{"What does Jim\u2019sfather do for a living?": [" But I see you was the right sort. I says to myself, you stand by Hawkins, John, and Hawkins'll stand by you. You're his last card, and by the living thunder, John, he's yours! Back to back, says I. You save your witness, and he'll save your neck!\u201d I began dimly to understand. \u201cYou mean all's lost?\u201d I asked. \u201cAye, by gum, I do!\u201d he answered. \u201cShip gone, neck gone--that's the size of it. Once I looked into that bay, Jim Hawkins, and seen no schooner--well, I'm tough, but I gave out. As for that lot and their council, mark me, they're outright fools and cowards. I'll save your life--if so be as I can--from them. But, see here, Jim--tit for tat--you save Long John from swinging.\u201d I was bewildered; it seemed a thing so hopeless he was asking--he, the old buccaneer, the ringleader throughout. \u201cWhat I can do, that I'll do,\u201d I said. \u201cIt's a bargain!\u201d cried Long John. \u201cYou speak up plucky, and by thunder, I've a chance!\u201d He hobbled to the torch, where it stood propped among the firewood, and took a fresh light to his pipe. \u201cUnderstand me, Jim,\u201d he said, returning. \u201cI've a head on my shoulders, I have. I'm on squire's side now. I know you've got that ship safe somewheres. How you done it, I don't know, but safe it is. I guess Hands and O'Brien turned soft. I never much believed in neither of THEM. Now you mark me. I ask no questions, nor I won't let others. I know when a game's up, I do; and I know a lad that's staunch.", " Wherever a man is, says I, a man can do for himself. But, mate, my heart is sore for Christian diet. You mightn't happen to have a piece of cheese about you, now? No? Well, many's the long night I've dreamed of cheese--toasted, mostly--and woke up again, and here I were.\u201d \u201cIf ever I can get aboard again,\u201d said I, \u201cyou shall have cheese by the stone.\u201d All this time he had been feeling the stuff of my jacket, smoothing my hands, looking at my boots, and generally, in the intervals of his speech, showing a childish pleasure in the presence of a fellow creature. But at my last words he perked up into a kind of startled slyness. \u201cIf ever you can get aboard again, says you?\u201d he repeated. \u201cWhy, now, who's to hinder you?\u201d \u201cNot you, I know,\u201d was my reply. \u201cAnd right you was,\u201d he cried. \u201cNow you--what do you call yourself, mate?\u201d \u201cJim,\u201d I told him. \u201cJim, Jim,\u201d says he, quite pleased apparently. \u201cWell, now, Jim, I've lived that rough as you'd be ashamed to hear of. Now, for instance, you wouldn't think I had had a pious mother--to look at me?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy, no, not in particular,\u201d I answered. \u201cAh, well,\u201d said he, \u201cbut I had--remarkable pious. And I was a civil, pious boy, and could rattle off my catechism that fast, as you couldn't tell one word from another. And here's what it come to, Jim, and it begun with chuck-farthen on the blessed grave-stones! That's what it begun with, but it went further'n that; and so my mother told me, and predicked the whole, she did, the pious woman!", " The body pointed straight in the direction of the island, and the compass read duly E.S.E. and by E. \u201cI thought so,\u201d cried the cook; \u201cthis here is a p'inter. Right up there is our line for the Pole Star and the jolly dollars. But, by thunder! If it don't make me cold inside to think of Flint. This is one of HIS jokes, and no mistake. Him and these six was alone here; he killed 'em, every man; and this one he hauled here and laid down by compass, shiver my timbers! They're long bones, and the hair's been yellow. Aye, that would be Allardyce. You mind Allardyce, Tom Morgan?\u201d \u201cAye, aye,\u201d returned Morgan; \u201cI mind him; he owed me money, he did, and took my knife ashore with him.\u201d \u201cSpeaking of knives,\u201d said another, \u201cwhy don't we find his'n lying round? Flint warn't the man to pick a seaman's pocket; and the birds, I guess, would leave it be.\u201d \u201cBy the powers, and that's true!\u201d cried Silver. \u201cThere ain't a thing left here,\u201d said Merry, still feeling round among the bones; \u201cnot a copper doit nor a baccy box. It don't look nat'ral to me.\u201d \u201cNo, by gum, it don't,\u201d agreed Silver; \u201cnot nat'ral, nor not nice, says you. Great guns! Messmates, but if Flint was living, this would be a hot spot for you and me. Six they were, and six are we; and bones is what they are now.\u201d \u201cI saw him dead with these here deadlights,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cBilly took me in. There he laid, with penny-pieces on his eyes.\u201d \u201cDead--aye, sure enough he's dead and gone below,\u201d said the fellow with the bandage; \u201cbut if ever sperrit walked, it would be Flint's.", " But I'll go as far with you as I dare go, and a step beyond, for I'll have my wig sorted by the captain or I'm mistaken! And first, I'll give you a bit of hope; Silver, if we both get alive out of this wolf-trap, I'll do my best to save you, short of perjury.\u201d Silver's face was radiant. \u201cYou couldn't say more, I'm sure, sir, not if you was my mother,\u201d he cried. \u201cWell, that's my first concession,\u201d added the doctor. \u201cMy second is a piece of advice: keep the boy close beside you, and when you need help, halloo. I'm off to seek it for you, and that itself will show you if I speak at random. Good-bye, Jim.\u201d And Dr. Livesey shook hands with me through the stockade, nodded to Silver, and set off at a brisk pace into the wood. 31 The Treasure-hunt--Flint's Pointer \u201cJIM,\u201d said Silver when we were alone, \u201cif I saved your life, you saved mine; and I'll not forget it. I seen the doctor waving you to run for it--with the tail of my eye, I did; and I seen you say no, as plain as hearing. Jim, that's one to you. This is the first glint of hope I had since the attack failed, and I owe it you. And now, Jim, we're to go in for this here treasure-hunting, with sealed orders too, and I don't like it; and you and me must stick close, back to back like, and we'll save our necks in spite o' fate and fortune.\u201d Just then a man hailed us from the fire that breakfast was ready, and we were soon seated here and there about the sand over biscuit and fried junk."], "Why does Billygive Jim money each month?": [" Blackbeard was a child to Flint. The Spaniards were so prodigiously afraid of him that, I tell you, sir, I was sometimes proud he was an Englishman. I've seen his top-sails with these eyes, off Trinidad, and the cowardly son of a rum-puncheon that I sailed with put back--put back, sir, into Port of Spain.\u201d \u201cWell, I've heard of him myself, in England,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cBut the point is, had he money?\u201d \u201cMoney!\u201d cried the squire. \u201cHave you heard the story? What were these villains after but money? What do they care for but money? For what would they risk their rascal carcasses but money?\u201d \u201cThat we shall soon know,\u201d replied the doctor. \u201cBut you are so confoundedly hot-headed and exclamatory that I cannot get a word in. What I want to know is this: Supposing that I have here in my pocket some clue to where Flint buried his treasure, will that treasure amount to much?\u201d \u201cAmount, sir!\u201d cried the squire. \u201cIt will amount to this: If we have the clue you talk about, I fit out a ship in Bristol dock, and take you and Hawkins here along, and I'll have that treasure if I search a year.\u201d \u201cVery well,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cNow, then, if Jim is agreeable, we'll open the packet\u201d; and he laid it before him on the table. The bundle was sewn together, and the doctor had to get out his instrument case and cut the stitches with his medical scissors. It contained two things--a book and a sealed paper. \u201cFirst of all we'll try the book,\u201d observed the doctor.", " Nor would he allow anyone to leave the inn till he had drunk himself sleepy and reeled off to bed. His stories were what frightened people worst of all. Dreadful stories they were--about hanging, and walking the plank, and storms at sea, and the Dry Tortugas, and wild deeds and places on the Spanish Main. By his own account he must have lived his life among some of the wickedest men that God ever allowed upon the sea, and the language in which he told these stories shocked our plain country people almost as much as the crimes that he described. My father was always saying the inn would be ruined, for people would soon cease coming there to be tyrannized over and put down, and sent shivering to their beds; but I really believe his presence did us good. People were frightened at the time, but on looking back they rather liked it; it was a fine excitement in a quiet country life, and there was even a party of the younger men who pretended to admire him, calling him a \u201ctrue sea-dog\u201d and a \u201creal old salt\u201d and such like names, and saying there was the sort of man that made England terrible at sea. In one way, indeed, he bade fair to ruin us, for he kept on staying week after week, and at last month after month, so that all the money had been long exhausted, and still my father never plucked up the heart to insist on having more. If ever he mentioned it, the captain blew through his nose so loudly that you might say he roared, and stared my poor father out of the room.", " He was a very silent man by custom. All day he hung round the cove or upon the cliffs with a brass telescope; all evening he sat in a corner of the parlour next the fire and drank rum and water very strong. Mostly he would not speak when spoken to, only look up sudden and fierce and blow through his nose like a fog-horn; and we and the people who came about our house soon learned to let him be. Every day when he came back from his stroll he would ask if any seafaring men had gone by along the road. At first we thought it was the want of company of his own kind that made him ask this question, but at last we began to see he was desirous to avoid them. When a seaman did put up at the Admiral Benbow (as now and then some did, making by the coast road for Bristol) he would look in at him through the curtained door before he entered the parlour; and he was always sure to be as silent as a mouse when any such was present. For me, at least, there was no secret about the matter, for I was, in a way, a sharer in his alarms. He had taken me aside one day and promised me a silver fourpenny on the first of every month if I would only keep my \u201cweather-eye open for a seafaring man with one leg\u201d and let him know the moment he appeared. Often enough when the first of the month came round and I applied to him for my wage, he would only blow through his nose at me and stare me down, but before the week was out he was sure to think better of it, bring me my four-penny piece, and repeat his orders to look out for \u201cthe seafaring man with one leg.\u201d How that personage haunted my dreams, I need scarcely tell you.", " He hailed her. A voice replied, telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get some lead in him, and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his arm. Soon after, the lugger doubled the point and disappeared. Mr. Dance stood there, as he said, \u201clike a fish out of water,\u201d and all he could do was to dispatch a man to B---- to warn the cutter. \u201cAnd that,\u201d said he, \u201cis just about as good as nothing. They've got off clean, and there's an end. Only,\u201d he added, \u201cI'm glad I trod on Master Pew's corns,\u201d for by this time he had heard my story. I went back with him to the Admiral Benbow, and you cannot imagine a house in such a state of smash; the very clock had been thrown down by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself; and though nothing had actually been taken away except the captain's money-bag and a little silver from the till, I could see at once that we were ruined. Mr. Dance could make nothing of the scene. \u201cThey got the money, you say? Well, then, Hawkins, what in fortune were they after? More money, I suppose?\u201d \u201cNo, sir; not money, I think,\u201d replied I. \u201cIn fact, sir, I believe I have the thing in my breast pocket; and to tell you the truth, I should like to get it put in safety.\u201d \u201cTo be sure, boy; quite right,\u201d said he. \u201cI'll take it, if you like.\u201d \u201cI thought perhaps Dr. Livesey--\u201d I began. \u201cPerfectly right,\u201d he interrupted very cheerily, \u201cperfectly right--a gentleman and a magistrate."], "Where is Billywhen he receives the black spot?": [" He gave it me at Savannah, when he lay a-dying, like as if I was to now, you see. But you won't peach unless they get the black spot on me, or unless you see that Black Dog again or a seafaring man with one leg, Jim--him above all.\u201d \u201cBut what is the black spot, captain?\u201d I asked. \u201cThat's a summons, mate. I'll tell you if they get that. But you keep your weather-eye open, Jim, and I'll share with you equals, upon my honour.\u201d He wandered a little longer, his voice growing weaker; but soon after I had given him his medicine, which he took like a child, with the remark, \u201cIf ever a seaman wanted drugs, it's me,\u201d he fell at last into a heavy, swoon-like sleep, in which I left him. What I should have done had all gone well I do not know. Probably I should have told the whole story to the doctor, for I was in mortal fear lest the captain should repent of his confessions and make an end of me. But as things fell out, my poor father died quite suddenly that evening, which put all other matters on one side. Our natural distress, the visits of the neighbours, the arranging of the funeral, and all the work of the inn to be carried on in the meanwhile kept me so busy that I had scarcely time to think of the captain, far less to be afraid of him. He got downstairs next morning, to be sure, and had his meals as usual, though he ate little and had more, I am afraid, than his usual supply of rum, for he helped himself out of the bar, scowling and blowing through his nose, and no one dared to cross him.", " \u201cThere! Wot did I say? No good'll come o' that, I said.\u201d \u201cWell, you've about fixed it now, among you,\u201d continued Silver. \u201cYou'll all swing now, I reckon. What soft-headed lubber had a Bible?\u201d \u201cIt was Dick,\u201d said one. \u201cDick, was it? Then Dick can get to prayers,\u201d said Silver. \u201cHe's seen his slice of luck, has Dick, and you may lay to that.\u201d But here the long man with the yellow eyes struck in. \u201cBelay that talk, John Silver,\u201d he said. \u201cThis crew has tipped you the black spot in full council, as in dooty bound; just you turn it over, as in dooty bound, and see what's wrote there. Then you can talk.\u201d \u201cThanky, George,\u201d replied the sea-cook. \u201cYou always was brisk for business, and has the rules by heart, George, as I'm pleased to see. Well, what is it, anyway? Ah! 'Deposed'--that's it, is it? Very pretty wrote, to be sure; like print, I swear. Your hand o' write, George? Why, you was gettin' quite a leadin' man in this here crew. You'll be cap'n next, I shouldn't wonder. Just oblige me with that torch again, will you? This pipe don't draw.\u201d \u201cCome, now,\u201d said George, \u201cyou don't fool this crew no more. You're a funny man, by your account; but you're over now, and you'll maybe step down off that barrel and help vote.\u201d \u201cI thought you said you knowed the rules,\u201d returned Silver contemptuously. \u201cLeastways, if you don't, I do; and I wait here--and I'm still your cap'n, mind--till you outs with your grievances and I reply; in the meantime, your black spot ain't worth a biscuit.", " Is that seamanly behaviour, now, I want to know? But I'm a saving soul. I never wasted good money of mine, nor lost it neither; and I'll trick 'em again. I'm not afraid on 'em. I'll shake out another reef, matey, and daddle 'em again.\u201d As he was thus speaking, he had risen from bed with great difficulty, holding to my shoulder with a grip that almost made me cry out, and moving his legs like so much dead weight. His words, spirited as they were in meaning, contrasted sadly with the weakness of the voice in which they were uttered. He paused when he had got into a sitting position on the edge. \u201cThat doctor's done me,\u201d he murmured. \u201cMy ears is singing. Lay me back.\u201d Before I could do much to help him he had fallen back again to his former place, where he lay for a while silent. \u201cJim,\u201d he said at length, \u201cyou saw that seafaring man today?\u201d \u201cBlack Dog?\u201d I asked. \u201cAh! Black Dog,\u201d says he. \u201cHE'S a bad un; but there's worse that put him on. Now, if I can't get away nohow, and they tip me the black spot, mind you, it's my old sea-chest they're after; you get on a horse--you can, can't you? Well, then, you get on a horse, and go to--well, yes, I will!--to that eternal doctor swab, and tell him to pipe all hands--magistrates and sich--and he'll lay 'em aboard at the Admiral Benbow--all old Flint's crew, man and boy, all on 'em that's left. I was first mate, I was, old Flint's first mate, and I'm the on'y one as knows the place.", " \u201cBill,\u201d said the stranger in a voice that I thought he had tried to make bold and big. The captain spun round on his heel and fronted us; all the brown had gone out of his face, and even his nose was blue; he had the look of a man who sees a ghost, or the evil one, or something worse, if anything can be; and upon my word, I felt sorry to see him all in a moment turn so old and sick. \u201cCome, Bill, you know me; you know an old shipmate, Bill, surely,\u201d said the stranger. The captain made a sort of gasp. \u201cBlack Dog!\u201d said he. \u201cAnd who else?\u201d returned the other, getting more at his ease. \u201cBlack Dog as ever was, come for to see his old shipmate Billy, at the Admiral Benbow inn. Ah, Bill, Bill, we have seen a sight of times, us two, since I lost them two talons,\u201d holding up his mutilated hand. \u201cNow, look here,\u201d said the captain; \u201cyou've run me down; here I am; well, then, speak up; what is it?\u201d \u201cThat's you, Bill,\u201d returned Black Dog, \u201cyou're in the right of it, Billy. I'll have a glass of rum from this dear child here, as I've took such a liking to; and we'll sit down, if you please, and talk square, like old shipmates.\u201d When I returned with the rum, they were already seated on either side of the captain's breakfast-table--Black Dog next to the door and sitting sideways so as to have one eye on his old shipmate and one, as I thought, on his retreat. He bade me go and leave the door wide open."], "In what centuryis Treasure Island set?": [" . . . . . . . . . . . . . 195 33. THE FALL OF A CHIEFTAIN . . . . . . . . 201 34.

I remember him as if it were yesterday, as he came plodding to the inn door, his sea-chest following behind him in a hand-barrow--a tall, strong, heavy, nut-brown man, his tarry pigtail falling over the shoulder of his soiled blue coat, his hands ragged and scarred, with black, broken nails, and the sabre cut across one cheek, a dirty, livid white. I remember him looking round the cover and whistling to himself as he did so, and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so often afterwards: \u201cFifteen men on the dead man's chest-- Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!\u201d in the high, old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and broken at the capstan bars.

Soon, however, he saw that our party had the start of him; and Ben Gunn, being fleet of foot, had been dispatched in front to do his best alone. Then it had occurred to him to work upon the superstitions of his former shipmates, and he was so far successful that Gray and the doctor had come up and were already ambushed before the arrival of the treasure-hunters. \u201cAh,\u201d said Silver, \u201cit were fortunate for me that I had Hawkins here. You would have let old John be cut to bits, and never given it a thought, doctor.\u201d \u201cNot a thought,\u201d replied Dr. Livesey cheerily. And by this time we had reached the gigs. The doctor, with the pick-axe, demolished one of them, and then we all got aboard the other and set out to go round by sea for North Inlet. This was a run of eight or nine miles. Silver, though he was almost killed already with fatigue, was set to an oar, like the rest of us, and we were soon skimming swiftly over a smooth sea.", " The HISPANIOLA was rolling scuppers under in the ocean swell. The booms were tearing at the blocks, the rudder was banging to and fro, and the whole ship creaking, groaning, and jumping like a manufactory. I had to cling tight to the backstay, and the world turned giddily before my eyes, for though I was a good enough sailor when there was way on, this standing still and being rolled about like a bottle was a thing I never learned to stand without a qualm or so, above all in the morning, on an empty stomach. Perhaps it was this--perhaps it was the look of the island, with its grey, melancholy woods, and wild stone spires, and the surf that we could both see and hear foaming and thundering on the steep beach--at least, although the sun shone bright and hot, and the shore birds were fishing and crying all around us, and you would have thought anyone would have been glad to get to land after being so long at sea, my heart sank, as the saying is, into my boots; and from the first look onward, I hated the very thought of Treasure Island. We had a dreary morning's work before us, for there was no sign of any wind, and the boats had to be got out and manned, and the ship warped three or four miles round the corner of the island and up the narrow passage to the haven behind Skeleton Island. I volunteered for one of the boats, where I had, of course, no business. The heat was sweltering, and the men grumbled fiercely over their work."], "What is Pew\u2019smost noticeable physical feature?": [" \u201cThey might have hid the blessed thing,\u201d said another. \u201cTake the Georges, Pew, and don't stand here squalling.\u201d Squalling was the word for it; Pew's anger rose so high at these objections till at last, his passion completely taking the upper hand, he struck at them right and left in his blindness and his stick sounded heavily on more than one. These, in their turn, cursed back at the blind miscreant, threatened him in horrid terms, and tried in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from his grasp. This quarrel was the saving of us, for while it was still raging, another sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the hamlet--the tramp of horses galloping. Almost at the same time a pistol-shot, flash and report, came from the hedge side. And that was plainly the last signal of danger, for the buccaneers turned at once and ran, separating in every direction, one seaward along the cove, one slant across the hill, and so on, so that in half a minute not a sign of them remained but Pew. Him they had deserted, whether in sheer panic or out of revenge for his ill words and blows I know not; but there he remained behind, tapping up and down the road in a frenzy, and groping and calling for his comrades. Finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few steps past me, towards the hamlet, crying, \u201cJohnny, Black Dog, Dirk,\u201d and other names, \u201cyou won't leave old Pew, mates--not old Pew!\u201d Just then the noise of horses topped the rise, and four or five riders came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope.", " \u201cSearch him, some of you shirking lubbers, and the rest of you aloft and get the chest,\u201d he cried. I could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs, so that the house must have shook with it. Promptly afterwards, fresh sounds of astonishment arose; the window of the captain's room was thrown open with a slam and a jingle of broken glass, and a man leaned out into the moonlight, head and shoulders, and addressed the blind beggar on the road below him. \u201cPew,\u201d he cried, \u201cthey've been before us. Someone's turned the chest out alow and aloft.\u201d \u201cIs it there?\u201d roared Pew. \u201cThe money's there.\u201d The blind man cursed the money. \u201cFlint's fist, I mean,\u201d he cried. \u201cWe don't see it here nohow,\u201d returned the man. \u201cHere, you below there, is it on Bill?\u201d cried the blind man again. At that another fellow, probably him who had remained below to search the captain's body, came to the door of the inn. \u201cBill's been overhauled a'ready,\u201d said he; \u201cnothin' left.\u201d \u201cIt's these people of the inn--it's that boy. I wish I had put his eyes out!\u201d cried the blind man, Pew. \u201cThere were no time ago--they had the door bolted when I tried it. Scatter, lads, and find 'em.\u201d \u201cSure enough, they left their glim here,\u201d said the fellow from the window. \u201cScatter and find 'em! Rout the house out!\u201d reiterated Pew, striking with his stick upon the road. Then there followed a great to-do through all our old inn, heavy feet pounding to and fro, furniture thrown over, doors kicked in, until the very rocks re-echoed and the men came out again, one after another, on the road and declared that we were nowhere to be found.", " At this Pew saw his error, turned with a scream, and ran straight for the ditch, into which he rolled. But he was on his feet again in a second and made another dash, now utterly bewildered, right under the nearest of the coming horses. The rider tried to save him, but in vain. Down went Pew with a cry that rang high into the night; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him and passed by. He fell on his side, then gently collapsed upon his face and moved no more. I leaped to my feet and hailed the riders. They were pulling up, at any rate, horrified at the accident; and I soon saw what they were. One, tailing out behind the rest, was a lad that had gone from the hamlet to Dr. Livesey's; the rest were revenue officers, whom he had met by the way, and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once. Some news of the lugger in Kitt's Hole had found its way to Supervisor Dance and set him forth that night in our direction, and to that circumstance my mother and I owed our preservation from death. Pew was dead, stone dead. As for my mother, when we had carried her up to the hamlet, a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her back again, and she was none the worse for her terror, though she still continued to deplore the balance of the money. In the meantime the supervisor rode on, as fast as he could, to Kitt's Hole; but his men had to dismount and grope down the dingle, leading, and sometimes supporting, their horses, and in continual fear of ambushes; so it was no great matter for surprise that when they got down to the Hole the lugger was already under way, though still close in.", " And just the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead captain's money was once more clearly audible through the night, but this time twice repeated. I had thought it to be the blind man's trumpet, so to speak, summoning his crew to the assault, but I now found that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet, and from its effect upon the buccaneers, a signal to warn them of approaching danger. \u201cThere's Dirk again,\u201d said one. \u201cTwice! We'll have to budge, mates.\u201d \u201cBudge, you skulk!\u201d cried Pew. \u201cDirk was a fool and a coward from the first--you wouldn't mind him. They must be close by; they can't be far; you have your hands on it. Scatter and look for them, dogs! Oh, shiver my soul,\u201d he cried, \u201cif I had eyes!\u201d This appeal seemed to produce some effect, for two of the fellows began to look here and there among the lumber, but half-heartedly, I thought, and with half an eye to their own danger all the time, while the rest stood irresolute on the road. \u201cYou have your hands on thousands, you fools, and you hang a leg! You'd be as rich as kings if you could find it, and you know it's here, and you stand there skulking. There wasn't one of you dared face Bill, and I did it--a blind man! And I'm to lose my chance for you! I'm to be a poor, crawling beggar, sponging for rum, when I might be rolling in a coach! If you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch them still.\u201d \u201cHang it, Pew, we've got the doubloons!\u201d grumbled one."], "To whom does Jimfirst show the map?": [" \u201cOne more,\u201d said the captain. \u201cThere's been too much blabbing already.\u201d \u201cFar too much,\u201d agreed the doctor. \u201cI'll tell you what I've heard myself,\u201d continued Captain Smollett: \u201cthat you have a map of an island, that there's crosses on the map to show where treasure is, and that the island lies--\u201d And then he named the latitude and longitude exactly. \u201cI never told that,\u201d cried the squire, \u201cto a soul!\u201d \u201cThe hands know it, sir,\u201d returned the captain. \u201cLivesey, that must have been you or Hawkins,\u201d cried the squire. \u201cIt doesn't much matter who it was,\u201d replied the doctor. And I could see that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to Mr. Trelawney's protestations. Neither did I, to be sure, he was so loose a talker; yet in this case I believe he was really right and that nobody had told the situation of the island. \u201cWell, gentlemen,\u201d continued the captain, \u201cI don't know who has this map; but I make it a point, it shall be kept secret even from me and Mr. Arrow. Otherwise I would ask you to let me resign.\u201d \u201cI see,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cYou wish us to keep this matter dark and to make a garrison of the stern part of the ship, manned with my friend's own people, and provided with all the arms and powder on board. In other words, you fear a mutiny.\u201d \u201cSir,\u201d said Captain Smollett, \u201cwith no intention to take offence, I deny your right to put words into my mouth. No captain, sir, would be justified in going to sea at all if he had ground enough to say that.", " \u201cSee if that's the place.\u201d Long John's eyes burned in his head as he took the chart, but by the fresh look of the paper I knew he was doomed to disappointment. This was not the map we found in Billy Bones's chest, but an accurate copy, complete in all things--names and heights and soundings--with the single exception of the red crosses and the written notes. Sharp as must have been his annoyance, Silver had the strength of mind to hide it. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d said he, \u201cthis is the spot, to be sure, and very prettily drawed out. Who might have done that, I wonder? The pirates were too ignorant, I reckon. Aye, here it is: 'Capt. Kidd's Anchorage'--just the name my shipmate called it. There's a strong current runs along the south, and then away nor'ard up the west coast. Right you was, sir,\u201d says he, \u201cto haul your wind and keep the weather of the island. Leastways, if such was your intention as to enter and careen, and there ain't no better place for that in these waters.\u201d \u201cThank you, my man,\u201d says Captain Smollett. \u201cI'll ask you later on to give us a help. You may go.\u201d I was surprised at the coolness with which John avowed his knowledge of the island, and I own I was half-frightened when I saw him drawing nearer to myself. He did not know, to be sure, that I had overheard his council from the apple barrel, and yet I had by this time taken such a horror of his cruelty, duplicity, and power that I could scarce conceal a shudder when he laid his hand upon my arm.", " I've had a'most enough o' Cap'n Smollett; he's hazed me long enough, by thunder! I want to go into that cabin, I do. I want their pickles and wines, and that.\u201d \u201cIsrael,\u201d said Silver, \u201cyour head ain't much account, nor ever was. But you're able to hear, I reckon; leastways, your ears is big enough. Now, here's what I say: you'll berth forward, and you'll live hard, and you'll speak soft, and you'll keep sober till I give the word; and you may lay to that, my son.\u201d \u201cWell, I don't say no, do I?\u201d growled the coxswain. \u201cWhat I say is, when? That's what I say.\u201d \u201cWhen! By the powers!\u201d cried Silver. \u201cWell now, if you want to know, I'll tell you when. The last moment I can manage, and that's when. Here's a first-rate seaman, Cap'n Smollett, sails the blessed ship for us. Here's this squire and doctor with a map and such--I don't know where it is, do I? No more do you, says you. Well then, I mean this squire and doctor shall find the stuff, and help us to get it aboard, by the powers. Then we'll see. If I was sure of you all, sons of double Dutchmen, I'd have Cap'n Smollett navigate us half-way back again before I struck.\u201d \u201cWhy, we're all seamen aboard here, I should think,\u201d said the lad Dick. \u201cWe're all forecastle hands, you mean,\u201d snapped Silver. \u201cWe can steer a course, but who's to set one? That's what all you gentlemen split on, first and last. If I had my way, I'd have Cap'n Smollett work us back into the trades at least; then we'd have no blessed miscalculations and a spoonful of water a day.", " We must none of us go alone till we get to sea. Jim and I shall stick together in the meanwhile; you'll take Joyce and Hunter when you ride to Bristol, and from first to last, not one of us must breathe a word of what we've found.\u201d \u201cLivesey,\u201d returned the squire, \u201cyou are always in the right of it. I'll be as silent as the grave.\u201d PART TWO--The Sea-cook 7 I Go to Bristol IT was longer than the squire imagined ere we were ready for the sea, and none of our first plans--not even Dr. Livesey's, of keeping me beside him--could be carried out as we intended. The doctor had to go to London for a physician to take charge of his practice; the squire was hard at work at Bristol; and I lived on at the hall under the charge of old Redruth, the gamekeeper, almost a prisoner, but full of sea-dreams and the most charming anticipations of strange islands and adventures. I brooded by the hour together over the map, all the details of which I well remembered. Sitting by the fire in the housekeeper's room, I approached that island in my fancy from every possible direction; I explored every acre of its surface; I climbed a thousand times to that tall hill they call the Spy-glass, and from the top enjoyed the most wonderful and changing prospects. Sometimes the isle was thick with savages, with whom we fought, sometimes full of dangerous animals that hunted us, but in all my fancies nothing occurred to me so strange and tragic as our actual adventures."], "What is Long JohnSilver\u2019s original job on the ship?": [" Watch him as we pleased, we could do nothing to solve it; and when we asked him to his face, he would only laugh if he were drunk, and if he were sober deny solemnly that he ever tasted anything but water. He was not only useless as an officer and a bad influence amongst the men, but it was plain that at this rate he must soon kill himself outright, so nobody was much surprised, nor very sorry, when one dark night, with a head sea, he disappeared entirely and was seen no more. \u201cOverboard!\u201d said the captain. \u201cWell, gentlemen, that saves the trouble of putting him in irons.\u201d But there we were, without a mate; and it was necessary, of course, to advance one of the men. The boatswain, Job Anderson, was the likeliest man aboard, and though he kept his old title, he served in a way as mate. Mr. Trelawney had followed the sea, and his knowledge made him very useful, for he often took a watch himself in easy weather. And the coxswain, Israel Hands, was a careful, wily, old, experienced seaman who could be trusted at a pinch with almost anything. He was a great confidant of Long John Silver, and so the mention of his name leads me on to speak of our ship's cook, Barbecue, as the men called him. Aboard ship he carried his crutch by a lanyard round his neck, to have both hands as free as possible. It was something to see him wedge the foot of the crutch against a bulkhead, and propped against it, yielding to every movement of the ship, get on with his cooking like someone safe ashore.", " It was a smile that had in it something both of pain and weakness--a haggard old man's smile; but there was, besides that, a grain of derision, a shadow of treachery, in his expression as he craftily watched, and watched, and watched me at my work. 26 Israel Hands THE wind, serving us to a desire, now hauled into the west. We could run so much the easier from the north-east corner of the island to the mouth of the North Inlet. Only, as we had no power to anchor and dared not beach her till the tide had flowed a good deal farther, time hung on our hands. The coxswain told me how to lay the ship to; after a good many trials I succeeded, and we both sat in silence over another meal. \u201cCap'n,\u201d said he at length with that same uncomfortable smile, \u201chere's my old shipmate, O'Brien; s'pose you was to heave him overboard. I ain't partic'lar as a rule, and I don't take no blame for settling his hash, but I don't reckon him ornamental now, do you?\u201d \u201cI'm not strong enough, and I don't like the job; and there he lies, for me,\u201d said I. \u201cThis here's an unlucky ship, this HISPANIOLA, Jim,\u201d he went on, blinking. \u201cThere's a power of men been killed in this HISPANIOLA--a sight o' poor seamen dead and gone since you and me took ship to Bristol. I never seen sich dirty luck, not I. There was this here O'Brien now--he's dead, ain't he? Well now, I'm no scholar, and you're a lad as can read and figure, and to put it straight, do you take it as a dead man is dead for good, or do he come alive again?\u201d \u201cYou can kill the body, Mr.", " Feared he was, and proud. They was the roughest crew afloat, was Flint's; the devil himself would have been feared to go to sea with them. Well now, I tell you, I'm not a boasting man, and you seen yourself how easy I keep company, but when I was quartermaster, LAMBS wasn't the word for Flint's old buccaneers. Ah, you may be sure of yourself in old John's ship.\u201d \u201cWell, I tell you now,\u201d replied the lad, \u201cI didn't half a quarter like the job till I had this talk with you, John; but there's my hand on it now.\u201d \u201cAnd a brave lad you were, and smart too,\u201d answered Silver, shaking hands so heartily that all the barrel shook, \u201cand a finer figurehead for a gentleman of fortune I never clapped my eyes on.\u201d By this time I had begun to understand the meaning of their terms. By a \u201cgentleman of fortune\u201d they plainly meant neither more nor less than a common pirate, and the little scene that I had overheard was the last act in the corruption of one of the honest hands--perhaps of the last one left aboard. But on this point I was soon to be relieved, for Silver giving a little whistle, a third man strolled up and sat down by the party. \u201cDick's square,\u201d said Silver. \u201cOh, I know'd Dick was square,\u201d returned the voice of the coxswain, Israel Hands. \u201cHe's no fool, is Dick.\u201d And he turned his quid and spat. \u201cBut look here,\u201d he went on, \u201chere's what I want to know, Barbecue: how long are we a-going to stand off and on like a blessed bumboat?", " They spoke together for a little, and though none of them started, or raised his voice, or so much as whistled, it was plain enough that Dr. Livesey had communicated my request, for the next thing that I heard was the captain giving an order to Job Anderson, and all hands were piped on deck. \u201cMy lads,\u201d said Captain Smollett, \u201cI've a word to say to you. This land that we have sighted is the place we have been sailing for. Mr. Trelawney, being a very open-handed gentleman, as we all know, has just asked me a word or two, and as I was able to tell him that every man on board had done his duty, alow and aloft, as I never ask to see it done better, why, he and I and the doctor are going below to the cabin to drink YOUR health and luck, and you'll have grog served out for you to drink OUR health and luck. I'll tell you what I think of this: I think it handsome. And if you think as I do, you'll give a good sea-cheer for the gentleman that does it.\u201d The cheer followed--that was a matter of course; but it rang out so full and hearty that I confess I could hardly believe these same men were plotting for our blood. \u201cOne more cheer for Cap'n Smollett,\u201d cried Long John when the first had subsided. And this also was given with a will. On the top of that the three gentlemen went below, and not long after, word was sent forward that Jim Hawkins was wanted in the cabin. I found them all three seated round the table, a bottle of Spanish wine and some raisins before them, and the doctor smoking away, with his wig on his lap, and that, I knew, was a sign that he was agitated."], "Where is Jim whenhe overhears Silver\u2019s plans for mutiny?": [" But I'll go as far with you as I dare go, and a step beyond, for I'll have my wig sorted by the captain or I'm mistaken! And first, I'll give you a bit of hope; Silver, if we both get alive out of this wolf-trap, I'll do my best to save you, short of perjury.\u201d Silver's face was radiant. \u201cYou couldn't say more, I'm sure, sir, not if you was my mother,\u201d he cried. \u201cWell, that's my first concession,\u201d added the doctor. \u201cMy second is a piece of advice: keep the boy close beside you, and when you need help, halloo. I'm off to seek it for you, and that itself will show you if I speak at random. Good-bye, Jim.\u201d And Dr. Livesey shook hands with me through the stockade, nodded to Silver, and set off at a brisk pace into the wood. 31 The Treasure-hunt--Flint's Pointer \u201cJIM,\u201d said Silver when we were alone, \u201cif I saved your life, you saved mine; and I'll not forget it. I seen the doctor waving you to run for it--with the tail of my eye, I did; and I seen you say no, as plain as hearing. Jim, that's one to you. This is the first glint of hope I had since the attack failed, and I owe it you. And now, Jim, we're to go in for this here treasure-hunting, with sealed orders too, and I don't like it; and you and me must stick close, back to back like, and we'll save our necks in spite o' fate and fortune.\u201d Just then a man hailed us from the fire that breakfast was ready, and we were soon seated here and there about the sand over biscuit and fried junk.", " We must none of us go alone till we get to sea. Jim and I shall stick together in the meanwhile; you'll take Joyce and Hunter when you ride to Bristol, and from first to last, not one of us must breathe a word of what we've found.\u201d \u201cLivesey,\u201d returned the squire, \u201cyou are always in the right of it. I'll be as silent as the grave.\u201d PART TWO--The Sea-cook 7 I Go to Bristol IT was longer than the squire imagined ere we were ready for the sea, and none of our first plans--not even Dr. Livesey's, of keeping me beside him--could be carried out as we intended.

Speak up.\u201d I did as I was bid, and as short as I could make it, told the whole details of Silver's conversation. Nobody interrupted me till I was done, nor did any one of the three of them make so much as a movement, but they kept their eyes upon my face from first to last. \u201cJim,\u201d said Dr. Livesey, \u201ctake a seat.\u201d And they made me sit down at table beside them, poured me out a glass of wine, filled my hands with raisins, and all three, one after the other, and each with a bow, drank my good health, and their service to me, for my luck and courage. \u201cNow, captain,\u201d said the squire, \u201cyou were right, and I was wrong. I own myself an ass, and I await your orders.\u201d \u201cNo more an ass than I, sir,\u201d returned the captain. \u201cI never heard of a crew that meant to mutiny but what showed signs before, for any man that had an eye in his head to see the mischief and take steps according. But this crew,\u201d he added, \u201cbeats me.\u201d \u201cCaptain,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cwith your permission, that's Silver. A very remarkable man.\u201d \u201cHe'd look remarkably well from a yard-arm, sir,\u201d returned the captain. \u201cBut this is talk; this don't lead to anything. I see three or four points, and with Mr. Trelawney's permission, I'll name them.\u201d \u201cYou, sir, are the captain.", " But it were Providence that put me here. I've thought it all out in this here lonely island, and I'm back on piety. You don't catch me tasting rum so much, but just a thimbleful for luck, of course, the first chance I have. I'm bound I'll be good, and I see the way to. And, Jim\u201d--looking all round him and lowering his voice to a whisper--\u201cI'm rich.\u201d I now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude, and I suppose I must have shown the feeling in my face, for he repeated the statement hotly: \u201cRich! Rich! I says. And I'll tell you what: I'll make a man of you, Jim. Ah, Jim, you'll bless your stars, you will, you was the first that found me!\u201d And at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face, and he tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly before my eyes. \u201cNow, Jim, you tell me true: that ain't Flint's ship?\u201d he asked. At this I had a happy inspiration. I began to believe that I had found an ally, and I answered him at once. \u201cIt's not Flint's ship, and Flint is dead; but I'll tell you true, as you ask me--there are some of Flint's hands aboard; worse luck for the rest of us.\u201d \u201cNot a man--with one--leg?\u201d he gasped. \u201cSilver?\u201d I asked. \u201cAh, Silver!\u201d says he. \u201cThat were his name.\u201d \u201cHe's the cook, and the ringleader too.\u201d He was still holding me by the wrist, and at that he give it quite a wring. \u201cIf you was sent by Long John,\u201d he said, \u201cI'm as good as pork, and I know it."], "Where does Jimencounter Ben Gunn?": [" \u201cBut there's one thing not clear to me. There was an echo. Now, no man ever seen a sperrit with a shadow; well then, what's he doing with an echo to him, I should like to know? That ain't in natur', surely?\u201d This argument seemed weak enough to me. But you can never tell what will affect the superstitious, and to my wonder, George Merry was greatly relieved. \u201cWell, that's so,\u201d he said. \u201cYou've a head upon your shoulders, John, and no mistake. 'Bout ship, mates! This here crew is on a wrong tack, I do believe. And come to think on it, it was like Flint's voice, I grant you, but not just so clear-away like it, after all. It was liker somebody else's voice now--it was liker--\u201d \u201cBy the powers, Ben Gunn!\u201d roared Silver. \u201cAye, and so it were,\u201d cried Morgan, springing on his knees. \u201cBen Gunn it were!\u201d \u201cIt don't make much odds, do it, now?\u201d asked Dick. \u201cBen Gunn's not here in the body any more'n Flint.\u201d But the older hands greeted this remark with scorn. \u201cWhy, nobody minds Ben Gunn,\u201d cried Merry; \u201cdead or alive, nobody minds him.\u201d It was extraordinary how their spirits had returned and how the natural colour had revived in their faces. Soon they were chatting together, with intervals of listening; and not long after, hearing no further sound, they shouldered the tools and set forth again, Merry walking first with Silver's compass to keep them on the right line with Skeleton Island. He had said the truth: dead or alive, nobody minded Ben Gunn.", " \u201cThank ye kindly, doctor,\u201d says he. \u201cYou came in in about the nick, I guess, for me and Hawkins. And so it's you, Ben Gunn!\u201d he added. \u201cWell, you're a nice one, to be sure.\u201d \u201cI'm Ben Gunn, I am,\u201d replied the maroon, wriggling like an eel in his embarrassment. \u201cAnd,\u201d he added, after a long pause, \u201chow do, Mr. Silver? Pretty well, I thank ye, says you.\u201d \u201cBen, Ben,\u201d murmured Silver, \u201cto think as you've done me!\u201d The doctor sent back Gray for one of the pick-axes deserted, in their flight, by the mutineers, and then as we proceeded leisurely downhill to where the boats were lying, related in a few words what had taken place. It was a story that profoundly interested Silver; and Ben Gunn, the half-idiot maroon, was the hero from beginning to end. Ben, in his long, lonely wanderings about the island, had found the skeleton--it was he that had rifled it; he had found the treasure; he had dug it up (it was the haft of his pick-axe that lay broken in the excavation); he had carried it on his back, in many weary journeys, from the foot of the tall pine to a cave he had on the two-pointed hill at the north-east angle of the island, and there it had lain stored in safety since two months before the arrival of the HISPANIOLA. When the doctor had wormed this secret from him on the afternoon of the attack, and when next morning he saw the anchorage deserted, he had gone to Silver, given him the chart, which was now useless--given him the stores, for Ben Gunn's cave was well supplied with goats' meat salted by himself--given anything and everything to get a chance of moving in safety from the stockade to the two-pointed hill, there to be clear of malaria and keep a guard upon the money.", " But where was you, do you suppose?\u201d I had made my mind up in a moment, and by way of answer told him the whole story of our voyage and the predicament in which we found ourselves. He heard me with the keenest interest, and when I had done he patted me on the head. \u201cYou're a good lad, Jim,\u201d he said; \u201cand you're all in a clove hitch, ain't you? Well, you just put your trust in Ben Gunn--Ben Gunn's the man to do it. Would you think it likely, now, that your squire would prove a liberal-minded one in case of help--him being in a clove hitch, as you remark?\u201d I told him the squire was the most liberal of men. \u201cAye, but you see,\u201d returned Ben Gunn, \u201cI didn't mean giving me a gate to keep, and a suit of livery clothes, and such; that's not my mark, Jim. What I mean is, would he be likely to come down to the toon of, say one thousand pounds out of money that's as good as a man's own already?\u201d \u201cI am sure he would,\u201d said I. \u201cAs it was, all hands were to share.\u201d \u201cAND a passage home?\u201d he added with a look of great shrewdness. \u201cWhy,\u201d I cried, \u201cthe squire's a gentleman. And besides, if we got rid of the others, we should want you to help work the vessel home.\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d said he, \u201cso you would.\u201d And he seemed very much relieved. \u201cNow, I'll tell you what,\u201d he went on. \u201cSo much I'll tell you, and no more. I were in Flint's ship when he buried the treasure; he and six along--six strong seamen. They was ashore nigh on a week, and us standing off and on in the old WALRUS.", " \u201cAnd when Ben Gunn is wanted, you know where to find him, Jim. Just wheer you found him today. And him that comes is to have a white thing in his hand, and he's to come alone. Oh! And you'll say this: 'Ben Gunn,' says you, 'has reasons of his own. '\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said I, \u201cI believe I understand. You have something to propose, and you wish to see the squire or the doctor, and you're to be found where I found you. Is that all?\u201d \u201cAnd when? says you,\u201d he added. \u201cWhy, from about noon observation to about six bells.\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d said I, \u201cand now may I go?\u201d \u201cYou won't forget?\u201d he inquired anxiously. \u201cPrecious sight, and reasons of his own, says you. Reasons of his own; that's the mainstay; as between man and man. Well, then\u201d--still holding me--\u201cI reckon you can go, Jim. And, Jim, if you was to see Silver, you wouldn't go for to sell Ben Gunn? Wild horses wouldn't draw it from you? No, says you. And if them pirates camp ashore, Jim, what would you say but there'd be widders in the morning?\u201d Here he was interrupted by a loud report, and a cannonball came tearing through the trees and pitched in the sand not a hundred yards from where we two were talking. The next moment each of us had taken to his heels in a different direction. For a good hour to come frequent reports shook the island, and balls kept crashing through the woods. I moved from hiding-place to hiding-place, always pursued, or so it seemed to me, by these terrifying missiles."], "What does Jimhunt for after leaving Captain Smollett in the stockade?": [" \u201cAnd what do you want with your flag of truce?\u201d he cried. This time it was the other man who replied. \u201cCap'n Silver, sir, to come on board and make terms,\u201d he shouted. \u201cCap'n Silver! Don't know him. Who's he?\u201d cried the captain. And we could hear him adding to himself, \u201cCap'n, is it? My heart, and here's promotion!\u201d Long John answered for himself. \u201cMe, sir. These poor lads have chosen me cap'n, after your desertion, sir\u201d--laying a particular emphasis upon the word \u201cdesertion.\u201d \u201cWe're willing to submit, if we can come to terms, and no bones about it. All I ask is your word, Cap'n Smollett, to let me safe and sound out of this here stockade, and one minute to get out o' shot before a gun is fired.\u201d \u201cMy man,\u201d said Captain Smollett, \u201cI have not the slightest desire to talk to you. If you wish to talk to me, you can come, that's all. If there's any treachery, it'll be on your side, and the Lord help you.\u201d \u201cThat's enough, cap'n,\u201d shouted Long John cheerily. \u201cA word from you's enough. I know a gentleman, and you may lay to that.\u201d We could see the man who carried the flag of truce attempting to hold Silver back. Nor was that wonderful, seeing how cavalier had been the captain's answer. But Silver laughed at him aloud and slapped him on the back as if the idea of alarm had been absurd. Then he advanced to the stockade, threw over his crutch, got a leg up, and with great vigour and skill succeeded in surmounting the fence and dropping safely to the other side.", " They had the advantage of numbers, of course, but we had the advantage of arms. Not one of the men ashore had a musket, and before they could get within range for pistol shooting, we flattered ourselves we should be able to give a good account of a half-dozen at least. The squire was waiting for me at the stern window, all his faintness gone from him. He caught the painter and made it fast, and we fell to loading the boat for our very lives. Pork, powder, and biscuit was the cargo, with only a musket and a cutlass apiece for the squire and me and Redruth and the captain. The rest of the arms and powder we dropped overboard in two fathoms and a half of water, so that we could see the bright steel shining far below us in the sun, on the clean, sandy bottom. By this time the tide was beginning to ebb, and the ship was swinging round to her anchor. Voices were heard faintly halloaing in the direction of the two gigs; and though this reassured us for Joyce and Hunter, who were well to the eastward, it warned our party to be off. Redruth retreated from his place in the gallery and dropped into the boat, which we then brought round to the ship's counter, to be handier for Captain Smollett. \u201cNow, men,\u201d said he, \u201cdo you hear me?\u201d There was no answer from the forecastle. \u201cIt's to you, Abraham Gray--it's to you I am speaking.\u201d Still no reply. \u201cGray,\u201d resumed Mr. Smollett, a little louder, \u201cI am leaving this ship, and I order you to follow your captain.", " \u201cOne more,\u201d said the captain. \u201cThere's been too much blabbing already.\u201d \u201cFar too much,\u201d agreed the doctor. \u201cI'll tell you what I've heard myself,\u201d continued Captain Smollett: \u201cthat you have a map of an island, that there's crosses on the map to show where treasure is, and that the island lies--\u201d And then he named the latitude and longitude exactly. \u201cI never told that,\u201d cried the squire, \u201cto a soul!\u201d \u201cThe hands know it, sir,\u201d returned the captain. \u201cLivesey, that must have been you or Hawkins,\u201d cried the squire. \u201cIt doesn't much matter who it was,\u201d replied the doctor. And I could see that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to Mr. Trelawney's protestations. Neither did I, to be sure, he was so loose a talker; yet in this case I believe he was really right and that nobody had told the situation of the island. \u201cWell, gentlemen,\u201d continued the captain, \u201cI don't know who has this map; but I make it a point, it shall be kept secret even from me and Mr. Arrow. Otherwise I would ask you to let me resign.\u201d \u201cI see,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cYou wish us to keep this matter dark and to make a garrison of the stern part of the ship, manned with my friend's own people, and provided with all the arms and powder on board. In other words, you fear a mutiny.\u201d \u201cSir,\u201d said Captain Smollett, \u201cwith no intention to take offence, I deny your right to put words into my mouth. No captain, sir, would be justified in going to sea at all if he had ground enough to say that.", " \u201cWell, squire,\u201d said Dr. Livesey, \u201cI don't put much faith in your discoveries, as a general thing; but I will say this, John Silver suits me.\u201d \u201cThe man's a perfect trump,\u201d declared the squire. \u201cAnd now,\u201d added the doctor, \u201cJim may come on board with us, may he not?\u201d \u201cTo be sure he may,\u201d says squire. \u201cTake your hat, Hawkins, and we'll see the ship.\u201d 9 Powder and Arms THE HISPANIOLA lay some way out, and we went under the figureheads and round the sterns of many other ships, and their cables sometimes grated underneath our keel, and sometimes swung above us. At last, however, we got alongside, and were met and saluted as we stepped aboard by the mate, Mr. Arrow, a brown old sailor with earrings in his ears and a squint. He and the squire were very thick and friendly, but I soon observed that things were not the same between Mr. Trelawney and the captain. This last was a sharp-looking man who seemed angry with everything on board and was soon to tell us why, for we had hardly got down into the cabin when a sailor followed us. \u201cCaptain Smollett, sir, axing to speak with you,\u201d said he. \u201cI am always at the captain's orders. Show him in,\u201d said the squire. The captain, who was close behind his messenger, entered at once and shut the door behind him. \u201cWell, Captain Smollett, what have you to say? All well, I hope; all shipshape and seaworthy?\u201d \u201cWell, sir,\u201d said the captain, \u201cbetter speak plain, I believe, even at the risk of offence."], "How does Jimmove the ship away from the pirate camp?": [" I will confess that I was far too much taken up with what was going on to be of the slightest use as sentry; indeed, I had already deserted my eastern loophole and crept up behind the captain, who had now seated himself on the threshold, with his elbows on his knees, his head in his hands, and his eyes fixed on the water as it bubbled out of the old iron kettle in the sand. He was whistling \u201cCome, Lasses and Lads.\u201d Silver had terrible hard work getting up the knoll. What with the steepness of the incline, the thick tree stumps, and the soft sand, he and his crutch were as helpless as a ship in stays. But he stuck to it like a man in silence, and at last arrived before the captain, whom he saluted in the handsomest style. He was tricked out in his best; an immense blue coat, thick with brass buttons, hung as low as to his knees, and a fine laced hat was set on the back of his head. \u201cHere you are, my man,\u201d said the captain, raising his head. \u201cYou had better sit down.\u201d \u201cYou ain't a-going to let me inside, cap'n?\u201d complained Long John. \u201cIt's a main cold morning, to be sure, sir, to sit outside upon the sand.\u201d \u201cWhy, Silver,\u201d said the captain, \u201cif you had pleased to be an honest man, you might have been sitting in your galley. It's your own doing. You're either my ship's cook--and then you were treated handsome--or Cap'n Silver, a common mutineer and pirate, and then you can go hang!\u201d \u201cWell, well, cap'n,\u201d returned the sea-cook, sitting down as he was bidden on the sand, \u201cyou'll have to give me a hand up again, that's all.", " Feared he was, and proud. They was the roughest crew afloat, was Flint's; the devil himself would have been feared to go to sea with them. Well now, I tell you, I'm not a boasting man, and you seen yourself how easy I keep company, but when I was quartermaster, LAMBS wasn't the word for Flint's old buccaneers. Ah, you may be sure of yourself in old John's ship.\u201d \u201cWell, I tell you now,\u201d replied the lad, \u201cI didn't half a quarter like the job till I had this talk with you, John; but there's my hand on it now.\u201d \u201cAnd a brave lad you were, and smart too,\u201d answered Silver, shaking hands so heartily that all the barrel shook, \u201cand a finer figurehead for a gentleman of fortune I never clapped my eyes on.\u201d By this time I had begun to understand the meaning of their terms. By a \u201cgentleman of fortune\u201d they plainly meant neither more nor less than a common pirate, and the little scene that I had overheard was the last act in the corruption of one of the honest hands--perhaps of the last one left aboard. But on this point I was soon to be relieved, for Silver giving a little whistle, a third man strolled up and sat down by the party. \u201cDick's square,\u201d said Silver. \u201cOh, I know'd Dick was square,\u201d returned the voice of the coxswain, Israel Hands. \u201cHe's no fool, is Dick.\u201d And he turned his quid and spat. \u201cBut look here,\u201d he went on, \u201chere's what I want to know, Barbecue: how long are we a-going to stand off and on like a blessed bumboat?", " It appears they were at their wits' end what to do, the stores being so low that we must have been starved into surrender long before help came. But our best hope, it was decided, was to kill off the buccaneers until they either hauled down their flag or ran away with the HISPANIOLA. From nineteen they were already reduced to fifteen, two others were wounded, and one at least--the man shot beside the gun--severely wounded, if he were not dead. Every time we had a crack at them, we were to take it, saving our own lives, with the extremest care. And besides that, we had two able allies--rum and the climate. As for the first, though we were about half a mile away, we could hear them roaring and singing late into the night; and as for the second, the doctor staked his wig that, camped where they were in the marsh and unprovided with remedies, the half of them would be on their backs before a week. \u201cSo,\u201d he added, \u201cif we are not all shot down first they'll be glad to be packing in the schooner. It's always a ship, and they can get to buccaneering again, I suppose.\u201d \u201cFirst ship that ever I lost,\u201d said Captain Smollett. I was dead tired, as you may fancy; and when I got to sleep, which was not till after a great deal of tossing, I slept like a log of wood. The rest had long been up and had already breakfasted and increased the pile of firewood by about half as much again when I was wakened by a bustle and the sound of voices.", " But when I remembered the talk I had overheard from the apple barrel, all pity left me. I walked aft until I reached the main-mast. \u201cCome aboard, Mr. Hands,\u201d I said ironically. He rolled his eyes round heavily, but he was too far gone to express surprise. All he could do was to utter one word, \u201cBrandy.\u201d It occurred to me there was no time to lose, and dodging the boom as it once more lurched across the deck, I slipped aft and down the companion stairs into the cabin. It was such a scene of confusion as you can hardly fancy. All the lockfast places had been broken open in quest of the chart. The floor was thick with mud where ruffians had sat down to drink or consult after wading in the marshes round their camp. The bulkheads, all painted in clear white and beaded round with gilt, bore a pattern of dirty hands. Dozens of empty bottles clinked together in corners to the rolling of the ship. One of the doctor's medical books lay open on the table, half of the leaves gutted out, I suppose, for pipelights. In the midst of all this the lamp still cast a smoky glow, obscure and brown as umber. I went into the cellar; all the barrels were gone, and of the bottles a most surprising number had been drunk out and thrown away. Certainly, since the mutiny began, not a man of them could ever have been sober. Foraging about, I found a bottle with some brandy left, for Hands; and for myself I routed out some biscuit, some pickled fruits, a great bunch of raisins, and a piece of cheese."], "What is the nameof Long John Silver\u2019s parrot?": [" Still more strange was it to see him in the heaviest of weather cross the deck. He had a line or two rigged up to help him across the widest spaces--Long John's earrings, they were called; and he would hand himself from one place to another, now using the crutch, now trailing it alongside by the lanyard, as quickly as another man could walk. Yet some of the men who had sailed with him before expressed their pity to see him so reduced. \u201cHe's no common man, Barbecue,\u201d said the coxswain to me. \u201cHe had good schooling in his young days and can speak like a book when so minded; and brave--a lion's nothing alongside of Long John! I seen him grapple four and knock their heads together--him unarmed.\u201d All the crew respected and even obeyed him. He had a way of talking to each and doing everybody some particular service. To me he was unweariedly kind, and always glad to see me in the galley, which he kept as clean as a new pin, the dishes hanging up burnished and his parrot in a cage in one corner. \u201cCome away, Hawkins,\u201d he would say; \u201ccome and have a yarn with John. Nobody more welcome than yourself, my son. Sit you down and hear the news. Here's Cap'n Flint--I calls my parrot Cap'n Flint, after the famous buccaneer--here's Cap'n Flint predicting success to our v'yage. Wasn't you, cap'n?\u201d And the parrot would say, with great rapidity, \u201cPieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!\u201d till you wondered that it was not out of breath, or till John threw his handkerchief over the cage.", " With my arms before me I walked steadily in. I should lie down in my own place (I thought with a silent chuckle) and enjoy their faces when they found me in the morning. My foot struck something yielding--it was a sleeper's leg; and he turned and groaned, but without awaking. And then, all of a sudden, a shrill voice broke forth out of the darkness: \u201cPieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!\u201d and so forth, without pause or change, like the clacking of a tiny mill. Silver's green parrot, Captain Flint! It was she whom I had heard pecking at a piece of bark; it was she, keeping better watch than any human being, who thus announced my arrival with her wearisome refrain. I had no time left me to recover. At the sharp, clipping tone of the parrot, the sleepers awoke and sprang up; and with a mighty oath, the voice of Silver cried, \u201cWho goes?\u201d I turned to run, struck violently against one person, recoiled, and ran full into the arms of a second, who for his part closed upon and held me tight. \u201cBring a torch, Dick,\u201d said Silver when my capture was thus assured. And one of the men left the log-house and presently returned with a lighted brand. PART SIX--Captain Silver 28 In the Enemy's Camp THE red glare of the torch, lighting up the interior of the block house, showed me the worst of my apprehensions realized. The pirates were in possession of the house and stores: there was the cask of cognac, there were the pork and bread, as before, and what tenfold increased my horror, not a sign of any prisoner.", " I don't like this cruise; I don't like the men; and I don't like my officer. That's short and sweet.\u201d \u201cPerhaps, sir, you don't like the ship?\u201d inquired the squire, very angry, as I could see. \u201cI can't speak as to that, sir, not having seen her tried,\u201d said the captain. \u201cShe seems a clever craft; more I can't say.\u201d \u201cPossibly, sir, you may not like your employer, either?\u201d says the squire. But here Dr. Livesey cut in. \u201cStay a bit,\u201d said he, \u201cstay a bit. No use of such questions as that but to produce ill feeling. The captain has said too much or he has said too little, and I'm bound to say that I require an explanation of his words. You don't, you say, like this cruise. Now, why?\u201d \u201cI was engaged, sir, on what we call sealed orders, to sail this ship for that gentleman where he should bid me,\u201d said the captain. \u201cSo far so good. But now I find that every man before the mast knows more than I do. I don't call that fair, now, do you?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Dr. Livesey, \u201cI don't.\u201d \u201cNext,\u201d said the captain, \u201cI learn we are going after treasure--hear it from my own hands, mind you. Now, treasure is ticklish work; I don't like treasure voyages on any account, and I don't like them, above all, when they are secret and when (begging your pardon, Mr. Trelawney) the secret has been told to the parrot.\u201d \u201cSilver's parrot?\u201d asked the squire. \u201cIt's a way of speaking,\u201d said the captain. \u201cBlabbed, I mean. It's my belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about, but I'll tell you my way of it--life or death, and a close run.\u201d \u201cThat is all clear, and, I dare say, true enough,\u201d replied Dr. Livesey.", " Far away out in the marsh there arose, all of a sudden, a sound like the cry of anger, then another on the back of it; and then one horrid, long-drawn scream. The rocks of the Spy-glass re-echoed it a score of times; the whole troop of marsh-birds rose again, darkening heaven, with a simultaneous whirr; and long after that death yell was still ringing in my brain, silence had re-established its empire, and only the rustle of the redescending birds and the boom of the distant surges disturbed the languor of the afternoon. Tom had leaped at the sound, like a horse at the spur, but Silver had not winked an eye. He stood where he was, resting lightly on his crutch, watching his companion like a snake about to spring. \u201cJohn!\u201d said the sailor, stretching out his hand. \u201cHands off!\u201d cried Silver, leaping back a yard, as it seemed to me, with the speed and security of a trained gymnast. \u201cHands off, if you like, John Silver,\u201d said the other. \u201cIt's a black conscience that can make you feared of me. But in heaven's name, tell me, what was that?\u201d \u201cThat?\u201d returned Silver, smiling away, but warier than ever, his eye a mere pin-point in his big face, but gleaming like a crumb of glass. \u201cThat? Oh, I reckon that'll be Alan.\u201d And at this point Tom flashed out like a hero. \u201cAlan!\u201d he cried. \u201cThen rest his soul for a true seaman! And as for you, John Silver, long you've been a mate of mine, but you're mate of mine no more."], "Who is the firstto discover Flint\u2019s treasure on the island?": [" One fine day up went the signal, and here come Flint by himself in a little boat, and his head done up in a blue scarf. The sun was getting up, and mortal white he looked about the cutwater. But, there he was, you mind, and the six all dead--dead and buried. How he done it, not a man aboard us could make out. It was battle, murder, and sudden death, leastways--him against six. Billy Bones was the mate; Long John, he was quartermaster; and they asked him where the treasure was. 'Ah,' says he, 'you can go ashore, if you like, and stay,' he says; 'but as for the ship, she'll beat up for more, by thunder!' That's what he said. \u201cWell, I was in another ship three years back, and we sighted this island. 'Boys,' said I, 'here's Flint's treasure; let's land and find it.' The cap'n was displeased at that, but my messmates were all of a mind and landed. Twelve days they looked for it, and every day they had the worse word for me, until one fine morning all hands went aboard. 'As for you, Benjamin Gunn,' says they, 'here's a musket,' they says, 'and a spade, and pick-axe. You can stay here and find Flint's money for yourself,' they says. \u201cWell, Jim, three years have I been here, and not a bite of Christian diet from that day to this. But now, you look here; look at me. Do I look like a man before the mast? No, says you. Nor I weren't, neither, I says.\u201d And with that he winked and pinched me hard.", " But it were Providence that put me here. I've thought it all out in this here lonely island, and I'm back on piety. You don't catch me tasting rum so much, but just a thimbleful for luck, of course, the first chance I have. I'm bound I'll be good, and I see the way to. And, Jim\u201d--looking all round him and lowering his voice to a whisper--\u201cI'm rich.\u201d I now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude, and I suppose I must have shown the feeling in my face, for he repeated the statement hotly: \u201cRich! Rich! I says. And I'll tell you what: I'll make a man of you, Jim. Ah, Jim, you'll bless your stars, you will, you was the first that found me!\u201d And at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face, and he tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly before my eyes. \u201cNow, Jim, you tell me true: that ain't Flint's ship?\u201d he asked. At this I had a happy inspiration. I began to believe that I had found an ally, and I answered him at once. \u201cIt's not Flint's ship, and Flint is dead; but I'll tell you true, as you ask me--there are some of Flint's hands aboard; worse luck for the rest of us.\u201d \u201cNot a man--with one--leg?\u201d he gasped. \u201cSilver?\u201d I asked. \u201cAh, Silver!\u201d says he. \u201cThat were his name.\u201d \u201cHe's the cook, and the ringleader too.\u201d He was still holding me by the wrist, and at that he give it quite a wring. \u201cIf you was sent by Long John,\u201d he said, \u201cI'm as good as pork, and I know it.", " It was Silver's voice, and before I had heard a dozen words, I would not have shown myself for all the world, but lay there, trembling and listening, in the extreme of fear and curiosity, for from these dozen words I understood that the lives of all the honest men aboard depended upon me alone. 11 What I Heard in the Apple Barrel \u201cNO, not I,\u201d said Silver. \u201cFlint was cap'n; I was quartermaster, along of my timber leg. The same broadside I lost my leg, old Pew lost his deadlights. It was a master surgeon, him that ampytated me--out of college and all--Latin by the bucket, and what not; but he was hanged like a dog, and sun-dried like the rest, at Corso Castle. That was Roberts' men, that was, and comed of changing names to their ships--ROYAL FORTUNE and so on. Now, what a ship was christened, so let her stay, I says. So it was with the CASSANDRA, as brought us all safe home from Malabar, after England took the viceroy of the Indies; so it was with the old WALRUS, Flint's old ship, as I've seen amuck with the red blood and fit to sink with gold.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d cried another voice, that of the youngest hand on board, and evidently full of admiration. \u201cHe was the flower of the flock, was Flint!\u201d \u201cDavis was a man too, by all accounts,\u201d said Silver. \u201cI never sailed along of him; first with England, then with Flint, that's my story; and now here on my own account, in a manner of speaking. I laid by nine hundred safe, from England, and two thousand after Flint.", " Blackbeard was a child to Flint. The Spaniards were so prodigiously afraid of him that, I tell you, sir, I was sometimes proud he was an Englishman. I've seen his top-sails with these eyes, off Trinidad, and the cowardly son of a rum-puncheon that I sailed with put back--put back, sir, into Port of Spain.\u201d \u201cWell, I've heard of him myself, in England,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cBut the point is, had he money?\u201d \u201cMoney!\u201d cried the squire. \u201cHave you heard the story? What were these villains after but money? What do they care for but money? For what would they risk their rascal carcasses but money?\u201d \u201cThat we shall soon know,\u201d replied the doctor. \u201cBut you are so confoundedly hot-headed and exclamatory that I cannot get a word in. What I want to know is this: Supposing that I have here in my pocket some clue to where Flint buried his treasure, will that treasure amount to much?\u201d \u201cAmount, sir!\u201d cried the squire. \u201cIt will amount to this: If we have the clue you talk about, I fit out a ship in Bristol dock, and take you and Hawkins here along, and I'll have that treasure if I search a year.\u201d \u201cVery well,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cNow, then, if Jim is agreeable, we'll open the packet\u201d; and he laid it before him on the table. The bundle was sewn together, and the doctor had to get out his instrument case and cut the stitches with his medical scissors. It contained two things--a book and a sealed paper. \u201cFirst of all we'll try the book,\u201d observed the doctor."], "How does BenGunn frighten the pirates?": [" Well, George, how goes it? You're a pretty colour, certainly; why, your liver, man, is upside down. Did you take that medicine? Did he take that medicine, men?\u201d \u201cAye, aye, sir, he took it, sure enough,\u201d returned Morgan. \u201cBecause, you see, since I am mutineers' doctor, or prison doctor as I prefer to call it,\u201d says Doctor Livesey in his pleasantest way, \u201cI make it a point of honour not to lose a man for King George (God bless him!) and the gallows.\u201d The rogues looked at each other but swallowed the home-thrust in silence. \u201cDick don't feel well, sir,\u201d said one. \u201cDon't he?\u201d replied the doctor. \u201cWell, step up here, Dick, and let me see your tongue. No, I should be surprised if he did! The man's tongue is fit to frighten the French. Another fever.\u201d \u201cAh, there,\u201d said Morgan, \u201cthat comed of sp'iling Bibles.\u201d \u201cThat comes--as you call it--of being arrant asses,\u201d retorted the doctor, \u201cand not having sense enough to know honest air from poison, and the dry land from a vile, pestiferous slough. I think it most probable--though of course it's only an opinion--that you'll all have the deuce to pay before you get that malaria out of your systems. Camp in a bog, would you? Silver, I'm surprised at you. You're less of a fool than many, take you all round; but you don't appear to me to have the rudiments of a notion of the rules of health. \u201cWell,\u201d he added after he had dosed them round and they had taken his prescriptions, with really laughable humility, more like charity schoolchildren than blood-guilty mutineers and pirates--\u201cwell, that's done for today.", " For--you would have thought men would have been ashamed of themselves--no soul would consent to return with us to the Admiral Benbow. The more we told of our troubles, the more--man, woman, and child--they clung to the shelter of their houses. The name of Captain Flint, though it was strange to me, was well enough known to some there and carried a great weight of terror. Some of the men who had been to field-work on the far side of the Admiral Benbow remembered, besides, to have seen several strangers on the road, and taking them to be smugglers, to have bolted away; and one at least had seen a little lugger in what we called Kitt's Hole. For that matter, anyone who was a comrade of the captain's was enough to frighten them to death. And the short and the long of the matter was, that while we could get several who were willing enough to ride to Dr. Livesey's, which lay in another direction, not one would help us to defend the inn. They say cowardice is infectious; but then argument is, on the other hand, a great emboldener; and so when each had said his say, my mother made them a speech. She would not, she declared, lose money that belonged to her fatherless boy; \u201cIf none of the rest of you dare,\u201d she said, \u201cJim and I dare. Back we will go, the way we came, and small thanks to you big, hulking, chicken-hearted men. We'll have that chest open, if we die for it. And I'll thank you for that bag, Mrs. Crossley, to bring back our lawful money in.\u201d Of course I said I would go with my mother, and of course they all cried out at our foolhardiness, but even then not a man would go along with us.", " \u201cSee if that's the place.\u201d Long John's eyes burned in his head as he took the chart, but by the fresh look of the paper I knew he was doomed to disappointment. This was not the map we found in Billy Bones's chest, but an accurate copy, complete in all things--names and heights and soundings--with the single exception of the red crosses and the written notes. Sharp as must have been his annoyance, Silver had the strength of mind to hide it. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d said he, \u201cthis is the spot, to be sure, and very prettily drawed out. Who might have done that, I wonder? The pirates were too ignorant, I reckon. Aye, here it is: 'Capt. Kidd's Anchorage'--just the name my shipmate called it. There's a strong current runs along the south, and then away nor'ard up the west coast. Right you was, sir,\u201d says he, \u201cto haul your wind and keep the weather of the island. Leastways, if such was your intention as to enter and careen, and there ain't no better place for that in these waters.\u201d \u201cThank you, my man,\u201d says Captain Smollett. \u201cI'll ask you later on to give us a help. You may go.\u201d I was surprised at the coolness with which John avowed his knowledge of the island, and I own I was half-frightened when I saw him drawing nearer to myself. He did not know, to be sure, that I had overheard his council from the apple barrel, and yet I had by this time taken such a horror of his cruelty, duplicity, and power that I could scarce conceal a shudder when he laid his hand upon my arm.", " \u201cYou're the man to keep your word, we know that.\u201d Well, that was about the last news we had of the three pirates. Only once we heard a gunshot a great way off and supposed them to be hunting. A council was held, and it was decided that we must desert them on the island--to the huge glee, I must say, of Ben Gunn, and with the strong approval of Gray. We left a good stock of powder and shot, the bulk of the salt goat, a few medicines, and some other necessaries, tools, clothing, a spare sail, a fathom or two of rope, and by the particular desire of the doctor, a handsome present of tobacco. That was about our last doing on the island. Before that, we had got the treasure stowed and had shipped enough water and the remainder of the goat meat in case of any distress; and at last, one fine morning, we weighed anchor, which was about all that we could manage, and stood out of North Inlet, the same colours flying that the captain had flown and fought under at the palisade. The three fellows must have been watching us closer than we thought for, as we soon had proved. For coming through the narrows, we had to lie very near the southern point, and there we saw all three of them kneeling together on a spit of sand, with their arms raised in supplication. It went to all our hearts, I think, to leave them in that wretched state; but we could not risk another mutiny; and to take them home for the gibbet would have been a cruel sort of kindness."], "Who interruptsJim\u2019s narration to tell the story for a while?": [" But where was you, do you suppose?\u201d I had made my mind up in a moment, and by way of answer told him the whole story of our voyage and the predicament in which we found ourselves. He heard me with the keenest interest, and when I had done he patted me on the head. \u201cYou're a good lad, Jim,\u201d he said; \u201cand you're all in a clove hitch, ain't you? Well, you just put your trust in Ben Gunn--Ben Gunn's the man to do it. Would you think it likely, now, that your squire would prove a liberal-minded one in case of help--him being in a clove hitch, as you remark?\u201d I told him the squire was the most liberal of men. \u201cAye, but you see,\u201d returned Ben Gunn, \u201cI didn't mean giving me a gate to keep, and a suit of livery clothes, and such; that's not my mark, Jim. What I mean is, would he be likely to come down to the toon of, say one thousand pounds out of money that's as good as a man's own already?\u201d \u201cI am sure he would,\u201d said I. \u201cAs it was, all hands were to share.\u201d \u201cAND a passage home?\u201d he added with a look of great shrewdness. \u201cWhy,\u201d I cried, \u201cthe squire's a gentleman. And besides, if we got rid of the others, we should want you to help work the vessel home.\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d said he, \u201cso you would.\u201d And he seemed very much relieved. \u201cNow, I'll tell you what,\u201d he went on. \u201cSo much I'll tell you, and no more. I were in Flint's ship when he buried the treasure; he and six along--six strong seamen. They was ashore nigh on a week, and us standing off and on in the old WALRUS.", " \u201cAh,\u201d says he, \u201cthis here is a sweet spot, this island--a sweet spot for a lad to get ashore on. You'll bathe, and you'll climb trees, and you'll hunt goats, you will; and you'll get aloft on them hills like a goat yourself. Why, it makes me young again. I was going to forget my timber leg, I was. It's a pleasant thing to be young and have ten toes, and you may lay to that. When you want to go a bit of exploring, you just ask old John, and he'll put up a snack for you to take along.\u201d And clapping me in the friendliest way upon the shoulder, he hobbled off forward and went below. Captain Smollett, the squire, and Dr. Livesey were talking together on the quarter-deck, and anxious as I was to tell them my story, I durst not interrupt them openly. While I was still casting about in my thoughts to find some probable excuse, Dr. Livesey called me to his side. He had left his pipe below, and being a slave to tobacco, had meant that I should fetch it; but as soon as I was near enough to speak and not to be overheard, I broke immediately, \u201cDoctor, let me speak. Get the captain and squire down to the cabin, and then make some pretence to send for me. I have terrible news.\u201d The doctor changed countenance a little, but next moment he was master of himself. \u201cThank you, Jim,\u201d said he quite loudly, \u201cthat was all I wanted to know,\u201d as if he had asked me a question. And with that he turned on his heel and rejoined the other two.", " He hailed her. A voice replied, telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get some lead in him, and at the same time a bullet whistled close by his arm. Soon after, the lugger doubled the point and disappeared. Mr. Dance stood there, as he said, \u201clike a fish out of water,\u201d and all he could do was to dispatch a man to B---- to warn the cutter. \u201cAnd that,\u201d said he, \u201cis just about as good as nothing. They've got off clean, and there's an end. Only,\u201d he added, \u201cI'm glad I trod on Master Pew's corns,\u201d for by this time he had heard my story. I went back with him to the Admiral Benbow, and you cannot imagine a house in such a state of smash; the very clock had been thrown down by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself; and though nothing had actually been taken away except the captain's money-bag and a little silver from the till, I could see at once that we were ruined. Mr. Dance could make nothing of the scene. \u201cThey got the money, you say? Well, then, Hawkins, what in fortune were they after? More money, I suppose?\u201d \u201cNo, sir; not money, I think,\u201d replied I. \u201cIn fact, sir, I believe I have the thing in my breast pocket; and to tell you the truth, I should like to get it put in safety.\u201d \u201cTo be sure, boy; quite right,\u201d said he. \u201cI'll take it, if you like.\u201d \u201cI thought perhaps Dr. Livesey--\u201d I began. \u201cPerfectly right,\u201d he interrupted very cheerily, \u201cperfectly right--a gentleman and a magistrate.", " I judged at once that some of my shipmates must be drawing near along the borders of the fen. Nor was I deceived, for soon I heard the very distant and low tones of a human voice, which, as I continued to give ear, grew steadily louder and nearer. This put me in a great fear, and I crawled under cover of the nearest live-oak and squatted there, hearkening, as silent as a mouse. Another voice answered, and then the first voice, which I now recognized to be Silver's, once more took up the story and ran on for a long while in a stream, only now and again interrupted by the other. By the sound they must have been talking earnestly, and almost fiercely; but no distinct word came to my hearing. At last the speakers seemed to have paused and perhaps to have sat down, for not only did they cease to draw any nearer, but the birds themselves began to grow more quiet and to settle again to their places in the swamp. And now I began to feel that I was neglecting my business, that since I had been so foolhardy as to come ashore with these desperadoes, the least I could do was to overhear them at their councils, and that my plain and obvious duty was to draw as close as I could manage, under the favourable ambush of the crouching trees. I could tell the direction of the speakers pretty exactly, not only by the sound of their voices but by the behaviour of the few birds that still hung in alarm above the heads of the intruders."], "Whom does Jimfight on the ship when he sneaks on board?": [" The sight of so many good-humoured faces (especially the blacks), the taste of the tropical fruits, and above all the lights that began to shine in the town made a most charming contrast to our dark and bloody sojourn on the island; and the doctor and the squire, taking me along with them, went ashore to pass the early part of the night. Here they met the captain of an English man-of-war, fell in talk with him, went on board his ship, and, in short, had so agreeable a time that day was breaking when we came alongside the HISPANIOLA. Ben Gunn was on deck alone, and as soon as we came on board he began, with wonderful contortions, to make us a confession. Silver was gone. The maroon had connived at his escape in a shore boat some hours ago, and he now assured us he had only done so to preserve our lives, which would certainly have been forfeit if \u201cthat man with the one leg had stayed aboard.\u201d But this was not all. The sea-cook had not gone empty-handed. He had cut through a bulkhead unobserved and had removed one of the sacks of coin, worth perhaps three or four hundred guineas, to help him on his further wanderings. I think we were all pleased to be so cheaply quit of him. Well, to make a long story short, we got a few hands on board, made a good cruise home, and the HISPANIOLA reached Bristol just as Mr. Blandly was beginning to think of fitting out her consort. Five men only of those who had sailed returned with her.", " I'll fire a gun half an hour before sundown.\u201d I believe the silly fellows must have thought they would break their shins over treasure as soon as they were landed, for they all came out of their sulks in a moment and gave a cheer that started the echo in a faraway hill and sent the birds once more flying and squalling round the anchorage. The captain was too bright to be in the way. He whipped out of sight in a moment, leaving Silver to arrange the party, and I fancy it was as well he did so. Had he been on deck, he could no longer so much as have pretended not to understand the situation. It was as plain as day. Silver was the captain, and a mighty rebellious crew he had of it. The honest hands--and I was soon to see it proved that there were such on board--must have been very stupid fellows. Or rather, I suppose the truth was this, that all hands were disaffected by the example of the ringleaders--only some more, some less; and a few, being good fellows in the main, could neither be led nor driven any further. It is one thing to be idle and skulk and quite another to take a ship and murder a number of innocent men. At last, however, the party was made up. Six fellows were to stay on board, and the remaining thirteen, including Silver, began to embark. Then it was that there came into my head the first of the mad notions that contributed so much to save our lives. If six men were left by Silver, it was plain our party could not take and fight the ship; and since only six were left, it was equally plain that the cabin party had no present need of my assistance.", " \u201cWell, squire,\u201d said Dr. Livesey, \u201cI don't put much faith in your discoveries, as a general thing; but I will say this, John Silver suits me.\u201d \u201cThe man's a perfect trump,\u201d declared the squire. \u201cAnd now,\u201d added the doctor, \u201cJim may come on board with us, may he not?\u201d \u201cTo be sure he may,\u201d says squire. \u201cTake your hat, Hawkins, and we'll see the ship.\u201d 9 Powder and Arms THE HISPANIOLA lay some way out, and we went under the figureheads and round the sterns of many other ships, and their cables sometimes grated underneath our keel, and sometimes swung above us. At last, however, we got alongside, and were met and saluted as we stepped aboard by the mate, Mr. Arrow, a brown old sailor with earrings in his ears and a squint. He and the squire were very thick and friendly, but I soon observed that things were not the same between Mr. Trelawney and the captain. This last was a sharp-looking man who seemed angry with everything on board and was soon to tell us why, for we had hardly got down into the cabin when a sailor followed us. \u201cCaptain Smollett, sir, axing to speak with you,\u201d said he. \u201cI am always at the captain's orders. Show him in,\u201d said the squire. The captain, who was close behind his messenger, entered at once and shut the door behind him. \u201cWell, Captain Smollett, what have you to say? All well, I hope; all shipshape and seaworthy?\u201d \u201cWell, sir,\u201d said the captain, \u201cbetter speak plain, I believe, even at the risk of offence.", " When I first sighted her, all her sails were drawing; she was lying a course about north-west, and I presumed the men on board were going round the island on their way back to the anchorage. Presently she began to fetch more and more to the westward, so that I thought they had sighted me and were going about in chase. At last, however, she fell right into the wind's eye, was taken dead aback, and stood there awhile helpless, with her sails shivering. \u201cClumsy fellows,\u201d said I; \u201cthey must still be drunk as owls.\u201d And I thought how Captain Smollett would have set them skipping. Meanwhile the schooner gradually fell off and filled again upon another tack, sailed swiftly for a minute or so, and brought up once more dead in the wind's eye. Again and again was this repeated. To and fro, up and down, north, south, east, and west, the HISPANIOLA sailed by swoops and dashes, and at each repetition ended as she had begun, with idly flapping canvas. It became plain to me that nobody was steering. And if so, where were the men? Either they were dead drunk or had deserted her, I thought, and perhaps if I could get on board I might return the vessel to her captain. The current was bearing coracle and schooner southward at an equal rate. As for the latter's sailing, it was so wild and intermittent, and she hung each time so long in irons, that she certainly gained nothing, if she did not even lose."], "When the treasurewas initially discovered, where was it taken immediately after itsexcavation?": [" \u201cFlag of truce!\u201d I heard someone say; and then, immediately after, with a cry of surprise, \u201cSilver himself!\u201d And at that, up I jumped, and rubbing my eyes, ran to a loophole in the wall. 20 Silver's Embassy SURE enough, there were two men just outside the stockade, one of them waving a white cloth, the other, no less a person than Silver himself, standing placidly by. It was still quite early, and the coldest morning that I think I ever was abroad in--a chill that pierced into the marrow. The sky was bright and cloudless overhead, and the tops of the trees shone rosily in the sun. But where Silver stood with his lieutenant, all was still in shadow, and they waded knee-deep in a low white vapour that had crawled during the night out of the morass. The chill and the vapour taken together told a poor tale of the island. It was plainly a damp, feverish, unhealthy spot. \u201cKeep indoors, men,\u201d said the captain. \u201cTen to one this is a trick.\u201d Then he hailed the buccaneer. \u201cWho goes? Stand, or we fire.\u201d \u201cFlag of truce,\u201d cried Silver. The captain was in the porch, keeping himself carefully out of the way of a treacherous shot, should any be intended. He turned and spoke to us, \u201cDoctor's watch on the lookout. Dr. Livesey take the north side, if you please; Jim, the east; Gray, west. The watch below, all hands to load muskets. Lively, men, and careful.\u201d And then he turned again to the mutineers.", " They go the length of declaring that this honest creature would do anything for money, that the HISPANIOLA belonged to him, and that he sold it me absurdly high--the most transparent calumnies. None of them dare, however, to deny the merits of the ship. So far there was not a hitch. The workpeople, to be sure--riggers and what not--were most annoyingly slow; but time cured that. It was the crew that troubled me. I wished a round score of men--in case of natives, buccaneers, or the odious French--and I had the worry of the deuce itself to find so much as half a dozen, till the most remarkable stroke of fortune brought me the very man that I required. I was standing on the dock, when, by the merest accident, I fell in talk with him. I found he was an old sailor, kept a public-house, knew all the seafaring men in Bristol, had lost his health ashore, and wanted a good berth as cook to get to sea again. He had hobbled down there that morning, he said, to get a smell of the salt. I was monstrously touched--so would you have been--and, out of pure pity, I engaged him on the spot to be ship's cook. Long John Silver, he is called, and has lost a leg; but that I regarded as a recommendation, since he lost it in his country's service, under the immortal Hawke. He has no pension, Livesey. Imagine the abominable age we live in! Well, sir, I thought I had only found a cook, but it was a crew I had discovered.", " Just before him Tom lay motionless upon the sward; but the murderer minded him not a whit, cleansing his blood-stained knife the while upon a wisp of grass. Everything else was unchanged, the sun still shining mercilessly on the steaming marsh and the tall pinnacle of the mountain, and I could scarce persuade myself that murder had been actually done and a human life cruelly cut short a moment since before my eyes. But now John put his hand into his pocket, brought out a whistle, and blew upon it several modulated blasts that rang far across the heated air. I could not tell, of course, the meaning of the signal, but it instantly awoke my fears. More men would be coming. I might be discovered. They had already slain two of the honest people; after Tom and Alan, might not I come next? Instantly I began to extricate myself and crawl back again, with what speed and silence I could manage, to the more open portion of the wood. As I did so, I could hear hails coming and going between the old buccaneer and his comrades, and this sound of danger lent me wings. As soon as I was clear of the thicket, I ran as I never ran before, scarce minding the direction of my flight, so long as it led me from the murderers; and as I ran, fear grew and grew upon me until it turned into a kind of frenzy. Indeed, could anyone be more entirely lost than I? When the gun fired, how should I dare to go down to the boats among those fiends, still smoking from their crime?", " But towards the end of the bombardment, though still I durst not venture in the direction of the stockade, where the balls fell oftenest, I had begun, in a manner, to pluck up my heart again, and after a long detour to the east, crept down among the shore-side trees. The sun had just set, the sea breeze was rustling and tumbling in the woods and ruffling the grey surface of the anchorage; the tide, too, was far out, and great tracts of sand lay uncovered; the air, after the heat of the day, chilled me through my jacket. The HISPANIOLA still lay where she had anchored; but, sure enough, there was the Jolly Roger--the black flag of piracy--flying from her peak. Even as I looked, there came another red flash and another report that sent the echoes clattering, and one more round-shot whistled through the air. It was the last of the cannonade. I lay for some time watching the bustle which succeeded the attack. Men were demolishing something with axes on the beach near the stockade--the poor jolly-boat, I afterwards discovered. Away, near the mouth of the river, a great fire was glowing among the trees, and between that point and the ship one of the gigs kept coming and going, the men, whom I had seen so gloomy, shouting at the oars like children. But there was a sound in their voices which suggested rum. At length I thought I might return towards the stockade. I was pretty far down on the low, sandy spit that encloses the anchorage to the east, and is joined at half-water to Skeleton Island; and now, as I rose to my feet, I saw, some distance further down the spit and rising from among low bushes, an isolated rock, pretty high, and peculiarly white in colour."], "Why does Silvervisit Smollett in the stockade?": [" I've had a'most enough o' Cap'n Smollett; he's hazed me long enough, by thunder! I want to go into that cabin, I do. I want their pickles and wines, and that.\u201d \u201cIsrael,\u201d said Silver, \u201cyour head ain't much account, nor ever was. But you're able to hear, I reckon; leastways, your ears is big enough. Now, here's what I say: you'll berth forward, and you'll live hard, and you'll speak soft, and you'll keep sober till I give the word; and you may lay to that, my son.\u201d \u201cWell, I don't say no, do I?\u201d growled the coxswain. \u201cWhat I say is, when? That's what I say.\u201d \u201cWhen! By the powers!\u201d cried Silver. \u201cWell now, if you want to know, I'll tell you when. The last moment I can manage, and that's when. Here's a first-rate seaman, Cap'n Smollett, sails the blessed ship for us. Here's this squire and doctor with a map and such--I don't know where it is, do I? No more do you, says you. Well then, I mean this squire and doctor shall find the stuff, and help us to get it aboard, by the powers. Then we'll see. If I was sure of you all, sons of double Dutchmen, I'd have Cap'n Smollett navigate us half-way back again before I struck.\u201d \u201cWhy, we're all seamen aboard here, I should think,\u201d said the lad Dick. \u201cWe're all forecastle hands, you mean,\u201d snapped Silver. \u201cWe can steer a course, but who's to set one? That's what all you gentlemen split on, first and last. If I had my way, I'd have Cap'n Smollett work us back into the trades at least; then we'd have no blessed miscalculations and a spoonful of water a day.", " \u201cAnd what do you want with your flag of truce?\u201d he cried. This time it was the other man who replied. \u201cCap'n Silver, sir, to come on board and make terms,\u201d he shouted. \u201cCap'n Silver! Don't know him. Who's he?\u201d cried the captain. And we could hear him adding to himself, \u201cCap'n, is it? My heart, and here's promotion!\u201d Long John answered for himself. \u201cMe, sir. These poor lads have chosen me cap'n, after your desertion, sir\u201d--laying a particular emphasis upon the word \u201cdesertion.\u201d \u201cWe're willing to submit, if we can come to terms, and no bones about it. All I ask is your word, Cap'n Smollett, to let me safe and sound out of this here stockade, and one minute to get out o' shot before a gun is fired.\u201d \u201cMy man,\u201d said Captain Smollett, \u201cI have not the slightest desire to talk to you. If you wish to talk to me, you can come, that's all. If there's any treachery, it'll be on your side, and the Lord help you.\u201d \u201cThat's enough, cap'n,\u201d shouted Long John cheerily. \u201cA word from you's enough. I know a gentleman, and you may lay to that.\u201d We could see the man who carried the flag of truce attempting to hold Silver back. Nor was that wonderful, seeing how cavalier had been the captain's answer. But Silver laughed at him aloud and slapped him on the back as if the idea of alarm had been absurd. Then he advanced to the stockade, threw over his crutch, got a leg up, and with great vigour and skill succeeded in surmounting the fence and dropping safely to the other side.", " A hail on the land side. \u201cSomebody hailing us,\u201d said Hunter, who was on guard. \u201cDoctor! Squire! Captain! Hullo, Hunter, is that you?\u201d came the cries. And I ran to the door in time to see Jim Hawkins, safe and sound, come climbing over the stockade. 19 Narrative Resumed by Jim Hawkins: The Garrison in the Stockade AS soon as Ben Gunn saw the colours he came to a halt, stopped me by the arm, and sat down. \u201cNow,\u201d said he, \u201cthere's your friends, sure enough.\u201d \u201cFar more likely it's the mutineers,\u201d I answered. \u201cThat!\u201d he cried. \u201cWhy, in a place like this, where nobody puts in but gen'lemen of fortune, Silver would fly the Jolly Roger, you don't make no doubt of that. No, that's your friends. There's been blows too, and I reckon your friends has had the best of it; and here they are ashore in the old stockade, as was made years and years ago by Flint. Ah, he was the man to have a headpiece, was Flint! Barring rum, his match were never seen. He were afraid of none, not he; on'y Silver--Silver was that genteel.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said I, \u201cthat may be so, and so be it; all the more reason that I should hurry on and join my friends.\u201d \u201cNay, mate,\u201d returned Ben, \u201cnot you. You're a good boy, or I'm mistook; but you're on'y a boy, all told. Now, Ben Gunn is fly. Rum wouldn't bring me there, where you're going--not rum wouldn't, till I see your born gen'leman and gets it on his word of honour. And you won't forget my words; 'A precious sight (that's what you'll say), a precious sight more confidence'--and then nips him.\u201d And he pinched me the third time with the same air of cleverness.", " But towards the end of the bombardment, though still I durst not venture in the direction of the stockade, where the balls fell oftenest, I had begun, in a manner, to pluck up my heart again, and after a long detour to the east, crept down among the shore-side trees. The sun had just set, the sea breeze was rustling and tumbling in the woods and ruffling the grey surface of the anchorage; the tide, too, was far out, and great tracts of sand lay uncovered; the air, after the heat of the day, chilled me through my jacket. The HISPANIOLA still lay where she had anchored; but, sure enough, there was the Jolly Roger--the black flag of piracy--flying from her peak. Even as I looked, there came another red flash and another report that sent the echoes clattering, and one more round-shot whistled through the air. It was the last of the cannonade. I lay for some time watching the bustle which succeeded the attack. Men were demolishing something with axes on the beach near the stockade--the poor jolly-boat, I afterwards discovered. Away, near the mouth of the river, a great fire was glowing among the trees, and between that point and the ship one of the gigs kept coming and going, the men, whom I had seen so gloomy, shouting at the oars like children. But there was a sound in their voices which suggested rum. At length I thought I might return towards the stockade. I was pretty far down on the low, sandy spit that encloses the anchorage to the east, and is joined at half-water to Skeleton Island; and now, as I rose to my feet, I saw, some distance further down the spit and rising from among low bushes, an isolated rock, pretty high, and peculiarly white in colour."], "When the pirateshand Silver a black spot toward the end of the novel, what is itsmessage?": [" He gave it me at Savannah, when he lay a-dying, like as if I was to now, you see. But you won't peach unless they get the black spot on me, or unless you see that Black Dog again or a seafaring man with one leg, Jim--him above all.\u201d \u201cBut what is the black spot, captain?\u201d I asked. \u201cThat's a summons, mate. I'll tell you if they get that. But you keep your weather-eye open, Jim, and I'll share with you equals, upon my honour.\u201d He wandered a little longer, his voice growing weaker; but soon after I had given him his medicine, which he took like a child, with the remark, \u201cIf ever a seaman wanted drugs, it's me,\u201d he fell at last into a heavy, swoon-like sleep, in which I left him. What I should have done had all gone well I do not know. Probably I should have told the whole story to the doctor, for I was in mortal fear lest the captain should repent of his confessions and make an end of me. But as things fell out, my poor father died quite suddenly that evening, which put all other matters on one side. Our natural distress, the visits of the neighbours, the arranging of the funeral, and all the work of the inn to be carried on in the meanwhile kept me so busy that I had scarcely time to think of the captain, far less to be afraid of him. He got downstairs next morning, to be sure, and had his meals as usual, though he ate little and had more, I am afraid, than his usual supply of rum, for he helped himself out of the bar, scowling and blowing through his nose, and no one dared to cross him.", " \u201cThere! Wot did I say? No good'll come o' that, I said.\u201d \u201cWell, you've about fixed it now, among you,\u201d continued Silver. \u201cYou'll all swing now, I reckon. What soft-headed lubber had a Bible?\u201d \u201cIt was Dick,\u201d said one. \u201cDick, was it? Then Dick can get to prayers,\u201d said Silver. \u201cHe's seen his slice of luck, has Dick, and you may lay to that.\u201d But here the long man with the yellow eyes struck in. \u201cBelay that talk, John Silver,\u201d he said. \u201cThis crew has tipped you the black spot in full council, as in dooty bound; just you turn it over, as in dooty bound, and see what's wrote there. Then you can talk.\u201d \u201cThanky, George,\u201d replied the sea-cook. \u201cYou always was brisk for business, and has the rules by heart, George, as I'm pleased to see. Well, what is it, anyway? Ah! 'Deposed'--that's it, is it? Very pretty wrote, to be sure; like print, I swear. Your hand o' write, George? Why, you was gettin' quite a leadin' man in this here crew. You'll be cap'n next, I shouldn't wonder. Just oblige me with that torch again, will you? This pipe don't draw.\u201d \u201cCome, now,\u201d said George, \u201cyou don't fool this crew no more. You're a funny man, by your account; but you're over now, and you'll maybe step down off that barrel and help vote.\u201d \u201cI thought you said you knowed the rules,\u201d returned Silver contemptuously. \u201cLeastways, if you don't, I do; and I wait here--and I'm still your cap'n, mind--till you outs with your grievances and I reply; in the meantime, your black spot ain't worth a biscuit.", " Is that seamanly behaviour, now, I want to know? But I'm a saving soul. I never wasted good money of mine, nor lost it neither; and I'll trick 'em again. I'm not afraid on 'em. I'll shake out another reef, matey, and daddle 'em again.\u201d As he was thus speaking, he had risen from bed with great difficulty, holding to my shoulder with a grip that almost made me cry out, and moving his legs like so much dead weight. His words, spirited as they were in meaning, contrasted sadly with the weakness of the voice in which they were uttered. He paused when he had got into a sitting position on the edge. \u201cThat doctor's done me,\u201d he murmured. \u201cMy ears is singing. Lay me back.\u201d Before I could do much to help him he had fallen back again to his former place, where he lay for a while silent. \u201cJim,\u201d he said at length, \u201cyou saw that seafaring man today?\u201d \u201cBlack Dog?\u201d I asked. \u201cAh! Black Dog,\u201d says he. \u201cHE'S a bad un; but there's worse that put him on. Now, if I can't get away nohow, and they tip me the black spot, mind you, it's my old sea-chest they're after; you get on a horse--you can, can't you? Well, then, you get on a horse, and go to--well, yes, I will!--to that eternal doctor swab, and tell him to pipe all hands--magistrates and sich--and he'll lay 'em aboard at the Admiral Benbow--all old Flint's crew, man and boy, all on 'em that's left. I was first mate, I was, old Flint's first mate, and I'm the on'y one as knows the place.", " After that, we'll see.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d replied George, \u201cyou don't be under no kind of apprehension; WE'RE all square, we are. First, you've made a hash of this cruise--you'll be a bold man to say no to that. Second, you let the enemy out o' this here trap for nothing. Why did they want out? I dunno, but it's pretty plain they wanted it. Third, you wouldn't let us go at them upon the march. Oh, we see through you, John Silver; you want to play booty, that's what's wrong with you. And then, fourth, there's this here boy.\u201d \u201cIs that all?\u201d asked Silver quietly. \u201cEnough, too,\u201d retorted George. \u201cWe'll all swing and sun-dry for your bungling.\u201d \u201cWell now, look here, I'll answer these four p'ints; one after another I'll answer 'em. I made a hash o' this cruise, did I? Well now, you all know what I wanted, and you all know if that had been done that we'd 'a been aboard the HISPANIOLA this night as ever was, every man of us alive, and fit, and full of good plum-duff, and the treasure in the hold of her, by thunder! Well, who crossed me? Who forced my hand, as was the lawful cap'n? Who tipped me the black spot the day we landed and began this dance? Ah, it's a fine dance--I'm with you there--and looks mighty like a hornpipe in a rope's end at Execution Dock by London town, it does. But who done it? Why, it was Anderson, and Hands, and you, George Merry! And you're the last above board of that same meddling crew; and you have the Davy Jones's insolence to up and stand for cap'n over me--you, that sank the lot of us!"], "Which of thefollowing characters does Silver take hostage?": [" By the powers! But this tops the stiffest yarn to nothing.\u201d Silver paused, and I could see by the faces of George and his late comrades that these words had not been said in vain. \u201cThat's for number one,\u201d cried the accused, wiping the sweat from his brow, for he had been talking with a vehemence that shook the house. \u201cWhy, I give you my word, I'm sick to speak to you. You've neither sense nor memory, and I leave it to fancy where your mothers was that let you come to sea. Sea! Gentlemen o' fortune! I reckon tailors is your trade.\u201d \u201cGo on, John,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cSpeak up to the others.\u201d \u201cAh, the others!\u201d returned John. \u201cThey're a nice lot, ain't they? You say this cruise is bungled. Ah! By gum, if you could understand how bad it's bungled, you would see! We're that near the gibbet that my neck's stiff with thinking on it. You've seen 'em, maybe, hanged in chains, birds about 'em, seamen p'inting 'em out as they go down with the tide. 'Who's that?' says one. 'That! Why, that's John Silver. I knowed him well,' says another. And you can hear the chains a-jangle as you go about and reach for the other buoy. Now, that's about where we are, every mother's son of us, thanks to him, and Hands, and Anderson, and other ruination fools of you. And if you want to know about number four, and that boy, why, shiver my timbers, isn't he a hostage? Are we a-going to waste a hostage? No, not us; he might be our last chance, and I shouldn't wonder.", " They had lit a fire fit to roast an ox, and it was now grown so hot that they could only approach it from the windward, and even there not without precaution. In the same wasteful spirit, they had cooked, I suppose, three times more than we could eat; and one of them, with an empty laugh, threw what was left into the fire, which blazed and roared again over this unusual fuel. I never in my life saw men so careless of the morrow; hand to mouth is the only word that can describe their way of doing; and what with wasted food and sleeping sentries, though they were bold enough for a brush and be done with it, I could see their entire unfitness for anything like a prolonged campaign. Even Silver, eating away, with Captain Flint upon his shoulder, had not a word of blame for their recklessness. And this the more surprised me, for I thought he had never shown himself so cunning as he did then. \u201cAye, mates,\u201d said he, \u201cit's lucky you have Barbecue to think for you with this here head. I got what I wanted, I did. Sure enough, they have the ship. Where they have it, I don't know yet; but once we hit the treasure, we'll have to jump about and find out. And then, mates, us that has the boats, I reckon, has the upper hand.\u201d Thus he kept running on, with his mouth full of the hot bacon; thus he restored their hope and confidence, and, I more than suspect, repaired his own at the same time. \u201cAs for hostage,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat's his last talk, I guess, with them he loves so dear.", " Kill that boy? Not me, mates! And number three? Ah, well, there's a deal to say to number three. Maybe you don't count it nothing to have a real college doctor to see you every day--you, John, with your head broke--or you, George Merry, that had the ague shakes upon you not six hours agone, and has your eyes the colour of lemon peel to this same moment on the clock? And maybe, perhaps, you didn't know there was a consort coming either? But there is, and not so long till then; and we'll see who'll be glad to have a hostage when it comes to that. And as for number two, and why I made a bargain--well, you came crawling on your knees to me to make it--on your knees you came, you was that downhearted--and you'd have starved too if I hadn't--but that's a trifle! You look there--that's why!\u201d And he cast down upon the floor a paper that I instantly recognized--none other than the chart on yellow paper, with the three red crosses, that I had found in the oilcloth at the bottom of the captain's chest. Why the doctor had given it to him was more than I could fancy. But if it were inexplicable to me, the appearance of the chart was incredible to the surviving mutineers. They leaped upon it like cats upon a mouse. It went from hand to hand, one tearing it from another; and by the oaths and the cries and the childish laughter with which they accompanied their examination, you would have thought, not only they were fingering the very gold, but were at sea with it, besides, in safety.", " \u201cThe thing is as clear as noonday,\u201d cried the squire. \u201cThis is the black-hearted hound's account-book. These crosses stand for the names of ships or towns that they sank or plundered. The sums are the scoundrel's share, and where he feared an ambiguity, you see he added something clearer. 'Offe Caraccas,' now; you see, here was some unhappy vessel boarded off that coast. God help the poor souls that manned her--coral long ago.\u201d \u201cRight!\u201d said the doctor. \u201cSee what it is to be a traveller. Right! And the amounts increase, you see, as he rose in rank.\u201d There was little else in the volume but a few bearings of places noted in the blank leaves towards the end and a table for reducing French, English, and Spanish moneys to a common value. \u201cThrifty man!\u201d cried the doctor. \u201cHe wasn't the one to be cheated.\u201d \u201cAnd now,\u201d said the squire, \u201cfor the other.\u201d The paper had been sealed in several places with a thimble by way of seal; the very thimble, perhaps, that I had found in the captain's pocket. The doctor opened the seals with great care, and there fell out the map of an island, with latitude and longitude, soundings, names of hills and bays and inlets, and every particular that would be needed to bring a ship to a safe anchorage upon its shores. It was about nine miles long and five across, shaped, you might say, like a fat dragon standing up, and had two fine land-locked harbours, and a hill in the centre part marked \u201cThe Spy-glass.\u201d There were several additions of a later date, but above all, three crosses of red ink--two on the north part of the island, one in the southwest--and beside this last, in the same red ink, and in a small, neat hand, very different from the captain's tottery characters, these words: \u201cBulk of treasure here.\u201d Over on the back the same hand had written this further information: Tall tree, Spy-glass shoulder, bearing a point to the N. of N.N.E."], "How does BillyBones die?": [" Both the squire and I returned the shot, but as we had nothing to aim at, it is probable we only wasted powder. Then we reloaded and turned our attention to poor Tom. The captain and Gray were already examining him, and I saw with half an eye that all was over. I believe the readiness of our return volley had scattered the mutineers once more, for we were suffered without further molestation to get the poor old gamekeeper hoisted over the stockade and carried, groaning and bleeding, into the log-house. Poor old fellow, he had not uttered one word of surprise, complaint, fear, or even acquiescence from the very beginning of our troubles till now, when we had laid him down in the log-house to die. He had lain like a Trojan behind his mattress in the gallery; he had followed every order silently, doggedly, and well; he was the oldest of our party by a score of years; and now, sullen, old, serviceable servant, it was he that was to die. The squire dropped down beside him on his knees and kissed his hand, crying like a child. \u201cBe I going, doctor?\u201d he asked. \u201cTom, my man,\u201d said I, \u201cyou're going home.\u201d \u201cI wish I had had a lick at them with the gun first,\u201d he replied. \u201cTom,\u201d said the squire, \u201csay you forgive me, won't you?\u201d \u201cWould that be respectful like, from me to you, squire?\u201d was the answer. \u201cHowsoever, so be it, amen!\u201d After a little while of silence, he said he thought somebody might read a prayer.", " If I die like a dog, I'll die in my dooty. You've killed Alan, have you? Kill me too, if you can. But I defies you.\u201d And with that, this brave fellow turned his back directly on the cook and set off walking for the beach. But he was not destined to go far. With a cry John seized the branch of a tree, whipped the crutch out of his armpit, and sent that uncouth missile hurtling through the air. It struck poor Tom, point foremost, and with stunning violence, right between the shoulders in the middle of his back. His hands flew up, he gave a sort of gasp, and fell. Whether he were injured much or little, none could ever tell. Like enough, to judge from the sound, his back was broken on the spot. But he had no time given him to recover. Silver, agile as a monkey even without leg or crutch, was on the top of him next moment and had twice buried his knife up to the hilt in that defenceless body. From my place of ambush, I could hear him pant aloud as he struck the blows. I do not know what it rightly is to faint, but I do know that for the next little while the whole world swam away from before me in a whirling mist; Silver and the birds, and the tall Spy-glass hilltop, going round and round and topsy-turvy before my eyes, and all manner of bells ringing and distant voices shouting in my ear. When I came again to myself the monster had pulled himself together, his crutch under his arm, his hat upon his head.", " It was tattooed in several places. \u201cHere's luck,\u201d \u201cA fair wind,\u201d and \u201cBilly Bones his fancy,\u201d were very neatly and clearly executed on the forearm; and up near the shoulder there was a sketch of a gallows and a man hanging from it--done, as I thought, with great spirit. \u201cProphetic,\u201d said the doctor, touching this picture with his finger. \u201cAnd now, Master Billy Bones, if that be your name, we'll have a look at the colour of your blood. Jim,\u201d he said, \u201care you afraid of blood?\u201d \u201cNo, sir,\u201d said I. \u201cWell, then,\u201d said he, \u201cyou hold the basin\u201d; and with that he took his lancet and opened a vein. A great deal of blood was taken before the captain opened his eyes and looked mistily about him. First he recognized the doctor with an unmistakable frown; then his glance fell upon me, and he looked relieved. But suddenly his colour changed, and he tried to raise himself, crying, \u201cWhere's Black Dog?\u201d \u201cThere is no Black Dog here,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cexcept what you have on your own back. You have been drinking rum; you have had a stroke, precisely as I told you; and I have just, very much against my own will, dragged you headforemost out of the grave. Now, Mr. Bones--\u201d \u201cThat's not my name,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cMuch I care,\u201d returned the doctor. \u201cIt's the name of a buccaneer of my acquaintance; and I call you by it for the sake of shortness, and what I have to say to you is this; one glass of rum won't kill you, but if you take one you'll take another and another, and I stake my wig if you don't break off short, you'll die--do you understand that?--die, and go to your own place, like the man in the Bible.", " I see you were smart when first I set my eyes on you, but this here gets away from me clean, it do.\u201d To all this, as may be well supposed, I made no answer. They had set me with my back against the wall, and I stood there, looking Silver in the face, pluckily enough, I hope, to all outward appearance, but with black despair in my heart. Silver took a whiff or two of his pipe with great composure and then ran on again. \u201cNow, you see, Jim, so be as you ARE here,\u201d says he, \u201cI'll give you a piece of my mind. I've always liked you, I have, for a lad of spirit, and the picter of my own self when I was young and handsome. I always wanted you to jine and take your share, and die a gentleman, and now, my cock, you've got to. Cap'n Smollett's a fine seaman, as I'll own up to any day, but stiff on discipline. 'Dooty is dooty,' says he, and right he is. Just you keep clear of the cap'n. The doctor himself is gone dead again you--'ungrateful scamp' was what he said; and the short and the long of the whole story is about here: you can't go back to your own lot, for they won't have you; and without you start a third ship's company all by yourself, which might be lonely, you'll have to jine with Cap'n Silver.\u201d So far so good. My friends, then, were still alive, and though I partly believed the truth of Silver's statement, that the cabin party were incensed at me for my desertion, I was more relieved than distressed by what I heard."], "What is the lastclue guiding the pirates to the treasure site?": [" I've got my piece o' news, and thanky to him for that; but it's over and done. I'll take him in a line when we go treasure-hunting, for we'll keep him like so much gold, in case of accidents, you mark, and in the meantime. Once we got the ship and treasure both and off to sea like jolly companions, why then we'll talk Mr. Hawkins over, we will, and we'll give him his share, to be sure, for all his kindness.\u201d It was no wonder the men were in a good humour now. For my part, I was horribly cast down. Should the scheme he had now sketched prove feasible, Silver, already doubly a traitor, would not hesitate to adopt it. He had still a foot in either camp, and there was no doubt he would prefer wealth and freedom with the pirates to a bare escape from hanging, which was the best he had to hope on our side. Nay, and even if things so fell out that he was forced to keep his faith with Dr. Livesey, even then what danger lay before us! What a moment that would be when the suspicions of his followers turned to certainty and he and I should have to fight for dear life--he a cripple and I a boy--against five strong and active seamen! Add to this double apprehension the mystery that still hung over the behaviour of my friends, their unexplained desertion of the stockade, their inexplicable cession of the chart, or harder still to understand, the doctor's last warning to Silver, \u201cLook out for squalls when you find it,\u201d and you will readily believe how little taste I found in my breakfast and with how uneasy a heart I set forth behind my captors on the quest for treasure.", " *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TREASURE ISLAND *** Produced by Judy Boss, John Hamm and David Widger TREASURE ISLAND by Robert Louis Stevenson TREASURE ISLAND To S.L.O., an American gentleman in accordance with whose classic taste the following narrative has been designed, it is now, in return for numerous delightful hours, and with the kindest wishes, dedicated by his affectionate friend, the author.

Only once we heard a gunshot a great way off and supposed them to be hunting. A council was held, and it was decided that we must desert them on the island--to the huge glee, I must say, of Ben Gunn, and with the strong approval of Gray. We left a good stock of powder and shot, the bulk of the salt goat, a few medicines, and some other necessaries, tools, clothing, a spare sail, a fathom or two of rope, and by the particular desire of the doctor, a handsome present of tobacco. That was about our last doing on the island. Before that, we had got the treasure stowed and had shipped enough water and the remainder of the goat meat in case of any distress; and at last, one fine morning, we weighed anchor, which was about all that we could manage, and stood out of North Inlet, the same colours flying that the captain had flown and fought under at the palisade. The three fellows must have been watching us closer than we thought for, as we soon had proved. For coming through the narrows, we had to lie very near the southern point, and there we saw all three of them kneeling together on a spit of sand, with their arms raised in supplication. It went to all our hearts, I think, to leave them in that wretched state; but we could not risk another mutiny; and to take them home for the gibbet would have been a cruel sort of kindness.", " But the great advantage of the coracle it certainly possessed, for it was exceedingly light and portable. Well, now that I had found the boat, you would have thought I had had enough of truantry for once, but in the meantime I had taken another notion and become so obstinately fond of it that I would have carried it out, I believe, in the teeth of Captain Smollett himself. This was to slip out under cover of the night, cut the HISPANIOLA adrift, and let her go ashore where she fancied. I had quite made up my mind that the mutineers, after their repulse of the morning, had nothing nearer their hearts than to up anchor and away to sea; this, I thought, it would be a fine thing to prevent, and now that I had seen how they left their watchmen unprovided with a boat, I thought it might be done with little risk. Down I sat to wait for darkness, and made a hearty meal of biscuit. It was a night out of ten thousand for my purpose. The fog had now buried all heaven. As the last rays of daylight dwindled and disappeared, absolute blackness settled down on Treasure Island. And when, at last, I shouldered the coracle and groped my way stumblingly out of the hollow where I had supped, there were but two points visible on the whole anchorage. One was the great fire on shore, by which the defeated pirates lay carousing in the swamp. The other, a mere blur of light upon the darkness, indicated the position of the anchored ship."], "What happensto Silver at the end of the novel?": [" Rapidly I described to him my adventures, and he heard me out in silence. \u201cThere is a kind of fate in this,\u201d he observed when I had done. \u201cEvery step, it's you that saves our lives; and do you suppose by any chance that we are going to let you lose yours? That would be a poor return, my boy. You found out the plot; you found Ben Gunn--the best deed that ever you did, or will do, though you live to ninety. Oh, by Jupiter, and talking of Ben Gunn! Why, this is the mischief in person. Silver!\u201d he cried. \u201cSilver! I'll give you a piece of advice,\u201d he continued as the cook drew near again; \u201cdon't you be in any great hurry after that treasure.\u201d \u201cWhy, sir, I do my possible, which that ain't,\u201d said Silver. \u201cI can only, asking your pardon, save my life and the boy's by seeking for that treasure; and you may lay to that.\u201d \u201cWell, Silver,\u201d replied the doctor, \u201cif that is so, I'll go one step further: look out for squalls when you find it.\u201d \u201cSir,\u201d said Silver, \u201cas between man and man, that's too much and too little. What you're after, why you left the block house, why you given me that there chart, I don't know, now, do I? And yet I done your bidding with my eyes shut and never a word of hope! But no, this here's too much. If you won't tell me what you mean plain out, just say so and I'll leave the helm.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said the doctor musingly; \u201cI've no right to say more; it's not my secret, you see, Silver, or, I give you my word, I'd tell it you.", " Now, however, when I had nothing else to do, I began to pay more heed. One I recognized for the coxswain's, Israel Hands, that had been Flint's gunner in former days. The other was, of course, my friend of the red night-cap. Both men were plainly the worse of drink, and they were still drinking, for even while I was listening, one of them, with a drunken cry, opened the stern window and threw out something, which I divined to be an empty bottle. But they were not only tipsy; it was plain that they were furiously angry. Oaths flew like hailstones, and every now and then there came forth such an explosion as I thought was sure to end in blows. But each time the quarrel passed off and the voices grumbled lower for a while, until the next crisis came and in its turn passed away without result. On shore, I could see the glow of the great camp-fire burning warmly through the shore-side trees. Someone was singing, a dull, old, droning sailor's song, with a droop and a quaver at the end of every verse, and seemingly no end to it at all but the patience of the singer. I had heard it on the voyage more than once and remembered these words: \u201cBut one man of her crew alive, What put to sea with seventy-five.\u201d And I thought it was a ditty rather too dolefully appropriate for a company that had met such cruel losses in the morning. But, indeed, from what I saw, all these buccaneers were as callous as the sea they sailed on.", " \u201cA Bible with a bit cut out!\u201d returned Silver derisively. \u201cNot it. It don't bind no more'n a ballad-book.\u201d \u201cDon't it, though?\u201d cried Dick with a sort of joy. \u201cWell, I reckon that's worth having too.\u201d \u201cHere, Jim--here's a cur'osity for you,\u201d said Silver, and he tossed me the paper. It was around about the size of a crown piece. One side was blank, for it had been the last leaf; the other contained a verse or two of Revelation--these words among the rest, which struck sharply home upon my mind: \u201cWithout are dogs and murderers.\u201d The printed side had been blackened with wood ash, which already began to come off and soil my fingers; on the blank side had been written with the same material the one word \u201cDepposed.\u201d I have that curiosity beside me at this moment, but not a trace of writing now remains beyond a single scratch, such as a man might make with his thumb-nail. That was the end of the night's business. Soon after, with a drink all round, we lay down to sleep, and the outside of Silver's vengeance was to put George Merry up for sentinel and threaten him with death if he should prove unfaithful. It was long ere I could close an eye, and heaven knows I had matter enough for thought in the man whom I had slain that afternoon, in my own most perilous position, and above all, in the remarkable game that I saw Silver now engaged upon--keeping the mutineers together with one hand and grasping with the other after every means, possible and impossible, to make his peace and save his miserable life.", " \u201cIt was him that knowed Black Dog.\u201d \u201cWell, and see here,\u201d added the sea-cook. \u201cI'll put another again to that, by thunder! For it was this same boy that faked the chart from Billy Bones. First and last, we've split upon Jim Hawkins!\u201d \u201cThen here goes!\u201d said Morgan with an oath. And he sprang up, drawing his knife as if he had been twenty. \u201cAvast, there!\u201d cried Silver. \u201cWho are you, Tom Morgan? Maybe you thought you was cap'n here, perhaps. By the powers, but I'll teach you better! Cross me, and you'll go where many a good man's gone before you, first and last, these thirty year back--some to the yard-arm, shiver my timbers, and some by the board, and all to feed the fishes. There's never a man looked me between the eyes and seen a good day a'terwards, Tom Morgan, you may lay to that.\u201d Morgan paused, but a hoarse murmur rose from the others. \u201cTom's right,\u201d said one. \u201cI stood hazing long enough from one,\u201d added another. \u201cI'll be hanged if I'll be hazed by you, John Silver.\u201d \u201cDid any of you gentlemen want to have it out with ME?\u201d roared Silver, bending far forward from his position on the keg, with his pipe still glowing in his right hand. \u201cPut a name on what you're at; you ain't dumb, I reckon. Him that wants shall get it. Have I lived this many years, and a son of a rum puncheon cock his hat athwart my hawse at the latter end of it? You know the way; you're all gentlemen o' fortune, by your account."], "What flag doesSmollett fly over the stockade?": [" A hail on the land side. \u201cSomebody hailing us,\u201d said Hunter, who was on guard. \u201cDoctor! Squire! Captain! Hullo, Hunter, is that you?\u201d came the cries. And I ran to the door in time to see Jim Hawkins, safe and sound, come climbing over the stockade. 19 Narrative Resumed by Jim Hawkins: The Garrison in the Stockade AS soon as Ben Gunn saw the colours he came to a halt, stopped me by the arm, and sat down. \u201cNow,\u201d said he, \u201cthere's your friends, sure enough.\u201d \u201cFar more likely it's the mutineers,\u201d I answered. \u201cThat!\u201d he cried. \u201cWhy, in a place like this, where nobody puts in but gen'lemen of fortune, Silver would fly the Jolly Roger, you don't make no doubt of that. No, that's your friends. There's been blows too, and I reckon your friends has had the best of it; and here they are ashore in the old stockade, as was made years and years ago by Flint. Ah, he was the man to have a headpiece, was Flint! Barring rum, his match were never seen. He were afraid of none, not he; on'y Silver--Silver was that genteel.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said I, \u201cthat may be so, and so be it; all the more reason that I should hurry on and join my friends.\u201d \u201cNay, mate,\u201d returned Ben, \u201cnot you. You're a good boy, or I'm mistook; but you're on'y a boy, all told. Now, Ben Gunn is fly. Rum wouldn't bring me there, where you're going--not rum wouldn't, till I see your born gen'leman and gets it on his word of honour. And you won't forget my words; 'A precious sight (that's what you'll say), a precious sight more confidence'--and then nips him.\u201d And he pinched me the third time with the same air of cleverness.", " \u201cAnd what do you want with your flag of truce?\u201d he cried. This time it was the other man who replied. \u201cCap'n Silver, sir, to come on board and make terms,\u201d he shouted. \u201cCap'n Silver! Don't know him. Who's he?\u201d cried the captain. And we could hear him adding to himself, \u201cCap'n, is it? My heart, and here's promotion!\u201d Long John answered for himself. \u201cMe, sir. These poor lads have chosen me cap'n, after your desertion, sir\u201d--laying a particular emphasis upon the word \u201cdesertion.\u201d \u201cWe're willing to submit, if we can come to terms, and no bones about it. All I ask is your word, Cap'n Smollett, to let me safe and sound out of this here stockade, and one minute to get out o' shot before a gun is fired.\u201d \u201cMy man,\u201d said Captain Smollett, \u201cI have not the slightest desire to talk to you. If you wish to talk to me, you can come, that's all. If there's any treachery, it'll be on your side, and the Lord help you.\u201d \u201cThat's enough, cap'n,\u201d shouted Long John cheerily. \u201cA word from you's enough. I know a gentleman, and you may lay to that.\u201d We could see the man who carried the flag of truce attempting to hold Silver back. Nor was that wonderful, seeing how cavalier had been the captain's answer. But Silver laughed at him aloud and slapped him on the back as if the idea of alarm had been absurd. Then he advanced to the stockade, threw over his crutch, got a leg up, and with great vigour and skill succeeded in surmounting the fence and dropping safely to the other side.", " \u201cFlag of truce!\u201d I heard someone say; and then, immediately after, with a cry of surprise, \u201cSilver himself!\u201d And at that, up I jumped, and rubbing my eyes, ran to a loophole in the wall. 20 Silver's Embassy SURE enough, there were two men just outside the stockade, one of them waving a white cloth, the other, no less a person than Silver himself, standing placidly by. It was still quite early, and the coldest morning that I think I ever was abroad in--a chill that pierced into the marrow. The sky was bright and cloudless overhead, and the tops of the trees shone rosily in the sun. But where Silver stood with his lieutenant, all was still in shadow, and they waded knee-deep in a low white vapour that had crawled during the night out of the morass. The chill and the vapour taken together told a poor tale of the island. It was plainly a damp, feverish, unhealthy spot. \u201cKeep indoors, men,\u201d said the captain. \u201cTen to one this is a trick.\u201d Then he hailed the buccaneer. \u201cWho goes? Stand, or we fire.\u201d \u201cFlag of truce,\u201d cried Silver. The captain was in the porch, keeping himself carefully out of the way of a treacherous shot, should any be intended. He turned and spoke to us, \u201cDoctor's watch on the lookout. Dr. Livesey take the north side, if you please; Jim, the east; Gray, west. The watch below, all hands to load muskets. Lively, men, and careful.\u201d And then he turned again to the mutineers.", " But towards the end of the bombardment, though still I durst not venture in the direction of the stockade, where the balls fell oftenest, I had begun, in a manner, to pluck up my heart again, and after a long detour to the east, crept down among the shore-side trees. The sun had just set, the sea breeze was rustling and tumbling in the woods and ruffling the grey surface of the anchorage; the tide, too, was far out, and great tracts of sand lay uncovered; the air, after the heat of the day, chilled me through my jacket. The HISPANIOLA still lay where she had anchored; but, sure enough, there was the Jolly Roger--the black flag of piracy--flying from her peak. Even as I looked, there came another red flash and another report that sent the echoes clattering, and one more round-shot whistled through the air. It was the last of the cannonade. I lay for some time watching the bustle which succeeded the attack. Men were demolishing something with axes on the beach near the stockade--the poor jolly-boat, I afterwards discovered. Away, near the mouth of the river, a great fire was glowing among the trees, and between that point and the ship one of the gigs kept coming and going, the men, whom I had seen so gloomy, shouting at the oars like children. But there was a sound in their voices which suggested rum. At length I thought I might return towards the stockade. I was pretty far down on the low, sandy spit that encloses the anchorage to the east, and is joined at half-water to Skeleton Island; and now, as I rose to my feet, I saw, some distance further down the spit and rising from among low bushes, an isolated rock, pretty high, and peculiarly white in colour."], "In what time period does the novel take place?": [" But when they saw Redruth waiting for them in the sparred galley, they went about ship at once, and a head popped out again on deck. \u201cDown, dog!\u201d cries the captain. And the head popped back again; and we heard no more, for the time, of these six very faint-hearted seamen. By this time, tumbling things in as they came, we had the jolly-boat loaded as much as we dared. Joyce and I got out through the stern-port, and we made for shore again as fast as oars could take us. This second trip fairly aroused the watchers along shore. \u201cLillibullero\u201d was dropped again; and just before we lost sight of them behind the little point, one of them whipped ashore and disappeared. I had half a mind to change my plan and destroy their boats, but I feared that Silver and the others might be close at hand, and all might very well be lost by trying for too much. We had soon touched land in the same place as before and set to provision the block house. All three made the first journey, heavily laden, and tossed our stores over the palisade. Then, leaving Joyce to guard them--one man, to be sure, but with half a dozen muskets--Hunter and I returned to the jolly-boat and loaded ourselves once more. So we proceeded without pausing to take breath, till the whole cargo was bestowed, when the two servants took up their position in the block house, and I, with all my power, sculled back to the HISPANIOLA. That we should have risked a second boat load seems more daring than it really was.", " When we were about half-way through, I suddenly put my hand upon her arm, for I had heard in the silent frosty air a sound that brought my heart into my mouth--the tap-tapping of the blind man's stick upon the frozen road. It drew nearer and nearer, while we sat holding our breath. Then it struck sharp on the inn door, and then we could hear the handle being turned and the bolt rattling as the wretched being tried to enter; and then there was a long time of silence both within and without. At last the tapping recommenced, and, to our indescribable joy and gratitude, died slowly away again until it ceased to be heard. \u201cMother,\u201d said I, \u201ctake the whole and let's be going,\u201d for I was sure the bolted door must have seemed suspicious and would bring the whole hornet's nest about our ears, though how thankful I was that I had bolted it, none could tell who had never met that terrible blind man. But my mother, frightened as she was, would not consent to take a fraction more than was due to her and was obstinately unwilling to be content with less. It was not yet seven, she said, by a long way; she knew her rights and she would have them; and she was still arguing with me when a little low whistle sounded a good way off upon the hill. That was enough, and more than enough, for both of us. \u201cI'll take what I have,\u201d she said, jumping to her feet. \u201cAnd I'll take this to square the count,\u201d said I, picking up the oilskin packet.", " \u201cSee if that's the place.\u201d Long John's eyes burned in his head as he took the chart, but by the fresh look of the paper I knew he was doomed to disappointment. This was not the map we found in Billy Bones's chest, but an accurate copy, complete in all things--names and heights and soundings--with the single exception of the red crosses and the written notes. Sharp as must have been his annoyance, Silver had the strength of mind to hide it. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d said he, \u201cthis is the spot, to be sure, and very prettily drawed out. Who might have done that, I wonder? The pirates were too ignorant, I reckon. Aye, here it is: 'Capt. Kidd's Anchorage'--just the name my shipmate called it.

Leastways, if such was your intention as to enter and careen, and there ain't no better place for that in these waters.\u201d \u201cThank you, my man,\u201d says Captain Smollett. \u201cI'll ask you later on to give us a help. You may go.\u201d I was surprised at the coolness with which John avowed his knowledge of the island, and I own I was half-frightened when I saw him drawing nearer to myself. He did not know, to be sure, that I had overheard his council from the apple barrel, and yet I had by this time taken such a horror of his cruelty, duplicity, and power that I could scarce conceal a shudder when he laid his hand upon my arm.", " In the second place, the ebb was now making--a strong rippling current running westward through the basin, and then south'ard and seaward down the straits by which we had entered in the morning. Even the ripples were a danger to our overloaded craft, but the worst of it was that we were swept out of our true course and away from our proper landing-place behind the point. If we let the current have its way we should come ashore beside the gigs, where the pirates might appear at any moment. \u201cI cannot keep her head for the stockade, sir,\u201d said I to the captain. I was steering, while he and Redruth, two fresh men, were at the oars. \u201cThe tide keeps washing her down. Could you pull a little stronger?\u201d \u201cNot without swamping the boat,\u201d said he. \u201cYou must bear up, sir, if you please--bear up until you see you're gaining.\u201d I tried and found by experiment that the tide kept sweeping us westward until I had laid her head due east, or just about right angles to the way we ought to go. \u201cWe'll never get ashore at this rate,\u201d said I. \u201cIf it's the only course that we can lie, sir, we must even lie it,\u201d returned the captain. \u201cWe must keep upstream. You see, sir,\u201d he went on, \u201cif once we dropped to leeward of the landing-place, it's hard to say where we should get ashore, besides the chance of being boarded by the gigs; whereas, the way we go the current must slacken, and then we can dodge back along the shore.\u201d \u201cThe current's less a'ready, sir,\u201d said the man Gray, who was sitting in the fore-sheets; \u201cyou can ease her off a bit.\u201d \u201cThank you, my man,\u201d said I, quite as if nothing had happened, for we had all quietly made up our minds to treat him like one of ourselves."], "What pirate symbol of guilt do Billy Bones and Long John Silver receive?": [" Or cut 'em down like that much pork?

A great deal of blood was taken before the captain opened his eyes and looked mistily about him. First he recognized the doctor with an unmistakable frown; then his glance fell upon me, and he looked relieved. But suddenly his colour changed, and he tried to raise himself, crying, \u201cWhere's Black Dog?\u201d \u201cThere is no Black Dog here,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cexcept what you have on your own back.

I heard Dick begin to rise, and then someone seemingly stopped him, and the voice of Hands exclaimed, \u201cOh, stow that! Don't you get sucking of that bilge, John. Let's have a go of the rum.\u201d \u201cDick,\u201d said Silver, \u201cI trust you. I've a gauge on the keg, mind.", " One fine day up went the signal, and here come Flint by himself in a little boat, and his head done up in a blue scarf. The sun was getting up, and mortal white he looked about the cutwater. But, there he was, you mind, and the six all dead--dead and buried. How he done it, not a man aboard us could make out. It was battle, murder, and sudden death, leastways--him against six. Billy Bones was the mate; Long John, he was quartermaster; and they asked him where the treasure was. 'Ah,' says he, 'you can go ashore, if you like, and stay,' he says; 'but as for the ship, she'll beat up for more, by thunder!' That's what he said. \u201cWell, I was in another ship three years back, and we sighted this island. 'Boys,' said I, 'here's Flint's treasure; let's land and find it.' The cap'n was displeased at that, but my messmates were all of a mind and landed. Twelve days they looked for it, and every day they had the worse word for me, until one fine morning all hands went aboard. 'As for you, Benjamin Gunn,' says they, 'here's a musket,' they says, 'and a spade, and pick-axe. You can stay here and find Flint's money for yourself,' they says. \u201cWell, Jim, three years have I been here, and not a bite of Christian diet from that day to this. But now, you look here; look at me. Do I look like a man before the mast? No, says you. Nor I weren't, neither, I says.\u201d And with that he winked and pinched me hard.", " But I see you was the right sort. I says to myself, you stand by Hawkins, John, and Hawkins'll stand by you. You're his last card, and by the living thunder, John, he's yours! Back to back, says I. You save your witness, and he'll save your neck!\u201d I began dimly to understand. \u201cYou mean all's lost?\u201d I asked. \u201cAye, by gum, I do!\u201d he answered. \u201cShip gone, neck gone--that's the size of it. Once I looked into that bay, Jim Hawkins, and seen no schooner--well, I'm tough, but I gave out. As for that lot and their council, mark me, they're outright fools and cowards. I'll save your life--if so be as I can--from them. But, see here, Jim--tit for tat--you save Long John from swinging.\u201d I was bewildered; it seemed a thing so hopeless he was asking--he, the old buccaneer, the ringleader throughout. \u201cWhat I can do, that I'll do,\u201d I said. \u201cIt's a bargain!\u201d cried Long John. \u201cYou speak up plucky, and by thunder, I've a chance!\u201d He hobbled to the torch, where it stood propped among the firewood, and took a fresh light to his pipe. \u201cUnderstand me, Jim,\u201d he said, returning. \u201cI've a head on my shoulders, I have. I'm on squire's side now. I know you've got that ship safe somewheres. How you done it, I don't know, but safe it is. I guess Hands and O'Brien turned soft. I never much believed in neither of THEM. Now you mark me. I ask no questions, nor I won't let others. I know when a game's up, I do; and I know a lad that's staunch.", " It was tattooed in several places. \u201cHere's luck,\u201d \u201cA fair wind,\u201d and \u201cBilly Bones his fancy,\u201d were very neatly and clearly executed on the forearm; and up near the shoulder there was a sketch of a gallows and a man hanging from it--done, as I thought, with great spirit. \u201cProphetic,\u201d said the doctor, touching this picture with his finger. \u201cAnd now, Master Billy Bones, if that be your name, we'll have a look at the colour of your blood. Jim,\u201d he said, \u201care you afraid of blood?\u201d \u201cNo, sir,\u201d said I. \u201cWell, then,\u201d said he, \u201cyou hold the basin\u201d; and with that he took his lancet and opened a vein. A great deal of blood was taken before the captain opened his eyes and looked mistily about him. First he recognized the doctor with an unmistakable frown; then his glance fell upon me, and he looked relieved. But suddenly his colour changed, and he tried to raise himself, crying, \u201cWhere's Black Dog?\u201d \u201cThere is no Black Dog here,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cexcept what you have on your own back. You have been drinking rum; you have had a stroke, precisely as I told you; and I have just, very much against my own will, dragged you headforemost out of the grave. Now, Mr. Bones--\u201d \u201cThat's not my name,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cMuch I care,\u201d returned the doctor. \u201cIt's the name of a buccaneer of my acquaintance; and I call you by it for the sake of shortness, and what I have to say to you is this; one glass of rum won't kill you, but if you take one you'll take another and another, and I stake my wig if you don't break off short, you'll die--do you understand that?--die, and go to your own place, like the man in the Bible."], "What do Silver, Jim, and the crew find in the spot where the map marks treasure?": [" \u201cOne more,\u201d said the captain. \u201cThere's been too much blabbing already.\u201d \u201cFar too much,\u201d agreed the doctor. \u201cI'll tell you what I've heard myself,\u201d continued Captain Smollett: \u201cthat you have a map of an island, that there's crosses on the map to show where treasure is, and that the island lies--\u201d And then he named the latitude and longitude exactly. \u201cI never told that,\u201d cried the squire, \u201cto a soul!\u201d \u201cThe hands know it, sir,\u201d returned the captain. \u201cLivesey, that must have been you or Hawkins,\u201d cried the squire. \u201cIt doesn't much matter who it was,\u201d replied the doctor. And I could see that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to Mr. Trelawney's protestations. Neither did I, to be sure, he was so loose a talker; yet in this case I believe he was really right and that nobody had told the situation of the island. \u201cWell, gentlemen,\u201d continued the captain, \u201cI don't know who has this map; but I make it a point, it shall be kept secret even from me and Mr. Arrow. Otherwise I would ask you to let me resign.\u201d \u201cI see,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cYou wish us to keep this matter dark and to make a garrison of the stern part of the ship, manned with my friend's own people, and provided with all the arms and powder on board. In other words, you fear a mutiny.\u201d \u201cSir,\u201d said Captain Smollett, \u201cwith no intention to take offence, I deny your right to put words into my mouth. No captain, sir, would be justified in going to sea at all if he had ground enough to say that.", " \u201cThere! Wot did I say? No good'll come o' that, I said.\u201d \u201cWell, you've about fixed it now, among you,\u201d continued Silver. \u201cYou'll all swing now, I reckon. What soft-headed lubber had a Bible?\u201d \u201cIt was Dick,\u201d said one. \u201cDick, was it? Then Dick can get to prayers,\u201d said Silver. \u201cHe's seen his slice of luck, has Dick, and you may lay to that.\u201d But here the long man with the yellow eyes struck in. \u201cBelay that talk, John Silver,\u201d he said. \u201cThis crew has tipped you the black spot in full council, as in dooty bound; just you turn it over, as in dooty bound, and see what's wrote there. Then you can talk.\u201d \u201cThanky, George,\u201d replied the sea-cook. \u201cYou always was brisk for business, and has the rules by heart, George, as I'm pleased to see. Well, what is it, anyway? Ah! 'Deposed'--that's it, is it? Very pretty wrote, to be sure; like print, I swear. Your hand o' write, George? Why, you was gettin' quite a leadin' man in this here crew. You'll be cap'n next, I shouldn't wonder. Just oblige me with that torch again, will you? This pipe don't draw.\u201d \u201cCome, now,\u201d said George, \u201cyou don't fool this crew no more. You're a funny man, by your account; but you're over now, and you'll maybe step down off that barrel and help vote.\u201d \u201cI thought you said you knowed the rules,\u201d returned Silver contemptuously. \u201cLeastways, if you don't, I do; and I wait here--and I'm still your cap'n, mind--till you outs with your grievances and I reply; in the meantime, your black spot ain't worth a biscuit.", " Even at that exciting moment it carried me back to the old Admiral Benbow in a second, and I seemed to hear the voice of the captain piping in the chorus. But soon the anchor was short up; soon it was hanging dripping at the bows; soon the sails began to draw, and the land and shipping to flit by on either side; and before I could lie down to snatch an hour of slumber the HISPANIOLA had begun her voyage to the Isle of Treasure. I am not going to relate that voyage in detail. It was fairly prosperous. The ship proved to be a good ship, the crew were capable seamen, and the captain thoroughly understood his business. But before we came the length of Treasure Island, two or three things had happened which require to be known. Mr. Arrow, first of all, turned out even worse than the captain had feared. He had no command among the men, and people did what they pleased with him. But that was by no means the worst of it, for after a day or two at sea he began to appear on deck with hazy eye, red cheeks, stuttering tongue, and other marks of drunkenness. Time after time he was ordered below in disgrace. Sometimes he fell and cut himself; sometimes he lay all day long in his little bunk at one side of the companion; sometimes for a day or two he would be almost sober and attend to his work at least passably. In the meantime, we could never make out where he got the drink. That was the ship's mystery.", " But I'll go as far with you as I dare go, and a step beyond, for I'll have my wig sorted by the captain or I'm mistaken! And first, I'll give you a bit of hope; Silver, if we both get alive out of this wolf-trap, I'll do my best to save you, short of perjury.\u201d Silver's face was radiant. \u201cYou couldn't say more, I'm sure, sir, not if you was my mother,\u201d he cried. \u201cWell, that's my first concession,\u201d added the doctor. \u201cMy second is a piece of advice: keep the boy close beside you, and when you need help, halloo. I'm off to seek it for you, and that itself will show you if I speak at random. Good-bye, Jim.\u201d And Dr. Livesey shook hands with me through the stockade, nodded to Silver, and set off at a brisk pace into the wood. 31 The Treasure-hunt--Flint's Pointer \u201cJIM,\u201d said Silver when we were alone, \u201cif I saved your life, you saved mine; and I'll not forget it. I seen the doctor waving you to run for it--with the tail of my eye, I did; and I seen you say no, as plain as hearing. Jim, that's one to you. This is the first glint of hope I had since the attack failed, and I owe it you. And now, Jim, we're to go in for this here treasure-hunting, with sealed orders too, and I don't like it; and you and me must stick close, back to back like, and we'll save our necks in spite o' fate and fortune.\u201d Just then a man hailed us from the fire that breakfast was ready, and we were soon seated here and there about the sand over biscuit and fried junk."], "What happens to the mutineers at the end of the novel?": [" \u201cCome, that's better. Five against three leaves us four to nine. That's better odds than we had at starting. We were seven to nineteen then, or thought we were, and that's as bad to bear.\u201d * *The mutineers were soon only eight in number, for the man shot by Mr. Trelawney on board the schooner died that same evening of his wound. But this was, of course, not known till after by the faithful party. PART FIVE--My Sea Adventure 22 How My Sea Adventure Began THERE was no return of the mutineers--not so much as another shot out of the woods. They had \u201cgot their rations for that day,\u201d as the captain put it, and we had the place to ourselves and a quiet time to overhaul the wounded and get dinner. Squire and I cooked outside in spite of the danger, and even outside we could hardly tell what we were at, for horror of the loud groans that reached us from the doctor's patients. Out of the eight men who had fallen in the action, only three still breathed--that one of the pirates who had been shot at the loophole, Hunter, and Captain Smollett; and of these, the first two were as good as dead; the mutineer indeed died under the doctor's knife, and Hunter, do what we could, never recovered consciousness in this world. He lingered all day, breathing loudly like the old buccaneer at home in his apoplectic fit, but the bones of his chest had been crushed by the blow and his skull fractured in falling, and some time in the following night, without sign or sound, he went to his Maker.", " English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Georges, and Louises, doubloons and double guineas and moidores and sequins, the pictures of all the kings of Europe for the last hundred years, strange Oriental pieces stamped with what looked like wisps of string or bits of spider's web, round pieces and square pieces, and pieces bored through the middle, as if to wear them round your neck--nearly every variety of money in the world must, I think, have found a place in that collection; and for number, I am sure they were like autumn leaves, so that my back ached with stooping and my fingers with sorting them out. Day after day this work went on; by every evening a fortune had been stowed aboard, but there was another fortune waiting for the morrow; and all this time we heard nothing of the three surviving mutineers. At last--I think it was on the third night--the doctor and I were strolling on the shoulder of the hill where it overlooks the lowlands of the isle, when, from out the thick darkness below, the wind brought us a noise between shrieking and singing. It was only a snatch that reached our ears, followed by the former silence. \u201cHeaven forgive them,\u201d said the doctor; \u201c'tis the mutineers!\u201d \u201cAll drunk, sir,\u201d struck in the voice of Silver from behind us. Silver, I should say, was allowed his entire liberty, and in spite of daily rebuffs, seemed to regard himself once more as quite a privileged and friendly dependent.", " Now, however, when I had nothing else to do, I began to pay more heed. One I recognized for the coxswain's, Israel Hands, that had been Flint's gunner in former days. The other was, of course, my friend of the red night-cap. Both men were plainly the worse of drink, and they were still drinking, for even while I was listening, one of them, with a drunken cry, opened the stern window and threw out something, which I divined to be an empty bottle. But they were not only tipsy; it was plain that they were furiously angry. Oaths flew like hailstones, and every now and then there came forth such an explosion as I thought was sure to end in blows. But each time the quarrel passed off and the voices grumbled lower for a while, until the next crisis came and in its turn passed away without result. On shore, I could see the glow of the great camp-fire burning warmly through the shore-side trees. Someone was singing, a dull, old, droning sailor's song, with a droop and a quaver at the end of every verse, and seemingly no end to it at all but the patience of the singer. I had heard it on the voyage more than once and remembered these words: \u201cBut one man of her crew alive, What put to sea with seventy-five.\u201d And I thought it was a ditty rather too dolefully appropriate for a company that had met such cruel losses in the morning. But, indeed, from what I saw, all these buccaneers were as callous as the sea they sailed on.", " We had no ricochet to fear, and though one popped in through the roof of the log-house and out again through the floor, we soon got used to that sort of horse-play and minded it no more than cricket. \u201cThere is one good thing about all this,\u201d observed the captain; \u201cthe wood in front of us is likely clear. The ebb has made a good while; our stores should be uncovered. Volunteers to go and bring in pork.\u201d Gray and Hunter were the first to come forward. Well armed, they stole out of the stockade, but it proved a useless mission. The mutineers were bolder than we fancied or they put more trust in Israel's gunnery. For four or five of them were busy carrying off our stores and wading out with them to one of the gigs that lay close by, pulling an oar or so to hold her steady against the current. Silver was in the stern-sheets in command; and every man of them was now provided with a musket from some secret magazine of their own. The captain sat down to his log, and here is the beginning of the entry: Alexander Smollett, master; David Livesey, ship's doctor; Abraham Gray, carpenter's mate; John Trelawney, owner; John Hunter and Richard Joyce, owner's servants, landsmen--being all that is left faithful of the ship's company--with stores for ten days at short rations, came ashore this day and flew British colours on the log-house in Treasure Island. Thomas Redruth, owner's servant, landsman, shot by the mutineers; James Hawkins, cabin-boy-- And at the same time, I was wondering over poor Jim Hawkins' fate."], "Who narrates almost the entire novel?": [" There I lay on my elbows in the most trying attitude, and every now and again gave a weak stroke or two to turn her head to shore. It was very tiring and slow work, yet I did visibly gain ground; and as we drew near the Cape of the Woods, though I saw I must infallibly miss that point, I had still made some hundred yards of easting. I was, indeed, close in. I could see the cool green tree-tops swaying together in the breeze, and I felt sure I should make the next promontory without fail. It was high time, for I now began to be tortured with thirst. The glow of the sun from above, its thousandfold reflection from the waves, the sea-water that fell and dried upon me, caking my very lips with salt, combined to make my throat burn and my brain ache. The sight of the trees so near at hand had almost made me sick with longing, but the current had soon carried me past the point, and as the next reach of sea opened out, I beheld a sight that changed the nature of my thoughts. Right in front of me, not half a mile away, I beheld the HISPANIOLA under sail. I made sure, of course, that I should be taken; but I was so distressed for want of water that I scarce knew whether to be glad or sorry at the thought, and long before I had come to a conclusion, surprise had taken entire possession of my mind and I could do nothing but stare and wonder. The HISPANIOLA was under her main-sail and two jibs, and the beautiful white canvas shone in the sun like snow or silver.", " They had lit a fire fit to roast an ox, and it was now grown so hot that they could only approach it from the windward, and even there not without precaution. In the same wasteful spirit, they had cooked, I suppose, three times more than we could eat; and one of them, with an empty laugh, threw what was left into the fire, which blazed and roared again over this unusual fuel. I never in my life saw men so careless of the morrow; hand to mouth is the only word that can describe their way of doing; and what with wasted food and sleeping sentries, though they were bold enough for a brush and be done with it, I could see their entire unfitness for anything like a prolonged campaign. Even Silver, eating away, with Captain Flint upon his shoulder, had not a word of blame for their recklessness. And this the more surprised me, for I thought he had never shown himself so cunning as he did then. \u201cAye, mates,\u201d said he, \u201cit's lucky you have Barbecue to think for you with this here head. I got what I wanted, I did. Sure enough, they have the ship. Where they have it, I don't know yet; but once we hit the treasure, we'll have to jump about and find out. And then, mates, us that has the boats, I reckon, has the upper hand.\u201d Thus he kept running on, with his mouth full of the hot bacon; thus he restored their hope and confidence, and, I more than suspect, repaired his own at the same time. \u201cAs for hostage,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat's his last talk, I guess, with them he loves so dear.", " English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Georges, and Louises, doubloons and double guineas and moidores and sequins, the pictures of all the kings of Europe for the last hundred years, strange Oriental pieces stamped with what looked like wisps of string or bits of spider's web, round pieces and square pieces, and pieces bored through the middle, as if to wear them round your neck--nearly every variety of money in the world must, I think, have found a place in that collection; and for number, I am sure they were like autumn leaves, so that my back ached with stooping and my fingers with sorting them out.

We were both of us capsized in a second, and both of us rolled, almost together, into the scuppers, the dead red-cap, with his arms still spread out, tumbling stiffly after us. So near were we, indeed, that my head came against the coxswain's foot with a crack that made my teeth rattle. Blow and all, I was the first afoot again, for Hands had got involved with the dead body. The sudden canting of the ship had made the deck no place for running on; I had to find some new way of escape, and that upon the instant, for my foe was almost touching me. Quick as thought, I sprang into the mizzen shrouds, rattled up hand over hand, and did not draw a breath till I was seated on the cross-trees. I had been saved by being prompt; the dirk had struck not half a foot below me as I pursued my upward flight; and there stood Israel Hands with his mouth open and his face upturned to mine, a perfect statue of surprise and disappointment. Now that I had a moment to myself, I lost no time in changing the priming of my pistol, and then, having one ready for service, and to make assurance doubly sure, I proceeded to draw the load of the other and recharge it afresh from the beginning."], "On what pirate crew did Billy Bones once serve?": [" It was tattooed in several places. \u201cHere's luck,\u201d \u201cA fair wind,\u201d and \u201cBilly Bones his fancy,\u201d were very neatly and clearly executed on the forearm; and up near the shoulder there was a sketch of a gallows and a man hanging from it--done, as I thought, with great spirit. \u201cProphetic,\u201d said the doctor, touching this picture with his finger. \u201cAnd now, Master Billy Bones, if that be your name, we'll have a look at the colour of your blood.

Six they were, and six are we; and bones is what they are now.\u201d \u201cI saw him dead with these here deadlights,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cBilly took me in. There he laid, with penny-pieces on his eyes.\u201d \u201cDead--aye, sure enough he's dead and gone below,\u201d said the fellow with the bandage; \u201cbut if ever sperrit walked, it would be Flint's.", " The squire and I were both peering over his shoulder as he opened it, for Dr. Livesey had kindly motioned me to come round from the side-table, where I had been eating, to enjoy the sport of the search. On the first page there were only some scraps of writing, such as a man with a pen in his hand might make for idleness or practice. One was the same as the tattoo mark, \u201cBilly Bones his fancy\u201d; then there was \u201cMr. W. Bones, mate,\u201d \u201cNo more rum,\u201d \u201cOff Palm Key he got itt,\u201d and some other snatches, mostly single words and unintelligible. I could not help wondering who it was that had \u201cgot itt,\u201d and what \u201citt\u201d was that he got. A knife in his back as like as not. \u201cNot much instruction there,\u201d said Dr. Livesey as he passed on. The next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious series of entries. There was a date at one end of the line and at the other a sum of money, as in common account-books, but instead of explanatory writing, only a varying number of crosses between the two. On the 12th of June, 1745, for instance, a sum of seventy pounds had plainly become due to someone, and there was nothing but six crosses to explain the cause. In a few cases, to be sure, the name of a place would be added, as \u201cOffe Caraccas,\u201d or a mere entry of latitude and longitude, as \u201c62o 17' 20\u201d, 19o 2' 40\u201d.\u201d The record lasted over nearly twenty years, the amount of the separate entries growing larger as time went on, and at the end a grand total had been made out after five or six wrong additions, and these words appended, \u201cBones, his pile.\u201d \u201cI can't make head or tail of this,\u201d said Dr. Livesey."], "Despite their competence and reliability, what does Jim not find Dr. Livesey and Captain Smollett to be?": [" I don't like this cruise; I don't like the men; and I don't like my officer. That's short and sweet.\u201d \u201cPerhaps, sir, you don't like the ship?\u201d inquired the squire, very angry, as I could see. \u201cI can't speak as to that, sir, not having seen her tried,\u201d said the captain. \u201cShe seems a clever craft; more I can't say.\u201d \u201cPossibly, sir, you may not like your employer, either?\u201d says the squire. But here Dr. Livesey cut in. \u201cStay a bit,\u201d said he, \u201cstay a bit. No use of such questions as that but to produce ill feeling. The captain has said too much or he has said too little, and I'm bound to say that I require an explanation of his words. You don't, you say, like this cruise. Now, why?\u201d \u201cI was engaged, sir, on what we call sealed orders, to sail this ship for that gentleman where he should bid me,\u201d said the captain. \u201cSo far so good. But now I find that every man before the mast knows more than I do. I don't call that fair, now, do you?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Dr. Livesey, \u201cI don't.\u201d \u201cNext,\u201d said the captain, \u201cI learn we are going after treasure--hear it from my own hands, mind you. Now, treasure is ticklish work; I don't like treasure voyages on any account, and I don't like them, above all, when they are secret and when (begging your pardon, Mr. Trelawney) the secret has been told to the parrot.\u201d \u201cSilver's parrot?\u201d asked the squire. \u201cIt's a way of speaking,\u201d said the captain. \u201cBlabbed, I mean. It's my belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about, but I'll tell you my way of it--life or death, and a close run.\u201d \u201cThat is all clear, and, I dare say, true enough,\u201d replied Dr. Livesey.", " \u201cAh,\u201d says he, \u201cthis here is a sweet spot, this island--a sweet spot for a lad to get ashore on. You'll bathe, and you'll climb trees, and you'll hunt goats, you will; and you'll get aloft on them hills like a goat yourself. Why, it makes me young again. I was going to forget my timber leg, I was. It's a pleasant thing to be young and have ten toes, and you may lay to that. When you want to go a bit of exploring, you just ask old John, and he'll put up a snack for you to take along.\u201d And clapping me in the friendliest way upon the shoulder, he hobbled off forward and went below. Captain Smollett, the squire, and Dr. Livesey were talking together on the quarter-deck, and anxious as I was to tell them my story, I durst not interrupt them openly. While I was still casting about in my thoughts to find some probable excuse, Dr. Livesey called me to his side. He had left his pipe below, and being a slave to tobacco, had meant that I should fetch it; but as soon as I was near enough to speak and not to be overheard, I broke immediately, \u201cDoctor, let me speak. Get the captain and squire down to the cabin, and then make some pretence to send for me. I have terrible news.\u201d The doctor changed countenance a little, but next moment he was master of himself. \u201cThank you, Jim,\u201d said he quite loudly, \u201cthat was all I wanted to know,\u201d as if he had asked me a question. And with that he turned on his heel and rejoined the other two.", " \u201cWell, squire,\u201d said Dr. Livesey, \u201cI don't put much faith in your discoveries, as a general thing; but I will say this, John Silver suits me.\u201d \u201cThe man's a perfect trump,\u201d declared the squire. \u201cAnd now,\u201d added the doctor, \u201cJim may come on board with us, may he not?\u201d \u201cTo be sure he may,\u201d says squire. \u201cTake your hat, Hawkins, and we'll see the ship.\u201d 9 Powder and Arms THE HISPANIOLA lay some way out, and we went under the figureheads and round the sterns of many other ships, and their cables sometimes grated underneath our keel, and sometimes swung above us. At last, however, we got alongside, and were met and saluted as we stepped aboard by the mate, Mr. Arrow, a brown old sailor with earrings in his ears and a squint. He and the squire were very thick and friendly, but I soon observed that things were not the same between Mr. Trelawney and the captain. This last was a sharp-looking man who seemed angry with everything on board and was soon to tell us why, for we had hardly got down into the cabin when a sailor followed us. \u201cCaptain Smollett, sir, axing to speak with you,\u201d said he. \u201cI am always at the captain's orders. Show him in,\u201d said the squire. The captain, who was close behind his messenger, entered at once and shut the door behind him. \u201cWell, Captain Smollett, what have you to say? All well, I hope; all shipshape and seaworthy?\u201d \u201cWell, sir,\u201d said the captain, \u201cbetter speak plain, I believe, even at the risk of offence.", " So the weeks passed on, till one fine day there came a letter addressed to Dr. Livesey, with this addition, \u201cTo be opened, in the case of his absence, by Tom Redruth or young Hawkins.\u201d Obeying this order, we found, or rather I found--for the gamekeeper was a poor hand at reading anything but print--the following important news: Old Anchor Inn, Bristol, March 1, 17-- Dear Livesey--As I do not know whether you are at the hall or still in London, I send this in double to both places. The ship is bought and fitted. She lies at anchor, ready for sea. You never imagined a sweeter schooner--a child might sail her--two hundred tons; name, HISPANIOLA. I got her through my old friend, Blandly, who has proved himself throughout the most surprising trump. The admirable fellow literally slaved in my interest, and so, I may say, did everyone in Bristol, as soon as they got wind of the port we sailed for--treasure, I mean. \u201cRedruth,\u201d said I, interrupting the letter, \u201cDr. Livesey will not like that. The squire has been talking, after all.\u201d \u201cWell, who's a better right?\u201d growled the gamekeeper. \u201cA pretty rum go if squire ain't to talk for Dr. Livesey, I should think.\u201d At that I gave up all attempts at commentary and read straight on: Blandly himself found the HISPANIOLA, and by the most admirable management got her for the merest trifle. There is a class of men in Bristol monstrously prejudiced against Blandly."], "What character is most associated with civic authority and social power?": [" It was a smile that had in it something both of pain and weakness--a haggard old man's smile; but there was, besides that, a grain of derision, a shadow of treachery, in his expression as he craftily watched, and watched, and watched me at my work. 26 Israel Hands THE wind, serving us to a desire, now hauled into the west. We could run so much the easier from the north-east corner of the island to the mouth of the North Inlet. Only, as we had no power to anchor and dared not beach her till the tide had flowed a good deal farther, time hung on our hands. The coxswain told me how to lay the ship to; after a good many trials I succeeded, and we both sat in silence over another meal. \u201cCap'n,\u201d said he at length with that same uncomfortable smile, \u201chere's my old shipmate, O'Brien; s'pose you was to heave him overboard. I ain't partic'lar as a rule, and I don't take no blame for settling his hash, but I don't reckon him ornamental now, do you?\u201d \u201cI'm not strong enough, and I don't like the job; and there he lies, for me,\u201d said I. \u201cThis here's an unlucky ship, this HISPANIOLA, Jim,\u201d he went on, blinking. \u201cThere's a power of men been killed in this HISPANIOLA--a sight o' poor seamen dead and gone since you and me took ship to Bristol. I never seen sich dirty luck, not I. There was this here O'Brien now--he's dead, ain't he? Well now, I'm no scholar, and you're a lad as can read and figure, and to put it straight, do you take it as a dead man is dead for good, or do he come alive again?\u201d \u201cYou can kill the body, Mr.", " We pulled easily, by Silver's directions, not to weary the hands prematurely, and after quite a long passage, landed at the mouth of the second river--that which runs down a woody cleft of the Spy-glass. Thence, bending to our left, we began to ascend the slope towards the plateau. At the first outset, heavy, miry ground and a matted, marish vegetation greatly delayed our progress; but by little and little the hill began to steepen and become stony under foot, and the wood to change its character and to grow in a more open order. It was, indeed, a most pleasant portion of the island that we were now approaching. A heavy-scented broom and many flowering shrubs had almost taken the place of grass. Thickets of green nutmeg-trees were dotted here and there with the red columns and the broad shadow of the pines; and the first mingled their spice with the aroma of the others. The air, besides, was fresh and stirring, and this, under the sheer sunbeams, was a wonderful refreshment to our senses. The party spread itself abroad, in a fan shape, shouting and leaping to and fro. About the centre, and a good way behind the rest, Silver and I followed--I tethered by my rope, he ploughing, with deep pants, among the sliding gravel. From time to time, indeed, I had to lend him a hand, or he must have missed his footing and fallen backward down the hill. We had thus proceeded for about half a mile and were approaching the brow of the plateau when the man upon the farthest left began to cry aloud, as if in terror.", " \u201cSee if that's the place.\u201d Long John's eyes burned in his head as he took the chart, but by the fresh look of the paper I knew he was doomed to disappointment. This was not the map we found in Billy Bones's chest, but an accurate copy, complete in all things--names and heights and soundings--with the single exception of the red crosses and the written notes. Sharp as must have been his annoyance, Silver had the strength of mind to hide it. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d said he, \u201cthis is the spot, to be sure, and very prettily drawed out. Who might have done that, I wonder? The pirates were too ignorant, I reckon. Aye, here it is: 'Capt. Kidd's Anchorage'--just the name my shipmate called it. There's a strong current runs along the south, and then away nor'ard up the west coast. Right you was, sir,\u201d says he, \u201cto haul your wind and keep the weather of the island. Leastways, if such was your intention as to enter and careen, and there ain't no better place for that in these waters.\u201d \u201cThank you, my man,\u201d says Captain Smollett. \u201cI'll ask you later on to give us a help. You may go.\u201d I was surprised at the coolness with which John avowed his knowledge of the island, and I own I was half-frightened when I saw him drawing nearer to myself. He did not know, to be sure, that I had overheard his council from the apple barrel, and yet I had by this time taken such a horror of his cruelty, duplicity, and power that I could scarce conceal a shudder when he laid his hand upon my arm.", " But when they saw Redruth waiting for them in the sparred galley, they went about ship at once, and a head popped out again on deck. \u201cDown, dog!\u201d cries the captain. And the head popped back again; and we heard no more, for the time, of these six very faint-hearted seamen. By this time, tumbling things in as they came, we had the jolly-boat loaded as much as we dared. Joyce and I got out through the stern-port, and we made for shore again as fast as oars could take us. This second trip fairly aroused the watchers along shore. \u201cLillibullero\u201d was dropped again; and just before we lost sight of them behind the little point, one of them whipped ashore and disappeared. I had half a mind to change my plan and destroy their boats, but I feared that Silver and the others might be close at hand, and all might very well be lost by trying for too much. We had soon touched land in the same place as before and set to provision the block house. All three made the first journey, heavily laden, and tossed our stores over the palisade. Then, leaving Joyce to guard them--one man, to be sure, but with half a dozen muskets--Hunter and I returned to the jolly-boat and loaded ourselves once more. So we proceeded without pausing to take breath, till the whole cargo was bestowed, when the two servants took up their position in the block house, and I, with all my power, sculled back to the HISPANIOLA. That we should have risked a second boat load seems more daring than it really was."], "Who is the only pirate character to be reformed?": [" We pulled easily, by Silver's directions, not to weary the hands prematurely, and after quite a long passage, landed at the mouth of the second river--that which runs down a woody cleft of the Spy-glass.

We had thus proceeded for about half a mile and were approaching the brow of the plateau when the man upon the farthest left began to cry aloud, as if in terror.", " Feared he was, and proud. They was the roughest crew afloat, was Flint's; the devil himself would have been feared to go to sea with them. Well now, I tell you, I'm not a boasting man, and you seen yourself how easy I keep company, but when I was quartermaster, LAMBS wasn't the word for Flint's old buccaneers. Ah, you may be sure of yourself in old John's ship.\u201d \u201cWell, I tell you now,\u201d replied the lad, \u201cI didn't half a quarter like the job till I had this talk with you, John; but there's my hand on it now.\u201d \u201cAnd a brave lad you were, and smart too,\u201d answered Silver, shaking hands so heartily that all the barrel shook, \u201cand a finer figurehead for a gentleman of fortune I never clapped my eyes on.\u201d By this time I had begun to understand the meaning of their terms. By a \u201cgentleman of fortune\u201d they plainly meant neither more nor less than a common pirate, and the little scene that I had overheard was the last act in the corruption of one of the honest hands--perhaps of the last one left aboard. But on this point I was soon to be relieved, for Silver giving a little whistle, a third man strolled up and sat down by the party. \u201cDick's square,\u201d said Silver. \u201cOh, I know'd Dick was square,\u201d returned the voice of the coxswain, Israel Hands. \u201cHe's no fool, is Dick.\u201d And he turned his quid and spat. \u201cBut look here,\u201d he went on, \u201chere's what I want to know, Barbecue: how long are we a-going to stand off and on like a blessed bumboat?", " I have seen him wringing his hands after such a rebuff, and I am sure the annoyance and the terror he lived in must have greatly hastened his early and unhappy death. All the time he lived with us the captain made no change whatever in his dress but to buy some stockings from a hawker. One of the cocks of his hat having fallen down, he let it hang from that day forth, though it was a great annoyance when it blew. I remember the appearance of his coat, which he patched himself upstairs in his room, and which, before the end, was nothing but patches. He never wrote or received a letter, and he never spoke with any but the neighbours, and with these, for the most part, only when drunk on rum. The great sea-chest none of us had ever seen open. He was only once crossed, and that was towards the end, when my poor father was far gone in a decline that took him off. Dr. Livesey came late one afternoon to see the patient, took a bit of dinner from my mother, and went into the parlour to smoke a pipe until his horse should come down from the hamlet, for we had no stabling at the old Benbow. I followed him in, and I remember observing the contrast the neat, bright doctor, with his powder as white as snow and his bright, black eyes and pleasant manners, made with the coltish country folk, and above all, with that filthy, heavy, bleared scarecrow of a pirate of ours, sitting, far gone in rum, with his arms on the table.", " The four who had boarded made straight before them for the building, shouting as they ran, and the men among the trees shouted back to encourage them. Several shots were fired, but such was the hurry of the marksmen that not one appears to have taken effect. In a moment, the four pirates had swarmed up the mound and were upon us. The head of Job Anderson, the boatswain, appeared at the middle loophole. \u201cAt 'em, all hands--all hands!\u201d he roared in a voice of thunder. At the same moment, another pirate grasped Hunter's musket by the muzzle, wrenched it from his hands, plucked it through the loophole, and with one stunning blow, laid the poor fellow senseless on the floor. Meanwhile a third, running unharmed all around the house, appeared suddenly in the doorway and fell with his cutlass on the doctor. Our position was utterly reversed. A moment since we were firing, under cover, at an exposed enemy; now it was we who lay uncovered and could not return a blow. The log-house was full of smoke, to which we owed our comparative safety. Cries and confusion, the flashes and reports of pistol-shots, and one loud groan rang in my ears. \u201cOut, lads, out, and fight 'em in the open! Cutlasses!\u201d cried the captain. I snatched a cutlass from the pile, and someone, at the same time snatching another, gave me a cut across the knuckles which I hardly felt. I dashed out of the door into the clear sunlight."], "What best characterizes the change that Jim undergoes in the course of his adventures?": [" We must none of us go alone till we get to sea. Jim and I shall stick together in the meanwhile; you'll take Joyce and Hunter when you ride to Bristol, and from first to last, not one of us must breathe a word of what we've found.\u201d \u201cLivesey,\u201d returned the squire, \u201cyou are always in the right of it. I'll be as silent as the grave.\u201d PART TWO--The Sea-cook 7 I Go to Bristol IT was longer than the squire imagined ere we were ready for the sea, and none of our first plans--not even Dr. Livesey's, of keeping me beside him--could be carried out as we intended. The doctor had to go to London for a physician to take charge of his practice; the squire was hard at work at Bristol; and I lived on at the hall under the charge of old Redruth, the gamekeeper, almost a prisoner, but full of sea-dreams and the most charming anticipations of strange islands and adventures. I brooded by the hour together over the map, all the details of which I well remembered. Sitting by the fire in the housekeeper's room, I approached that island in my fancy from every possible direction; I explored every acre of its surface; I climbed a thousand times to that tall hill they call the Spy-glass, and from the top enjoyed the most wonderful and changing prospects. Sometimes the isle was thick with savages, with whom we fought, sometimes full of dangerous animals that hunted us, but in all my fancies nothing occurred to me so strange and tragic as our actual adventures.", " Rapidly I described to him my adventures, and he heard me out in silence. \u201cThere is a kind of fate in this,\u201d he observed when I had done. \u201cEvery step, it's you that saves our lives; and do you suppose by any chance that we are going to let you lose yours? That would be a poor return, my boy. You found out the plot; you found Ben Gunn--the best deed that ever you did, or will do, though you live to ninety. Oh, by Jupiter, and talking of Ben Gunn! Why, this is the mischief in person. Silver!\u201d he cried. \u201cSilver! I'll give you a piece of advice,\u201d he continued as the cook drew near again; \u201cdon't you be in any great hurry after that treasure.\u201d \u201cWhy, sir, I do my possible, which that ain't,\u201d said Silver. \u201cI can only, asking your pardon, save my life and the boy's by seeking for that treasure; and you may lay to that.\u201d \u201cWell, Silver,\u201d replied the doctor, \u201cif that is so, I'll go one step further: look out for squalls when you find it.\u201d \u201cSir,\u201d said Silver, \u201cas between man and man, that's too much and too little. What you're after, why you left the block house, why you given me that there chart, I don't know, now, do I? And yet I done your bidding with my eyes shut and never a word of hope! But no, this here's too much. If you won't tell me what you mean plain out, just say so and I'll leave the helm.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said the doctor musingly; \u201cI've no right to say more; it's not my secret, you see, Silver, or, I give you my word, I'd tell it you.", " But I'll go as far with you as I dare go, and a step beyond, for I'll have my wig sorted by the captain or I'm mistaken! And first, I'll give you a bit of hope; Silver, if we both get alive out of this wolf-trap, I'll do my best to save you, short of perjury.\u201d Silver's face was radiant. \u201cYou couldn't say more, I'm sure, sir, not if you was my mother,\u201d he cried. \u201cWell, that's my first concession,\u201d added the doctor. \u201cMy second is a piece of advice: keep the boy close beside you, and when you need help, halloo. I'm off to seek it for you, and that itself will show you if I speak at random. Good-bye, Jim.\u201d And Dr. Livesey shook hands with me through the stockade, nodded to Silver, and set off at a brisk pace into the wood. 31 The Treasure-hunt--Flint's Pointer \u201cJIM,\u201d said Silver when we were alone, \u201cif I saved your life, you saved mine; and I'll not forget it. I seen the doctor waving you to run for it--with the tail of my eye, I did; and I seen you say no, as plain as hearing. Jim, that's one to you. This is the first glint of hope I had since the attack failed, and I owe it you. And now, Jim, we're to go in for this here treasure-hunting, with sealed orders too, and I don't like it; and you and me must stick close, back to back like, and we'll save our necks in spite o' fate and fortune.\u201d Just then a man hailed us from the fire that breakfast was ready, and we were soon seated here and there about the sand over biscuit and fried junk.", " One glance, however, was sufficient; and it was only one glance that I durst take from that unsteady skiff. It showed me Hands and his companion locked together in deadly wrestle, each with a hand upon the other's throat. I dropped upon the thwart again, none too soon, for I was near overboard. I could see nothing for the moment but these two furious, encrimsoned faces swaying together under the smoky lamp, and I shut my eyes to let them grow once more familiar with the darkness. The endless ballad had come to an end at last, and the whole diminished company about the camp-fire had broken into the chorus I had heard so often: \u201cFifteen men on the dead man's chest-- Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum! Drink and the devil had done for the rest-- Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!\u201d I was just thinking how busy drink and the devil were at that very moment in the cabin of the HISPANIOLA, when I was surprised by a sudden lurch of the coracle. At the same moment, she yawed sharply and seemed to change her course. The speed in the meantime had strangely increased. I opened my eyes at once. All round me were little ripples, combing over with a sharp, bristling sound and slightly phosphorescent. The HISPANIOLA herself, a few yards in whose wake I was still being whirled along, seemed to stagger in her course, and I saw her spars toss a little against the blackness of the night; nay, as I looked longer, I made sure she also was wheeling to the southward."], "What specific details does Jim include in his narrative that make the heroic claims of grownups seem like empty bluster?": [" . 54 9.

THE TREASURE-HUNT--THE VOICE AMONG THE TREES .", " The stern window was open, for it was a warm night, and you could see the moon shining behind on the ship's wake. \u201cNow, Hawkins,\u201d said the squire, \u201cyou have something to say. Speak up.\u201d I did as I was bid, and as short as I could make it, told the whole details of Silver's conversation. Nobody interrupted me till I was done, nor did any one of the three of them make so much as a movement, but they kept their eyes upon my face from first to last. \u201cJim,\u201d said Dr. Livesey, \u201ctake a seat.\u201d And they made me sit down at table beside them, poured me out a glass of wine, filled my hands with raisins, and all three, one after the other, and each with a bow, drank my good health, and their service to me, for my luck and courage. \u201cNow, captain,\u201d said the squire, \u201cyou were right, and I was wrong. I own myself an ass, and I await your orders.\u201d \u201cNo more an ass than I, sir,\u201d returned the captain. \u201cI never heard of a crew that meant to mutiny but what showed signs before, for any man that had an eye in his head to see the mischief and take steps according. But this crew,\u201d he added, \u201cbeats me.\u201d \u201cCaptain,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cwith your permission, that's Silver. A very remarkable man.\u201d \u201cHe'd look remarkably well from a yard-arm, sir,\u201d returned the captain. \u201cBut this is talk; this don't lead to anything. I see three or four points, and with Mr. Trelawney's permission, I'll name them.\u201d \u201cYou, sir, are the captain.", " \u201cYou seem to have a lot to say,\u201d remarked Silver, spitting far into the air. \u201cPipe up and let me hear it, or lay to.\u201d \u201cAx your pardon, sir,\u201d returned one of the men; \u201cyou're pretty free with some of the rules; maybe you'll kindly keep an eye upon the rest. This crew's dissatisfied; this crew don't vally bullying a marlin-spike; this crew has its rights like other crews, I'll make so free as that; and by your own rules, I take it we can talk together. I ax your pardon, sir, acknowledging you for to be captaing at this present; but I claim my right, and steps outside for a council.\u201d And with an elaborate sea-salute, this fellow, a long, ill-looking, yellow-eyed man of five and thirty, stepped coolly towards the door and disappeared out of the house. One after another the rest followed his example, each making a salute as he passed, each adding some apology. \u201cAccording to rules,\u201d said one. \u201cForecastle council,\u201d said Morgan. And so with one remark or another all marched out and left Silver and me alone with the torch. The sea-cook instantly removed his pipe. \u201cNow, look you here, Jim Hawkins,\u201d he said in a steady whisper that was no more than audible, \u201cyou're within half a plank of death, and what's a long sight worse, of torture. They're going to throw me off. But, you mark, I stand by you through thick and thin. I didn't mean to; no, not till you spoke up. I was about desperate to lose that much blunt, and be hanged into the bargain.", " A hail on the land side. \u201cSomebody hailing us,\u201d said Hunter, who was on guard. \u201cDoctor! Squire! Captain! Hullo, Hunter, is that you?\u201d came the cries. And I ran to the door in time to see Jim Hawkins, safe and sound, come climbing over the stockade. 19 Narrative Resumed by Jim Hawkins: The Garrison in the Stockade AS soon as Ben Gunn saw the colours he came to a halt, stopped me by the arm, and sat down. \u201cNow,\u201d said he, \u201cthere's your friends, sure enough.\u201d \u201cFar more likely it's the mutineers,\u201d I answered. \u201cThat!\u201d he cried. \u201cWhy, in a place like this, where nobody puts in but gen'lemen of fortune, Silver would fly the Jolly Roger, you don't make no doubt of that. No, that's your friends. There's been blows too, and I reckon your friends has had the best of it; and here they are ashore in the old stockade, as was made years and years ago by Flint. Ah, he was the man to have a headpiece, was Flint! Barring rum, his match were never seen. He were afraid of none, not he; on'y Silver--Silver was that genteel.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said I, \u201cthat may be so, and so be it; all the more reason that I should hurry on and join my friends.\u201d \u201cNay, mate,\u201d returned Ben, \u201cnot you. You're a good boy, or I'm mistook; but you're on'y a boy, all told. Now, Ben Gunn is fly. Rum wouldn't bring me there, where you're going--not rum wouldn't, till I see your born gen'leman and gets it on his word of honour. And you won't forget my words; 'A precious sight (that's what you'll say), a precious sight more confidence'--and then nips him.\u201d And he pinched me the third time with the same air of cleverness."], "What does Silver\u2019s murder of Tom Redruth demonstrate that he cares little about?": [" \u201cIt was him that knowed Black Dog.\u201d \u201cWell, and see here,\u201d added the sea-cook. \u201cI'll put another again to that, by thunder! For it was this same boy that faked the chart from Billy Bones. First and last, we've split upon Jim Hawkins!\u201d \u201cThen here goes!\u201d said Morgan with an oath. And he sprang up, drawing his knife as if he had been twenty. \u201cAvast, there!\u201d cried Silver. \u201cWho are you, Tom Morgan? Maybe you thought you was cap'n here, perhaps. By the powers, but I'll teach you better! Cross me, and you'll go where many a good man's gone before you, first and last, these thirty year back--some to the yard-arm, shiver my timbers, and some by the board, and all to feed the fishes. There's never a man looked me between the eyes and seen a good day a'terwards, Tom Morgan, you may lay to that.\u201d Morgan paused, but a hoarse murmur rose from the others. \u201cTom's right,\u201d said one. \u201cI stood hazing long enough from one,\u201d added another. \u201cI'll be hanged if I'll be hazed by you, John Silver.\u201d \u201cDid any of you gentlemen want to have it out with ME?\u201d roared Silver, bending far forward from his position on the keg, with his pipe still glowing in his right hand. \u201cPut a name on what you're at; you ain't dumb, I reckon. Him that wants shall get it. Have I lived this many years, and a son of a rum puncheon cock his hat athwart my hawse at the latter end of it? You know the way; you're all gentlemen o' fortune, by your account.", " Just before him Tom lay motionless upon the sward; but the murderer minded him not a whit, cleansing his blood-stained knife the while upon a wisp of grass. Everything else was unchanged, the sun still shining mercilessly on the steaming marsh and the tall pinnacle of the mountain, and I could scarce persuade myself that murder had been actually done and a human life cruelly cut short a moment since before my eyes. But now John put his hand into his pocket, brought out a whistle, and blew upon it several modulated blasts that rang far across the heated air. I could not tell, of course, the meaning of the signal, but it instantly awoke my fears. More men would be coming. I might be discovered. They had already slain two of the honest people; after Tom and Alan, might not I come next? Instantly I began to extricate myself and crawl back again, with what speed and silence I could manage, to the more open portion of the wood. As I did so, I could hear hails coming and going between the old buccaneer and his comrades, and this sound of danger lent me wings. As soon as I was clear of the thicket, I ran as I never ran before, scarce minding the direction of my flight, so long as it led me from the murderers; and as I ran, fear grew and grew upon me until it turned into a kind of frenzy. Indeed, could anyone be more entirely lost than I? When the gun fired, how should I dare to go down to the boats among those fiends, still smoking from their crime?", " Both the squire and I returned the shot, but as we had nothing to aim at, it is probable we only wasted powder. Then we reloaded and turned our attention to poor Tom. The captain and Gray were already examining him, and I saw with half an eye that all was over. I believe the readiness of our return volley had scattered the mutineers once more, for we were suffered without further molestation to get the poor old gamekeeper hoisted over the stockade and carried, groaning and bleeding, into the log-house. Poor old fellow, he had not uttered one word of surprise, complaint, fear, or even acquiescence from the very beginning of our troubles till now, when we had laid him down in the log-house to die. He had lain like a Trojan behind his mattress in the gallery; he had followed every order silently, doggedly, and well; he was the oldest of our party by a score of years; and now, sullen, old, serviceable servant, it was he that was to die. The squire dropped down beside him on his knees and kissed his hand, crying like a child. \u201cBe I going, doctor?\u201d he asked. \u201cTom, my man,\u201d said I, \u201cyou're going home.\u201d \u201cI wish I had had a lick at them with the gun first,\u201d he replied. \u201cTom,\u201d said the squire, \u201csay you forgive me, won't you?\u201d \u201cWould that be respectful like, from me to you, squire?\u201d was the answer. \u201cHowsoever, so be it, amen!\u201d After a little while of silence, he said he thought somebody might read a prayer.", " Very close around the stockade--too close for defence, they said--the wood still flourished high and dense, all of fir on the land side, but towards the sea with a large admixture of live-oaks. The cold evening breeze, of which I have spoken, whistled through every chink of the rude building and sprinkled the floor with a continual rain of fine sand. There was sand in our eyes, sand in our teeth, sand in our suppers, sand dancing in the spring at the bottom of the kettle, for all the world like porridge beginning to boil. Our chimney was a square hole in the roof; it was but a little part of the smoke that found its way out, and the rest eddied about the house and kept us coughing and piping the eye. Add to this that Gray, the new man, had his face tied up in a bandage for a cut he had got in breaking away from the mutineers and that poor old Tom Redruth, still unburied, lay along the wall, stiff and stark, under the Union Jack. If we had been allowed to sit idle, we should all have fallen in the blues, but Captain Smollett was never the man for that. All hands were called up before him, and he divided us into watches. The doctor and Gray and I for one; the squire, Hunter, and Joyce upon the other. Tired though we all were, two were sent out for firewood; two more were set to dig a grave for Redruth; the doctor was named cook; I was put sentry at the door; and the captain himself went from one to another, keeping up our spirits and lending a hand wherever it was wanted."], "What characteristic does Silver seem to share with Dr. Livesey?": [" So the weeks passed on, till one fine day there came a letter addressed to Dr. Livesey, with this addition, \u201cTo be opened, in the case of his absence, by Tom Redruth or young Hawkins.\u201d Obeying this order, we found, or rather I found--for the gamekeeper was a poor hand at reading anything but print--the following important news: Old Anchor Inn, Bristol, March 1, 17-- Dear Livesey--As I do not know whether you are at the hall or still in London, I send this in double to both places. The ship is bought and fitted. She lies at anchor, ready for sea. You never imagined a sweeter schooner--a child might sail her--two hundred tons; name, HISPANIOLA. I got her through my old friend, Blandly, who has proved himself throughout the most surprising trump. The admirable fellow literally slaved in my interest, and so, I may say, did everyone in Bristol, as soon as they got wind of the port we sailed for--treasure, I mean. \u201cRedruth,\u201d said I, interrupting the letter, \u201cDr. Livesey will not like that. The squire has been talking, after all.\u201d \u201cWell, who's a better right?\u201d growled the gamekeeper. \u201cA pretty rum go if squire ain't to talk for Dr. Livesey, I should think.\u201d At that I gave up all attempts at commentary and read straight on: Blandly himself found the HISPANIOLA, and by the most admirable management got her for the merest trifle. There is a class of men in Bristol monstrously prejudiced against Blandly.", " I don't like this cruise; I don't like the men; and I don't like my officer. That's short and sweet.\u201d \u201cPerhaps, sir, you don't like the ship?\u201d inquired the squire, very angry, as I could see. \u201cI can't speak as to that, sir, not having seen her tried,\u201d said the captain. \u201cShe seems a clever craft; more I can't say.\u201d \u201cPossibly, sir, you may not like your employer, either?\u201d says the squire. But here Dr. Livesey cut in. \u201cStay a bit,\u201d said he, \u201cstay a bit. No use of such questions as that but to produce ill feeling. The captain has said too much or he has said too little, and I'm bound to say that I require an explanation of his words. You don't, you say, like this cruise. Now, why?\u201d \u201cI was engaged, sir, on what we call sealed orders, to sail this ship for that gentleman where he should bid me,\u201d said the captain. \u201cSo far so good. But now I find that every man before the mast knows more than I do. I don't call that fair, now, do you?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Dr. Livesey, \u201cI don't.\u201d \u201cNext,\u201d said the captain, \u201cI learn we are going after treasure--hear it from my own hands, mind you. Now, treasure is ticklish work; I don't like treasure voyages on any account, and I don't like them, above all, when they are secret and when (begging your pardon, Mr. Trelawney) the secret has been told to the parrot.\u201d \u201cSilver's parrot?\u201d asked the squire. \u201cIt's a way of speaking,\u201d said the captain. \u201cBlabbed, I mean. It's my belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about, but I'll tell you my way of it--life or death, and a close run.\u201d \u201cThat is all clear, and, I dare say, true enough,\u201d replied Dr. Livesey.", " Well, then, I will not. But the dead men, sir, hang about your neck like mill-stones.\u201d \u201cThank you kindly, sir,\u201d replied Long John, again saluting. \u201cI dare you to thank me!\u201d cried the squire. \u201cIt is a gross dereliction of my duty. Stand back.\u201d And thereupon we all entered the cave. It was a large, airy place, with a little spring and a pool of clear water, overhung with ferns. The floor was sand. Before a big fire lay Captain Smollett; and in a far corner, only duskily flickered over by the blaze, I beheld great heaps of coin and quadrilaterals built of bars of gold. That was Flint's treasure that we had come so far to seek and that had cost already the lives of seventeen men from the HISPANIOLA. How many it had cost in the amassing, what blood and sorrow, what good ships scuttled on the deep, what brave men walking the plank blindfold, what shot of cannon, what shame and lies and cruelty, perhaps no man alive could tell. Yet there were still three upon that island--Silver, and old Morgan, and Ben Gunn--who had each taken his share in these crimes, as each had hoped in vain to share in the reward. \u201cCome in, Jim,\u201d said the captain. \u201cYou're a good boy in your line, Jim, but I don't think you and me'll go to sea again. You're too much of the born favourite for me. Is that you, John Silver? What brings you here, man?\u201d \u201cCome back to my dooty, sir,\u201d returned Silver. \u201cAh!\u201d said the captain, and that was all he said.", " And, now I come to think of it, I might as well ride round there myself and report to him or squire. Master Pew's dead, when all's done; not that I regret it, but he's dead, you see, and people will make it out against an officer of his Majesty's revenue, if make it out they can. Now, I'll tell you, Hawkins, if you like, I'll take you along.\u201d I thanked him heartily for the offer, and we walked back to the hamlet where the horses were. By the time I had told mother of my purpose they were all in the saddle. \u201cDogger,\u201d said Mr. Dance, \u201cyou have a good horse; take up this lad behind you.\u201d As soon as I was mounted, holding on to Dogger's belt, the supervisor gave the word, and the party struck out at a bouncing trot on the road to Dr. Livesey's house. 6 The Captain's Papers WE rode hard all the way till we drew up before Dr. Livesey's door. The house was all dark to the front. Mr. Dance told me to jump down and knock, and Dogger gave me a stirrup to descend by. The door was opened almost at once by the maid. \u201cIs Dr. Livesey in?\u201d I asked. No, she said, he had come home in the afternoon but had gone up to the hall to dine and pass the evening with the squire. \u201cSo there we go, boys,\u201d said Mr. Dance. This time, as the distance was short, I did not mount, but ran with Dogger's stirrup-leather to the lodge gates and up the long, leafless, moonlit avenue to where the white line of the hall buildings looked on either hand on great old gardens."], "What does Dr. Livesey never do, unlike Jim or the pirates?": [" So the weeks passed on, till one fine day there came a letter addressed to Dr. Livesey, with this addition, \u201cTo be opened, in the case of his absence, by Tom Redruth or young Hawkins.\u201d Obeying this order, we found, or rather I found--for the gamekeeper was a poor hand at reading anything but print--the following important news: Old Anchor Inn, Bristol, March 1, 17-- Dear Livesey--As I do not know whether you are at the hall or still in London, I send this in double to both places.

But I'll own up fairly, I've the shakes upon me for the gallows. You're a good man and a true; I never seen a better man! And you'll not forget what I done good, not any more than you'll forget the bad, I know. And I step aside--see here--and leave you and Jim alone. And you'll put that down for me too, for it's a long stretch, is that!\u201d So saying, he stepped back a little way, till he was out of earshot, and there sat down upon a tree-stump and began to whistle, spinning round now and again upon his seat so as to command a sight, sometimes of me and the doctor and sometimes of his unruly ruffians as they went to and fro in the sand between the fire--which they were busy rekindling--and the house, from which they brought forth pork and bread to make the breakfast. \u201cSo, Jim,\u201d said the doctor sadly, \u201chere you are. As you have brewed, so shall you drink, my boy.", " It occurred to me at once to go ashore. In a jiffy I had slipped over the side and curled up in the fore-sheets of the nearest boat, and almost at the same moment she shoved off. No one took notice of me, only the bow oar saying, \u201cIs that you, Jim? Keep your head down.\u201d But Silver, from the other boat, looked sharply over and called out to know if that were me; and from that moment I began to regret what I had done. The crews raced for the beach, but the boat I was in, having some start and being at once the lighter and the better manned, shot far ahead of her consort, and the bow had struck among the shore-side trees and I had caught a branch and swung myself out and plunged into the nearest thicket while Silver and the rest were still a hundred yards behind. \u201cJim, Jim!\u201d I heard him shouting. But you may suppose I paid no heed; jumping, ducking, and breaking through, I ran straight before my nose till I could run no longer. 14 The First Blow I WAS so pleased at having given the slip to Long John that I began to enjoy myself and look around me with some interest on the strange land that I was in. I had crossed a marshy tract full of willows, bulrushes, and odd, outlandish, swampy trees; and I had now come out upon the skirts of an open piece of undulating, sandy country, about a mile long, dotted with a few pines and a great number of contorted trees, not unlike the oak in growth, but pale in the foliage, like willows."], "What is Silver able to provide Jim with that he doesn\u2019t find in the civilized world?": [" I've had a'most enough o' Cap'n Smollett; he's hazed me long enough, by thunder! I want to go into that cabin, I do. I want their pickles and wines, and that.\u201d \u201cIsrael,\u201d said Silver, \u201cyour head ain't much account, nor ever was. But you're able to hear, I reckon; leastways, your ears is big enough. Now, here's what I say: you'll berth forward, and you'll live hard, and you'll speak soft, and you'll keep sober till I give the word; and you may lay to that, my son.\u201d \u201cWell, I don't say no, do I?\u201d growled the coxswain. \u201cWhat I say is, when? That's what I say.\u201d \u201cWhen! By the powers!\u201d cried Silver. \u201cWell now, if you want to know, I'll tell you when. The last moment I can manage, and that's when. Here's a first-rate seaman, Cap'n Smollett, sails the blessed ship for us. Here's this squire and doctor with a map and such--I don't know where it is, do I? No more do you, says you. Well then, I mean this squire and doctor shall find the stuff, and help us to get it aboard, by the powers. Then we'll see. If I was sure of you all, sons of double Dutchmen, I'd have Cap'n Smollett navigate us half-way back again before I struck.\u201d \u201cWhy, we're all seamen aboard here, I should think,\u201d said the lad Dick. \u201cWe're all forecastle hands, you mean,\u201d snapped Silver. \u201cWe can steer a course, but who's to set one? That's what all you gentlemen split on, first and last. If I had my way, I'd have Cap'n Smollett work us back into the trades at least; then we'd have no blessed miscalculations and a spoonful of water a day.", " \u201cWe've quite a surprise for you too, sir,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe've a little stranger here--he! he! A noo boarder and lodger, sir, and looking fit and taut as a fiddle; slep' like a supercargo, he did, right alongside of John--stem to stem we was, all night.\u201d Dr. Livesey was by this time across the stockade and pretty near the cook, and I could hear the alteration in his voice as he said, \u201cNot Jim?\u201d \u201cThe very same Jim as ever was,\u201d says Silver. The doctor stopped outright, although he did not speak, and it was some seconds before he seemed able to move on. \u201cWell, well,\u201d he said at last, \u201cduty first and pleasure afterwards, as you might have said yourself, Silver. Let us overhaul these patients of yours.\u201d A moment afterwards he had entered the block house and with one grim nod to me proceeded with his work among the sick. He seemed under no apprehension, though he must have known that his life, among these treacherous demons, depended on a hair; and he rattled on to his patients as if he were paying an ordinary professional visit in a quiet English family. His manner, I suppose, reacted on the men, for they behaved to him as if nothing had occurred, as if he were still ship's doctor and they still faithful hands before the mast. \u201cYou're doing well, my friend,\u201d he said to the fellow with the bandaged head, \u201cand if ever any person had a close shave, it was you; your head must be as hard as iron.", " But I'll go as far with you as I dare go, and a step beyond, for I'll have my wig sorted by the captain or I'm mistaken! And first, I'll give you a bit of hope; Silver, if we both get alive out of this wolf-trap, I'll do my best to save you, short of perjury.\u201d Silver's face was radiant. \u201cYou couldn't say more, I'm sure, sir, not if you was my mother,\u201d he cried. \u201cWell, that's my first concession,\u201d added the doctor. \u201cMy second is a piece of advice: keep the boy close beside you, and when you need help, halloo. I'm off to seek it for you, and that itself will show you if I speak at random. Good-bye, Jim.\u201d And Dr. Livesey shook hands with me through the stockade, nodded to Silver, and set off at a brisk pace into the wood. 31 The Treasure-hunt--Flint's Pointer \u201cJIM,\u201d said Silver when we were alone, \u201cif I saved your life, you saved mine; and I'll not forget it. I seen the doctor waving you to run for it--with the tail of my eye, I did; and I seen you say no, as plain as hearing. Jim, that's one to you. This is the first glint of hope I had since the attack failed, and I owe it you. And now, Jim, we're to go in for this here treasure-hunting, with sealed orders too, and I don't like it; and you and me must stick close, back to back like, and we'll save our necks in spite o' fate and fortune.\u201d Just then a man hailed us from the fire that breakfast was ready, and we were soon seated here and there about the sand over biscuit and fried junk.", " \u201cAnd when Ben Gunn is wanted, you know where to find him, Jim. Just wheer you found him today. And him that comes is to have a white thing in his hand, and he's to come alone. Oh! And you'll say this: 'Ben Gunn,' says you, 'has reasons of his own. '\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said I, \u201cI believe I understand. You have something to propose, and you wish to see the squire or the doctor, and you're to be found where I found you. Is that all?\u201d \u201cAnd when? says you,\u201d he added. \u201cWhy, from about noon observation to about six bells.\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d said I, \u201cand now may I go?\u201d \u201cYou won't forget?\u201d he inquired anxiously. \u201cPrecious sight, and reasons of his own, says you. Reasons of his own; that's the mainstay; as between man and man. Well, then\u201d--still holding me--\u201cI reckon you can go, Jim. And, Jim, if you was to see Silver, you wouldn't go for to sell Ben Gunn? Wild horses wouldn't draw it from you? No, says you. And if them pirates camp ashore, Jim, what would you say but there'd be widders in the morning?\u201d Here he was interrupted by a loud report, and a cannonball came tearing through the trees and pitched in the sand not a hundred yards from where we two were talking. The next moment each of us had taken to his heels in a different direction. For a good hour to come frequent reports shook the island, and balls kept crashing through the woods. I moved from hiding-place to hiding-place, always pursued, or so it seemed to me, by these terrifying missiles."], "What symbol is linked to Stevenson\u2019s thematic exploration of the futility of desire?": [" On the far side of the open stood one of the hills, with two quaint, craggy peaks shining vividly in the sun. I now felt for the first time the joy of exploration. The isle was uninhabited; my shipmates I had left behind, and nothing lived in front of me but dumb brutes and fowls. I turned hither and thither among the trees. Here and there were flowering plants, unknown to me; here and there I saw snakes, and one raised his head from a ledge of rock and hissed at me with a noise not unlike the spinning of a top. Little did I suppose that he was a deadly enemy and that the noise was the famous rattle. Then I came to a long thicket of these oaklike trees--live, or evergreen, oaks, I heard afterwards they should be called--which grew low along the sand like brambles, the boughs curiously twisted, the foliage compact, like thatch. The thicket stretched down from the top of one of the sandy knolls, spreading and growing taller as it went, until it reached the margin of the broad, reedy fen, through which the nearest of the little rivers soaked its way into the anchorage. The marsh was steaming in the strong sun, and the outline of the Spy-glass trembled through the haze. All at once there began to go a sort of bustle among the bulrushes; a wild duck flew up with a quack, another followed, and soon over the whole surface of the marsh a great cloud of birds hung screaming and circling in the air.", " *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TREASURE ISLAND *** Produced by Judy Boss, John Hamm and David Widger TREASURE ISLAND by Robert Louis Stevenson TREASURE ISLAND To S.L.O., an American gentleman in accordance with whose classic taste the following narrative has been designed, it is now, in return for numerous delightful hours, and with the kindest wishes, dedicated by his affectionate friend, the author.

Only once we heard a gunshot a great way off and supposed them to be hunting. A council was held, and it was decided that we must desert them on the island--to the huge glee, I must say, of Ben Gunn, and with the strong approval of Gray. We left a good stock of powder and shot, the bulk of the salt goat, a few medicines, and some other necessaries, tools, clothing, a spare sail, a fathom or two of rope, and by the particular desire of the doctor, a handsome present of tobacco. That was about our last doing on the island. Before that, we had got the treasure stowed and had shipped enough water and the remainder of the goat meat in case of any distress; and at last, one fine morning, we weighed anchor, which was about all that we could manage, and stood out of North Inlet, the same colours flying that the captain had flown and fought under at the palisade. The three fellows must have been watching us closer than we thought for, as we soon had proved. For coming through the narrows, we had to lie very near the southern point, and there we saw all three of them kneeling together on a spit of sand, with their arms raised in supplication. It went to all our hearts, I think, to leave them in that wretched state; but we could not risk another mutiny; and to take them home for the gibbet would have been a cruel sort of kindness.", " As for Mr. Arrow, I believe him thoroughly honest; some of the men are the same; all may be for what I know. But I am responsible for the ship's safety and the life of every man Jack aboard of her. I see things going, as I think, not quite right. And I ask you to take certain precautions or let me resign my berth. And that's all.\u201d \u201cCaptain Smollett,\u201d began the doctor with a smile, \u201cdid ever you hear the fable of the mountain and the mouse? You'll excuse me, I dare say, but you remind me of that fable. When you came in here, I'll stake my wig, you meant more than this.\u201d \u201cDoctor,\u201d said the captain, \u201cyou are smart. When I came in here I meant to get discharged. I had no thought that Mr. Trelawney would hear a word.\u201d \u201cNo more I would,\u201d cried the squire. \u201cHad Livesey not been here I should have seen you to the deuce. As it is, I have heard you. I will do as you desire, but I think the worse of you.\u201d \u201cThat's as you please, sir,\u201d said the captain. \u201cYou'll find I do my duty.\u201d And with that he took his leave. \u201cTrelawney,\u201d said the doctor, \u201ccontrary to all my notions, I believed you have managed to get two honest men on board with you--that man and John Silver.\u201d \u201cSilver, if you like,\u201d cried the squire; \u201cbut as for that intolerable humbug, I declare I think his conduct unmanly, unsailorly, and downright un-English.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d says the doctor, \u201cwe shall see.\u201d When we came on deck, the men had begun already to take out the arms and powder, yo-ho-ing at their work, while the captain and Mr. Arrow stood by superintending."], "By setting his narrative in a romanticized past, what does Stevenson imply that the modern age is missing?": [" . 54 9.

They don't come down here now; they're all mastheaded on them mountings for the fear of Benjamin Gunn. Ah! And there's the cetemery\u201d--cemetery, he must have meant. \u201cYou see the mounds? I come here and prayed, nows and thens, when I thought maybe a Sunday would be about doo. It weren't quite a chapel, but it seemed more solemn like; and then, says you, Ben Gunn was short-handed--no chapling, nor so much as a Bible and a flag, you says.\u201d So he kept talking as I ran, neither expecting nor receiving any answer. The cannon-shot was followed after a considerable interval by a volley of small arms. Another pause, and then, not a quarter of a mile in front of me, I beheld the Union Jack flutter in the air above a wood. PART FOUR--The Stockade 16 Narrative Continued by the Doctor: How the Ship Was Abandoned IT was about half past one--three bells in the sea phrase--that the two boats went ashore from the HISPANIOLA. The captain, the squire, and I were talking matters over in the cabin. Had there been a breath of wind, we should have fallen on the six mutineers who were left aboard with us, slipped our cable, and away to sea. But the wind was wanting; and to complete our helplessness, down came Hunter with the news that Jim Hawkins had slipped into a boat and was gone ashore with the rest.", " In the middle, the cutlasses lay ranged. \u201cToss out the fire,\u201d said the captain; \u201cthe chill is past, and we mustn't have smoke in our eyes.\u201d The iron fire-basket was carried bodily out by Mr. Trelawney, and the embers smothered among sand. \u201cHawkins hasn't had his breakfast. Hawkins, help yourself, and back to your post to eat it,\u201d continued Captain Smollett. \u201cLively, now, my lad; you'll want it before you've done. Hunter, serve out a round of brandy to all hands.\u201d And while this was going on, the captain completed, in his own mind, the plan of the defence. \u201cDoctor, you will take the door,\u201d he resumed. \u201cSee, and don't expose yourself; keep within, and fire through the porch. Hunter, take the east side, there. Joyce, you stand by the west, my man. Mr. Trelawney, you are the best shot--you and Gray will take this long north side, with the five loopholes; it's there the danger is. If they can get up to it and fire in upon us through our own ports, things would begin to look dirty. Hawkins, neither you nor I are much account at the shooting; we'll stand by to load and bear a hand.\u201d As the captain had said, the chill was past. As soon as the sun had climbed above our girdle of trees, it fell with all its force upon the clearing and drank up the vapours at a draught. Soon the sand was baking and the resin melting in the logs of the block house. Jackets and coats were flung aside, shirts thrown open at the neck and rolled up to the shoulders; and we stood there, each at his post, in a fever of heat and anxiety."], "Which of the following motifs does Stevenson often invoke in his descriptions of the pirates?": [" *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TREASURE ISLAND *** Produced by Judy Boss, John Hamm and David Widger TREASURE ISLAND by Robert Louis Stevenson TREASURE ISLAND To S.L.O., an American gentleman in accordance with whose classic taste the following narrative has been designed, it is now, in return for numerous delightful hours, and with the kindest wishes, dedicated by his affectionate friend, the author.

They had \u201cgot their rations for that day,\u201d as the captain put it, and we had the place to ourselves and a quiet time to overhaul the wounded and get dinner. Squire and I cooked outside in spite of the danger, and even outside we could hardly tell what we were at, for horror of the loud groans that reached us from the doctor's patients. Out of the eight men who had fallen in the action, only three still breathed--that one of the pirates who had been shot at the loophole, Hunter, and Captain Smollett; and of these, the first two were as good as dead; the mutineer indeed died under the doctor's knife, and Hunter, do what we could, never recovered consciousness in this world. He lingered all day, breathing loudly like the old buccaneer at home in his apoplectic fit, but the bones of his chest had been crushed by the blow and his skull fractured in falling, and some time in the following night, without sign or sound, he went to his Maker.", " . . . . . . . . . . . . . 195 33.

I remember him as if it were yesterday, as he came plodding to the inn door, his sea-chest following behind him in a hand-barrow--a tall, strong, heavy, nut-brown man, his tarry pigtail falling over the shoulder of his soiled blue coat, his hands ragged and scarred, with black, broken nails, and the sabre cut across one cheek, a dirty, livid white. I remember him looking round the cover and whistling to himself as he did so, and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so often afterwards: \u201cFifteen men on the dead man's chest-- Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!\u201d in the high, old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and broken at the capstan bars. Then he rapped on the door with a bit of stick like a handspike that he carried, and when my father appeared, called roughly for a glass of rum.", " On stormy nights, when the wind shook the four corners of the house and the surf roared along the cove and up the cliffs, I would see him in a thousand forms, and with a thousand diabolical expressions. Now the leg would be cut off at the knee, now at the hip; now he was a monstrous kind of a creature who had never had but the one leg, and that in the middle of his body. To see him leap and run and pursue me over hedge and ditch was the worst of nightmares. And altogether I paid pretty dear for my monthly fourpenny piece, in the shape of these abominable fancies. But though I was so terrified by the idea of the seafaring man with one leg, I was far less afraid of the captain himself than anybody else who knew him. There were nights when he took a deal more rum and water than his head would carry; and then he would sometimes sit and sing his wicked, old, wild sea-songs, minding nobody; but sometimes he would call for glasses round and force all the trembling company to listen to his stories or bear a chorus to his singing. Often I have heard the house shaking with \u201cYo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum,\u201d all the neighbours joining in for dear life, with the fear of death upon them, and each singing louder than the other to avoid remark. For in these fits he was the most overriding companion ever known; he would slap his hand on the table for silence all round; he would fly up in a passion of anger at a question, or sometimes because none was put, and so he judged the company was not following his story."], "What symbolic object serves as a kind of magical talisman in the way it draws people into the adventure story?": [" . 54 9.

His stories were what frightened people worst of all. Dreadful stories they were--about hanging, and walking the plank, and storms at sea, and the Dry Tortugas, and wild deeds and places on the Spanish Main. By his own account he must have lived his life among some of the wickedest men that God ever allowed upon the sea, and the language in which he told these stories shocked our plain country people almost as much as the crimes that he described. My father was always saying the inn would be ruined, for people would soon cease coming there to be tyrannized over and put down, and sent shivering to their beds; but I really believe his presence did us good. People were frightened at the time, but on looking back they rather liked it; it was a fine excitement in a quiet country life, and there was even a party of the younger men who pretended to admire him, calling him a \u201ctrue sea-dog\u201d and a \u201creal old salt\u201d and such like names, and saying there was the sort of man that made England terrible at sea. In one way, indeed, he bade fair to ruin us, for he kept on staying week after week, and at last month after month, so that all the money had been long exhausted, and still my father never plucked up the heart to insist on having more. If ever he mentioned it, the captain blew through his nose so loudly that you might say he roared, and stared my poor father out of the room.", " The men are not shy with him, and Jim is a noticing lad.\u201d \u201cHawkins, I put prodigious faith in you,\u201d added the squire. I began to feel pretty desperate at this, for I felt altogether helpless; and yet, by an odd train of circumstances, it was indeed through me that safety came. In the meantime, talk as we pleased, there were only seven out of the twenty-six on whom we knew we could rely; and out of these seven one was a boy, so that the grown men on our side were six to their nineteen. PART THREE--My Shore Adventure 13 How My Shore Adventure Began THE appearance of the island when I came on deck next morning was altogether changed. Although the breeze had now utterly ceased, we had made a great deal of way during the night and were now lying becalmed about half a mile to the south-east of the low eastern coast. Grey-coloured woods covered a large part of the surface. This even tint was indeed broken up by streaks of yellow sand-break in the lower lands, and by many tall trees of the pine family, out-topping the others--some singly, some in clumps; but the general colouring was uniform and sad. The hills ran up clear above the vegetation in spires of naked rock. All were strangely shaped, and the Spy-glass, which was by three or four hundred feet the tallest on the island, was likewise the strangest in configuration, running up sheer from almost every side and then suddenly cut off at the top like a pedestal to put a statue on.", " \u201cCome, that's better.

I remember him as if it were yesterday, as he came plodding to the inn door, his sea-chest following behind him in a hand-barrow--a tall, strong, heavy, nut-brown man, his tarry pigtail falling over the shoulder of his soiled blue coat, his hands ragged and scarred, with black, broken nails, and the sabre cut across one cheek, a dirty, livid white. I remember him looking round the cover and whistling to himself as he did so, and then breaking out in that old sea-song that he sang so often afterwards: \u201cFifteen men on the dead man's chest-- Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!\u201d in the high, old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and broken at the capstan bars. Then he rapped on the door with a bit of stick like a handspike that he carried, and when my father appeared, called roughly for a glass of rum.", " For--you would have thought men would have been ashamed of themselves--no soul would consent to return with us to the Admiral Benbow. The more we told of our troubles, the more--man, woman, and child--they clung to the shelter of their houses. The name of Captain Flint, though it was strange to me, was well enough known to some there and carried a great weight of terror. Some of the men who had been to field-work on the far side of the Admiral Benbow remembered, besides, to have seen several strangers on the road, and taking them to be smugglers, to have bolted away; and one at least had seen a little lugger in what we called Kitt's Hole. For that matter, anyone who was a comrade of the captain's was enough to frighten them to death. And the short and the long of the matter was, that while we could get several who were willing enough to ride to Dr. Livesey's, which lay in another direction, not one would help us to defend the inn. They say cowardice is infectious; but then argument is, on the other hand, a great emboldener; and so when each had said his say, my mother made them a speech. She would not, she declared, lose money that belonged to her fatherless boy; \u201cIf none of the rest of you dare,\u201d she said, \u201cJim and I dare. Back we will go, the way we came, and small thanks to you big, hulking, chicken-hearted men. We'll have that chest open, if we die for it. And I'll thank you for that bag, Mrs. Crossley, to bring back our lawful money in.\u201d Of course I said I would go with my mother, and of course they all cried out at our foolhardiness, but even then not a man would go along with us.", " *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TREASURE ISLAND *** Produced by Judy Boss, John Hamm and David Widger TREASURE ISLAND by Robert Louis Stevenson TREASURE ISLAND To S.L.O., an American gentleman in accordance with whose classic taste the following narrative has been designed, it is now, in return for numerous delightful hours, and with the kindest wishes, dedicated by his affectionate friend, the author.

Dreadful stories they were--about hanging, and walking the plank, and storms at sea, and the Dry Tortugas, and wild deeds and places on the Spanish Main. By his own account he must have lived his life among some of the wickedest men that God ever allowed upon the sea, and the language in which he told these stories shocked our plain country people almost as much as the crimes that he described. My father was always saying the inn would be ruined, for people would soon cease coming there to be tyrannized over and put down, and sent shivering to their beds; but I really believe his presence did us good. People were frightened at the time, but on looking back they rather liked it; it was a fine excitement in a quiet country life, and there was even a party of the younger men who pretended to admire him, calling him a \u201ctrue sea-dog\u201d and a \u201creal old salt\u201d and such like names, and saying there was the sort of man that made England terrible at sea. In one way, indeed, he bade fair to ruin us, for he kept on staying week after week, and at last month after month, so that all the money had been long exhausted, and still my father never plucked up the heart to insist on having more. If ever he mentioned it, the captain blew through his nose so loudly that you might say he roared, and stared my poor father out of the room."], "The sailor who hires Jim tells him to look out for a ___ man.": [" Leastways, none of us had looked out. We looked out, and by thunder, the old ship was gone! I never seen a pack o' fools look fishier; and you may lay to that, if I tells you that looked the fishiest. 'Well,' says the doctor, 'let's bargain.' We bargained, him and I, and here we are: stores, brandy, block house, the firewood you was thoughtful enough to cut, and in a manner of speaking, the whole blessed boat, from cross-trees to kelson. As for them, they've tramped; I don't know where's they are.\u201d He drew again quietly at his pipe. \u201cAnd lest you should take it into that head of yours,\u201d he went on, \u201cthat you was included in the treaty, here's the last word that was said: 'How many are you,' says I, 'to leave?' 'Four,' says he; 'four, and one of us wounded. As for that boy, I don't know where he is, confound him,' says he, 'nor I don't much care. We're about sick of him.' These was his words. \u201cIs that all?\u201d I asked. \u201cWell, it's all that you're to hear, my son,\u201d returned Silver. \u201cAnd now I am to choose?\u201d \u201cAnd now you are to choose, and you may lay to that,\u201d said Silver. \u201cWell,\u201d said I, \u201cI am not such a fool but I know pretty well what I have to look for. Let the worst come to the worst, it's little I care. I've seen too many die since I fell in with you. But there's a thing or two I have to tell you,\u201d I said, and by this time I was quite excited; \u201cand the first is this: here you are, in a bad way--ship lost, treasure lost, men lost, your whole business gone to wreck; and if you want to know who did it--it was I!", " \u201cWell, squire,\u201d said Dr. Livesey, \u201cI don't put much faith in your discoveries, as a general thing; but I will say this, John Silver suits me.\u201d \u201cThe man's a perfect trump,\u201d declared the squire. \u201cAnd now,\u201d added the doctor, \u201cJim may come on board with us, may he not?\u201d \u201cTo be sure he may,\u201d says squire. \u201cTake your hat, Hawkins, and we'll see the ship.\u201d 9 Powder and Arms THE HISPANIOLA lay some way out, and we went under the figureheads and round the sterns of many other ships, and their cables sometimes grated underneath our keel, and sometimes swung above us. At last, however, we got alongside, and were met and saluted as we stepped aboard by the mate, Mr. Arrow, a brown old sailor with earrings in his ears and a squint. He and the squire were very thick and friendly, but I soon observed that things were not the same between Mr. Trelawney and the captain. This last was a sharp-looking man who seemed angry with everything on board and was soon to tell us why, for we had hardly got down into the cabin when a sailor followed us. \u201cCaptain Smollett, sir, axing to speak with you,\u201d said he. \u201cI am always at the captain's orders. Show him in,\u201d said the squire. The captain, who was close behind his messenger, entered at once and shut the door behind him. \u201cWell, Captain Smollett, what have you to say? All well, I hope; all shipshape and seaworthy?\u201d \u201cWell, sir,\u201d said the captain, \u201cbetter speak plain, I believe, even at the risk of offence.", " Wherever a man is, says I, a man can do for himself. But, mate, my heart is sore for Christian diet. You mightn't happen to have a piece of cheese about you, now? No? Well, many's the long night I've dreamed of cheese--toasted, mostly--and woke up again, and here I were.\u201d \u201cIf ever I can get aboard again,\u201d said I, \u201cyou shall have cheese by the stone.\u201d All this time he had been feeling the stuff of my jacket, smoothing my hands, looking at my boots, and generally, in the intervals of his speech, showing a childish pleasure in the presence of a fellow creature. But at my last words he perked up into a kind of startled slyness. \u201cIf ever you can get aboard again, says you?\u201d he repeated. \u201cWhy, now, who's to hinder you?\u201d \u201cNot you, I know,\u201d was my reply. \u201cAnd right you was,\u201d he cried. \u201cNow you--what do you call yourself, mate?\u201d \u201cJim,\u201d I told him. \u201cJim, Jim,\u201d says he, quite pleased apparently. \u201cWell, now, Jim, I've lived that rough as you'd be ashamed to hear of. Now, for instance, you wouldn't think I had had a pious mother--to look at me?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy, no, not in particular,\u201d I answered. \u201cAh, well,\u201d said he, \u201cbut I had--remarkable pious. And I was a civil, pious boy, and could rattle off my catechism that fast, as you couldn't tell one word from another. And here's what it come to, Jim, and it begun with chuck-farthen on the blessed grave-stones! That's what it begun with, but it went further'n that; and so my mother told me, and predicked the whole, she did, the pious woman!", " It's been meat and drink, and man and wife, to me; and if I'm not to have my rum now I'm a poor old hulk on a lee shore, my blood'll be on you, Jim, and that doctor swab\u201d; and he ran on again for a while with curses. \u201cLook, Jim, how my fingers fidges,\u201d he continued in the pleading tone. \u201cI can't keep 'em still, not I. I haven't had a drop this blessed day. That doctor's a fool, I tell you. If I don't have a dram o' rum, Jim, I'll have the horrors; I seen some on 'em already. I seen old Flint in the corner there, behind you; as plain as print, I seen him; and if I get the horrors, I'm a man that has lived rough, and I'll raise Cain. Your doctor hisself said one glass wouldn't hurt me. I'll give you a golden guinea for a noggin, Jim.\u201d He was growing more and more excited, and this alarmed me for my father, who was very low that day and needed quiet; besides, I was reassured by the doctor's words, now quoted to me, and rather offended by the offer of a bribe. \u201cI want none of your money,\u201d said I, \u201cbut what you owe my father. I'll get you one glass, and no more.\u201d When I brought it to him, he seized it greedily and drank it out. \u201cAye, aye,\u201d said he, \u201cthat's some better, sure enough. And now, matey, did that doctor say how long I was to lie here in this old berth?\u201d \u201cA week at least,\u201d said I. \u201cThunder!\u201d he cried. \u201cA week! I can't do that; they'd have the black spot on me by then. The lubbers is going about to get the wind of me this blessed moment; lubbers as couldn't keep what they got, and want to nail what is another's."], "What happens to Billy Bones as he is attempting to kill Black Dog with his sword?": [" It was tattooed in several places. \u201cHere's luck,\u201d \u201cA fair wind,\u201d and \u201cBilly Bones his fancy,\u201d were very neatly and clearly executed on the forearm; and up near the shoulder there was a sketch of a gallows and a man hanging from it--done, as I thought, with great spirit. \u201cProphetic,\u201d said the doctor, touching this picture with his finger. \u201cAnd now, Master Billy Bones, if that be your name, we'll have a look at the colour of your blood. Jim,\u201d he said, \u201care you afraid of blood?\u201d \u201cNo, sir,\u201d said I. \u201cWell, then,\u201d said he, \u201cyou hold the basin\u201d; and with that he took his lancet and opened a vein. A great deal of blood was taken before the captain opened his eyes and looked mistily about him. First he recognized the doctor with an unmistakable frown; then his glance fell upon me, and he looked relieved. But suddenly his colour changed, and he tried to raise himself, crying, \u201cWhere's Black Dog?\u201d \u201cThere is no Black Dog here,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cexcept what you have on your own back. You have been drinking rum; you have had a stroke, precisely as I told you; and I have just, very much against my own will, dragged you headforemost out of the grave. Now, Mr. Bones--\u201d \u201cThat's not my name,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cMuch I care,\u201d returned the doctor. \u201cIt's the name of a buccaneer of my acquaintance; and I call you by it for the sake of shortness, and what I have to say to you is this; one glass of rum won't kill you, but if you take one you'll take another and another, and I stake my wig if you don't break off short, you'll die--do you understand that?--die, and go to your own place, like the man in the Bible.", " \u201cBill,\u201d said the stranger in a voice that I thought he had tried to make bold and big. The captain spun round on his heel and fronted us; all the brown had gone out of his face, and even his nose was blue; he had the look of a man who sees a ghost, or the evil one, or something worse, if anything can be; and upon my word, I felt sorry to see him all in a moment turn so old and sick. \u201cCome, Bill, you know me; you know an old shipmate, Bill, surely,\u201d said the stranger. The captain made a sort of gasp. \u201cBlack Dog!\u201d said he. \u201cAnd who else?\u201d returned the other, getting more at his ease. \u201cBlack Dog as ever was, come for to see his old shipmate Billy, at the Admiral Benbow inn. Ah, Bill, Bill, we have seen a sight of times, us two, since I lost them two talons,\u201d holding up his mutilated hand. \u201cNow, look here,\u201d said the captain; \u201cyou've run me down; here I am; well, then, speak up; what is it?\u201d \u201cThat's you, Bill,\u201d returned Black Dog, \u201cyou're in the right of it, Billy. I'll have a glass of rum from this dear child here, as I've took such a liking to; and we'll sit down, if you please, and talk square, like old shipmates.\u201d When I returned with the rum, they were already seated on either side of the captain's breakfast-table--Black Dog next to the door and sitting sideways so as to have one eye on his old shipmate and one, as I thought, on his retreat. He bade me go and leave the door wide open.", " Or cut 'em down like that much pork? That would have been Flint's, or Billy Bones's.\u201d \u201cBilly was the man for that,\u201d said Israel. \u201c'Dead men don't bite,' says he. Well, he's dead now hisself; he knows the long and short on it now; and if ever a rough hand come to port, it was Billy.\u201d \u201cRight you are,\u201d said Silver; \u201crough and ready. But mark you here, I'm an easy man--I'm quite the gentleman, says you; but this time it's serious. Dooty is dooty, mates. I give my vote--death. When I'm in Parlyment and riding in my coach, I don't want none of these sea-lawyers in the cabin a-coming home, unlooked for, like the devil at prayers. Wait is what I say; but when the time comes, why, let her rip!\u201d \u201cJohn,\u201d cries the coxswain, \u201cyou're a man!\u201d \u201cYou'll say so, Israel when you see,\u201d said Silver. \u201cOnly one thing I claim--I claim Trelawney.

On the first page there were only some scraps of writing, such as a man with a pen in his hand might make for idleness or practice.

A knife in his back as like as not. \u201cNot much instruction there,\u201d said Dr. Livesey as he passed on. The next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious series of entries. There was a date at one end of the line and at the other a sum of money, as in common account-books, but instead of explanatory writing, only a varying number of crosses between the two. On the 12th of June, 1745, for instance, a sum of seventy pounds had plainly become due to someone, and there was nothing but six crosses to explain the cause. In a few cases, to be sure, the name of a place would be added, as \u201cOffe Caraccas,\u201d or a mere entry of latitude and longitude, as \u201c62o 17' 20\u201d, 19o 2' 40\u201d.\u201d The record lasted over nearly twenty years, the amount of the separate entries growing larger as time went on, and at the end a grand total had been made out after five or six wrong additions, and these words appended, \u201cBones, his pile.\u201d \u201cI can't make head or tail of this,\u201d said Dr. Livesey."], "What does Billy Bones read that precipitates his fatal stroke?": [" It was tattooed in several places. \u201cHere's luck,\u201d \u201cA fair wind,\u201d and \u201cBilly Bones his fancy,\u201d were very neatly and clearly executed on the forearm; and up near the shoulder there was a sketch of a gallows and a man hanging from it--done, as I thought, with great spirit. \u201cProphetic,\u201d said the doctor, touching this picture with his finger. \u201cAnd now, Master Billy Bones, if that be your name, we'll have a look at the colour of your blood. Jim,\u201d he said, \u201care you afraid of blood?\u201d \u201cNo, sir,\u201d said I. \u201cWell, then,\u201d said he, \u201cyou hold the basin\u201d; and with that he took his lancet and opened a vein. A great deal of blood was taken before the captain opened his eyes and looked mistily about him. First he recognized the doctor with an unmistakable frown; then his glance fell upon me, and he looked relieved. But suddenly his colour changed, and he tried to raise himself, crying, \u201cWhere's Black Dog?\u201d \u201cThere is no Black Dog here,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cexcept what you have on your own back. You have been drinking rum; you have had a stroke, precisely as I told you; and I have just, very much against my own will, dragged you headforemost out of the grave. Now, Mr. Bones--\u201d \u201cThat's not my name,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cMuch I care,\u201d returned the doctor. \u201cIt's the name of a buccaneer of my acquaintance; and I call you by it for the sake of shortness, and what I have to say to you is this; one glass of rum won't kill you, but if you take one you'll take another and another, and I stake my wig if you don't break off short, you'll die--do you understand that?--die, and go to your own place, like the man in the Bible.", " The body pointed straight in the direction of the island, and the compass read duly E.S.E. and by E. \u201cI thought so,\u201d cried the cook; \u201cthis here is a p'inter. Right up there is our line for the Pole Star and the jolly dollars. But, by thunder! If it don't make me cold inside to think of Flint. This is one of HIS jokes, and no mistake. Him and these six was alone here; he killed 'em, every man; and this one he hauled here and laid down by compass, shiver my timbers! They're long bones, and the hair's been yellow. Aye, that would be Allardyce. You mind Allardyce, Tom Morgan?\u201d \u201cAye, aye,\u201d returned Morgan; \u201cI mind him; he owed me money, he did, and took my knife ashore with him.\u201d \u201cSpeaking of knives,\u201d said another, \u201cwhy don't we find his'n lying round? Flint warn't the man to pick a seaman's pocket; and the birds, I guess, would leave it be.\u201d \u201cBy the powers, and that's true!\u201d cried Silver. \u201cThere ain't a thing left here,\u201d said Merry, still feeling round among the bones; \u201cnot a copper doit nor a baccy box. It don't look nat'ral to me.\u201d \u201cNo, by gum, it don't,\u201d agreed Silver; \u201cnot nat'ral, nor not nice, says you. Great guns! Messmates, but if Flint was living, this would be a hot spot for you and me. Six they were, and six are we; and bones is what they are now.\u201d \u201cI saw him dead with these here deadlights,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cBilly took me in. There he laid, with penny-pieces on his eyes.\u201d \u201cDead--aye, sure enough he's dead and gone below,\u201d said the fellow with the bandage; \u201cbut if ever sperrit walked, it would be Flint's.", " Or cut 'em down like that much pork? That would have been Flint's, or Billy Bones's.\u201d \u201cBilly was the man for that,\u201d said Israel. \u201c'Dead men don't bite,' says he. Well, he's dead now hisself; he knows the long and short on it now; and if ever a rough hand come to port, it was Billy.\u201d \u201cRight you are,\u201d said Silver; \u201crough and ready. But mark you here, I'm an easy man--I'm quite the gentleman, says you; but this time it's serious. Dooty is dooty, mates. I give my vote--death. When I'm in Parlyment and riding in my coach, I don't want none of these sea-lawyers in the cabin a-coming home, unlooked for, like the devil at prayers.

Let's have a go of the rum.\u201d \u201cDick,\u201d said Silver, \u201cI trust you. I've a gauge on the keg, mind.", " The squire and I were both peering over his shoulder as he opened it, for Dr. Livesey had kindly motioned me to come round from the side-table, where I had been eating, to enjoy the sport of the search. On the first page there were only some scraps of writing, such as a man with a pen in his hand might make for idleness or practice. One was the same as the tattoo mark, \u201cBilly Bones his fancy\u201d; then there was \u201cMr. W. Bones, mate,\u201d \u201cNo more rum,\u201d \u201cOff Palm Key he got itt,\u201d and some other snatches, mostly single words and unintelligible.

A knife in his back as like as not. \u201cNot much instruction there,\u201d said Dr. Livesey as he passed on. The next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious series of entries.

His stories were what frightened people worst of all. Dreadful stories they were--about hanging, and walking the plank, and storms at sea, and the Dry Tortugas, and wild deeds and places on the Spanish Main. By his own account he must have lived his life among some of the wickedest men that God ever allowed upon the sea, and the language in which he told these stories shocked our plain country people almost as much as the crimes that he described. My father was always saying the inn would be ruined, for people would soon cease coming there to be tyrannized over and put down, and sent shivering to their beds; but I really believe his presence did us good. People were frightened at the time, but on looking back they rather liked it; it was a fine excitement in a quiet country life, and there was even a party of the younger men who pretended to admire him, calling him a \u201ctrue sea-dog\u201d and a \u201creal old salt\u201d and such like names, and saying there was the sort of man that made England terrible at sea. In one way, indeed, he bade fair to ruin us, for he kept on staying week after week, and at last month after month, so that all the money had been long exhausted, and still my father never plucked up the heart to insist on having more. If ever he mentioned it, the captain blew through his nose so loudly that you might say he roared, and stared my poor father out of the room.", " \u201cSearch him, some of you shirking lubbers, and the rest of you aloft and get the chest,\u201d he cried. I could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs, so that the house must have shook with it. Promptly afterwards, fresh sounds of astonishment arose; the window of the captain's room was thrown open with a slam and a jingle of broken glass, and a man leaned out into the moonlight, head and shoulders, and addressed the blind beggar on the road below him. \u201cPew,\u201d he cried, \u201cthey've been before us. Someone's turned the chest out alow and aloft.\u201d \u201cIs it there?\u201d roared Pew. \u201cThe money's there.\u201d The blind man cursed the money. \u201cFlint's fist, I mean,\u201d he cried. \u201cWe don't see it here nohow,\u201d returned the man. \u201cHere, you below there, is it on Bill?\u201d cried the blind man again. At that another fellow, probably him who had remained below to search the captain's body, came to the door of the inn. \u201cBill's been overhauled a'ready,\u201d said he; \u201cnothin' left.\u201d \u201cIt's these people of the inn--it's that boy. I wish I had put his eyes out!\u201d cried the blind man, Pew. \u201cThere were no time ago--they had the door bolted when I tried it. Scatter, lads, and find 'em.\u201d \u201cSure enough, they left their glim here,\u201d said the fellow from the window. \u201cScatter and find 'em! Rout the house out!\u201d reiterated Pew, striking with his stick upon the road. Then there followed a great to-do through all our old inn, heavy feet pounding to and fro, furniture thrown over, doors kicked in, until the very rocks re-echoed and the men came out again, one after another, on the road and declared that we were nowhere to be found.", " But one look at the man before me was enough. I had seen the captain, and Black Dog, and the blind man, Pew, and I thought I knew what a buccaneer was like--a very different creature, according to me, from this clean and pleasant-tempered landlord. I plucked up courage at once, crossed the threshold, and walked right up to the man where he stood, propped on his crutch, talking to a customer. \u201cMr. Silver, sir?\u201d I asked, holding out the note. \u201cYes, my lad,\u201d said he; \u201csuch is my name, to be sure. And who may you be?\u201d And then as he saw the squire's letter, he seemed to me to give something almost like a start. \u201cOh!\u201d said he, quite loud, and offering his hand. \u201cI see. You are our new cabin-boy; pleased I am to see you.\u201d And he took my hand in his large firm grasp. Just then one of the customers at the far side rose suddenly and made for the door. It was close by him, and he was out in the street in a moment. But his hurry had attracted my notice, and I recognized him at glance. It was the tallow-faced man, wanting two fingers, who had come first to the Admiral Benbow. \u201cOh,\u201d I cried, \u201cstop him! It's Black Dog!\u201d \u201cI don't care two coppers who he is,\u201d cried Silver. \u201cBut he hasn't paid his score. Harry, run and catch him.\u201d One of the others who was nearest the door leaped up and started in pursuit. \u201cIf he were Admiral Hawke he shall pay his score,\u201d cried Silver; and then, relinquishing my hand, \u201cWho did you say he was?\u201d he asked.", " The doctor hailed them and told them of the stores we had left, and where they were to find them. But they continued to call us by name and appeal to us, for God's sake, to be merciful and not leave them to die in such a place. At last, seeing the ship still bore on her course and was now swiftly drawing out of earshot, one of them--I know not which it was--leapt to his feet with a hoarse cry, whipped his musket to his shoulder, and sent a shot whistling over Silver's head and through the main-sail. After that, we kept under cover of the bulwarks, and when next I looked out they had disappeared from the spit, and the spit itself had almost melted out of sight in the growing distance. That was, at least, the end of that; and before noon, to my inexpressible joy, the highest rock of Treasure Island had sunk into the blue round of sea. We were so short of men that everyone on board had to bear a hand--only the captain lying on a mattress in the stern and giving his orders, for though greatly recovered he was still in want of quiet. We laid her head for the nearest port in Spanish America, for we could not risk the voyage home without fresh hands; and as it was, what with baffling winds and a couple of fresh gales, we were all worn out before we reached it. It was just at sundown when we cast anchor in a most beautiful land-locked gulf, and were immediately surrounded by shore boats full of Negroes and Mexican Indians and half-bloods selling fruits and vegetables and offering to dive for bits of money."], "What does Jim believe the pirates were looking for when they raided the inn?": [" \u201cAnd when Ben Gunn is wanted, you know where to find him, Jim. Just wheer you found him today. And him that comes is to have a white thing in his hand, and he's to come alone. Oh! And you'll say this: 'Ben Gunn,' says you, 'has reasons of his own. '\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said I, \u201cI believe I understand. You have something to propose, and you wish to see the squire or the doctor, and you're to be found where I found you. Is that all?\u201d \u201cAnd when? says you,\u201d he added. \u201cWhy, from about noon observation to about six bells.\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d said I, \u201cand now may I go?\u201d \u201cYou won't forget?\u201d he inquired anxiously. \u201cPrecious sight, and reasons of his own, says you. Reasons of his own; that's the mainstay; as between man and man. Well, then\u201d--still holding me--\u201cI reckon you can go, Jim. And, Jim, if you was to see Silver, you wouldn't go for to sell Ben Gunn? Wild horses wouldn't draw it from you? No, says you. And if them pirates camp ashore, Jim, what would you say but there'd be widders in the morning?\u201d Here he was interrupted by a loud report, and a cannonball came tearing through the trees and pitched in the sand not a hundred yards from where we two were talking. The next moment each of us had taken to his heels in a different direction. For a good hour to come frequent reports shook the island, and balls kept crashing through the woods. I moved from hiding-place to hiding-place, always pursued, or so it seemed to me, by these terrifying missiles.", " But it were Providence that put me here. I've thought it all out in this here lonely island, and I'm back on piety. You don't catch me tasting rum so much, but just a thimbleful for luck, of course, the first chance I have. I'm bound I'll be good, and I see the way to. And, Jim\u201d--looking all round him and lowering his voice to a whisper--\u201cI'm rich.\u201d I now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude, and I suppose I must have shown the feeling in my face, for he repeated the statement hotly: \u201cRich! Rich! I says. And I'll tell you what: I'll make a man of you, Jim. Ah, Jim, you'll bless your stars, you will, you was the first that found me!\u201d And at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face, and he tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly before my eyes. \u201cNow, Jim, you tell me true: that ain't Flint's ship?\u201d he asked. At this I had a happy inspiration. I began to believe that I had found an ally, and I answered him at once. \u201cIt's not Flint's ship, and Flint is dead; but I'll tell you true, as you ask me--there are some of Flint's hands aboard; worse luck for the rest of us.\u201d \u201cNot a man--with one--leg?\u201d he gasped. \u201cSilver?\u201d I asked. \u201cAh, Silver!\u201d says he. \u201cThat were his name.\u201d \u201cHe's the cook, and the ringleader too.\u201d He was still holding me by the wrist, and at that he give it quite a wring. \u201cIf you was sent by Long John,\u201d he said, \u201cI'm as good as pork, and I know it.", " Nor would he allow anyone to leave the inn till he had drunk himself sleepy and reeled off to bed.

Under that, the miscellany began--a quadrant, a tin canikin, several sticks of tobacco, two brace of very handsome pistols, a piece of bar silver, an old Spanish watch and some other trinkets of little value and mostly of foreign make, a pair of compasses mounted with brass, and five or six curious West Indian shells. I have often wondered since why he should have carried about these shells with him in his wandering, guilty, and hunted life. In the meantime, we had found nothing of any value but the silver and the trinkets, and neither of these were in our way. Underneath there was an old boat-cloak, whitened with sea-salt on many a harbour-bar. My mother pulled it up with impatience, and there lay before us, the last things in the chest, a bundle tied up in oilcloth, and looking like papers, and a canvas bag that gave forth, at a touch, the jingle of gold. \u201cI'll show these rogues that I'm an honest woman,\u201d said my mother. \u201cI'll have my dues, and not a farthing over.

It was a long, difficult business, for the coins were of all countries and sizes--doubloons, and louis d'ors, and guineas, and pieces of eight, and I know not what besides, all shaken together at random. The guineas, too, were about the scarcest, and it was with these only that my mother knew how to make her count."], "Where does Jim find Dr. Livesey after deciding to show him Billy\u2019s papers?": [" And, now I come to think of it, I might as well ride round there myself and report to him or squire. Master Pew's dead, when all's done; not that I regret it, but he's dead, you see, and people will make it out against an officer of his Majesty's revenue, if make it out they can. Now, I'll tell you, Hawkins, if you like, I'll take you along.\u201d I thanked him heartily for the offer, and we walked back to the hamlet where the horses were. By the time I had told mother of my purpose they were all in the saddle. \u201cDogger,\u201d said Mr. Dance, \u201cyou have a good horse; take up this lad behind you.\u201d As soon as I was mounted, holding on to Dogger's belt, the supervisor gave the word, and the party struck out at a bouncing trot on the road to Dr. Livesey's house. 6 The Captain's Papers WE rode hard all the way till we drew up before Dr. Livesey's door. The house was all dark to the front. Mr. Dance told me to jump down and knock, and Dogger gave me a stirrup to descend by. The door was opened almost at once by the maid. \u201cIs Dr. Livesey in?\u201d I asked. No, she said, he had come home in the afternoon but had gone up to the hall to dine and pass the evening with the squire. \u201cSo there we go, boys,\u201d said Mr. Dance. This time, as the distance was short, I did not mount, but ran with Dogger's stirrup-leather to the lodge gates and up the long, leafless, moonlit avenue to where the white line of the hall buildings looked on either hand on great old gardens.", " But I'll go as far with you as I dare go, and a step beyond, for I'll have my wig sorted by the captain or I'm mistaken! And first, I'll give you a bit of hope; Silver, if we both get alive out of this wolf-trap, I'll do my best to save you, short of perjury.\u201d Silver's face was radiant. \u201cYou couldn't say more, I'm sure, sir, not if you was my mother,\u201d he cried. \u201cWell, that's my first concession,\u201d added the doctor. \u201cMy second is a piece of advice: keep the boy close beside you, and when you need help, halloo. I'm off to seek it for you, and that itself will show you if I speak at random. Good-bye, Jim.\u201d And Dr. Livesey shook hands with me through the stockade, nodded to Silver, and set off at a brisk pace into the wood. 31 The Treasure-hunt--Flint's Pointer \u201cJIM,\u201d said Silver when we were alone, \u201cif I saved your life, you saved mine; and I'll not forget it. I seen the doctor waving you to run for it--with the tail of my eye, I did; and I seen you say no, as plain as hearing. Jim, that's one to you. This is the first glint of hope I had since the attack failed, and I owe it you. And now, Jim, we're to go in for this here treasure-hunting, with sealed orders too, and I don't like it; and you and me must stick close, back to back like, and we'll save our necks in spite o' fate and fortune.\u201d Just then a man hailed us from the fire that breakfast was ready, and we were soon seated here and there about the sand over biscuit and fried junk.", " I don't like this cruise; I don't like the men; and I don't like my officer. That's short and sweet.\u201d \u201cPerhaps, sir, you don't like the ship?\u201d inquired the squire, very angry, as I could see. \u201cI can't speak as to that, sir, not having seen her tried,\u201d said the captain. \u201cShe seems a clever craft; more I can't say.\u201d \u201cPossibly, sir, you may not like your employer, either?\u201d says the squire. But here Dr. Livesey cut in. \u201cStay a bit,\u201d said he, \u201cstay a bit. No use of such questions as that but to produce ill feeling. The captain has said too much or he has said too little, and I'm bound to say that I require an explanation of his words. You don't, you say, like this cruise. Now, why?\u201d \u201cI was engaged, sir, on what we call sealed orders, to sail this ship for that gentleman where he should bid me,\u201d said the captain. \u201cSo far so good.

I don't call that fair, now, do you?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Dr. Livesey, \u201cI don't.\u201d \u201cNext,\u201d said the captain, \u201cI learn we are going after treasure--hear it from my own hands, mind you. Now, treasure is ticklish work; I don't like treasure voyages on any account, and I don't like them, above all, when they are secret and when (begging your pardon, Mr. Trelawney) the secret has been told to the parrot.\u201d \u201cSilver's parrot?\u201d asked the squire. \u201cIt's a way of speaking,\u201d said the captain. \u201cBlabbed, I mean. It's my belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about, but I'll tell you my way of it--life or death, and a close run.\u201d \u201cThat is all clear, and, I dare say, true enough,\u201d replied Dr. Livesey.", " The squire and I were both peering over his shoulder as he opened it, for Dr. Livesey had kindly motioned me to come round from the side-table, where I had been eating, to enjoy the sport of the search. On the first page there were only some scraps of writing, such as a man with a pen in his hand might make for idleness or practice. One was the same as the tattoo mark, \u201cBilly Bones his fancy\u201d; then there was \u201cMr. W. Bones, mate,\u201d \u201cNo more rum,\u201d \u201cOff Palm Key he got itt,\u201d and some other snatches, mostly single words and unintelligible. I could not help wondering who it was that had \u201cgot itt,\u201d and what \u201citt\u201d was that he got. A knife in his back as like as not. \u201cNot much instruction there,\u201d said Dr. Livesey as he passed on. The next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious series of entries. There was a date at one end of the line and at the other a sum of money, as in common account-books, but instead of explanatory writing, only a varying number of crosses between the two. On the 12th of June, 1745, for instance, a sum of seventy pounds had plainly become due to someone, and there was nothing but six crosses to explain the cause. In a few cases, to be sure, the name of a place would be added, as \u201cOffe Caraccas,\u201d or a mere entry of latitude and longitude, as \u201c62o 17' 20\u201d, 19o 2' 40\u201d.\u201d The record lasted over nearly twenty years, the amount of the separate entries growing larger as time went on, and at the end a grand total had been made out after five or six wrong additions, and these words appended, \u201cBones, his pile.\u201d \u201cI can't make head or tail of this,\u201d said Dr. Livesey."], "Trelawney and Livesey plan for Jim to be a/an ___ in their expedition to recover Flint\u2019s treasure.": [" But it were Providence that put me here. I've thought it all out in this here lonely island, and I'm back on piety. You don't catch me tasting rum so much, but just a thimbleful for luck, of course, the first chance I have. I'm bound I'll be good, and I see the way to. And, Jim\u201d--looking all round him and lowering his voice to a whisper--\u201cI'm rich.\u201d I now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude, and I suppose I must have shown the feeling in my face, for he repeated the statement hotly: \u201cRich! Rich! I says. And I'll tell you what: I'll make a man of you, Jim. Ah, Jim, you'll bless your stars, you will, you was the first that found me!\u201d And at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face, and he tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly before my eyes. \u201cNow, Jim, you tell me true: that ain't Flint's ship?\u201d he asked. At this I had a happy inspiration. I began to believe that I had found an ally, and I answered him at once. \u201cIt's not Flint's ship, and Flint is dead; but I'll tell you true, as you ask me--there are some of Flint's hands aboard; worse luck for the rest of us.\u201d \u201cNot a man--with one--leg?\u201d he gasped. \u201cSilver?\u201d I asked. \u201cAh, Silver!\u201d says he. \u201cThat were his name.\u201d \u201cHe's the cook, and the ringleader too.\u201d He was still holding me by the wrist, and at that he give it quite a wring. \u201cIf you was sent by Long John,\u201d he said, \u201cI'm as good as pork, and I know it.", " But I'll go as far with you as I dare go, and a step beyond, for I'll have my wig sorted by the captain or I'm mistaken!

The sun was getting up, and mortal white he looked about the cutwater. But, there he was, you mind, and the six all dead--dead and buried. How he done it, not a man aboard us could make out. It was battle, murder, and sudden death, leastways--him against six. Billy Bones was the mate; Long John, he was quartermaster; and they asked him where the treasure was. 'Ah,' says he, 'you can go ashore, if you like, and stay,' he says; 'but as for the ship, she'll beat up for more, by thunder!' That's what he said. \u201cWell, I was in another ship three years back, and we sighted this island. 'Boys,' said I, 'here's Flint's treasure; let's land and find it.' The cap'n was displeased at that, but my messmates were all of a mind and landed. Twelve days they looked for it, and every day they had the worse word for me, until one fine morning all hands went aboard. 'As for you, Benjamin Gunn,' says they, 'here's a musket,' they says, 'and a spade, and pick-axe. You can stay here and find Flint's money for yourself,' they says. \u201cWell, Jim, three years have I been here, and not a bite of Christian diet from that day to this. But now, you look here; look at me. Do I look like a man before the mast? No, says you. Nor I weren't, neither, I says.\u201d And with that he winked and pinched me hard."], "Who does Trelawney hire as the ship\u2019s cook?": [" They go the length of declaring that this honest creature would do anything for money, that the HISPANIOLA belonged to him, and that he sold it me absurdly high--the most transparent calumnies. None of them dare, however, to deny the merits of the ship. So far there was not a hitch. The workpeople, to be sure--riggers and what not--were most annoyingly slow; but time cured that. It was the crew that troubled me. I wished a round score of men--in case of natives, buccaneers, or the odious French--and I had the worry of the deuce itself to find so much as half a dozen, till the most remarkable stroke of fortune brought me the very man that I required. I was standing on the dock, when, by the merest accident, I fell in talk with him. I found he was an old sailor, kept a public-house, knew all the seafaring men in Bristol, had lost his health ashore, and wanted a good berth as cook to get to sea again. He had hobbled down there that morning, he said, to get a smell of the salt. I was monstrously touched--so would you have been--and, out of pure pity, I engaged him on the spot to be ship's cook. Long John Silver, he is called, and has lost a leg; but that I regarded as a recommendation, since he lost it in his country's service, under the immortal Hawke. He has no pension, Livesey. Imagine the abominable age we live in! Well, sir, I thought I had only found a cook, but it was a crew I had discovered.", " It is for you to speak,\u201d says Mr. Trelawney grandly. \u201cFirst point,\u201d began Mr. Smollett. \u201cWe must go on, because we can't turn back. If I gave the word to go about, they would rise at once. Second point, we have time before us--at least until this treasure's found. Third point, there are faithful hands. Now, sir, it's got to come to blows sooner or later, and what I propose is to take time by the forelock, as the saying is, and come to blows some fine day when they least expect it. We can count, I take it, on your own home servants, Mr. Trelawney?\u201d \u201cAs upon myself,\u201d declared the squire. \u201cThree,\u201d reckoned the captain; \u201courselves make seven, counting Hawkins here. Now, about the honest hands?\u201d \u201cMost likely Trelawney's own men,\u201d said the doctor; \u201cthose he had picked up for himself before he lit on Silver.\u201d \u201cNay,\u201d replied the squire. \u201cHands was one of mine.\u201d \u201cI did think I could have trusted Hands,\u201d added the captain. \u201cAnd to think that they're all Englishmen!\u201d broke out the squire. \u201cSir, I could find it in my heart to blow the ship up.\u201d \u201cWell, gentlemen,\u201d said the captain, \u201cthe best that I can say is not much. We must lay to, if you please, and keep a bright lookout. It's trying on a man, I know. It would be pleasanter to come to blows. But there's no help for it till we know our men. Lay to, and whistle for a wind, that's my view.\u201d \u201cJim here,\u201d said the doctor, \u201ccan help us more than anyone.", " Watch him as we pleased, we could do nothing to solve it; and when we asked him to his face, he would only laugh if he were drunk, and if he were sober deny solemnly that he ever tasted anything but water. He was not only useless as an officer and a bad influence amongst the men, but it was plain that at this rate he must soon kill himself outright, so nobody was much surprised, nor very sorry, when one dark night, with a head sea, he disappeared entirely and was seen no more. \u201cOverboard!\u201d said the captain. \u201cWell, gentlemen, that saves the trouble of putting him in irons.\u201d But there we were, without a mate; and it was necessary, of course, to advance one of the men. The boatswain, Job Anderson, was the likeliest man aboard, and though he kept his old title, he served in a way as mate. Mr. Trelawney had followed the sea, and his knowledge made him very useful, for he often took a watch himself in easy weather. And the coxswain, Israel Hands, was a careful, wily, old, experienced seaman who could be trusted at a pinch with almost anything. He was a great confidant of Long John Silver, and so the mention of his name leads me on to speak of our ship's cook, Barbecue, as the men called him. Aboard ship he carried his crutch by a lanyard round his neck, to have both hands as free as possible. It was something to see him wedge the foot of the crutch against a bulkhead, and propped against it, yielding to every movement of the ship, get on with his cooking like someone safe ashore.", " \u201cYes,\u201d said one, \u201cthat's Flint, sure enough. J. F., and a score below, with a clove hitch to it; so he done ever.\u201d \u201cMighty pretty,\u201d said George. \u201cBut how are we to get away with it, and us no ship.\u201d Silver suddenly sprang up, and supporting himself with a hand against the wall: \u201cNow I give you warning, George,\u201d he cried. \u201cOne more word of your sauce, and I'll call you down and fight you. How? Why, how do I know? You had ought to tell me that--you and the rest, that lost me my schooner, with your interference, burn you! But not you, you can't; you hain't got the invention of a cockroach. But civil you can speak, and shall, George Merry, you may lay to that.\u201d \u201cThat's fair enow,\u201d said the old man Morgan. \u201cFair! I reckon so,\u201d said the sea-cook. \u201cYou lost the ship; I found the treasure. Who's the better man at that? And now I resign, by thunder! Elect whom you please to be your cap'n now; I'm done with it.\u201d \u201cSilver!\u201d they cried. \u201cBarbecue forever! Barbecue for cap'n!\u201d \u201cSo that's the toon, is it?\u201d cried the cook. \u201cGeorge, I reckon you'll have to wait another turn, friend; and lucky for you as I'm not a revengeful man. But that was never my way. And now, shipmates, this black spot? 'Tain't much good now, is it? Dick's crossed his luck and spoiled his Bible, and that's about all.\u201d \u201cIt'll do to kiss the book on still, won't it?\u201d growled Dick, who was evidently uneasy at the curse he had brought upon himself."], "From what city does Trelawney\u2019s ship, the Hispaniola, sail?": [" \u201cGod save the king!\u201d said I, waving my cap. \u201cAnd there's an end to Captain Silver!\u201d He watched me keenly and slyly, his chin all the while on his breast. \u201cI reckon,\u201d he said at last, \u201cI reckon, Cap'n Hawkins, you'll kind of want to get ashore now. S'pose we talks.\u201d \u201cWhy, yes,\u201d says I, \u201cwith all my heart, Mr. Hands. Say on.\u201d And I went back to my meal with a good appetite. \u201cThis man,\u201d he began, nodding feebly at the corpse \u201c--O'Brien were his name, a rank Irelander--this man and me got the canvas on her, meaning for to sail her back. Well, HE'S dead now, he is--as dead as bilge; and who's to sail this ship, I don't see. Without I gives you a hint, you ain't that man, as far's I can tell. Now, look here, you gives me food and drink and a old scarf or ankecher to tie my wound up, you do, and I'll tell you how to sail her, and that's about square all round, I take it.\u201d \u201cI'll tell you one thing,\u201d says I: \u201cI'm not going back to Captain Kidd's anchorage. I mean to get into North Inlet and beach her quietly there.\u201d \u201cTo be sure you did,\u201d he cried. \u201cWhy, I ain't sich an infernal lubber after all. I can see, can't I? I've tried my fling, I have, and I've lost, and it's you has the wind of me. North Inlet? Why, I haven't no ch'ice, not I! I'd help you sail her up to Execution Dock, by thunder! So I would.\u201d Well, as it seemed to me, there was some sense in this. We struck our bargain on the spot.", " In one, sailors were singing at their work, in another there were men aloft, high over my head, hanging to threads that seemed no thicker than a spider's. Though I had lived by the shore all my life, I seemed never to have been near the sea till then. The smell of tar and salt was something new. I saw the most wonderful figureheads, that had all been far over the ocean. I saw, besides, many old sailors, with rings in their ears, and whiskers curled in ringlets, and tarry pigtails, and their swaggering, clumsy sea-walk; and if I had seen as many kings or archbishops I could not have been more delighted. And I was going to sea myself, to sea in a schooner, with a piping boatswain and pig-tailed singing seamen, to sea, bound for an unknown island, and to seek for buried treasure! While I was still in this delightful dream, we came suddenly in front of a large inn and met Squire Trelawney, all dressed out like a sea-officer, in stout blue cloth, coming out of the door with a smile on his face and a capital imitation of a sailor's walk. \u201cHere you are,\u201d he cried, \u201cand the doctor came last night from London. Bravo! The ship's company complete!\u201d \u201cOh, sir,\u201d cried I, \u201cwhen do we sail?\u201d \u201cSail!\u201d says he. \u201cWe sail tomorrow!\u201d 8 At the Sign of the Spy-glass WHEN I had done breakfasting the squire gave me a note addressed to John Silver, at the sign of the Spy-glass, and told me I should easily find the place by following the line of the docks and keeping a bright lookout for a little tavern with a large brass telescope for sign.", " I am afraid I led that boy a dog's life, for as he was new to the work, I had a hundred opportunities of setting him right and putting him down, and I was not slow to profit by them. The night passed, and the next day, after dinner, Redruth and I were afoot again and on the road. I said good-bye to Mother and the cove where I had lived since I was born, and the dear old Admiral Benbow--since he was repainted, no longer quite so dear. One of my last thoughts was of the captain, who had so often strode along the beach with his cocked hat, his sabre-cut cheek, and his old brass telescope. Next moment we had turned the corner and my home was out of sight. The mail picked us up about dusk at the Royal George on the heath. I was wedged in between Redruth and a stout old gentleman, and in spite of the swift motion and the cold night air, I must have dozed a great deal from the very first, and then slept like a log up hill and down dale through stage after stage, for when I was awakened at last it was by a punch in the ribs, and I opened my eyes to find that we were standing still before a large building in a city street and that the day had already broken a long time. \u201cWhere are we?\u201d I asked. \u201cBristol,\u201d said Tom. \u201cGet down.\u201d Mr. Trelawney had taken up his residence at an inn far down the docks to superintend the work upon the schooner. Thither we had now to walk, and our way, to my great delight, lay along the quays and beside the great multitude of ships of all sizes and rigs and nations.", " There I lay on my elbows in the most trying attitude, and every now and again gave a weak stroke or two to turn her head to shore. It was very tiring and slow work, yet I did visibly gain ground; and as we drew near the Cape of the Woods, though I saw I must infallibly miss that point, I had still made some hundred yards of easting. I was, indeed, close in. I could see the cool green tree-tops swaying together in the breeze, and I felt sure I should make the next promontory without fail. It was high time, for I now began to be tortured with thirst. The glow of the sun from above, its thousandfold reflection from the waves, the sea-water that fell and dried upon me, caking my very lips with salt, combined to make my throat burn and my brain ache. The sight of the trees so near at hand had almost made me sick with longing, but the current had soon carried me past the point, and as the next reach of sea opened out, I beheld a sight that changed the nature of my thoughts. Right in front of me, not half a mile away, I beheld the HISPANIOLA under sail. I made sure, of course, that I should be taken; but I was so distressed for want of water that I scarce knew whether to be glad or sorry at the thought, and long before I had come to a conclusion, surprise had taken entire possession of my mind and I could do nothing but stare and wonder. The HISPANIOLA was under her main-sail and two jibs, and the beautiful white canvas shone in the sun like snow or silver."], "Who speaks openly about his dislike of the crew and his bad feeling about the voyage?": [" \u201cThat's a good man, captain,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cVery likely, sir,\u201d replied Captain Smollett. \u201cEasy with that, men--easy,\u201d he ran on, to the fellows who were shifting the powder; and then suddenly observing me examining the swivel we carried amidships, a long brass nine, \u201cHere you, ship's boy,\u201d he cried, \u201cout o' that! Off with you to the cook and get some work.\u201d And then as I was hurrying off I heard him say, quite loudly, to the doctor, \u201cI'll have no favourites on my ship.\u201d I assure you I was quite of the squire's way of thinking, and hated the captain deeply. 10 The Voyage ALL that night we were in a great bustle getting things stowed in their place, and boatfuls of the squire's friends, Mr. Blandly and the like, coming off to wish him a good voyage and a safe return. We never had a night at the Admiral Benbow when I had half the work; and I was dog-tired when, a little before dawn, the boatswain sounded his pipe and the crew began to man the capstan-bars. I might have been twice as weary, yet I would not have left the deck, all was so new and interesting to me--the brief commands, the shrill note of the whistle, the men bustling to their places in the glimmer of the ship's lanterns. \u201cNow, Barbecue, tip us a stave,\u201d cried one voice. \u201cThe old one,\u201d cried another. \u201cAye, aye, mates,\u201d said Long John, who was standing by, with his crutch under his arm, and at once broke out in the air and words I knew so well: \u201cFifteen men on the dead man's chest--\u201d And then the whole crew bore chorus:-- \u201cYo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!\u201d And at the third \u201cHo!\u201d drove the bars before them with a will.", " Even at that exciting moment it carried me back to the old Admiral Benbow in a second, and I seemed to hear the voice of the captain piping in the chorus. But soon the anchor was short up; soon it was hanging dripping at the bows; soon the sails began to draw, and the land and shipping to flit by on either side; and before I could lie down to snatch an hour of slumber the HISPANIOLA had begun her voyage to the Isle of Treasure. I am not going to relate that voyage in detail. It was fairly prosperous. The ship proved to be a good ship, the crew were capable seamen, and the captain thoroughly understood his business. But before we came the length of Treasure Island, two or three things had happened which require to be known. Mr. Arrow, first of all, turned out even worse than the captain had feared. He had no command among the men, and people did what they pleased with him. But that was by no means the worst of it, for after a day or two at sea he began to appear on deck with hazy eye, red cheeks, stuttering tongue, and other marks of drunkenness. Time after time he was ordered below in disgrace. Sometimes he fell and cut himself; sometimes he lay all day long in his little bunk at one side of the companion; sometimes for a day or two he would be almost sober and attend to his work at least passably. In the meantime, we could never make out where he got the drink. That was the ship's mystery.", " \u201cAh,\u201d says he, \u201cthis here is a sweet spot, this island--a sweet spot for a lad to get ashore on. You'll bathe, and you'll climb trees, and you'll hunt goats, you will; and you'll get aloft on them hills like a goat yourself. Why, it makes me young again. I was going to forget my timber leg, I was. It's a pleasant thing to be young and have ten toes, and you may lay to that. When you want to go a bit of exploring, you just ask old John, and he'll put up a snack for you to take along.\u201d And clapping me in the friendliest way upon the shoulder, he hobbled off forward and went below. Captain Smollett, the squire, and Dr. Livesey were talking together on the quarter-deck, and anxious as I was to tell them my story, I durst not interrupt them openly. While I was still casting about in my thoughts to find some probable excuse, Dr. Livesey called me to his side. He had left his pipe below, and being a slave to tobacco, had meant that I should fetch it; but as soon as I was near enough to speak and not to be overheard, I broke immediately, \u201cDoctor, let me speak. Get the captain and squire down to the cabin, and then make some pretence to send for me. I have terrible news.\u201d The doctor changed countenance a little, but next moment he was master of himself. \u201cThank you, Jim,\u201d said he quite loudly, \u201cthat was all I wanted to know,\u201d as if he had asked me a question. And with that he turned on his heel and rejoined the other two.", " Now, however, when I had nothing else to do, I began to pay more heed. One I recognized for the coxswain's, Israel Hands, that had been Flint's gunner in former days. The other was, of course, my friend of the red night-cap. Both men were plainly the worse of drink, and they were still drinking, for even while I was listening, one of them, with a drunken cry, opened the stern window and threw out something, which I divined to be an empty bottle. But they were not only tipsy; it was plain that they were furiously angry. Oaths flew like hailstones, and every now and then there came forth such an explosion as I thought was sure to end in blows. But each time the quarrel passed off and the voices grumbled lower for a while, until the next crisis came and in its turn passed away without result. On shore, I could see the glow of the great camp-fire burning warmly through the shore-side trees. Someone was singing, a dull, old, droning sailor's song, with a droop and a quaver at the end of every verse, and seemingly no end to it at all but the patience of the singer. I had heard it on the voyage more than once and remembered these words: \u201cBut one man of her crew alive, What put to sea with seventy-five.\u201d And I thought it was a ditty rather too dolefully appropriate for a company that had met such cruel losses in the morning. But, indeed, from what I saw, all these buccaneers were as callous as the sea they sailed on."], "What does Jim learn about most of the sailors while eavesdropping on Long John Silver?": [" In one, sailors were singing at their work, in another there were men aloft, high over my head, hanging to threads that seemed no thicker than a spider's. Though I had lived by the shore all my life, I seemed never to have been near the sea till then. The smell of tar and salt was something new. I saw the most wonderful figureheads, that had all been far over the ocean. I saw, besides, many old sailors, with rings in their ears, and whiskers curled in ringlets, and tarry pigtails, and their swaggering, clumsy sea-walk; and if I had seen as many kings or archbishops I could not have been more delighted. And I was going to sea myself, to sea in a schooner, with a piping boatswain and pig-tailed singing seamen, to sea, bound for an unknown island, and to seek for buried treasure! While I was still in this delightful dream, we came suddenly in front of a large inn and met Squire Trelawney, all dressed out like a sea-officer, in stout blue cloth, coming out of the door with a smile on his face and a capital imitation of a sailor's walk. \u201cHere you are,\u201d he cried, \u201cand the doctor came last night from London. Bravo! The ship's company complete!\u201d \u201cOh, sir,\u201d cried I, \u201cwhen do we sail?\u201d \u201cSail!\u201d says he. \u201cWe sail tomorrow!\u201d 8 At the Sign of the Spy-glass WHEN I had done breakfasting the squire gave me a note addressed to John Silver, at the sign of the Spy-glass, and told me I should easily find the place by following the line of the docks and keeping a bright lookout for a little tavern with a large brass telescope for sign.", " Crawling on all fours, I made steadily but slowly towards them, till at last, raising my head to an aperture among the leaves, I could see clear down into a little green dell beside the marsh, and closely set about with trees, where Long John Silver and another of the crew stood face to face in conversation. The sun beat full upon them. Silver had thrown his hat beside him on the ground, and his great, smooth, blond face, all shining with heat, was lifted to the other man's in a kind of appeal. \u201cMate,\u201d he was saying, \u201cit's because I thinks gold dust of you--gold dust, and you may lay to that! If I hadn't took to you like pitch, do you think I'd have been here a-warning of you? All's up--you can't make nor mend; it's to save your neck that I'm a-speaking, and if one of the wild uns knew it, where'd I be, Tom--now, tell me, where'd I be?\u201d \u201cSilver,\u201d said the other man--and I observed he was not only red in the face, but spoke as hoarse as a crow, and his voice shook too, like a taut rope--\u201cSilver,\u201d says he, \u201cyou're old, and you're honest, or has the name for it; and you've money too, which lots of poor sailors hasn't; and you're brave, or I'm mistook. And will you tell me you'll let yourself be led away with that kind of a mess of swabs? Not you! As sure as God sees me, I'd sooner lose my hand. If I turn agin my dooty--\u201d And then all of a sudden he was interrupted by a noise. I had found one of the honest hands--well, here, at that same moment, came news of another.", " But I see you was the right sort. I says to myself, you stand by Hawkins, John, and Hawkins'll stand by you. You're his last card, and by the living thunder, John, he's yours! Back to back, says I. You save your witness, and he'll save your neck!\u201d I began dimly to understand. \u201cYou mean all's lost?\u201d I asked. \u201cAye, by gum, I do!\u201d he answered. \u201cShip gone, neck gone--that's the size of it. Once I looked into that bay, Jim Hawkins, and seen no schooner--well, I'm tough, but I gave out. As for that lot and their council, mark me, they're outright fools and cowards. I'll save your life--if so be as I can--from them. But, see here, Jim--tit for tat--you save Long John from swinging.\u201d I was bewildered; it seemed a thing so hopeless he was asking--he, the old buccaneer, the ringleader throughout. \u201cWhat I can do, that I'll do,\u201d I said. \u201cIt's a bargain!\u201d cried Long John. \u201cYou speak up plucky, and by thunder, I've a chance!\u201d He hobbled to the torch, where it stood propped among the firewood, and took a fresh light to his pipe. \u201cUnderstand me, Jim,\u201d he said, returning. \u201cI've a head on my shoulders, I have. I'm on squire's side now. I know you've got that ship safe somewheres. How you done it, I don't know, but safe it is. I guess Hands and O'Brien turned soft. I never much believed in neither of THEM. Now you mark me. I ask no questions, nor I won't let others. I know when a game's up, I do; and I know a lad that's staunch.", " Far away out in the marsh there arose, all of a sudden, a sound like the cry of anger, then another on the back of it; and then one horrid, long-drawn scream. The rocks of the Spy-glass re-echoed it a score of times; the whole troop of marsh-birds rose again, darkening heaven, with a simultaneous whirr; and long after that death yell was still ringing in my brain, silence had re-established its empire, and only the rustle of the redescending birds and the boom of the distant surges disturbed the languor of the afternoon. Tom had leaped at the sound, like a horse at the spur, but Silver had not winked an eye. He stood where he was, resting lightly on his crutch, watching his companion like a snake about to spring. \u201cJohn!\u201d said the sailor, stretching out his hand. \u201cHands off!\u201d cried Silver, leaping back a yard, as it seemed to me, with the speed and security of a trained gymnast. \u201cHands off, if you like, John Silver,\u201d said the other. \u201cIt's a black conscience that can make you feared of me. But in heaven's name, tell me, what was that?\u201d \u201cThat?\u201d returned Silver, smiling away, but warier than ever, his eye a mere pin-point in his big face, but gleaming like a crumb of glass. \u201cThat? Oh, I reckon that'll be Alan.\u201d And at this point Tom flashed out like a hero. \u201cAlan!\u201d he cried. \u201cThen rest his soul for a true seaman! And as for you, John Silver, long you've been a mate of mine, but you're mate of mine no more."], "What feature is missing from the copy of the treasure map that Jim sees Smollett using?": [" \u201cOne more,\u201d said the captain. \u201cThere's been too much blabbing already.\u201d \u201cFar too much,\u201d agreed the doctor. \u201cI'll tell you what I've heard myself,\u201d continued Captain Smollett: \u201cthat you have a map of an island, that there's crosses on the map to show where treasure is, and that the island lies--\u201d And then he named the latitude and longitude exactly. \u201cI never told that,\u201d cried the squire, \u201cto a soul!\u201d \u201cThe hands know it, sir,\u201d returned the captain. \u201cLivesey, that must have been you or Hawkins,\u201d cried the squire. \u201cIt doesn't much matter who it was,\u201d replied the doctor. And I could see that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to Mr. Trelawney's protestations. Neither did I, to be sure, he was so loose a talker; yet in this case I believe he was really right and that nobody had told the situation of the island. \u201cWell, gentlemen,\u201d continued the captain, \u201cI don't know who has this map; but I make it a point, it shall be kept secret even from me and Mr. Arrow. Otherwise I would ask you to let me resign.\u201d \u201cI see,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cYou wish us to keep this matter dark and to make a garrison of the stern part of the ship, manned with my friend's own people, and provided with all the arms and powder on board. In other words, you fear a mutiny.\u201d \u201cSir,\u201d said Captain Smollett, \u201cwith no intention to take offence, I deny your right to put words into my mouth. No captain, sir, would be justified in going to sea at all if he had ground enough to say that.", " \u201cSee if that's the place.\u201d Long John's eyes burned in his head as he took the chart, but by the fresh look of the paper I knew he was doomed to disappointment. This was not the map we found in Billy Bones's chest, but an accurate copy, complete in all things--names and heights and soundings--with the single exception of the red crosses and the written notes. Sharp as must have been his annoyance, Silver had the strength of mind to hide it. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d said he, \u201cthis is the spot, to be sure, and very prettily drawed out. Who might have done that, I wonder? The pirates were too ignorant, I reckon. Aye, here it is: 'Capt. Kidd's Anchorage'--just the name my shipmate called it. There's a strong current runs along the south, and then away nor'ard up the west coast. Right you was, sir,\u201d says he, \u201cto haul your wind and keep the weather of the island. Leastways, if such was your intention as to enter and careen, and there ain't no better place for that in these waters.\u201d \u201cThank you, my man,\u201d says Captain Smollett. \u201cI'll ask you later on to give us a help. You may go.\u201d I was surprised at the coolness with which John avowed his knowledge of the island, and I own I was half-frightened when I saw him drawing nearer to myself. He did not know, to be sure, that I had overheard his council from the apple barrel, and yet I had by this time taken such a horror of his cruelty, duplicity, and power that I could scarce conceal a shudder when he laid his hand upon my arm.", " I've had a'most enough o' Cap'n Smollett; he's hazed me long enough, by thunder! I want to go into that cabin, I do. I want their pickles and wines, and that.\u201d \u201cIsrael,\u201d said Silver, \u201cyour head ain't much account, nor ever was. But you're able to hear, I reckon; leastways, your ears is big enough. Now, here's what I say: you'll berth forward, and you'll live hard, and you'll speak soft, and you'll keep sober till I give the word; and you may lay to that, my son.\u201d \u201cWell, I don't say no, do I?\u201d growled the coxswain. \u201cWhat I say is, when? That's what I say.\u201d \u201cWhen! By the powers!\u201d cried Silver. \u201cWell now, if you want to know, I'll tell you when. The last moment I can manage, and that's when. Here's a first-rate seaman, Cap'n Smollett, sails the blessed ship for us. Here's this squire and doctor with a map and such--I don't know where it is, do I? No more do you, says you. Well then, I mean this squire and doctor shall find the stuff, and help us to get it aboard, by the powers. Then we'll see. If I was sure of you all, sons of double Dutchmen, I'd have Cap'n Smollett navigate us half-way back again before I struck.\u201d \u201cWhy, we're all seamen aboard here, I should think,\u201d said the lad Dick. \u201cWe're all forecastle hands, you mean,\u201d snapped Silver. \u201cWe can steer a course, but who's to set one? That's what all you gentlemen split on, first and last. If I had my way, I'd have Cap'n Smollett work us back into the trades at least; then we'd have no blessed miscalculations and a spoonful of water a day.", " But I'll go as far with you as I dare go, and a step beyond, for I'll have my wig sorted by the captain or I'm mistaken! And first, I'll give you a bit of hope; Silver, if we both get alive out of this wolf-trap, I'll do my best to save you, short of perjury.\u201d Silver's face was radiant. \u201cYou couldn't say more, I'm sure, sir, not if you was my mother,\u201d he cried. \u201cWell, that's my first concession,\u201d added the doctor. \u201cMy second is a piece of advice: keep the boy close beside you, and when you need help, halloo. I'm off to seek it for you, and that itself will show you if I speak at random. Good-bye, Jim.\u201d And Dr. Livesey shook hands with me through the stockade, nodded to Silver, and set off at a brisk pace into the wood. 31 The Treasure-hunt--Flint's Pointer \u201cJIM,\u201d said Silver when we were alone, \u201cif I saved your life, you saved mine; and I'll not forget it. I seen the doctor waving you to run for it--with the tail of my eye, I did; and I seen you say no, as plain as hearing. Jim, that's one to you. This is the first glint of hope I had since the attack failed, and I owe it you. And now, Jim, we're to go in for this here treasure-hunting, with sealed orders too, and I don't like it; and you and me must stick close, back to back like, and we'll save our necks in spite o' fate and fortune.\u201d Just then a man hailed us from the fire that breakfast was ready, and we were soon seated here and there about the sand over biscuit and fried junk."], "Who notices that Jim has hidden in one of the pirate\u2019s boats and is catching a ride to the island?": [" The HISPANIOLA was rolling scuppers under in the ocean swell. The booms were tearing at the blocks, the rudder was banging to and fro, and the whole ship creaking, groaning, and jumping like a manufactory. I had to cling tight to the backstay, and the world turned giddily before my eyes, for though I was a good enough sailor when there was way on, this standing still and being rolled about like a bottle was a thing I never learned to stand without a qualm or so, above all in the morning, on an empty stomach. Perhaps it was this--perhaps it was the look of the island, with its grey, melancholy woods, and wild stone spires, and the surf that we could both see and hear foaming and thundering on the steep beach--at least, although the sun shone bright and hot, and the shore birds were fishing and crying all around us, and you would have thought anyone would have been glad to get to land after being so long at sea, my heart sank, as the saying is, into my boots; and from the first look onward, I hated the very thought of Treasure Island. We had a dreary morning's work before us, for there was no sign of any wind, and the boats had to be got out and manned, and the ship warped three or four miles round the corner of the island and up the narrow passage to the haven behind Skeleton Island. I volunteered for one of the boats, where I had, of course, no business. The heat was sweltering, and the men grumbled fiercely over their work.", " All they would do was to give me a loaded pistol lest we were attacked, and to promise to have horses ready saddled in case we were pursued on our return, while one lad was to ride forward to the doctor's in search of armed assistance. My heart was beating finely when we two set forth in the cold night upon this dangerous venture. A full moon was beginning to rise and peered redly through the upper edges of the fog, and this increased our haste, for it was plain, before we came forth again, that all would be as bright as day, and our departure exposed to the eyes of any watchers. We slipped along the hedges, noiseless and swift, nor did we see or hear anything to increase our terrors, till, to our relief, the door of the Admiral Benbow had closed behind us. I slipped the bolt at once, and we stood and panted for a moment in the dark, alone in the house with the dead captain's body. Then my mother got a candle in the bar, and holding each other's hands, we advanced into the parlour. He lay as we had left him, on his back, with his eyes open and one arm stretched out. \u201cDraw down the blind, Jim,\u201d whispered my mother; \u201cthey might come and watch outside. And now,\u201d said she when I had done so, \u201cwe have to get the key off THAT; and who's to touch it, I should like to know!\u201d and she gave a kind of sob as she said the words. I went down on my knees at once. On the floor close to his hand there was a little round of paper, blackened on the one side.", " But it were Providence that put me here. I've thought it all out in this here lonely island, and I'm back on piety. You don't catch me tasting rum so much, but just a thimbleful for luck, of course, the first chance I have. I'm bound I'll be good, and I see the way to. And, Jim\u201d--looking all round him and lowering his voice to a whisper--\u201cI'm rich.\u201d I now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude, and I suppose I must have shown the feeling in my face, for he repeated the statement hotly: \u201cRich! Rich! I says. And I'll tell you what: I'll make a man of you, Jim. Ah, Jim, you'll bless your stars, you will, you was the first that found me!\u201d And at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face, and he tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly before my eyes. \u201cNow, Jim, you tell me true: that ain't Flint's ship?\u201d he asked. At this I had a happy inspiration. I began to believe that I had found an ally, and I answered him at once. \u201cIt's not Flint's ship, and Flint is dead; but I'll tell you true, as you ask me--there are some of Flint's hands aboard; worse luck for the rest of us.\u201d \u201cNot a man--with one--leg?\u201d he gasped. \u201cSilver?\u201d I asked. \u201cAh, Silver!\u201d says he. \u201cThat were his name.\u201d \u201cHe's the cook, and the ringleader too.\u201d He was still holding me by the wrist, and at that he give it quite a wring. \u201cIf you was sent by Long John,\u201d he said, \u201cI'm as good as pork, and I know it.", " We must none of us go alone till we get to sea. Jim and I shall stick together in the meanwhile; you'll take Joyce and Hunter when you ride to Bristol, and from first to last, not one of us must breathe a word of what we've found.\u201d \u201cLivesey,\u201d returned the squire, \u201cyou are always in the right of it. I'll be as silent as the grave.\u201d PART TWO--The Sea-cook 7 I Go to Bristol IT was longer than the squire imagined ere we were ready for the sea, and none of our first plans--not even Dr. Livesey's, of keeping me beside him--could be carried out as we intended. The doctor had to go to London for a physician to take charge of his practice; the squire was hard at work at Bristol; and I lived on at the hall under the charge of old Redruth, the gamekeeper, almost a prisoner, but full of sea-dreams and the most charming anticipations of strange islands and adventures. I brooded by the hour together over the map, all the details of which I well remembered. Sitting by the fire in the housekeeper's room, I approached that island in my fancy from every possible direction; I explored every acre of its surface; I climbed a thousand times to that tall hill they call the Spy-glass, and from the top enjoyed the most wonderful and changing prospects. Sometimes the isle was thick with savages, with whom we fought, sometimes full of dangerous animals that hunted us, but in all my fancies nothing occurred to me so strange and tragic as our actual adventures."], "What does Tom Redruth do when Silver says that his life rides on whether or not he joins the mutiny?": [" \u201cIt was him that knowed Black Dog.\u201d \u201cWell, and see here,\u201d added the sea-cook. \u201cI'll put another again to that, by thunder! For it was this same boy that faked the chart from Billy Bones. First and last, we've split upon Jim Hawkins!\u201d \u201cThen here goes!\u201d said Morgan with an oath. And he sprang up, drawing his knife as if he had been twenty. \u201cAvast, there!\u201d cried Silver. \u201cWho are you, Tom Morgan? Maybe you thought you was cap'n here, perhaps. By the powers, but I'll teach you better! Cross me, and you'll go where many a good man's gone before you, first and last, these thirty year back--some to the yard-arm, shiver my timbers, and some by the board, and all to feed the fishes. There's never a man looked me between the eyes and seen a good day a'terwards, Tom Morgan, you may lay to that.\u201d Morgan paused, but a hoarse murmur rose from the others. \u201cTom's right,\u201d said one. \u201cI stood hazing long enough from one,\u201d added another. \u201cI'll be hanged if I'll be hazed by you, John Silver.\u201d \u201cDid any of you gentlemen want to have it out with ME?\u201d roared Silver, bending far forward from his position on the keg, with his pipe still glowing in his right hand. \u201cPut a name on what you're at; you ain't dumb, I reckon. Him that wants shall get it. Have I lived this many years, and a son of a rum puncheon cock his hat athwart my hawse at the latter end of it? You know the way; you're all gentlemen o' fortune, by your account.", " So the weeks passed on, till one fine day there came a letter addressed to Dr. Livesey, with this addition, \u201cTo be opened, in the case of his absence, by Tom Redruth or young Hawkins.\u201d Obeying this order, we found, or rather I found--for the gamekeeper was a poor hand at reading anything but print--the following important news: Old Anchor Inn, Bristol, March 1, 17-- Dear Livesey--As I do not know whether you are at the hall or still in London, I send this in double to both places. The ship is bought and fitted. She lies at anchor, ready for sea. You never imagined a sweeter schooner--a child might sail her--two hundred tons; name, HISPANIOLA. I got her through my old friend, Blandly, who has proved himself throughout the most surprising trump. The admirable fellow literally slaved in my interest, and so, I may say, did everyone in Bristol, as soon as they got wind of the port we sailed for--treasure, I mean. \u201cRedruth,\u201d said I, interrupting the letter, \u201cDr. Livesey will not like that. The squire has been talking, after all.\u201d \u201cWell, who's a better right?\u201d growled the gamekeeper. \u201cA pretty rum go if squire ain't to talk for Dr. Livesey, I should think.\u201d At that I gave up all attempts at commentary and read straight on: Blandly himself found the HISPANIOLA, and by the most admirable management got her for the merest trifle. There is a class of men in Bristol monstrously prejudiced against Blandly.", " One fine day up went the signal, and here come Flint by himself in a little boat, and his head done up in a blue scarf. The sun was getting up, and mortal white he looked about the cutwater. But, there he was, you mind, and the six all dead--dead and buried. How he done it, not a man aboard us could make out. It was battle, murder, and sudden death, leastways--him against six. Billy Bones was the mate; Long John, he was quartermaster; and they asked him where the treasure was. 'Ah,' says he, 'you can go ashore, if you like, and stay,' he says; 'but as for the ship, she'll beat up for more, by thunder!' That's what he said. \u201cWell, I was in another ship three years back, and we sighted this island. 'Boys,' said I, 'here's Flint's treasure; let's land and find it.' The cap'n was displeased at that, but my messmates were all of a mind and landed. Twelve days they looked for it, and every day they had the worse word for me, until one fine morning all hands went aboard. 'As for you, Benjamin Gunn,' says they, 'here's a musket,' they says, 'and a spade, and pick-axe. You can stay here and find Flint's money for yourself,' they says. \u201cWell, Jim, three years have I been here, and not a bite of Christian diet from that day to this. But now, you look here; look at me. Do I look like a man before the mast? No, says you. Nor I weren't, neither, I says.\u201d And with that he winked and pinched me hard.", " \u201cI'll bring you port, Mr. Hands. But I'll have to dig for it.\u201d With that I scuttled down the companion with all the noise I could, slipped off my shoes, ran quietly along the sparred gallery, mounted the forecastle ladder, and popped my head out of the fore companion. I knew he would not expect to see me there, yet I took every precaution possible, and certainly the worst of my suspicions proved too true. He had risen from his position to his hands and knees, and though his leg obviously hurt him pretty sharply when he moved--for I could hear him stifle a groan--yet it was at a good, rattling rate that he trailed himself across the deck. In half a minute he had reached the port scuppers and picked, out of a coil of rope, a long knife, or rather a short dirk, discoloured to the hilt with blood. He looked upon it for a moment, thrusting forth his under jaw, tried the point upon his hand, and then, hastily concealing it in the bosom of his jacket, trundled back again into his old place against the bulwark. This was all that I required to know. Israel could move about, he was now armed, and if he had been at so much trouble to get rid of me, it was plain that I was meant to be the victim. What he would do afterwards--whether he would try to crawl right across the island from North Inlet to the camp among the swamps or whether he would fire Long Tom, trusting that his own comrades might come first to help him--was, of course, more than I could say."], "What does Silver throw at Tom\u2019s back when Tom refuses to join the mutiny?": [" \u201cIt was him that knowed Black Dog.\u201d \u201cWell, and see here,\u201d added the sea-cook. \u201cI'll put another again to that, by thunder! For it was this same boy that faked the chart from Billy Bones. First and last, we've split upon Jim Hawkins!\u201d \u201cThen here goes!\u201d said Morgan with an oath. And he sprang up, drawing his knife as if he had been twenty. \u201cAvast, there!\u201d cried Silver. \u201cWho are you, Tom Morgan? Maybe you thought you was cap'n here, perhaps. By the powers, but I'll teach you better! Cross me, and you'll go where many a good man's gone before you, first and last, these thirty year back--some to the yard-arm, shiver my timbers, and some by the board, and all to feed the fishes. There's never a man looked me between the eyes and seen a good day a'terwards, Tom Morgan, you may lay to that.\u201d Morgan paused, but a hoarse murmur rose from the others. \u201cTom's right,\u201d said one. \u201cI stood hazing long enough from one,\u201d added another. \u201cI'll be hanged if I'll be hazed by you, John Silver.\u201d \u201cDid any of you gentlemen want to have it out with ME?\u201d roared Silver, bending far forward from his position on the keg, with his pipe still glowing in his right hand. \u201cPut a name on what you're at; you ain't dumb, I reckon. Him that wants shall get it. Have I lived this many years, and a son of a rum puncheon cock his hat athwart my hawse at the latter end of it? You know the way; you're all gentlemen o' fortune, by your account.", " Both the squire and I returned the shot, but as we had nothing to aim at, it is probable we only wasted powder. Then we reloaded and turned our attention to poor Tom. The captain and Gray were already examining him, and I saw with half an eye that all was over. I believe the readiness of our return volley had scattered the mutineers once more, for we were suffered without further molestation to get the poor old gamekeeper hoisted over the stockade and carried, groaning and bleeding, into the log-house. Poor old fellow, he had not uttered one word of surprise, complaint, fear, or even acquiescence from the very beginning of our troubles till now, when we had laid him down in the log-house to die. He had lain like a Trojan behind his mattress in the gallery; he had followed every order silently, doggedly, and well; he was the oldest of our party by a score of years; and now, sullen, old, serviceable servant, it was he that was to die. The squire dropped down beside him on his knees and kissed his hand, crying like a child. \u201cBe I going, doctor?\u201d he asked. \u201cTom, my man,\u201d said I, \u201cyou're going home.\u201d \u201cI wish I had had a lick at them with the gun first,\u201d he replied. \u201cTom,\u201d said the squire, \u201csay you forgive me, won't you?\u201d \u201cWould that be respectful like, from me to you, squire?\u201d was the answer. \u201cHowsoever, so be it, amen!\u201d After a little while of silence, he said he thought somebody might read a prayer.", " \u201cBlack what?\u201d \u201cDog, sir,\u201d said I. \u201cHas Mr. Trelawney not told you of the buccaneers? He was one of them.\u201d \u201cSo?\u201d cried Silver. \u201cIn my house! Ben, run and help Harry. One of those swabs, was he? Was that you drinking with him, Morgan? Step up here.\u201d The man whom he called Morgan--an old, grey-haired, mahogany-faced sailor--came forward pretty sheepishly, rolling his quid. \u201cNow, Morgan,\u201d said Long John very sternly, \u201cyou never clapped your eyes on that Black--Black Dog before, did you, now?\u201d \u201cNot I, sir,\u201d said Morgan with a salute. \u201cYou didn't know his name, did you?\u201d \u201cNo, sir.\u201d \u201cBy the powers, Tom Morgan, it's as good for you!\u201d exclaimed the landlord. \u201cIf you had been mixed up with the like of that, you would never have put another foot in my house, you may lay to that. And what was he saying to you?\u201d \u201cI don't rightly know, sir,\u201d answered Morgan. \u201cDo you call that a head on your shoulders, or a blessed dead-eye?\u201d cried Long John. \u201cDon't rightly know, don't you! Perhaps you don't happen to rightly know who you was speaking to, perhaps? Come, now, what was he jawing--v'yages, cap'ns, ships? Pipe up! What was it?\u201d \u201cWe was a-talkin' of keel-hauling,\u201d answered Morgan. \u201cKeel-hauling, was you? And a mighty suitable thing, too, and you may lay to that. Get back to your place for a lubber, Tom.\u201d And then, as Morgan rolled back to his seat, Silver added to me in a confidential whisper that was very flattering, as I thought, \u201cHe's quite an honest man, Tom Morgan, on'y stupid.", " Far away out in the marsh there arose, all of a sudden, a sound like the cry of anger, then another on the back of it; and then one horrid, long-drawn scream. The rocks of the Spy-glass re-echoed it a score of times; the whole troop of marsh-birds rose again, darkening heaven, with a simultaneous whirr; and long after that death yell was still ringing in my brain, silence had re-established its empire, and only the rustle of the redescending birds and the boom of the distant surges disturbed the languor of the afternoon. Tom had leaped at the sound, like a horse at the spur, but Silver had not winked an eye. He stood where he was, resting lightly on his crutch, watching his companion like a snake about to spring. \u201cJohn!\u201d said the sailor, stretching out his hand. \u201cHands off!\u201d cried Silver, leaping back a yard, as it seemed to me, with the speed and security of a trained gymnast. \u201cHands off, if you like, John Silver,\u201d said the other. \u201cIt's a black conscience that can make you feared of me. But in heaven's name, tell me, what was that?\u201d \u201cThat?\u201d returned Silver, smiling away, but warier than ever, his eye a mere pin-point in his big face, but gleaming like a crumb of glass. \u201cThat? Oh, I reckon that'll be Alan.\u201d And at this point Tom flashed out like a hero. \u201cAlan!\u201d he cried. \u201cThen rest his soul for a true seaman! And as for you, John Silver, long you've been a mate of mine, but you're mate of mine no more."], "While fleeing the pirates, who does Jim find in the woods of the island?": [" \u201cAnd when Ben Gunn is wanted, you know where to find him, Jim. Just wheer you found him today. And him that comes is to have a white thing in his hand, and he's to come alone. Oh! And you'll say this: 'Ben Gunn,' says you, 'has reasons of his own. '\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said I, \u201cI believe I understand. You have something to propose, and you wish to see the squire or the doctor, and you're to be found where I found you. Is that all?\u201d \u201cAnd when? says you,\u201d he added. \u201cWhy, from about noon observation to about six bells.\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d said I, \u201cand now may I go?\u201d \u201cYou won't forget?\u201d he inquired anxiously. \u201cPrecious sight, and reasons of his own, says you. Reasons of his own; that's the mainstay; as between man and man. Well, then\u201d--still holding me--\u201cI reckon you can go, Jim. And, Jim, if you was to see Silver, you wouldn't go for to sell Ben Gunn? Wild horses wouldn't draw it from you? No, says you. And if them pirates camp ashore, Jim, what would you say but there'd be widders in the morning?\u201d Here he was interrupted by a loud report, and a cannonball came tearing through the trees and pitched in the sand not a hundred yards from where we two were talking. The next moment each of us had taken to his heels in a different direction. For a good hour to come frequent reports shook the island, and balls kept crashing through the woods. I moved from hiding-place to hiding-place, always pursued, or so it seemed to me, by these terrifying missiles.", " I saw the three flashes--two close together--one farther to the west.\u201d \u201cThree!\u201d repeated the captain. \u201cAnd how many on yours, Mr. Trelawney?\u201d But this was not so easily answered. There had come many from the north--seven by the squire's computation, eight or nine according to Gray. From the east and west only a single shot had been fired. It was plain, therefore, that the attack would be developed from the north and that on the other three sides we were only to be annoyed by a show of hostilities. But Captain Smollett made no change in his arrangements. If the mutineers succeeded in crossing the stockade, he argued, they would take possession of any unprotected loophole and shoot us down like rats in our own stronghold. Nor had we much time left to us for thought. Suddenly, with a loud huzza, a little cloud of pirates leaped from the woods on the north side and ran straight on the stockade. At the same moment, the fire was once more opened from the woods, and a rifle ball sang through the doorway and knocked the doctor's musket into bits. The boarders swarmed over the fence like monkeys. Squire and Gray fired again and yet again; three men fell, one forwards into the enclosure, two back on the outside. But of these, one was evidently more frightened than hurt, for he was on his feet again in a crack and instantly disappeared among the trees. Two had bit the dust, one had fled, four had made good their footing inside our defences, while from the shelter of the woods seven or eight men, each evidently supplied with several muskets, kept up a hot though useless fire on the log-house.", " Anderson was in command of my boat, and instead of keeping the crew in order, he grumbled as loud as the worst. \u201cWell,\u201d he said with an oath, \u201cit's not forever.\u201d I thought this was a very bad sign, for up to that day the men had gone briskly and willingly about their business; but the very sight of the island had relaxed the cords of discipline. All the way in, Long John stood by the steersman and conned the ship. He knew the passage like the palm of his hand, and though the man in the chains got everywhere more water than was down in the chart, John never hesitated once. \u201cThere's a strong scour with the ebb,\u201d he said, \u201cand this here passage has been dug out, in a manner of speaking, with a spade.\u201d We brought up just where the anchor was in the chart, about a third of a mile from each shore, the mainland on one side and Skeleton Island on the other. The bottom was clean sand. The plunge of our anchor sent up clouds of birds wheeling and crying over the woods, but in less than a minute they were down again and all was once more silent. The place was entirely land-locked, buried in woods, the trees coming right down to high-water mark, the shores mostly flat, and the hilltops standing round at a distance in a sort of amphitheatre, one here, one there. Two little rivers, or rather two swamps, emptied out into this pond, as you might call it; and the foliage round that part of the shore had a kind of poisonous brightness.", " The HISPANIOLA was rolling scuppers under in the ocean swell. The booms were tearing at the blocks, the rudder was banging to and fro, and the whole ship creaking, groaning, and jumping like a manufactory. I had to cling tight to the backstay, and the world turned giddily before my eyes, for though I was a good enough sailor when there was way on, this standing still and being rolled about like a bottle was a thing I never learned to stand without a qualm or so, above all in the morning, on an empty stomach. Perhaps it was this--perhaps it was the look of the island, with its grey, melancholy woods, and wild stone spires, and the surf that we could both see and hear foaming and thundering on the steep beach--at least, although the sun shone bright and hot, and the shore birds were fishing and crying all around us, and you would have thought anyone would have been glad to get to land after being so long at sea, my heart sank, as the saying is, into my boots; and from the first look onward, I hated the very thought of Treasure Island. We had a dreary morning's work before us, for there was no sign of any wind, and the boats had to be got out and manned, and the ship warped three or four miles round the corner of the island and up the narrow passage to the haven behind Skeleton Island. I volunteered for one of the boats, where I had, of course, no business. The heat was sweltering, and the men grumbled fiercely over their work."], "What does Gunn promise to do in exchange for a safe passage home?": [" But where was you, do you suppose?\u201d I had made my mind up in a moment, and by way of answer told him the whole story of our voyage and the predicament in which we found ourselves. He heard me with the keenest interest, and when I had done he patted me on the head. \u201cYou're a good lad, Jim,\u201d he said; \u201cand you're all in a clove hitch, ain't you? Well, you just put your trust in Ben Gunn--Ben Gunn's the man to do it. Would you think it likely, now, that your squire would prove a liberal-minded one in case of help--him being in a clove hitch, as you remark?\u201d I told him the squire was the most liberal of men. \u201cAye, but you see,\u201d returned Ben Gunn, \u201cI didn't mean giving me a gate to keep, and a suit of livery clothes, and such; that's not my mark, Jim. What I mean is, would he be likely to come down to the toon of, say one thousand pounds out of money that's as good as a man's own already?\u201d \u201cI am sure he would,\u201d said I. \u201cAs it was, all hands were to share.\u201d \u201cAND a passage home?\u201d he added with a look of great shrewdness. \u201cWhy,\u201d I cried, \u201cthe squire's a gentleman. And besides, if we got rid of the others, we should want you to help work the vessel home.\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d said he, \u201cso you would.\u201d And he seemed very much relieved. \u201cNow, I'll tell you what,\u201d he went on. \u201cSo much I'll tell you, and no more. I were in Flint's ship when he buried the treasure; he and six along--six strong seamen. They was ashore nigh on a week, and us standing off and on in the old WALRUS.", " \u201cBut there's one thing not clear to me. There was an echo. Now, no man ever seen a sperrit with a shadow; well then, what's he doing with an echo to him, I should like to know? That ain't in natur', surely?\u201d This argument seemed weak enough to me. But you can never tell what will affect the superstitious, and to my wonder, George Merry was greatly relieved. \u201cWell, that's so,\u201d he said. \u201cYou've a head upon your shoulders, John, and no mistake. 'Bout ship, mates! This here crew is on a wrong tack, I do believe. And come to think on it, it was like Flint's voice, I grant you, but not just so clear-away like it, after all. It was liker somebody else's voice now--it was liker--\u201d \u201cBy the powers, Ben Gunn!\u201d roared Silver. \u201cAye, and so it were,\u201d cried Morgan, springing on his knees. \u201cBen Gunn it were!\u201d \u201cIt don't make much odds, do it, now?\u201d asked Dick. \u201cBen Gunn's not here in the body any more'n Flint.\u201d But the older hands greeted this remark with scorn. \u201cWhy, nobody minds Ben Gunn,\u201d cried Merry; \u201cdead or alive, nobody minds him.\u201d It was extraordinary how their spirits had returned and how the natural colour had revived in their faces. Soon they were chatting together, with intervals of listening; and not long after, hearing no further sound, they shouldered the tools and set forth again, Merry walking first with Silver's compass to keep them on the right line with Skeleton Island. He had said the truth: dead or alive, nobody minded Ben Gunn.", " It was Silver's voice, and before I had heard a dozen words, I would not have shown myself for all the world, but lay there, trembling and listening, in the extreme of fear and curiosity, for from these dozen words I understood that the lives of all the honest men aboard depended upon me alone. 11 What I Heard in the Apple Barrel \u201cNO, not I,\u201d said Silver. \u201cFlint was cap'n; I was quartermaster, along of my timber leg. The same broadside I lost my leg, old Pew lost his deadlights. It was a master surgeon, him that ampytated me--out of college and all--Latin by the bucket, and what not; but he was hanged like a dog, and sun-dried like the rest, at Corso Castle. That was Roberts' men, that was, and comed of changing names to their ships--ROYAL FORTUNE and so on. Now, what a ship was christened, so let her stay, I says. So it was with the CASSANDRA, as brought us all safe home from Malabar, after England took the viceroy of the Indies; so it was with the old WALRUS, Flint's old ship, as I've seen amuck with the red blood and fit to sink with gold.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d cried another voice, that of the youngest hand on board, and evidently full of admiration. \u201cHe was the flower of the flock, was Flint!\u201d \u201cDavis was a man too, by all accounts,\u201d said Silver. \u201cI never sailed along of him; first with England, then with Flint, that's my story; and now here on my own account, in a manner of speaking. I laid by nine hundred safe, from England, and two thousand after Flint.", " Just about the same time, the sun had gone down behind the Spy-glass, and as the fog was collecting rapidly, it began to grow dark in earnest. I saw I must lose no time if I were to find the boat that evening. The white rock, visible enough above the brush, was still some eighth of a mile further down the spit, and it took me a goodish while to get up with it, crawling, often on all fours, among the scrub. Night had almost come when I laid my hand on its rough sides. Right below it there was an exceedingly small hollow of green turf, hidden by banks and a thick underwood about knee-deep, that grew there very plentifully; and in the centre of the dell, sure enough, a little tent of goat-skins, like what the gipsies carry about with them in England. I dropped into the hollow, lifted the side of the tent, and there was Ben Gunn's boat--home-made if ever anything was home-made; a rude, lop-sided framework of tough wood, and stretched upon that a covering of goat-skin, with the hair inside. The thing was extremely small, even for me, and I can hardly imagine that it could have floated with a full-sized man. There was one thwart set as low as possible, a kind of stretcher in the bows, and a double paddle for propulsion. I had not then seen a coracle, such as the ancient Britons made, but I have seen one since, and I can give you no fairer idea of Ben Gunn's boat than by saying it was like the first and the worst coracle ever made by man."], "Who takes over narration from Jim, beginning his story at the mutineers\u2019 departure for the island?": [" All they would do was to give me a loaded pistol lest we were attacked, and to promise to have horses ready saddled in case we were pursued on our return, while one lad was to ride forward to the doctor's in search of armed assistance. My heart was beating finely when we two set forth in the cold night upon this dangerous venture. A full moon was beginning to rise and peered redly through the upper edges of the fog, and this increased our haste, for it was plain, before we came forth again, that all would be as bright as day, and our departure exposed to the eyes of any watchers. We slipped along the hedges, noiseless and swift, nor did we see or hear anything to increase our terrors, till, to our relief, the door of the Admiral Benbow had closed behind us. I slipped the bolt at once, and we stood and panted for a moment in the dark, alone in the house with the dead captain's body. Then my mother got a candle in the bar, and holding each other's hands, we advanced into the parlour. He lay as we had left him, on his back, with his eyes open and one arm stretched out. \u201cDraw down the blind, Jim,\u201d whispered my mother; \u201cthey might come and watch outside. And now,\u201d said she when I had done so, \u201cwe have to get the key off THAT; and who's to touch it, I should like to know!\u201d and she gave a kind of sob as she said the words. I went down on my knees at once. On the floor close to his hand there was a little round of paper, blackened on the one side.", " We had no ricochet to fear, and though one popped in through the roof of the log-house and out again through the floor, we soon got used to that sort of horse-play and minded it no more than cricket. \u201cThere is one good thing about all this,\u201d observed the captain; \u201cthe wood in front of us is likely clear. The ebb has made a good while; our stores should be uncovered. Volunteers to go and bring in pork.\u201d Gray and Hunter were the first to come forward. Well armed, they stole out of the stockade, but it proved a useless mission. The mutineers were bolder than we fancied or they put more trust in Israel's gunnery. For four or five of them were busy carrying off our stores and wading out with them to one of the gigs that lay close by, pulling an oar or so to hold her steady against the current. Silver was in the stern-sheets in command; and every man of them was now provided with a musket from some secret magazine of their own. The captain sat down to his log, and here is the beginning of the entry: Alexander Smollett, master; David Livesey, ship's doctor; Abraham Gray, carpenter's mate; John Trelawney, owner; John Hunter and Richard Joyce, owner's servants, landsmen--being all that is left faithful of the ship's company--with stores for ten days at short rations, came ashore this day and flew British colours on the log-house in Treasure Island. Thomas Redruth, owner's servant, landsman, shot by the mutineers; James Hawkins, cabin-boy-- And at the same time, I was wondering over poor Jim Hawkins' fate.", " \u201cThank ye kindly, doctor,\u201d says he. \u201cYou came in in about the nick, I guess, for me and Hawkins. And so it's you, Ben Gunn!\u201d he added. \u201cWell, you're a nice one, to be sure.\u201d \u201cI'm Ben Gunn, I am,\u201d replied the maroon, wriggling like an eel in his embarrassment. \u201cAnd,\u201d he added, after a long pause, \u201chow do, Mr. Silver? Pretty well, I thank ye, says you.\u201d \u201cBen, Ben,\u201d murmured Silver, \u201cto think as you've done me!\u201d The doctor sent back Gray for one of the pick-axes deserted, in their flight, by the mutineers, and then as we proceeded leisurely downhill to where the boats were lying, related in a few words what had taken place. It was a story that profoundly interested Silver; and Ben Gunn, the half-idiot maroon, was the hero from beginning to end. Ben, in his long, lonely wanderings about the island, had found the skeleton--it was he that had rifled it; he had found the treasure; he had dug it up (it was the haft of his pick-axe that lay broken in the excavation); he had carried it on his back, in many weary journeys, from the foot of the tall pine to a cave he had on the two-pointed hill at the north-east angle of the island, and there it had lain stored in safety since two months before the arrival of the HISPANIOLA. When the doctor had wormed this secret from him on the afternoon of the attack, and when next morning he saw the anchorage deserted, he had gone to Silver, given him the chart, which was now useless--given him the stores, for Ben Gunn's cave was well supplied with goats' meat salted by himself--given anything and everything to get a chance of moving in safety from the stockade to the two-pointed hill, there to be clear of malaria and keep a guard upon the money.", " The sight of so many good-humoured faces (especially the blacks), the taste of the tropical fruits, and above all the lights that began to shine in the town made a most charming contrast to our dark and bloody sojourn on the island; and the doctor and the squire, taking me along with them, went ashore to pass the early part of the night. Here they met the captain of an English man-of-war, fell in talk with him, went on board his ship, and, in short, had so agreeable a time that day was breaking when we came alongside the HISPANIOLA. Ben Gunn was on deck alone, and as soon as we came on board he began, with wonderful contortions, to make us a confession. Silver was gone. The maroon had connived at his escape in a shore boat some hours ago, and he now assured us he had only done so to preserve our lives, which would certainly have been forfeit if \u201cthat man with the one leg had stayed aboard.\u201d But this was not all. The sea-cook had not gone empty-handed. He had cut through a bulkhead unobserved and had removed one of the sacks of coin, worth perhaps three or four hundred guineas, to help him on his further wanderings. I think we were all pleased to be so cheaply quit of him. Well, to make a long story short, we got a few hands on board, made a good cruise home, and the HISPANIOLA reached Bristol just as Mr. Blandly was beginning to think of fitting out her consort. Five men only of those who had sailed returned with her."], "What endangers the lives of the crewmembers traveling from the ship to the island?": [" \u201cDrink and the devil had done for the rest,\u201d with a vengeance, although, to be sure, we were not quite in so bad a case as that other ship they sang about: With one man of her crew alive, What put to sea with seventy-five. All of us had an ample share of the treasure and used it wisely or foolishly, according to our natures. Captain Smollett is now retired from the sea. Gray not only saved his money, but being suddenly smit with the desire to rise, also studied his profession, and he is now mate and part owner of a fine full-rigged ship, married besides, and the father of a family. As for Ben Gunn, he got a thousand pounds, which he spent or lost in three weeks, or to be more exact, in nineteen days, for he was back begging on the twentieth. Then he was given a lodge to keep, exactly as he had feared upon the island; and he still lives, a great favourite, though something of a butt, with the country boys, and a notable singer in church on Sundays and saints' days. Of Silver we have heard no more. That formidable seafaring man with one leg has at last gone clean out of my life; but I dare say he met his old Negress, and perhaps still lives in comfort with her and Captain Flint. It is to be hoped so, I suppose, for his chances of comfort in another world are very small. The bar silver and the arms still lie, for all that I know, where Flint buried them; and certainly they shall lie there for me.", " The HISPANIOLA was rolling scuppers under in the ocean swell. The booms were tearing at the blocks, the rudder was banging to and fro, and the whole ship creaking, groaning, and jumping like a manufactory. I had to cling tight to the backstay, and the world turned giddily before my eyes, for though I was a good enough sailor when there was way on, this standing still and being rolled about like a bottle was a thing I never learned to stand without a qualm or so, above all in the morning, on an empty stomach. Perhaps it was this--perhaps it was the look of the island, with its grey, melancholy woods, and wild stone spires, and the surf that we could both see and hear foaming and thundering on the steep beach--at least, although the sun shone bright and hot, and the shore birds were fishing and crying all around us, and you would have thought anyone would have been glad to get to land after being so long at sea, my heart sank, as the saying is, into my boots; and from the first look onward, I hated the very thought of Treasure Island. We had a dreary morning's work before us, for there was no sign of any wind, and the boats had to be got out and manned, and the ship warped three or four miles round the corner of the island and up the narrow passage to the haven behind Skeleton Island. I volunteered for one of the boats, where I had, of course, no business. The heat was sweltering, and the men grumbled fiercely over their work.", " They had the advantage of numbers, of course, but we had the advantage of arms. Not one of the men ashore had a musket, and before they could get within range for pistol shooting, we flattered ourselves we should be able to give a good account of a half-dozen at least. The squire was waiting for me at the stern window, all his faintness gone from him. He caught the painter and made it fast, and we fell to loading the boat for our very lives. Pork, powder, and biscuit was the cargo, with only a musket and a cutlass apiece for the squire and me and Redruth and the captain. The rest of the arms and powder we dropped overboard in two fathoms and a half of water, so that we could see the bright steel shining far below us in the sun, on the clean, sandy bottom. By this time the tide was beginning to ebb, and the ship was swinging round to her anchor. Voices were heard faintly halloaing in the direction of the two gigs; and though this reassured us for Joyce and Hunter, who were well to the eastward, it warned our party to be off. Redruth retreated from his place in the gallery and dropped into the boat, which we then brought round to the ship's counter, to be handier for Captain Smollett. \u201cNow, men,\u201d said he, \u201cdo you hear me?\u201d There was no answer from the forecastle. \u201cIt's to you, Abraham Gray--it's to you I am speaking.\u201d Still no reply. \u201cGray,\u201d resumed Mr. Smollett, a little louder, \u201cI am leaving this ship, and I order you to follow your captain.", " This was how it came about. We had run up the trades to get the wind of the island we were after--I am not allowed to be more plain--and now we were running down for it with a bright lookout day and night. It was about the last day of our outward voyage by the largest computation; some time that night, or at latest before noon of the morrow, we should sight the Treasure Island. We were heading S.S.W. and had a steady breeze abeam and a quiet sea. The HISPANIOLA rolled steadily, dipping her bowsprit now and then with a whiff of spray. All was drawing alow and aloft; everyone was in the bravest spirits because we were now so near an end of the first part of our adventure. Now, just after sundown, when all my work was over and I was on my way to my berth, it occurred to me that I should like an apple. I ran on deck. The watch was all forward looking out for the island. The man at the helm was watching the luff of the sail and whistling away gently to himself, and that was the only sound excepting the swish of the sea against the bows and around the sides of the ship. In I got bodily into the apple barrel, and found there was scarce an apple left; but sitting down there in the dark, what with the sound of the waters and the rocking movement of the ship, I had either fallen asleep or was on the point of doing so when a heavy man sat down with rather a clash close by. The barrel shook as he leaned his shoulders against it, and I was just about to jump up when the man began to speak."], "Where do the good sailors weather cannon fire from the mutineers?": [" In one, sailors were singing at their work, in another there were men aloft, high over my head, hanging to threads that seemed no thicker than a spider's. Though I had lived by the shore all my life, I seemed never to have been near the sea till then. The smell of tar and salt was something new. I saw the most wonderful figureheads, that had all been far over the ocean. I saw, besides, many old sailors, with rings in their ears, and whiskers curled in ringlets, and tarry pigtails, and their swaggering, clumsy sea-walk; and if I had seen as many kings or archbishops I could not have been more delighted. And I was going to sea myself, to sea in a schooner, with a piping boatswain and pig-tailed singing seamen, to sea, bound for an unknown island, and to seek for buried treasure! While I was still in this delightful dream, we came suddenly in front of a large inn and met Squire Trelawney, all dressed out like a sea-officer, in stout blue cloth, coming out of the door with a smile on his face and a capital imitation of a sailor's walk. \u201cHere you are,\u201d he cried, \u201cand the doctor came last night from London. Bravo! The ship's company complete!\u201d \u201cOh, sir,\u201d cried I, \u201cwhen do we sail?\u201d \u201cSail!\u201d says he. \u201cWe sail tomorrow!\u201d 8 At the Sign of the Spy-glass WHEN I had done breakfasting the squire gave me a note addressed to John Silver, at the sign of the Spy-glass, and told me I should easily find the place by following the line of the docks and keeping a bright lookout for a little tavern with a large brass telescope for sign.", " Well, then, I will not. But the dead men, sir, hang about your neck like mill-stones.\u201d \u201cThank you kindly, sir,\u201d replied Long John, again saluting. \u201cI dare you to thank me!\u201d cried the squire. \u201cIt is a gross dereliction of my duty. Stand back.\u201d And thereupon we all entered the cave. It was a large, airy place, with a little spring and a pool of clear water, overhung with ferns. The floor was sand. Before a big fire lay Captain Smollett; and in a far corner, only duskily flickered over by the blaze, I beheld great heaps of coin and quadrilaterals built of bars of gold. That was Flint's treasure that we had come so far to seek and that had cost already the lives of seventeen men from the HISPANIOLA. How many it had cost in the amassing, what blood and sorrow, what good ships scuttled on the deep, what brave men walking the plank blindfold, what shot of cannon, what shame and lies and cruelty, perhaps no man alive could tell. Yet there were still three upon that island--Silver, and old Morgan, and Ben Gunn--who had each taken his share in these crimes, as each had hoped in vain to share in the reward. \u201cCome in, Jim,\u201d said the captain. \u201cYou're a good boy in your line, Jim, but I don't think you and me'll go to sea again. You're too much of the born favourite for me. Is that you, John Silver? What brings you here, man?\u201d \u201cCome back to my dooty, sir,\u201d returned Silver. \u201cAh!\u201d said the captain, and that was all he said.", " \u201cLeft, left,\u201d says he; \u201ckeep to your left hand, mate Jim! Under the trees with you! Theer's where I killed my first goat. They don't come down here now; they're all mastheaded on them mountings for the fear of Benjamin Gunn. Ah! And there's the cetemery\u201d--cemetery, he must have meant. \u201cYou see the mounds? I come here and prayed, nows and thens, when I thought maybe a Sunday would be about doo. It weren't quite a chapel, but it seemed more solemn like; and then, says you, Ben Gunn was short-handed--no chapling, nor so much as a Bible and a flag, you says.\u201d So he kept talking as I ran, neither expecting nor receiving any answer. The cannon-shot was followed after a considerable interval by a volley of small arms. Another pause, and then, not a quarter of a mile in front of me, I beheld the Union Jack flutter in the air above a wood. PART FOUR--The Stockade 16 Narrative Continued by the Doctor: How the Ship Was Abandoned IT was about half past one--three bells in the sea phrase--that the two boats went ashore from the HISPANIOLA. The captain, the squire, and I were talking matters over in the cabin. Had there been a breath of wind, we should have fallen on the six mutineers who were left aboard with us, slipped our cable, and away to sea. But the wind was wanting; and to complete our helplessness, down came Hunter with the news that Jim Hawkins had slipped into a boat and was gone ashore with the rest.", " In the middle, the cutlasses lay ranged. \u201cToss out the fire,\u201d said the captain; \u201cthe chill is past, and we mustn't have smoke in our eyes.\u201d The iron fire-basket was carried bodily out by Mr. Trelawney, and the embers smothered among sand. \u201cHawkins hasn't had his breakfast. Hawkins, help yourself, and back to your post to eat it,\u201d continued Captain Smollett. \u201cLively, now, my lad; you'll want it before you've done. Hunter, serve out a round of brandy to all hands.\u201d And while this was going on, the captain completed, in his own mind, the plan of the defence. \u201cDoctor, you will take the door,\u201d he resumed. \u201cSee, and don't expose yourself; keep within, and fire through the porch. Hunter, take the east side, there. Joyce, you stand by the west, my man. Mr. Trelawney, you are the best shot--you and Gray will take this long north side, with the five loopholes; it's there the danger is. If they can get up to it and fire in upon us through our own ports, things would begin to look dirty. Hawkins, neither you nor I are much account at the shooting; we'll stand by to load and bear a hand.\u201d As the captain had said, the chill was past. As soon as the sun had climbed above our girdle of trees, it fell with all its force upon the clearing and drank up the vapours at a draught. Soon the sand was baking and the resin melting in the logs of the block house. Jackets and coats were flung aside, shirts thrown open at the neck and rolled up to the shoulders; and we stood there, each at his post, in a fever of heat and anxiety."], "What does Silver call himself before proposing a compromise with Smollett?": [" I've had a'most enough o' Cap'n Smollett; he's hazed me long enough, by thunder! I want to go into that cabin, I do. I want their pickles and wines, and that.\u201d \u201cIsrael,\u201d said Silver, \u201cyour head ain't much account, nor ever was. But you're able to hear, I reckon; leastways, your ears is big enough. Now, here's what I say: you'll berth forward, and you'll live hard, and you'll speak soft, and you'll keep sober till I give the word; and you may lay to that, my son.\u201d \u201cWell, I don't say no, do I?\u201d growled the coxswain. \u201cWhat I say is, when? That's what I say.\u201d \u201cWhen! By the powers!\u201d cried Silver. \u201cWell now, if you want to know, I'll tell you when. The last moment I can manage, and that's when. Here's a first-rate seaman, Cap'n Smollett, sails the blessed ship for us. Here's this squire and doctor with a map and such--I don't know where it is, do I? No more do you, says you. Well then, I mean this squire and doctor shall find the stuff, and help us to get it aboard, by the powers. Then we'll see. If I was sure of you all, sons of double Dutchmen, I'd have Cap'n Smollett navigate us half-way back again before I struck.\u201d \u201cWhy, we're all seamen aboard here, I should think,\u201d said the lad Dick. \u201cWe're all forecastle hands, you mean,\u201d snapped Silver. \u201cWe can steer a course, but who's to set one? That's what all you gentlemen split on, first and last. If I had my way, I'd have Cap'n Smollett work us back into the trades at least; then we'd have no blessed miscalculations and a spoonful of water a day.", " I don't like this cruise; I don't like the men; and I don't like my officer. That's short and sweet.\u201d \u201cPerhaps, sir, you don't like the ship?\u201d inquired the squire, very angry, as I could see. \u201cI can't speak as to that, sir, not having seen her tried,\u201d said the captain. \u201cShe seems a clever craft; more I can't say.\u201d \u201cPossibly, sir, you may not like your employer, either?\u201d says the squire. But here Dr. Livesey cut in. \u201cStay a bit,\u201d said he, \u201cstay a bit. No use of such questions as that but to produce ill feeling. The captain has said too much or he has said too little, and I'm bound to say that I require an explanation of his words. You don't, you say, like this cruise. Now, why?\u201d \u201cI was engaged, sir, on what we call sealed orders, to sail this ship for that gentleman where he should bid me,\u201d said the captain. \u201cSo far so good. But now I find that every man before the mast knows more than I do. I don't call that fair, now, do you?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Dr. Livesey, \u201cI don't.\u201d \u201cNext,\u201d said the captain, \u201cI learn we are going after treasure--hear it from my own hands, mind you. Now, treasure is ticklish work; I don't like treasure voyages on any account, and I don't like them, above all, when they are secret and when (begging your pardon, Mr. Trelawney) the secret has been told to the parrot.\u201d \u201cSilver's parrot?\u201d asked the squire. \u201cIt's a way of speaking,\u201d said the captain. \u201cBlabbed, I mean. It's my belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about, but I'll tell you my way of it--life or death, and a close run.\u201d \u201cThat is all clear, and, I dare say, true enough,\u201d replied Dr. Livesey.", " \u201cAnd what do you want with your flag of truce?\u201d he cried. This time it was the other man who replied. \u201cCap'n Silver, sir, to come on board and make terms,\u201d he shouted. \u201cCap'n Silver! Don't know him. Who's he?\u201d cried the captain. And we could hear him adding to himself, \u201cCap'n, is it? My heart, and here's promotion!\u201d Long John answered for himself. \u201cMe, sir. These poor lads have chosen me cap'n, after your desertion, sir\u201d--laying a particular emphasis upon the word \u201cdesertion.\u201d \u201cWe're willing to submit, if we can come to terms, and no bones about it. All I ask is your word, Cap'n Smollett, to let me safe and sound out of this here stockade, and one minute to get out o' shot before a gun is fired.\u201d \u201cMy man,\u201d said Captain Smollett, \u201cI have not the slightest desire to talk to you. If you wish to talk to me, you can come, that's all. If there's any treachery, it'll be on your side, and the Lord help you.\u201d \u201cThat's enough, cap'n,\u201d shouted Long John cheerily. \u201cA word from you's enough. I know a gentleman, and you may lay to that.\u201d We could see the man who carried the flag of truce attempting to hold Silver back. Nor was that wonderful, seeing how cavalier had been the captain's answer. But Silver laughed at him aloud and slapped him on the back as if the idea of alarm had been absurd. Then he advanced to the stockade, threw over his crutch, got a leg up, and with great vigour and skill succeeded in surmounting the fence and dropping safely to the other side.", " This, when it was brought to him, he drank slowly, like a connoisseur, lingering on the taste and still looking about him at the cliffs and up at our signboard. \u201cThis is a handy cove,\u201d says he at length; \u201cand a pleasant sittyated grog-shop. Much company, mate?\u201d My father told him no, very little company, the more was the pity. \u201cWell, then,\u201d said he, \u201cthis is the berth for me. Here you, matey,\u201d he cried to the man who trundled the barrow; \u201cbring up alongside and help up my chest. I'll stay here a bit,\u201d he continued. \u201cI'm a plain man; rum and bacon and eggs is what I want, and that head up there for to watch ships off. What you mought call me? You mought call me captain. Oh, I see what you're at--there\u201d; and he threw down three or four gold pieces on the threshold. \u201cYou can tell me when I've worked through that,\u201d says he, looking as fierce as a commander. And indeed bad as his clothes were and coarsely as he spoke, he had none of the appearance of a man who sailed before the mast, but seemed like a mate or skipper accustomed to be obeyed or to strike. The man who came with the barrow told us the mail had set him down the morning before at the Royal George, that he had inquired what inns there were along the coast, and hearing ours well spoken of, I suppose, and described as lonely, had chosen it from the others for his place of residence. And that was all we could learn of our guest."], "What does Silver demand from Smollett in exchange for the safe voyage he offers?": [" \u201cThat's a good man, captain,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cVery likely, sir,\u201d replied Captain Smollett. \u201cEasy with that, men--easy,\u201d he ran on, to the fellows who were shifting the powder; and then suddenly observing me examining the swivel we carried amidships, a long brass nine, \u201cHere you, ship's boy,\u201d he cried, \u201cout o' that! Off with you to the cook and get some work.\u201d And then as I was hurrying off I heard him say, quite loudly, to the doctor, \u201cI'll have no favourites on my ship.\u201d I assure you I was quite of the squire's way of thinking, and hated the captain deeply. 10 The Voyage ALL that night we were in a great bustle getting things stowed in their place, and boatfuls of the squire's friends, Mr. Blandly and the like, coming off to wish him a good voyage and a safe return. We never had a night at the Admiral Benbow when I had half the work; and I was dog-tired when, a little before dawn, the boatswain sounded his pipe and the crew began to man the capstan-bars. I might have been twice as weary, yet I would not have left the deck, all was so new and interesting to me--the brief commands, the shrill note of the whistle, the men bustling to their places in the glimmer of the ship's lanterns. \u201cNow, Barbecue, tip us a stave,\u201d cried one voice. \u201cThe old one,\u201d cried another. \u201cAye, aye, mates,\u201d said Long John, who was standing by, with his crutch under his arm, and at once broke out in the air and words I knew so well: \u201cFifteen men on the dead man's chest--\u201d And then the whole crew bore chorus:-- \u201cYo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!\u201d And at the third \u201cHo!\u201d drove the bars before them with a will.", " I've had a'most enough o' Cap'n Smollett; he's hazed me long enough, by thunder!

The same broadside I lost my leg, old Pew lost his deadlights. It was a master surgeon, him that ampytated me--out of college and all--Latin by the bucket, and what not; but he was hanged like a dog, and sun-dried like the rest, at Corso Castle. That was Roberts' men, that was, and comed of changing names to their ships--ROYAL FORTUNE and so on. Now, what a ship was christened, so let her stay, I says. So it was with the CASSANDRA, as brought us all safe home from Malabar, after England took the viceroy of the Indies; so it was with the old WALRUS, Flint's old ship, as I've seen amuck with the red blood and fit to sink with gold.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d cried another voice, that of the youngest hand on board, and evidently full of admiration. \u201cHe was the flower of the flock, was Flint!\u201d \u201cDavis was a man too, by all accounts,\u201d said Silver. \u201cI never sailed along of him; first with England, then with Flint, that's my story; and now here on my own account, in a manner of speaking. I laid by nine hundred safe, from England, and two thousand after Flint."], "What does Jim plan to do with the Hispaniola after sailing out to it in the coracle?": [" But now, at last, I had my chance. The breeze fell for some seconds, very low, and the current gradually turning her, the HISPANIOLA revolved slowly round her centre and at last presented me her stern, with the cabin window still gaping open and the lamp over the table still burning on into the day. The main-sail hung drooped like a banner. She was stock-still but for the current. For the last little while I had even lost, but now redoubling my efforts, I began once more to overhaul the chase. I was not a hundred yards from her when the wind came again in a clap; she filled on the port tack and was off again, stooping and skimming like a swallow. My first impulse was one of despair, but my second was towards joy. Round she came, till she was broadside on to me--round still till she had covered a half and then two thirds and then three quarters of the distance that separated us. I could see the waves boiling white under her forefoot. Immensely tall she looked to me from my low station in the coracle. And then, of a sudden, I began to comprehend. I had scarce time to think--scarce time to act and save myself. I was on the summit of one swell when the schooner came stooping over the next. The bowsprit was over my head. I sprang to my feet and leaped, stamping the coracle under water. With one hand I caught the jib-boom, while my foot was lodged between the stay and the brace; and as I still clung there panting, a dull blow told me that the schooner had charged down upon and struck the coracle and that I was left without retreat on the HISPANIOLA.", " When I first sighted her, all her sails were drawing; she was lying a course about north-west, and I presumed the men on board were going round the island on their way back to the anchorage. Presently she began to fetch more and more to the westward, so that I thought they had sighted me and were going about in chase. At last, however, she fell right into the wind's eye, was taken dead aback, and stood there awhile helpless, with her sails shivering. \u201cClumsy fellows,\u201d said I; \u201cthey must still be drunk as owls.\u201d And I thought how Captain Smollett would have set them skipping. Meanwhile the schooner gradually fell off and filled again upon another tack, sailed swiftly for a minute or so, and brought up once more dead in the wind's eye. Again and again was this repeated. To and fro, up and down, north, south, east, and west, the HISPANIOLA sailed by swoops and dashes, and at each repetition ended as she had begun, with idly flapping canvas. It became plain to me that nobody was steering. And if so, where were the men? Either they were dead drunk or had deserted her, I thought, and perhaps if I could get on board I might return the vessel to her captain. The current was bearing coracle and schooner southward at an equal rate. As for the latter's sailing, it was so wild and intermittent, and she hung each time so long in irons, that she certainly gained nothing, if she did not even lose.", " But the great advantage of the coracle it certainly possessed, for it was exceedingly light and portable. Well, now that I had found the boat, you would have thought I had had enough of truantry for once, but in the meantime I had taken another notion and become so obstinately fond of it that I would have carried it out, I believe, in the teeth of Captain Smollett himself. This was to slip out under cover of the night, cut the HISPANIOLA adrift, and let her go ashore where she fancied. I had quite made up my mind that the mutineers, after their repulse of the morning, had nothing nearer their hearts than to up anchor and away to sea; this, I thought, it would be a fine thing to prevent, and now that I had seen how they left their watchmen unprovided with a boat, I thought it might be done with little risk. Down I sat to wait for darkness, and made a hearty meal of biscuit. It was a night out of ten thousand for my purpose. The fog had now buried all heaven. As the last rays of daylight dwindled and disappeared, absolute blackness settled down on Treasure Island. And when, at last, I shouldered the coracle and groped my way stumblingly out of the hollow where I had supped, there were but two points visible on the whole anchorage. One was the great fire on shore, by which the defeated pirates lay carousing in the swamp. The other, a mere blur of light upon the darkness, indicated the position of the anchored ship.", " And I had hardly moved before the boat, giving up at once her gentle dancing movement, ran straight down a slope of water so steep that it made me giddy, and struck her nose, with a spout of spray, deep into the side of the next wave. I was drenched and terrified, and fell instantly back into my old position, whereupon the coracle seemed to find her head again and led me as softly as before among the billows. It was plain she was not to be interfered with, and at that rate, since I could in no way influence her course, what hope had I left of reaching land? I began to be horribly frightened, but I kept my head, for all that. First, moving with all care, I gradually baled out the coracle with my sea-cap; then, getting my eye once more above the gunwale, I set myself to study how it was she managed to slip so quietly through the rollers. I found each wave, instead of the big, smooth glossy mountain it looks from shore or from a vessel's deck, was for all the world like any range of hills on dry land, full of peaks and smooth places and valleys. The coracle, left to herself, turning from side to side, threaded, so to speak, her way through these lower parts and avoided the steep slopes and higher, toppling summits of the wave. \u201cWell, now,\u201d thought I to myself, \u201cit is plain I must lie where I am and not disturb the balance; but it is plain also that I can put the paddle over the side and from time to time, in smooth places, give her a shove or two towards land.\u201d No sooner thought upon than done."], "What distraction prevents the pirates from noticing that Jim has cut the ship adrift?": [" But the great advantage of the coracle it certainly possessed, for it was exceedingly light and portable.

We both desired to have her stranded safe enough, in a sheltered place, and so that, when the time came, she could be got off again with as little labour and danger as might be; and until that was done I considered that my life would certainly be spared. While I was thus turning the business over in my mind, I had not been idle with my body. I had stolen back to the cabin, slipped once more into my shoes, and laid my hand at random on a bottle of wine, and now, with this for an excuse, I made my reappearance on the deck. Hands lay as I had left him, all fallen together in a bundle and with his eyelids lowered as though he were too weak to bear the light. He looked up, however, at my coming, knocked the neck off the bottle like a man who had done the same thing often, and took a good swig, with his favourite toast of \u201cHere's luck!\u201d Then he lay quiet for a little, and then, pulling out a stick of tobacco, begged me to cut him a quid. \u201cCut me a junk o' that,\u201d says he, \u201cfor I haven't no knife and hardly strength enough, so be as I had. Ah, Jim, Jim, I reckon I've missed stays! Cut me a quid, as'll likely be the last, lad, for I'm for my long home, and no mistake.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said I, \u201cI'll cut you some tobacco, but if I was you and thought myself so badly, I would go to my prayers like a Christian man.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d said he.", " The men are not shy with him, and Jim is a noticing lad.\u201d \u201cHawkins, I put prodigious faith in you,\u201d added the squire. I began to feel pretty desperate at this, for I felt altogether helpless; and yet, by an odd train of circumstances, it was indeed through me that safety came. In the meantime, talk as we pleased, there were only seven out of the twenty-six on whom we knew we could rely; and out of these seven one was a boy, so that the grown men on our side were six to their nineteen. PART THREE--My Shore Adventure 13 How My Shore Adventure Began THE appearance of the island when I came on deck next morning was altogether changed. Although the breeze had now utterly ceased, we had made a great deal of way during the night and were now lying becalmed about half a mile to the south-east of the low eastern coast. Grey-coloured woods covered a large part of the surface. This even tint was indeed broken up by streaks of yellow sand-break in the lower lands, and by many tall trees of the pine family, out-topping the others--some singly, some in clumps; but the general colouring was uniform and sad. The hills ran up clear above the vegetation in spires of naked rock. All were strangely shaped, and the Spy-glass, which was by three or four hundred feet the tallest on the island, was likewise the strangest in configuration, running up sheer from almost every side and then suddenly cut off at the top like a pedestal to put a statue on.", " \u201cAnd when Ben Gunn is wanted, you know where to find him, Jim. Just wheer you found him today. And him that comes is to have a white thing in his hand, and he's to come alone. Oh! And you'll say this: 'Ben Gunn,' says you, 'has reasons of his own.

The next moment each of us had taken to his heels in a different direction. For a good hour to come frequent reports shook the island, and balls kept crashing through the woods. I moved from hiding-place to hiding-place, always pursued, or so it seemed to me, by these terrifying missiles."], "What does Jim do after drifting too near to the pirates\u2019 campfire on shore?": [" \u201cAnd when Ben Gunn is wanted, you know where to find him, Jim.

I haven't had a drop this blessed day. That doctor's a fool, I tell you. If I don't have a dram o' rum, Jim, I'll have the horrors; I seen some on 'em already. I seen old Flint in the corner there, behind you; as plain as print, I seen him; and if I get the horrors, I'm a man that has lived rough, and I'll raise Cain. Your doctor hisself said one glass wouldn't hurt me. I'll give you a golden guinea for a noggin, Jim.\u201d He was growing more and more excited, and this alarmed me for my father, who was very low that day and needed quiet; besides, I was reassured by the doctor's words, now quoted to me, and rather offended by the offer of a bribe. \u201cI want none of your money,\u201d said I, \u201cbut what you owe my father. I'll get you one glass, and no more.\u201d When I brought it to him, he seized it greedily and drank it out. \u201cAye, aye,\u201d said he, \u201cthat's some better, sure enough. And now, matey, did that doctor say how long I was to lie here in this old berth?\u201d \u201cA week at least,\u201d said I. \u201cThunder!\u201d he cried. \u201cA week! I can't do that; they'd have the black spot on me by then. The lubbers is going about to get the wind of me this blessed moment; lubbers as couldn't keep what they got, and want to nail what is another's.", " Hands, if possible,\u201d said the captain. Trelawney was as cool as steel. He looked to the priming of his gun. \u201cNow,\u201d cried the captain, \u201ceasy with that gun, sir, or you'll swamp the boat. All hands stand by to trim her when he aims.\u201d The squire raised his gun, the rowing ceased, and we leaned over to the other side to keep the balance, and all was so nicely contrived that we did not ship a drop. They had the gun, by this time, slewed round upon the swivel, and Hands, who was at the muzzle with the rammer, was in consequence the most exposed. However, we had no luck, for just as Trelawney fired, down he stooped, the ball whistled over him, and it was one of the other four who fell. The cry he gave was echoed not only by his companions on board but by a great number of voices from the shore, and looking in that direction I saw the other pirates trooping out from among the trees and tumbling into their places in the boats. \u201cHere come the gigs, sir,\u201d said I. \u201cGive way, then,\u201d cried the captain. \u201cWe mustn't mind if we swamp her now. If we can't get ashore, all's up.\u201d \u201cOnly one of the gigs is being manned, sir,\u201d I added; \u201cthe crew of the other most likely going round by shore to cut us off.\u201d \u201cThey'll have a hot run, sir,\u201d returned the captain. \u201cJack ashore, you know. It's not them I mind; it's the round-shot. Carpet bowls! My lady's maid couldn't miss. Tell us, squire, when you see the match, and we'll hold water.\u201d In the meanwhile we had been making headway at a good pace for a boat so overloaded, and we had shipped but little water in the process.", " There I lay on my elbows in the most trying attitude, and every now and again gave a weak stroke or two to turn her head to shore. It was very tiring and slow work, yet I did visibly gain ground; and as we drew near the Cape of the Woods, though I saw I must infallibly miss that point, I had still made some hundred yards of easting. I was, indeed, close in. I could see the cool green tree-tops swaying together in the breeze, and I felt sure I should make the next promontory without fail. It was high time, for I now began to be tortured with thirst. The glow of the sun from above, its thousandfold reflection from the waves, the sea-water that fell and dried upon me, caking my very lips with salt, combined to make my throat burn and my brain ache. The sight of the trees so near at hand had almost made me sick with longing, but the current had soon carried me past the point, and as the next reach of sea opened out, I beheld a sight that changed the nature of my thoughts. Right in front of me, not half a mile away, I beheld the HISPANIOLA under sail. I made sure, of course, that I should be taken; but I was so distressed for want of water that I scarce knew whether to be glad or sorry at the thought, and long before I had come to a conclusion, surprise had taken entire possession of my mind and I could do nothing but stare and wonder. The HISPANIOLA was under her main-sail and two jibs, and the beautiful white canvas shone in the sun like snow or silver."], "What risk does Jim know that he runs by pursuing the drifting Hispaniola in his coracle?": [" She had swung round to the ebb--her bow was now towards me--the only lights on board were in the cabin, and what I saw was merely a reflection on the fog of the strong rays that flowed from the stern window. The ebb had already run some time, and I had to wade through a long belt of swampy sand, where I sank several times above the ankle, before I came to the edge of the retreating water, and wading a little way in, with some strength and dexterity, set my coracle, keel downwards, on the surface. 23 The Ebb-tide Runs THE coracle--as I had ample reason to know before I was done with her--was a very safe boat for a person of my height and weight, both buoyant and clever in a seaway; but she was the most cross-grained, lop-sided craft to manage. Do as you pleased, she always made more leeway than anything else, and turning round and round was the manoeuvre she was best at. Even Ben Gunn himself has admitted that she was \u201cqueer to handle till you knew her way.\u201d Certainly I did not know her way. She turned in every direction but the one I was bound to go; the most part of the time we were broadside on, and I am very sure I never should have made the ship at all but for the tide. By good fortune, paddle as I pleased, the tide was still sweeping me down; and there lay the HISPANIOLA right in the fairway, hardly to be missed. First she loomed before me like a blot of something yet blacker than darkness, then her spars and hull began to take shape, and the next moment, as it seemed (for, the farther I went, the brisker grew the current of the ebb), I was alongside of her hawser and had laid hold.", " But the great advantage of the coracle it certainly possessed, for it was exceedingly light and portable. Well, now that I had found the boat, you would have thought I had had enough of truantry for once, but in the meantime I had taken another notion and become so obstinately fond of it that I would have carried it out, I believe, in the teeth of Captain Smollett himself. This was to slip out under cover of the night, cut the HISPANIOLA adrift, and let her go ashore where she fancied. I had quite made up my mind that the mutineers, after their repulse of the morning, had nothing nearer their hearts than to up anchor and away to sea; this, I thought, it would be a fine thing to prevent, and now that I had seen how they left their watchmen unprovided with a boat, I thought it might be done with little risk. Down I sat to wait for darkness, and made a hearty meal of biscuit. It was a night out of ten thousand for my purpose. The fog had now buried all heaven. As the last rays of daylight dwindled and disappeared, absolute blackness settled down on Treasure Island. And when, at last, I shouldered the coracle and groped my way stumblingly out of the hollow where I had supped, there were but two points visible on the whole anchorage. One was the great fire on shore, by which the defeated pirates lay carousing in the swamp. The other, a mere blur of light upon the darkness, indicated the position of the anchored ship.", " But now, at last, I had my chance. The breeze fell for some seconds, very low, and the current gradually turning her, the HISPANIOLA revolved slowly round her centre and at last presented me her stern, with the cabin window still gaping open and the lamp over the table still burning on into the day. The main-sail hung drooped like a banner. She was stock-still but for the current. For the last little while I had even lost, but now redoubling my efforts, I began once more to overhaul the chase. I was not a hundred yards from her when the wind came again in a clap; she filled on the port tack and was off again, stooping and skimming like a swallow. My first impulse was one of despair, but my second was towards joy. Round she came, till she was broadside on to me--round still till she had covered a half and then two thirds and then three quarters of the distance that separated us. I could see the waves boiling white under her forefoot. Immensely tall she looked to me from my low station in the coracle. And then, of a sudden, I began to comprehend. I had scarce time to think--scarce time to act and save myself. I was on the summit of one swell when the schooner came stooping over the next. The bowsprit was over my head. I sprang to my feet and leaped, stamping the coracle under water. With one hand I caught the jib-boom, while my foot was lodged between the stay and the brace; and as I still clung there panting, a dull blow told me that the schooner had charged down upon and struck the coracle and that I was left without retreat on the HISPANIOLA.", " At last the breeze came; the schooner sidled and drew nearer in the dark; I felt the hawser slacken once more, and with a good, tough effort, cut the last fibres through. The breeze had but little action on the coracle, and I was almost instantly swept against the bows of the HISPANIOLA. At the same time, the schooner began to turn upon her heel, spinning slowly, end for end, across the current. I wrought like a fiend, for I expected every moment to be swamped; and since I found I could not push the coracle directly off, I now shoved straight astern. At length I was clear of my dangerous neighbour, and just as I gave the last impulsion, my hands came across a light cord that was trailing overboard across the stern bulwarks. Instantly I grasped it. Why I should have done so I can hardly say. It was at first mere instinct, but once I had it in my hands and found it fast, curiosity began to get the upper hand, and I determined I should have one look through the cabin window. I pulled in hand over hand on the cord, and when I judged myself near enough, rose at infinite risk to about half my height and thus commanded the roof and a slice of the interior of the cabin. By this time the schooner and her little consort were gliding pretty swiftly through the water; indeed, we had already fetched up level with the camp-fire. The ship was talking, as sailors say, loudly, treading the innumerable ripples with an incessant weltering splash; and until I got my eye above the window-sill I could not comprehend why the watchmen had taken no alarm."], "What sound does Jim hear after climbing aboard the drifting ship?": [" Wherever a man is, says I, a man can do for himself. But, mate, my heart is sore for Christian diet. You mightn't happen to have a piece of cheese about you, now? No? Well, many's the long night I've dreamed of cheese--toasted, mostly--and woke up again, and here I were.\u201d \u201cIf ever I can get aboard again,\u201d said I, \u201cyou shall have cheese by the stone.\u201d All this time he had been feeling the stuff of my jacket, smoothing my hands, looking at my boots, and generally, in the intervals of his speech, showing a childish pleasure in the presence of a fellow creature. But at my last words he perked up into a kind of startled slyness. \u201cIf ever you can get aboard again, says you?\u201d he repeated. \u201cWhy, now, who's to hinder you?\u201d \u201cNot you, I know,\u201d was my reply. \u201cAnd right you was,\u201d he cried. \u201cNow you--what do you call yourself, mate?\u201d \u201cJim,\u201d I told him. \u201cJim, Jim,\u201d says he, quite pleased apparently. \u201cWell, now, Jim, I've lived that rough as you'd be ashamed to hear of. Now, for instance, you wouldn't think I had had a pious mother--to look at me?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy, no, not in particular,\u201d I answered. \u201cAh, well,\u201d said he, \u201cbut I had--remarkable pious. And I was a civil, pious boy, and could rattle off my catechism that fast, as you couldn't tell one word from another. And here's what it come to, Jim, and it begun with chuck-farthen on the blessed grave-stones! That's what it begun with, but it went further'n that; and so my mother told me, and predicked the whole, she did, the pious woman!", " A hail on the land side. \u201cSomebody hailing us,\u201d said Hunter, who was on guard. \u201cDoctor! Squire! Captain! Hullo, Hunter, is that you?\u201d came the cries. And I ran to the door in time to see Jim Hawkins, safe and sound, come climbing over the stockade. 19 Narrative Resumed by Jim Hawkins: The Garrison in the Stockade AS soon as Ben Gunn saw the colours he came to a halt, stopped me by the arm, and sat down. \u201cNow,\u201d said he, \u201cthere's your friends, sure enough.\u201d \u201cFar more likely it's the mutineers,\u201d I answered. \u201cThat!\u201d he cried. \u201cWhy, in a place like this, where nobody puts in but gen'lemen of fortune, Silver would fly the Jolly Roger, you don't make no doubt of that. No, that's your friends. There's been blows too, and I reckon your friends has had the best of it; and here they are ashore in the old stockade, as was made years and years ago by Flint. Ah, he was the man to have a headpiece, was Flint! Barring rum, his match were never seen. He were afraid of none, not he; on'y Silver--Silver was that genteel.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said I, \u201cthat may be so, and so be it; all the more reason that I should hurry on and join my friends.\u201d \u201cNay, mate,\u201d returned Ben, \u201cnot you. You're a good boy, or I'm mistook; but you're on'y a boy, all told. Now, Ben Gunn is fly. Rum wouldn't bring me there, where you're going--not rum wouldn't, till I see your born gen'leman and gets it on his word of honour. And you won't forget my words; 'A precious sight (that's what you'll say), a precious sight more confidence'--and then nips him.\u201d And he pinched me the third time with the same air of cleverness.", " But it were Providence that put me here. I've thought it all out in this here lonely island, and I'm back on piety. You don't catch me tasting rum so much, but just a thimbleful for luck, of course, the first chance I have. I'm bound I'll be good, and I see the way to. And, Jim\u201d--looking all round him and lowering his voice to a whisper--\u201cI'm rich.\u201d I now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude, and I suppose I must have shown the feeling in my face, for he repeated the statement hotly: \u201cRich! Rich! I says. And I'll tell you what: I'll make a man of you, Jim. Ah, Jim, you'll bless your stars, you will, you was the first that found me!\u201d And at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face, and he tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly before my eyes. \u201cNow, Jim, you tell me true: that ain't Flint's ship?\u201d he asked. At this I had a happy inspiration. I began to believe that I had found an ally, and I answered him at once. \u201cIt's not Flint's ship, and Flint is dead; but I'll tell you true, as you ask me--there are some of Flint's hands aboard; worse luck for the rest of us.\u201d \u201cNot a man--with one--leg?\u201d he gasped. \u201cSilver?\u201d I asked. \u201cAh, Silver!\u201d says he. \u201cThat were his name.\u201d \u201cHe's the cook, and the ringleader too.\u201d He was still holding me by the wrist, and at that he give it quite a wring. \u201cIf you was sent by Long John,\u201d he said, \u201cI'm as good as pork, and I know it.", " One fine day up went the signal, and here come Flint by himself in a little boat, and his head done up in a blue scarf. The sun was getting up, and mortal white he looked about the cutwater. But, there he was, you mind, and the six all dead--dead and buried. How he done it, not a man aboard us could make out. It was battle, murder, and sudden death, leastways--him against six. Billy Bones was the mate; Long John, he was quartermaster; and they asked him where the treasure was. 'Ah,' says he, 'you can go ashore, if you like, and stay,' he says; 'but as for the ship, she'll beat up for more, by thunder!' That's what he said. \u201cWell, I was in another ship three years back, and we sighted this island. 'Boys,' said I, 'here's Flint's treasure; let's land and find it.' The cap'n was displeased at that, but my messmates were all of a mind and landed. Twelve days they looked for it, and every day they had the worse word for me, until one fine morning all hands went aboard. 'As for you, Benjamin Gunn,' says they, 'here's a musket,' they says, 'and a spade, and pick-axe. You can stay here and find Flint's money for yourself,' they says. \u201cWell, Jim, three years have I been here, and not a bite of Christian diet from that day to this. But now, you look here; look at me. Do I look like a man before the mast? No, says you. Nor I weren't, neither, I says.\u201d And with that he winked and pinched me hard."], "What is the drunken Israel Hands covered in when Jim discovers him aboard the drifting ship?": [" For a while the ship kept bucking and sidling like a vicious horse, the sails filling, now on one tack, now on another, and the boom swinging to and fro till the mast groaned aloud under the strain. Now and again too there would come a cloud of light sprays over the bulwark and a heavy blow of the ship's bows against the swell; so much heavier weather was made of it by this great rigged ship than by my home-made, lop-sided coracle, now gone to the bottom of the sea. At every jump of the schooner, red-cap slipped to and fro, but--what was ghastly to behold--neither his attitude nor his fixed teeth-disclosing grin was anyway disturbed by this rough usage. At every jump too, Hands appeared still more to sink into himself and settle down upon the deck, his feet sliding ever the farther out, and the whole body canting towards the stern, so that his face became, little by little, hid from me; and at last I could see nothing beyond his ear and the frayed ringlet of one whisker. At the same time, I observed, around both of them, splashes of dark blood upon the planks and began to feel sure that they had killed each other in their drunken wrath. While I was thus looking and wondering, in a calm moment, when the ship was still, Israel Hands turned partly round and with a low moan writhed himself back to the position in which I had seen him first. The moan, which told of pain and deadly weakness, and the way in which his jaw hung open went right to my heart.", " Watch him as we pleased, we could do nothing to solve it; and when we asked him to his face, he would only laugh if he were drunk, and if he were sober deny solemnly that he ever tasted anything but water. He was not only useless as an officer and a bad influence amongst the men, but it was plain that at this rate he must soon kill himself outright, so nobody was much surprised, nor very sorry, when one dark night, with a head sea, he disappeared entirely and was seen no more. \u201cOverboard!\u201d said the captain. \u201cWell, gentlemen, that saves the trouble of putting him in irons.\u201d But there we were, without a mate; and it was necessary, of course, to advance one of the men. The boatswain, Job Anderson, was the likeliest man aboard, and though he kept his old title, he served in a way as mate. Mr. Trelawney had followed the sea, and his knowledge made him very useful, for he often took a watch himself in easy weather. And the coxswain, Israel Hands, was a careful, wily, old, experienced seaman who could be trusted at a pinch with almost anything. He was a great confidant of Long John Silver, and so the mention of his name leads me on to speak of our ship's cook, Barbecue, as the men called him. Aboard ship he carried his crutch by a lanyard round his neck, to have both hands as free as possible. It was something to see him wedge the foot of the crutch against a bulkhead, and propped against it, yielding to every movement of the ship, get on with his cooking like someone safe ashore.", " Wherever a man is, says I, a man can do for himself. But, mate, my heart is sore for Christian diet. You mightn't happen to have a piece of cheese about you, now? No?

Some of the colour had come back into his cheeks, though he still looked very sick and still continued to slip out and settle down as the ship banged about. \u201cBy the by,\u201d I continued, \u201cI can't have these colours, Mr. Hands; and by your leave, I'll strike 'em. Better none than these.\u201d And again dodging the boom, I ran to the colour lines, handed down their cursed black flag, and chucked it overboard."], "What does Jim ask Hands to do after discovering him aboard the drifting ship?": [" But it were Providence that put me here. I've thought it all out in this here lonely island, and I'm back on piety. You don't catch me tasting rum so much, but just a thimbleful for luck, of course, the first chance I have. I'm bound I'll be good, and I see the way to. And, Jim\u201d--looking all round him and lowering his voice to a whisper--\u201cI'm rich.\u201d I now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude, and I suppose I must have shown the feeling in my face, for he repeated the statement hotly: \u201cRich! Rich! I says. And I'll tell you what: I'll make a man of you, Jim. Ah, Jim, you'll bless your stars, you will, you was the first that found me!\u201d And at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face, and he tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly before my eyes. \u201cNow, Jim, you tell me true: that ain't Flint's ship?\u201d he asked. At this I had a happy inspiration. I began to believe that I had found an ally, and I answered him at once. \u201cIt's not Flint's ship, and Flint is dead; but I'll tell you true, as you ask me--there are some of Flint's hands aboard; worse luck for the rest of us.\u201d \u201cNot a man--with one--leg?\u201d he gasped. \u201cSilver?\u201d I asked. \u201cAh, Silver!\u201d says he. \u201cThat were his name.\u201d \u201cHe's the cook, and the ringleader too.\u201d He was still holding me by the wrist, and at that he give it quite a wring. \u201cIf you was sent by Long John,\u201d he said, \u201cI'm as good as pork, and I know it.", " Wherever a man is, says I, a man can do for himself.

I'm on squire's side now. I know you've got that ship safe somewheres. How you done it, I don't know, but safe it is. I guess Hands and O'Brien turned soft. I never much believed in neither of THEM. Now you mark me. I ask no questions, nor I won't let others. I know when a game's up, I do; and I know a lad that's staunch."], "What does Hands hide in his coat while Jim goes to fetch him some port wine?": [" Hands, but not the spirit; you must know that already,\u201d I replied. \u201cO'Brien there is in another world, and may be watching us.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d says he. \u201cWell, that's unfort'nate--appears as if killing parties was a waste of time. Howsomever, sperrits don't reckon for much, by what I've seen. I'll chance it with the sperrits, Jim. And now, you've spoke up free, and I'll take it kind if you'd step down into that there cabin and get me a--well, a--shiver my timbers! I can't hit the name on 't; well, you get me a bottle of wine, Jim--this here brandy's too strong for my head.\u201d Now, the coxswain's hesitation seemed to be unnatural, and as for the notion of his preferring wine to brandy, I entirely disbelieved it. The whole story was a pretext. He wanted me to leave the deck--so much was plain; but with what purpose I could in no way imagine. His eyes never met mine; they kept wandering to and fro, up and down, now with a look to the sky, now with a flitting glance upon the dead O'Brien. All the time he kept smiling and putting his tongue out in the most guilty, embarrassed manner, so that a child could have told that he was bent on some deception. I was prompt with my answer, however, for I saw where my advantage lay and that with a fellow so densely stupid I could easily conceal my suspicions to the end. \u201cSome wine?\u201d I said. \u201cFar better. Will you have white or red?\u201d \u201cWell, I reckon it's about the blessed same to me, shipmate,\u201d he replied; \u201cso it's strong, and plenty of it, what's the odds?\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d I answered.", " \u201cI'll bring you port, Mr. Hands. But I'll have to dig for it.\u201d With that I scuttled down the companion with all the noise I could, slipped off my shoes, ran quietly along the sparred gallery, mounted the forecastle ladder, and popped my head out of the fore companion. I knew he would not expect to see me there, yet I took every precaution possible, and certainly the worst of my suspicions proved too true. He had risen from his position to his hands and knees, and though his leg obviously hurt him pretty sharply when he moved--for I could hear him stifle a groan--yet it was at a good, rattling rate that he trailed himself across the deck. In half a minute he had reached the port scuppers and picked, out of a coil of rope, a long knife, or rather a short dirk, discoloured to the hilt with blood. He looked upon it for a moment, thrusting forth his under jaw, tried the point upon his hand, and then, hastily concealing it in the bosom of his jacket, trundled back again into his old place against the bulwark. This was all that I required to know. Israel could move about, he was now armed, and if he had been at so much trouble to get rid of me, it was plain that I was meant to be the victim. What he would do afterwards--whether he would try to crawl right across the island from North Inlet to the camp among the swamps or whether he would fire Long Tom, trusting that his own comrades might come first to help him--was, of course, more than I could say.", " He sank daily, and my mother and I had all the inn upon our hands, and were kept busy enough without paying much regard to our unpleasant guest. It was one January morning, very early--a pinching, frosty morning--the cove all grey with hoar-frost, the ripple lapping softly on the stones, the sun still low and only touching the hilltops and shining far to seaward. The captain had risen earlier than usual and set out down the beach, his cutlass swinging under the broad skirts of the old blue coat, his brass telescope under his arm, his hat tilted back upon his head. I remember his breath hanging like smoke in his wake as he strode off, and the last sound I heard of him as he turned the big rock was a loud snort of indignation, as though his mind was still running upon Dr. Livesey. Well, mother was upstairs with father and I was laying the breakfast-table against the captain's return when the parlour door opened and a man stepped in on whom I had never set my eyes before. He was a pale, tallowy creature, wanting two fingers of the left hand, and though he wore a cutlass, he did not look much like a fighter. I had always my eye open for seafaring men, with one leg or two, and I remember this one puzzled me. He was not sailorly, and yet he had a smack of the sea about him too. I asked him what was for his service, and he said he would take rum; but as I was going out of the room to fetch it, he sat down upon a table and motioned me to draw near.", " Yet I felt sure that I could trust him in one point, since in that our interests jumped together, and that was in the disposition of the schooner. We both desired to have her stranded safe enough, in a sheltered place, and so that, when the time came, she could be got off again with as little labour and danger as might be; and until that was done I considered that my life would certainly be spared. While I was thus turning the business over in my mind, I had not been idle with my body. I had stolen back to the cabin, slipped once more into my shoes, and laid my hand at random on a bottle of wine, and now, with this for an excuse, I made my reappearance on the deck. Hands lay as I had left him, all fallen together in a bundle and with his eyelids lowered as though he were too weak to bear the light. He looked up, however, at my coming, knocked the neck off the bottle like a man who had done the same thing often, and took a good swig, with his favourite toast of \u201cHere's luck!\u201d Then he lay quiet for a little, and then, pulling out a stick of tobacco, begged me to cut him a quid. \u201cCut me a junk o' that,\u201d says he, \u201cfor I haven't no knife and hardly strength enough, so be as I had. Ah, Jim, Jim, I reckon I've missed stays!

And talking o' trouble, why did that doctor give me the chart, Jim?\u201d My face expressed a wonder so unaffected that he saw the needlessness of further questions. \u201cAh, well, he did, though,\u201d said he. \u201cAnd there's something under that, no doubt--something, surely, under that, Jim--bad or good.\u201d And he took another swallow of the brandy, shaking his great fair head like a man who looks forward to the worst. 29 The Black Spot Again THE council of buccaneers had lasted some time, when one of them re-entered the house, and with a repetition of the same salute, which had in my eyes an ironical air, begged for a moment's loan of the torch. Silver briefly agreed, and this emissary retired again, leaving us together in the dark. \u201cThere's a breeze coming, Jim,\u201d said Silver, who had by this time adopted quite a friendly and familiar tone. I turned to the loophole nearest me and looked out. The embers of the great fire had so far burned themselves out and now glowed so low and duskily that I understood why these conspirators desired a torch. About half-way down the slope to the stockade, they were collected in a group; one held the light, another was on his knees in their midst, and I saw the blade of an open knife shine in his hand with varying colours in the moon and torchlight.", " Wherever a man is, says I, a man can do for himself.

The doctor never so much as moved. He spoke to him as before, over his shoulder and in the same tone of voice, rather high, so that all the room might hear, but perfectly calm and steady: \u201cIf you do not put that knife this instant in your pocket, I promise, upon my honour, you shall hang at the next assizes.\u201d Then followed a battle of looks between them, but the captain soon knuckled under, put up his weapon, and resumed his seat, grumbling like a beaten dog. \u201cAnd now, sir,\u201d continued the doctor, \u201csince I now know there's such a fellow in my district, you may count I'll have an eye upon you day and night. I'm not a doctor only; I'm a magistrate; and if I catch a breath of complaint against you, if it's only for a piece of incivility like tonight's, I'll take effectual means to have you hunted down and routed out of this. Let that suffice.\u201d Soon after, Dr. Livesey's horse came to the door and he rode away, but the captain held his peace that evening, and for many evenings to come. 2 Black Dog Appears and Disappears IT was not very long after this that there occurred the first of the mysterious events that rid us at last of the captain, though not, as you will see, of his affairs. It was a bitter cold winter, with long, hard frosts and heavy gales; and it was plain from the first that my poor father was little likely to see the spring."], "Whose voice wakes up the men in the stockade by crying \u201cPieces of eight!\u201d?": [" With my arms before me I walked steadily in. I should lie down in my own place (I thought with a silent chuckle) and enjoy their faces when they found me in the morning. My foot struck something yielding--it was a sleeper's leg; and he turned and groaned, but without awaking. And then, all of a sudden, a shrill voice broke forth out of the darkness: \u201cPieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!\u201d and so forth, without pause or change, like the clacking of a tiny mill. Silver's green parrot, Captain Flint! It was she whom I had heard pecking at a piece of bark; it was she, keeping better watch than any human being, who thus announced my arrival with her wearisome refrain. I had no time left me to recover. At the sharp, clipping tone of the parrot, the sleepers awoke and sprang up; and with a mighty oath, the voice of Silver cried, \u201cWho goes?\u201d I turned to run, struck violently against one person, recoiled, and ran full into the arms of a second, who for his part closed upon and held me tight. \u201cBring a torch, Dick,\u201d said Silver when my capture was thus assured. And one of the men left the log-house and presently returned with a lighted brand. PART SIX--Captain Silver 28 In the Enemy's Camp THE red glare of the torch, lighting up the interior of the block house, showed me the worst of my apprehensions realized. The pirates were in possession of the house and stores: there was the cask of cognac, there were the pork and bread, as before, and what tenfold increased my horror, not a sign of any prisoner.", " Still more strange was it to see him in the heaviest of weather cross the deck. He had a line or two rigged up to help him across the widest spaces--Long John's earrings, they were called; and he would hand himself from one place to another, now using the crutch, now trailing it alongside by the lanyard, as quickly as another man could walk. Yet some of the men who had sailed with him before expressed their pity to see him so reduced. \u201cHe's no common man, Barbecue,\u201d said the coxswain to me. \u201cHe had good schooling in his young days and can speak like a book when so minded; and brave--a lion's nothing alongside of Long John! I seen him grapple four and knock their heads together--him unarmed.\u201d All the crew respected and even obeyed him. He had a way of talking to each and doing everybody some particular service. To me he was unweariedly kind, and always glad to see me in the galley, which he kept as clean as a new pin, the dishes hanging up burnished and his parrot in a cage in one corner. \u201cCome away, Hawkins,\u201d he would say; \u201ccome and have a yarn with John. Nobody more welcome than yourself, my son. Sit you down and hear the news. Here's Cap'n Flint--I calls my parrot Cap'n Flint, after the famous buccaneer--here's Cap'n Flint predicting success to our v'yage. Wasn't you, cap'n?\u201d And the parrot would say, with great rapidity, \u201cPieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!\u201d till you wondered that it was not out of breath, or till John threw his handkerchief over the cage.", " English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Georges, and Louises, doubloons and double guineas and moidores and sequins, the pictures of all the kings of Europe for the last hundred years, strange Oriental pieces stamped with what looked like wisps of string or bits of spider's web, round pieces and square pieces, and pieces bored through the middle, as if to wear them round your neck--nearly every variety of money in the world must, I think, have found a place in that collection; and for number, I am sure they were like autumn leaves, so that my back ached with stooping and my fingers with sorting them out. Day after day this work went on; by every evening a fortune had been stowed aboard, but there was another fortune waiting for the morrow; and all this time we heard nothing of the three surviving mutineers. At last--I think it was on the third night--the doctor and I were strolling on the shoulder of the hill where it overlooks the lowlands of the isle, when, from out the thick darkness below, the wind brought us a noise between shrieking and singing. It was only a snatch that reached our ears, followed by the former silence. \u201cHeaven forgive them,\u201d said the doctor; \u201c'tis the mutineers!\u201d \u201cAll drunk, sir,\u201d struck in the voice of Silver from behind us. Silver, I should say, was allowed his entire liberty, and in spite of daily rebuffs, seemed to regard himself once more as quite a privileged and friendly dependent.", " I saw the three flashes--two close together--one farther to the west.\u201d \u201cThree!\u201d repeated the captain. \u201cAnd how many on yours, Mr. Trelawney?\u201d But this was not so easily answered. There had come many from the north--seven by the squire's computation, eight or nine according to Gray. From the east and west only a single shot had been fired. It was plain, therefore, that the attack would be developed from the north and that on the other three sides we were only to be annoyed by a show of hostilities. But Captain Smollett made no change in his arrangements. If the mutineers succeeded in crossing the stockade, he argued, they would take possession of any unprotected loophole and shoot us down like rats in our own stronghold. Nor had we much time left to us for thought. Suddenly, with a loud huzza, a little cloud of pirates leaped from the woods on the north side and ran straight on the stockade. At the same moment, the fire was once more opened from the woods, and a rifle ball sang through the doorway and knocked the doctor's musket into bits. The boarders swarmed over the fence like monkeys. Squire and Gray fired again and yet again; three men fell, one forwards into the enclosure, two back on the outside. But of these, one was evidently more frightened than hurt, for he was on his feet again in a crack and instantly disappeared among the trees. Two had bit the dust, one had fled, four had made good their footing inside our defences, while from the shelter of the woods seven or eight men, each evidently supplied with several muskets, kept up a hot though useless fire on the log-house."], "What role does Silver convince Jim to play for the sake of preventing another mutiny?": [" You'll please bear in mind it's not my life only now--it's that boy's into the bargain; and you'll speak me fair, doctor, and give me a bit o' hope to go on, for the sake of mercy.\u201d Silver was a changed man once he was out there and had his back to his friends and the block house; his cheeks seemed to have fallen in, his voice trembled; never was a soul more dead in earnest. \u201cWhy, John, you're not afraid?\u201d asked Dr. Livesey. \u201cDoctor, I'm no coward; no, not I--not SO much!\u201d and he snapped his fingers. \u201cIf I was I wouldn't say it. But I'll own up fairly, I've the shakes upon me for the gallows. You're a good man and a true; I never seen a better man! And you'll not forget what I done good, not any more than you'll forget the bad, I know. And I step aside--see here--and leave you and Jim alone. And you'll put that down for me too, for it's a long stretch, is that!\u201d So saying, he stepped back a little way, till he was out of earshot, and there sat down upon a tree-stump and began to whistle, spinning round now and again upon his seat so as to command a sight, sometimes of me and the doctor and sometimes of his unruly ruffians as they went to and fro in the sand between the fire--which they were busy rekindling--and the house, from which they brought forth pork and bread to make the breakfast. \u201cSo, Jim,\u201d said the doctor sadly, \u201chere you are. As you have brewed, so shall you drink, my boy.", " Ah, you that's young--you and me might have done a power of good together!\u201d He drew some cognac from the cask into a tin cannikin. \u201cWill you taste, messmate?\u201d he asked; and when I had refused: \u201cWell, I'll take a dram myself, Jim,\u201d said he. \u201cI need a caulker, for there's trouble on hand. And talking o' trouble, why did that doctor give me the chart, Jim?\u201d My face expressed a wonder so unaffected that he saw the needlessness of further questions. \u201cAh, well, he did, though,\u201d said he. \u201cAnd there's something under that, no doubt--something, surely, under that, Jim--bad or good.\u201d And he took another swallow of the brandy, shaking his great fair head like a man who looks forward to the worst. 29 The Black Spot Again THE council of buccaneers had lasted some time, when one of them re-entered the house, and with a repetition of the same salute, which had in my eyes an ironical air, begged for a moment's loan of the torch. Silver briefly agreed, and this emissary retired again, leaving us together in the dark. \u201cThere's a breeze coming, Jim,\u201d said Silver, who had by this time adopted quite a friendly and familiar tone. I turned to the loophole nearest me and looked out. The embers of the great fire had so far burned themselves out and now glowed so low and duskily that I understood why these conspirators desired a torch. About half-way down the slope to the stockade, they were collected in a group; one held the light, another was on his knees in their midst, and I saw the blade of an open knife shine in his hand with varying colours in the moon and torchlight.", " But I'll go as far with you as I dare go, and a step beyond, for I'll have my wig sorted by the captain or I'm mistaken! And first, I'll give you a bit of hope; Silver, if we both get alive out of this wolf-trap, I'll do my best to save you, short of perjury.\u201d Silver's face was radiant. \u201cYou couldn't say more, I'm sure, sir, not if you was my mother,\u201d he cried. \u201cWell, that's my first concession,\u201d added the doctor. \u201cMy second is a piece of advice: keep the boy close beside you, and when you need help, halloo. I'm off to seek it for you, and that itself will show you if I speak at random. Good-bye, Jim.\u201d And Dr. Livesey shook hands with me through the stockade, nodded to Silver, and set off at a brisk pace into the wood. 31 The Treasure-hunt--Flint's Pointer \u201cJIM,\u201d said Silver when we were alone, \u201cif I saved your life, you saved mine; and I'll not forget it. I seen the doctor waving you to run for it--with the tail of my eye, I did; and I seen you say no, as plain as hearing. Jim, that's one to you. This is the first glint of hope I had since the attack failed, and I owe it you. And now, Jim, we're to go in for this here treasure-hunting, with sealed orders too, and I don't like it; and you and me must stick close, back to back like, and we'll save our necks in spite o' fate and fortune.\u201d Just then a man hailed us from the fire that breakfast was ready, and we were soon seated here and there about the sand over biscuit and fried junk.", " It was tattooed in several places. \u201cHere's luck,\u201d \u201cA fair wind,\u201d and \u201cBilly Bones his fancy,\u201d were very neatly and clearly executed on the forearm; and up near the shoulder there was a sketch of a gallows and a man hanging from it--done, as I thought, with great spirit. \u201cProphetic,\u201d said the doctor, touching this picture with his finger. \u201cAnd now, Master Billy Bones, if that be your name, we'll have a look at the colour of your blood. Jim,\u201d he said, \u201care you afraid of blood?\u201d \u201cNo, sir,\u201d said I. \u201cWell, then,\u201d said he, \u201cyou hold the basin\u201d; and with that he took his lancet and opened a vein. A great deal of blood was taken before the captain opened his eyes and looked mistily about him. First he recognized the doctor with an unmistakable frown; then his glance fell upon me, and he looked relieved. But suddenly his colour changed, and he tried to raise himself, crying, \u201cWhere's Black Dog?\u201d \u201cThere is no Black Dog here,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cexcept what you have on your own back. You have been drinking rum; you have had a stroke, precisely as I told you; and I have just, very much against my own will, dragged you headforemost out of the grave. Now, Mr. Bones--\u201d \u201cThat's not my name,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cMuch I care,\u201d returned the doctor. \u201cIt's the name of a buccaneer of my acquaintance; and I call you by it for the sake of shortness, and what I have to say to you is this; one glass of rum won't kill you, but if you take one you'll take another and another, and I stake my wig if you don't break off short, you'll die--do you understand that?--die, and go to your own place, like the man in the Bible."], "What does Silver reveal that Livesey has given him, to Jim\u2019s great astonishment?": [" But I'll go as far with you as I dare go, and a step beyond, for I'll have my wig sorted by the captain or I'm mistaken! And first, I'll give you a bit of hope; Silver, if we both get alive out of this wolf-trap, I'll do my best to save you, short of perjury.\u201d Silver's face was radiant. \u201cYou couldn't say more, I'm sure, sir, not if you was my mother,\u201d he cried. \u201cWell, that's my first concession,\u201d added the doctor. \u201cMy second is a piece of advice: keep the boy close beside you, and when you need help, halloo.

That would be a poor return, my boy. You found out the plot; you found Ben Gunn--the best deed that ever you did, or will do, though you live to ninety. Oh, by Jupiter, and talking of Ben Gunn! Why, this is the mischief in person. Silver!\u201d he cried. \u201cSilver! I'll give you a piece of advice,\u201d he continued as the cook drew near again; \u201cdon't you be in any great hurry after that treasure.\u201d \u201cWhy, sir, I do my possible, which that ain't,\u201d said Silver. \u201cI can only, asking your pardon, save my life and the boy's by seeking for that treasure; and you may lay to that.\u201d \u201cWell, Silver,\u201d replied the doctor, \u201cif that is so, I'll go one step further: look out for squalls when you find it.\u201d \u201cSir,\u201d said Silver, \u201cas between man and man, that's too much and too little. What you're after, why you left the block house, why you given me that there chart, I don't know, now, do I? And yet I done your bidding with my eyes shut and never a word of hope! But no, this here's too much. If you won't tell me what you mean plain out, just say so and I'll leave the helm.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said the doctor musingly; \u201cI've no right to say more; it's not my secret, you see, Silver, or, I give you my word, I'd tell it you.", " \u201cThank ye kindly, doctor,\u201d says he. \u201cYou came in in about the nick, I guess, for me and Hawkins. And so it's you, Ben Gunn!\u201d he added. \u201cWell, you're a nice one, to be sure.\u201d \u201cI'm Ben Gunn, I am,\u201d replied the maroon, wriggling like an eel in his embarrassment. \u201cAnd,\u201d he added, after a long pause, \u201chow do, Mr. Silver? Pretty well, I thank ye, says you.\u201d \u201cBen, Ben,\u201d murmured Silver, \u201cto think as you've done me!\u201d The doctor sent back Gray for one of the pick-axes deserted, in their flight, by the mutineers, and then as we proceeded leisurely downhill to where the boats were lying, related in a few words what had taken place. It was a story that profoundly interested Silver; and Ben Gunn, the half-idiot maroon, was the hero from beginning to end. Ben, in his long, lonely wanderings about the island, had found the skeleton--it was he that had rifled it; he had found the treasure; he had dug it up (it was the haft of his pick-axe that lay broken in the excavation); he had carried it on his back, in many weary journeys, from the foot of the tall pine to a cave he had on the two-pointed hill at the north-east angle of the island, and there it had lain stored in safety since two months before the arrival of the HISPANIOLA. When the doctor had wormed this secret from him on the afternoon of the attack, and when next morning he saw the anchorage deserted, he had gone to Silver, given him the chart, which was now useless--given him the stores, for Ben Gunn's cave was well supplied with goats' meat salted by himself--given anything and everything to get a chance of moving in safety from the stockade to the two-pointed hill, there to be clear of malaria and keep a guard upon the money.", " It occurred to me at once to go ashore. In a jiffy I had slipped over the side and curled up in the fore-sheets of the nearest boat, and almost at the same moment she shoved off. No one took notice of me, only the bow oar saying, \u201cIs that you, Jim? Keep your head down.\u201d But Silver, from the other boat, looked sharply over and called out to know if that were me; and from that moment I began to regret what I had done. The crews raced for the beach, but the boat I was in, having some start and being at once the lighter and the better manned, shot far ahead of her consort, and the bow had struck among the shore-side trees and I had caught a branch and swung myself out and plunged into the nearest thicket while Silver and the rest were still a hundred yards behind. \u201cJim, Jim!\u201d I heard him shouting. But you may suppose I paid no heed; jumping, ducking, and breaking through, I ran straight before my nose till I could run no longer. 14 The First Blow I WAS so pleased at having given the slip to Long John that I began to enjoy myself and look around me with some interest on the strange land that I was in. I had crossed a marshy tract full of willows, bulrushes, and odd, outlandish, swampy trees; and I had now come out upon the skirts of an open piece of undulating, sandy country, about a mile long, dotted with a few pines and a great number of contorted trees, not unlike the oak in growth, but pale in the foliage, like willows."], "What does Silver use to regain the confidence of his men after they hand him a black spot?": [" That ain't bad for a man before the mast--all safe in bank. 'Tain't earning now, it's saving does it, you may lay to that. Where's all England's men now? I dunno. Where's Flint's? Why, most on 'em aboard here, and glad to get the duff--been begging before that, some on 'em. Old Pew, as had lost his sight, and might have thought shame, spends twelve hundred pound in a year, like a lord in Parliament. Where is he now? Well, he's dead now and under hatches; but for two year before that, shiver my timbers, the man was starving! He begged, and he stole, and he cut throats, and starved at that, by the powers!\u201d \u201cWell, it ain't much use, after all,\u201d said the young seaman. \u201c'Tain't much use for fools, you may lay to it--that, nor nothing,\u201d cried Silver. \u201cBut now, you look here: you're young, you are, but you're as smart as paint. I see that when I set my eyes on you, and I'll talk to you like a man.\u201d You may imagine how I felt when I heard this abominable old rogue addressing another in the very same words of flattery as he had used to myself. I think, if I had been able, that I would have killed him through the barrel. Meantime, he ran on, little supposing he was overheard. \u201cHere it is about gentlemen of fortune. They lives rough, and they risk swinging, but they eat and drink like fighting-cocks, and when a cruise is done, why, it's hundreds of pounds instead of hundreds of farthings in their pockets.", " The rest were all somewhat stooping, as though watching the manoeuvres of this last. I could just make out that he had a book as well as a knife in his hand, and was still wondering how anything so incongruous had come in their possession when the kneeling figure rose once more to his feet and the whole party began to move together towards the house. \u201cHere they come,\u201d said I; and I returned to my former position, for it seemed beneath my dignity that they should find me watching them. \u201cWell, let 'em come, lad--let 'em come,\u201d said Silver cheerily. \u201cI've still a shot in my locker.\u201d The door opened, and the five men, standing huddled together just inside, pushed one of their number forward. In any other circumstances it would have been comical to see his slow advance, hesitating as he set down each foot, but holding his closed right hand in front of him. \u201cStep up, lad,\u201d cried Silver. \u201cI won't eat you. Hand it over, lubber. I know the rules, I do; I won't hurt a depytation.\u201d Thus encouraged, the buccaneer stepped forth more briskly, and having passed something to Silver, from hand to hand, slipped yet more smartly back again to his companions. The sea-cook looked at what had been given him. \u201cThe black spot! I thought so,\u201d he observed. \u201cWhere might you have got the paper? Why, hillo! Look here, now; this ain't lucky! You've gone and cut this out of a Bible. What fool's cut a Bible?\u201d \u201cAh, there!\u201d said Morgan.", " \u201cThere! Wot did I say? No good'll come o' that, I said.\u201d \u201cWell, you've about fixed it now, among you,\u201d continued Silver. \u201cYou'll all swing now, I reckon. What soft-headed lubber had a Bible?\u201d \u201cIt was Dick,\u201d said one. \u201cDick, was it? Then Dick can get to prayers,\u201d said Silver. \u201cHe's seen his slice of luck, has Dick, and you may lay to that.\u201d But here the long man with the yellow eyes struck in. \u201cBelay that talk, John Silver,\u201d he said. \u201cThis crew has tipped you the black spot in full council, as in dooty bound; just you turn it over, as in dooty bound, and see what's wrote there. Then you can talk.\u201d \u201cThanky, George,\u201d replied the sea-cook. \u201cYou always was brisk for business, and has the rules by heart, George, as I'm pleased to see. Well, what is it, anyway? Ah! 'Deposed'--that's it, is it? Very pretty wrote, to be sure; like print, I swear. Your hand o' write, George? Why, you was gettin' quite a leadin' man in this here crew. You'll be cap'n next, I shouldn't wonder. Just oblige me with that torch again, will you? This pipe don't draw.\u201d \u201cCome, now,\u201d said George, \u201cyou don't fool this crew no more. You're a funny man, by your account; but you're over now, and you'll maybe step down off that barrel and help vote.\u201d \u201cI thought you said you knowed the rules,\u201d returned Silver contemptuously. \u201cLeastways, if you don't, I do; and I wait here--and I'm still your cap'n, mind--till you outs with your grievances and I reply; in the meantime, your black spot ain't worth a biscuit.", " He gave it me at Savannah, when he lay a-dying, like as if I was to now, you see. But you won't peach unless they get the black spot on me, or unless you see that Black Dog again or a seafaring man with one leg, Jim--him above all.\u201d \u201cBut what is the black spot, captain?\u201d I asked. \u201cThat's a summons, mate. I'll tell you if they get that. But you keep your weather-eye open, Jim, and I'll share with you equals, upon my honour.\u201d He wandered a little longer, his voice growing weaker; but soon after I had given him his medicine, which he took like a child, with the remark, \u201cIf ever a seaman wanted drugs, it's me,\u201d he fell at last into a heavy, swoon-like sleep, in which I left him. What I should have done had all gone well I do not know. Probably I should have told the whole story to the doctor, for I was in mortal fear lest the captain should repent of his confessions and make an end of me. But as things fell out, my poor father died quite suddenly that evening, which put all other matters on one side. Our natural distress, the visits of the neighbours, the arranging of the funeral, and all the work of the inn to be carried on in the meanwhile kept me so busy that I had scarcely time to think of the captain, far less to be afraid of him. He got downstairs next morning, to be sure, and had his meals as usual, though he ate little and had more, I am afraid, than his usual supply of rum, for he helped himself out of the bar, scowling and blowing through his nose, and no one dared to cross him."], "What is the purpose of Dr. Livesey\u2019s visit to the pirate camp?": [" And, now I come to think of it, I might as well ride round there myself and report to him or squire. Master Pew's dead, when all's done; not that I regret it, but he's dead, you see, and people will make it out against an officer of his Majesty's revenue, if make it out they can. Now, I'll tell you, Hawkins, if you like, I'll take you along.\u201d I thanked him heartily for the offer, and we walked back to the hamlet where the horses were. By the time I had told mother of my purpose they were all in the saddle. \u201cDogger,\u201d said Mr. Dance, \u201cyou have a good horse; take up this lad behind you.\u201d As soon as I was mounted, holding on to Dogger's belt, the supervisor gave the word, and the party struck out at a bouncing trot on the road to Dr. Livesey's house. 6 The Captain's Papers WE rode hard all the way till we drew up before Dr. Livesey's door. The house was all dark to the front. Mr. Dance told me to jump down and knock, and Dogger gave me a stirrup to descend by. The door was opened almost at once by the maid. \u201cIs Dr. Livesey in?\u201d I asked. No, she said, he had come home in the afternoon but had gone up to the hall to dine and pass the evening with the squire. \u201cSo there we go, boys,\u201d said Mr. Dance. This time, as the distance was short, I did not mount, but ran with Dogger's stirrup-leather to the lodge gates and up the long, leafless, moonlit avenue to where the white line of the hall buildings looked on either hand on great old gardens.", " So the weeks passed on, till one fine day there came a letter addressed to Dr. Livesey, with this addition, \u201cTo be opened, in the case of his absence, by Tom Redruth or young Hawkins.\u201d Obeying this order, we found, or rather I found--for the gamekeeper was a poor hand at reading anything but print--the following important news: Old Anchor Inn, Bristol, March 1, 17-- Dear Livesey--As I do not know whether you are at the hall or still in London, I send this in double to both places. The ship is bought and fitted. She lies at anchor, ready for sea. You never imagined a sweeter schooner--a child might sail her--two hundred tons; name, HISPANIOLA. I got her through my old friend, Blandly, who has proved himself throughout the most surprising trump. The admirable fellow literally slaved in my interest, and so, I may say, did everyone in Bristol, as soon as they got wind of the port we sailed for--treasure, I mean. \u201cRedruth,\u201d said I, interrupting the letter, \u201cDr. Livesey will not like that. The squire has been talking, after all.\u201d \u201cWell, who's a better right?\u201d growled the gamekeeper. \u201cA pretty rum go if squire ain't to talk for Dr. Livesey, I should think.\u201d At that I gave up all attempts at commentary and read straight on: Blandly himself found the HISPANIOLA, and by the most admirable management got her for the merest trifle. There is a class of men in Bristol monstrously prejudiced against Blandly.", " I don't like this cruise; I don't like the men; and I don't like my officer. That's short and sweet.\u201d \u201cPerhaps, sir, you don't like the ship?\u201d inquired the squire, very angry, as I could see. \u201cI can't speak as to that, sir, not having seen her tried,\u201d said the captain. \u201cShe seems a clever craft; more I can't say.\u201d \u201cPossibly, sir, you may not like your employer, either?\u201d says the squire. But here Dr. Livesey cut in. \u201cStay a bit,\u201d said he, \u201cstay a bit. No use of such questions as that but to produce ill feeling. The captain has said too much or he has said too little, and I'm bound to say that I require an explanation of his words. You don't, you say, like this cruise. Now, why?\u201d \u201cI was engaged, sir, on what we call sealed orders, to sail this ship for that gentleman where he should bid me,\u201d said the captain. \u201cSo far so good. But now I find that every man before the mast knows more than I do. I don't call that fair, now, do you?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Dr. Livesey, \u201cI don't.\u201d \u201cNext,\u201d said the captain, \u201cI learn we are going after treasure--hear it from my own hands, mind you. Now, treasure is ticklish work; I don't like treasure voyages on any account, and I don't like them, above all, when they are secret and when (begging your pardon, Mr. Trelawney) the secret has been told to the parrot.\u201d \u201cSilver's parrot?\u201d asked the squire. \u201cIt's a way of speaking,\u201d said the captain. \u201cBlabbed, I mean. It's my belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about, but I'll tell you my way of it--life or death, and a close run.\u201d \u201cThat is all clear, and, I dare say, true enough,\u201d replied Dr. Livesey.", " That was a good un about my score.\u201d And he began to laugh again, and that so heartily, that though I did not see the joke as he did, I was again obliged to join him in his mirth. On our little walk along the quays, he made himself the most interesting companion, telling me about the different ships that we passed by, their rig, tonnage, and nationality, explaining the work that was going forward--how one was discharging, another taking in cargo, and a third making ready for sea--and every now and then telling me some little anecdote of ships or seamen or repeating a nautical phrase till I had learned it perfectly. I began to see that here was one of the best of possible shipmates. When we got to the inn, the squire and Dr. Livesey were seated together, finishing a quart of ale with a toast in it, before they should go aboard the schooner on a visit of inspection. Long John told the story from first to last, with a great deal of spirit and the most perfect truth. \u201cThat was how it were, now, weren't it, Hawkins?\u201d he would say, now and again, and I could always bear him entirely out. The two gentlemen regretted that Black Dog had got away, but we all agreed there was nothing to be done, and after he had been complimented, Long John took up his crutch and departed. \u201cAll hands aboard by four this afternoon,\u201d shouted the squire after him. \u201cAye, aye, sir,\u201d cried the cook, in the passage."], "On what basis does Silver claim to trust Livesey with his hostage, Jim?": [" Or cut 'em down like that much pork? That would have been Flint's, or Billy Bones's.\u201d \u201cBilly was the man for that,\u201d said Israel. \u201c'Dead men don't bite,' says he. Well, he's dead now hisself; he knows the long and short on it now; and if ever a rough hand come to port, it was Billy.\u201d \u201cRight you are,\u201d said Silver; \u201crough and ready. But mark you here, I'm an easy man--I'm quite the gentleman, says you; but this time it's serious. Dooty is dooty, mates. I give my vote--death. When I'm in Parlyment and riding in my coach, I don't want none of these sea-lawyers in the cabin a-coming home, unlooked for, like the devil at prayers. Wait is what I say; but when the time comes, why, let her rip!\u201d \u201cJohn,\u201d cries the coxswain, \u201cyou're a man!\u201d \u201cYou'll say so, Israel when you see,\u201d said Silver. \u201cOnly one thing I claim--I claim Trelawney. I'll wring his calf's head off his body with these hands, Dick!\u201d he added, breaking off. \u201cYou just jump up, like a sweet lad, and get me an apple, to wet my pipe like.\u201d You may fancy the terror I was in! I should have leaped out and run for it if I had found the strength, but my limbs and heart alike misgave me. I heard Dick begin to rise, and then someone seemingly stopped him, and the voice of Hands exclaimed, \u201cOh, stow that! Don't you get sucking of that bilge, John. Let's have a go of the rum.\u201d \u201cDick,\u201d said Silver, \u201cI trust you. I've a gauge on the keg, mind.", " By the powers! But this tops the stiffest yarn to nothing.\u201d Silver paused, and I could see by the faces of George and his late comrades that these words had not been said in vain. \u201cThat's for number one,\u201d cried the accused, wiping the sweat from his brow, for he had been talking with a vehemence that shook the house. \u201cWhy, I give you my word, I'm sick to speak to you. You've neither sense nor memory, and I leave it to fancy where your mothers was that let you come to sea. Sea! Gentlemen o' fortune! I reckon tailors is your trade.\u201d \u201cGo on, John,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cSpeak up to the others.\u201d \u201cAh, the others!\u201d returned John. \u201cThey're a nice lot, ain't they? You say this cruise is bungled. Ah! By gum, if you could understand how bad it's bungled, you would see! We're that near the gibbet that my neck's stiff with thinking on it. You've seen 'em, maybe, hanged in chains, birds about 'em, seamen p'inting 'em out as they go down with the tide. 'Who's that?' says one. 'That! Why, that's John Silver. I knowed him well,' says another. And you can hear the chains a-jangle as you go about and reach for the other buoy. Now, that's about where we are, every mother's son of us, thanks to him, and Hands, and Anderson, and other ruination fools of you. And if you want to know about number four, and that boy, why, shiver my timbers, isn't he a hostage? Are we a-going to waste a hostage? No, not us; he might be our last chance, and I shouldn't wonder.", " But I'll go as far with you as I dare go, and a step beyond, for I'll have my wig sorted by the captain or I'm mistaken! And first, I'll give you a bit of hope; Silver, if we both get alive out of this wolf-trap, I'll do my best to save you, short of perjury.\u201d Silver's face was radiant. \u201cYou couldn't say more, I'm sure, sir, not if you was my mother,\u201d he cried. \u201cWell, that's my first concession,\u201d added the doctor. \u201cMy second is a piece of advice: keep the boy close beside you, and when you need help, halloo. I'm off to seek it for you, and that itself will show you if I speak at random. Good-bye, Jim.\u201d And Dr. Livesey shook hands with me through the stockade, nodded to Silver, and set off at a brisk pace into the wood. 31 The Treasure-hunt--Flint's Pointer \u201cJIM,\u201d said Silver when we were alone, \u201cif I saved your life, you saved mine; and I'll not forget it. I seen the doctor waving you to run for it--with the tail of my eye, I did; and I seen you say no, as plain as hearing. Jim, that's one to you. This is the first glint of hope I had since the attack failed, and I owe it you. And now, Jim, we're to go in for this here treasure-hunting, with sealed orders too, and I don't like it; and you and me must stick close, back to back like, and we'll save our necks in spite o' fate and fortune.\u201d Just then a man hailed us from the fire that breakfast was ready, and we were soon seated here and there about the sand over biscuit and fried junk.", " Now, the most goes for rum and a good fling, and to sea again in their shirts. But that's not the course I lay. I puts it all away, some here, some there, and none too much anywheres, by reason of suspicion. I'm fifty, mark you; once back from this cruise, I set up gentleman in earnest. Time enough too, says you. Ah, but I've lived easy in the meantime, never denied myself o' nothing heart desires, and slep' soft and ate dainty all my days but when at sea. And how did I begin? Before the mast, like you!\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said the other, \u201cbut all the other money's gone now, ain't it? You daren't show face in Bristol after this.\u201d \u201cWhy, where might you suppose it was?\u201d asked Silver derisively. \u201cAt Bristol, in banks and places,\u201d answered his companion. \u201cIt were,\u201d said the cook; \u201cit were when we weighed anchor. But my old missis has it all by now. And the Spy-glass is sold, lease and goodwill and rigging; and the old girl's off to meet me. I would tell you where, for I trust you, but it'd make jealousy among the mates.\u201d \u201cAnd can you trust your missis?\u201d asked the other. \u201cGentlemen of fortune,\u201d returned the cook, \u201cusually trusts little among themselves, and right they are, you may lay to it. But I have a way with me, I have. When a mate brings a slip on his cable--one as knows me, I mean--it won't be in the same world with old John. There was some that was feared of Pew, and some that was feared of Flint; but Flint his own self was feared of me."], "What marker do the pirates find pointing in the direction the treasure?": [" Shout after shout came from him, and the others began to run in his direction. \u201cHe can't 'a found the treasure,\u201d said old Morgan, hurrying past us from the right, \u201cfor that's clean a-top.\u201d Indeed, as we found when we also reached the spot, it was something very different. At the foot of a pretty big pine and involved in a green creeper, which had even partly lifted some of the smaller bones, a human skeleton lay, with a few shreds of clothing, on the ground. I believe a chill struck for a moment to every heart. \u201cHe was a seaman,\u201d said George Merry, who, bolder than the rest, had gone up close and was examining the rags of clothing. \u201cLeastways, this is good sea-cloth.\u201d \u201cAye, aye,\u201d said Silver; \u201clike enough; you wouldn't look to find a bishop here, I reckon. But what sort of a way is that for bones to lie? 'Tain't in natur'.\u201d Indeed, on a second glance, it seemed impossible to fancy that the body was in a natural position. But for some disarray (the work, perhaps, of the birds that had fed upon him or of the slow-growing creeper that had gradually enveloped his remains) the man lay perfectly straight--his feet pointing in one direction, his hands, raised above his head like a diver's, pointing directly in the opposite. \u201cI've taken a notion into my old numbskull,\u201d observed Silver. \u201cHere's the compass; there's the tip-top p'int o' Skeleton Island, stickin' out like a tooth. Just take a bearing, will you, along the line of them bones.\u201d It was done.", " I've got my piece o' news, and thanky to him for that; but it's over and done. I'll take him in a line when we go treasure-hunting, for we'll keep him like so much gold, in case of accidents, you mark, and in the meantime. Once we got the ship and treasure both and off to sea like jolly companions, why then we'll talk Mr. Hawkins over, we will, and we'll give him his share, to be sure, for all his kindness.\u201d It was no wonder the men were in a good humour now. For my part, I was horribly cast down. Should the scheme he had now sketched prove feasible, Silver, already doubly a traitor, would not hesitate to adopt it. He had still a foot in either camp, and there was no doubt he would prefer wealth and freedom with the pirates to a bare escape from hanging, which was the best he had to hope on our side. Nay, and even if things so fell out that he was forced to keep his faith with Dr. Livesey, even then what danger lay before us! What a moment that would be when the suspicions of his followers turned to certainty and he and I should have to fight for dear life--he a cripple and I a boy--against five strong and active seamen! Add to this double apprehension the mystery that still hung over the behaviour of my friends, their unexplained desertion of the stockade, their inexplicable cession of the chart, or harder still to understand, the doctor's last warning to Silver, \u201cLook out for squalls when you find it,\u201d and you will readily believe how little taste I found in my breakfast and with how uneasy a heart I set forth behind my captors on the quest for treasure.", " One fine day up went the signal, and here come Flint by himself in a little boat, and his head done up in a blue scarf. The sun was getting up, and mortal white he looked about the cutwater. But, there he was, you mind, and the six all dead--dead and buried. How he done it, not a man aboard us could make out. It was battle, murder, and sudden death, leastways--him against six. Billy Bones was the mate; Long John, he was quartermaster; and they asked him where the treasure was. 'Ah,' says he, 'you can go ashore, if you like, and stay,' he says; 'but as for the ship, she'll beat up for more, by thunder!' That's what he said. \u201cWell, I was in another ship three years back, and we sighted this island. 'Boys,' said I, 'here's Flint's treasure; let's land and find it.' The cap'n was displeased at that, but my messmates were all of a mind and landed. Twelve days they looked for it, and every day they had the worse word for me, until one fine morning all hands went aboard. 'As for you, Benjamin Gunn,' says they, 'here's a musket,' they says, 'and a spade, and pick-axe. You can stay here and find Flint's money for yourself,' they says. \u201cWell, Jim, three years have I been here, and not a bite of Christian diet from that day to this. But now, you look here; look at me. Do I look like a man before the mast? No, says you. Nor I weren't, neither, I says.\u201d And with that he winked and pinched me hard.", " \u201cAnd when Ben Gunn is wanted, you know where to find him, Jim. Just wheer you found him today. And him that comes is to have a white thing in his hand, and he's to come alone. Oh! And you'll say this: 'Ben Gunn,' says you, 'has reasons of his own. '\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said I, \u201cI believe I understand. You have something to propose, and you wish to see the squire or the doctor, and you're to be found where I found you. Is that all?\u201d \u201cAnd when? says you,\u201d he added. \u201cWhy, from about noon observation to about six bells.\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d said I, \u201cand now may I go?\u201d \u201cYou won't forget?\u201d he inquired anxiously. \u201cPrecious sight, and reasons of his own, says you. Reasons of his own; that's the mainstay; as between man and man. Well, then\u201d--still holding me--\u201cI reckon you can go, Jim. And, Jim, if you was to see Silver, you wouldn't go for to sell Ben Gunn? Wild horses wouldn't draw it from you? No, says you. And if them pirates camp ashore, Jim, what would you say but there'd be widders in the morning?\u201d Here he was interrupted by a loud report, and a cannonball came tearing through the trees and pitched in the sand not a hundred yards from where we two were talking. The next moment each of us had taken to his heels in a different direction. For a good hour to come frequent reports shook the island, and balls kept crashing through the woods. I moved from hiding-place to hiding-place, always pursued, or so it seemed to me, by these terrifying missiles."], "Whose voice do the pirates believe they are hearing as they approach the site of the treasure?": [" *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TREASURE ISLAND *** Produced by Judy Boss, John Hamm and David Widger TREASURE ISLAND by Robert Louis Stevenson TREASURE ISLAND To S.L.O., an American gentleman in accordance with whose classic taste the following narrative has been designed, it is now, in return for numerous delightful hours, and with the kindest wishes, dedicated by his affectionate friend, the author.

Nor was I deceived, for soon I heard the very distant and low tones of a human voice, which, as I continued to give ear, grew steadily louder and nearer. This put me in a great fear, and I crawled under cover of the nearest live-oak and squatted there, hearkening, as silent as a mouse. Another voice answered, and then the first voice, which I now recognized to be Silver's, once more took up the story and ran on for a long while in a stream, only now and again interrupted by the other. By the sound they must have been talking earnestly, and almost fiercely; but no distinct word came to my hearing. At last the speakers seemed to have paused and perhaps to have sat down, for not only did they cease to draw any nearer, but the birds themselves began to grow more quiet and to settle again to their places in the swamp. And now I began to feel that I was neglecting my business, that since I had been so foolhardy as to come ashore with these desperadoes, the least I could do was to overhear them at their councils, and that my plain and obvious duty was to draw as close as I could manage, under the favourable ambush of the crouching trees. I could tell the direction of the speakers pretty exactly, not only by the sound of their voices but by the behaviour of the few birds that still hung in alarm above the heads of the intruders.", " I've got my piece o' news, and thanky to him for that; but it's over and done. I'll take him in a line when we go treasure-hunting, for we'll keep him like so much gold, in case of accidents, you mark, and in the meantime.

There was an echo. Now, no man ever seen a sperrit with a shadow; well then, what's he doing with an echo to him, I should like to know? That ain't in natur', surely?\u201d This argument seemed weak enough to me. But you can never tell what will affect the superstitious, and to my wonder, George Merry was greatly relieved. \u201cWell, that's so,\u201d he said. \u201cYou've a head upon your shoulders, John, and no mistake. 'Bout ship, mates! This here crew is on a wrong tack, I do believe. And come to think on it, it was like Flint's voice, I grant you, but not just so clear-away like it, after all. It was liker somebody else's voice now--it was liker--\u201d \u201cBy the powers, Ben Gunn!\u201d roared Silver. \u201cAye, and so it were,\u201d cried Morgan, springing on his knees. \u201cBen Gunn it were!\u201d \u201cIt don't make much odds, do it, now?\u201d asked Dick. \u201cBen Gunn's not here in the body any more'n Flint.\u201d But the older hands greeted this remark with scorn. \u201cWhy, nobody minds Ben Gunn,\u201d cried Merry; \u201cdead or alive, nobody minds him.\u201d It was extraordinary how their spirits had returned and how the natural colour had revived in their faces. Soon they were chatting together, with intervals of listening; and not long after, hearing no further sound, they shouldered the tools and set forth again, Merry walking first with Silver's compass to keep them on the right line with Skeleton Island. He had said the truth: dead or alive, nobody minded Ben Gunn."], "Who found Flint\u2019s treasure and moved it to a cave, rendering the original treasure map useless?": [" \u201cOne more,\u201d said the captain. \u201cThere's been too much blabbing already.\u201d \u201cFar too much,\u201d agreed the doctor. \u201cI'll tell you what I've heard myself,\u201d continued Captain Smollett: \u201cthat you have a map of an island, that there's crosses on the map to show where treasure is, and that the island lies--\u201d And then he named the latitude and longitude exactly. \u201cI never told that,\u201d cried the squire, \u201cto a soul!\u201d \u201cThe hands know it, sir,\u201d returned the captain. \u201cLivesey, that must have been you or Hawkins,\u201d cried the squire. \u201cIt doesn't much matter who it was,\u201d replied the doctor. And I could see that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to Mr. Trelawney's protestations. Neither did I, to be sure, he was so loose a talker; yet in this case I believe he was really right and that nobody had told the situation of the island. \u201cWell, gentlemen,\u201d continued the captain, \u201cI don't know who has this map; but I make it a point, it shall be kept secret even from me and Mr. Arrow. Otherwise I would ask you to let me resign.\u201d \u201cI see,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cYou wish us to keep this matter dark and to make a garrison of the stern part of the ship, manned with my friend's own people, and provided with all the arms and powder on board. In other words, you fear a mutiny.\u201d \u201cSir,\u201d said Captain Smollett, \u201cwith no intention to take offence, I deny your right to put words into my mouth. No captain, sir, would be justified in going to sea at all if he had ground enough to say that.", " \u201cThank ye kindly, doctor,\u201d says he. \u201cYou came in in about the nick, I guess, for me and Hawkins. And so it's you, Ben Gunn!\u201d he added. \u201cWell, you're a nice one, to be sure.\u201d \u201cI'm Ben Gunn, I am,\u201d replied the maroon, wriggling like an eel in his embarrassment. \u201cAnd,\u201d he added, after a long pause, \u201chow do, Mr. Silver? Pretty well, I thank ye, says you.\u201d \u201cBen, Ben,\u201d murmured Silver, \u201cto think as you've done me!\u201d The doctor sent back Gray for one of the pick-axes deserted, in their flight, by the mutineers, and then as we proceeded leisurely downhill to where the boats were lying, related in a few words what had taken place. It was a story that profoundly interested Silver; and Ben Gunn, the half-idiot maroon, was the hero from beginning to end. Ben, in his long, lonely wanderings about the island, had found the skeleton--it was he that had rifled it; he had found the treasure; he had dug it up (it was the haft of his pick-axe that lay broken in the excavation); he had carried it on his back, in many weary journeys, from the foot of the tall pine to a cave he had on the two-pointed hill at the north-east angle of the island, and there it had lain stored in safety since two months before the arrival of the HISPANIOLA. When the doctor had wormed this secret from him on the afternoon of the attack, and when next morning he saw the anchorage deserted, he had gone to Silver, given him the chart, which was now useless--given him the stores, for Ben Gunn's cave was well supplied with goats' meat salted by himself--given anything and everything to get a chance of moving in safety from the stockade to the two-pointed hill, there to be clear of malaria and keep a guard upon the money.", " Soon we passed out of the straits and doubled the south-east corner of the island, round which, four days ago, we had towed the HISPANIOLA. As we passed the two-pointed hill, we could see the black mouth of Ben Gunn's cave and a figure standing by it, leaning on a musket. It was the squire, and we waved a handkerchief and gave him three cheers, in which the voice of Silver joined as heartily as any. Three miles farther, just inside the mouth of North Inlet, what should we meet but the HISPANIOLA, cruising by herself? The last flood had lifted her, and had there been much wind or a strong tide current, as in the southern anchorage, we should never have found her more, or found her stranded beyond help. As it was, there was little amiss beyond the wreck of the main-sail. Another anchor was got ready and dropped in a fathom and a half of water. We all pulled round again to Rum Cove, the nearest point for Ben Gunn's treasure-house; and then Gray, single-handed, returned with the gig to the HISPANIOLA, where he was to pass the night on guard. A gentle slope ran up from the beach to the entrance of the cave. At the top, the squire met us. To me he was cordial and kind, saying nothing of my escapade either in the way of blame or praise. At Silver's polite salute he somewhat flushed. \u201cJohn Silver,\u201d he said, \u201cyou're a prodigious villain and imposter--a monstrous imposter, sir. I am told I am not to prosecute you.", " Blackbeard was a child to Flint. The Spaniards were so prodigiously afraid of him that, I tell you, sir, I was sometimes proud he was an Englishman. I've seen his top-sails with these eyes, off Trinidad, and the cowardly son of a rum-puncheon that I sailed with put back--put back, sir, into Port of Spain.\u201d \u201cWell, I've heard of him myself, in England,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cBut the point is, had he money?\u201d \u201cMoney!\u201d cried the squire. \u201cHave you heard the story? What were these villains after but money? What do they care for but money? For what would they risk their rascal carcasses but money?\u201d \u201cThat we shall soon know,\u201d replied the doctor. \u201cBut you are so confoundedly hot-headed and exclamatory that I cannot get a word in. What I want to know is this: Supposing that I have here in my pocket some clue to where Flint buried his treasure, will that treasure amount to much?\u201d \u201cAmount, sir!\u201d cried the squire. \u201cIt will amount to this: If we have the clue you talk about, I fit out a ship in Bristol dock, and take you and Hawkins here along, and I'll have that treasure if I search a year.\u201d \u201cVery well,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cNow, then, if Jim is agreeable, we'll open the packet\u201d; and he laid it before him on the table. The bundle was sewn together, and the doctor had to get out his instrument case and cut the stitches with his medical scissors. It contained two things--a book and a sealed paper. \u201cFirst of all we'll try the book,\u201d observed the doctor."], "What most fascinates Jim about the coins that the men find in the cave?": [" Well, then, I will not. But the dead men, sir, hang about your neck like mill-stones.\u201d \u201cThank you kindly, sir,\u201d replied Long John, again saluting. \u201cI dare you to thank me!\u201d cried the squire. \u201cIt is a gross dereliction of my duty. Stand back.\u201d And thereupon we all entered the cave. It was a large, airy place, with a little spring and a pool of clear water, overhung with ferns. The floor was sand. Before a big fire lay Captain Smollett; and in a far corner, only duskily flickered over by the blaze, I beheld great heaps of coin and quadrilaterals built of bars of gold. That was Flint's treasure that we had come so far to seek and that had cost already the lives of seventeen men from the HISPANIOLA. How many it had cost in the amassing, what blood and sorrow, what good ships scuttled on the deep, what brave men walking the plank blindfold, what shot of cannon, what shame and lies and cruelty, perhaps no man alive could tell. Yet there were still three upon that island--Silver, and old Morgan, and Ben Gunn--who had each taken his share in these crimes, as each had hoped in vain to share in the reward. \u201cCome in, Jim,\u201d said the captain. \u201cYou're a good boy in your line, Jim, but I don't think you and me'll go to sea again. You're too much of the born favourite for me. Is that you, John Silver? What brings you here, man?\u201d \u201cCome back to my dooty, sir,\u201d returned Silver. \u201cAh!\u201d said the captain, and that was all he said.", " Soon we passed out of the straits and doubled the south-east corner of the island, round which, four days ago, we had towed the HISPANIOLA. As we passed the two-pointed hill, we could see the black mouth of Ben Gunn's cave and a figure standing by it, leaning on a musket. It was the squire, and we waved a handkerchief and gave him three cheers, in which the voice of Silver joined as heartily as any. Three miles farther, just inside the mouth of North Inlet, what should we meet but the HISPANIOLA, cruising by herself? The last flood had lifted her, and had there been much wind or a strong tide current, as in the southern anchorage, we should never have found her more, or found her stranded beyond help. As it was, there was little amiss beyond the wreck of the main-sail. Another anchor was got ready and dropped in a fathom and a half of water. We all pulled round again to Rum Cove, the nearest point for Ben Gunn's treasure-house; and then Gray, single-handed, returned with the gig to the HISPANIOLA, where he was to pass the night on guard. A gentle slope ran up from the beach to the entrance of the cave. At the top, the squire met us. To me he was cordial and kind, saying nothing of my escapade either in the way of blame or praise. At Silver's polite salute he somewhat flushed. \u201cJohn Silver,\u201d he said, \u201cyou're a prodigious villain and imposter--a monstrous imposter, sir. I am told I am not to prosecute you.", " \u201cThank ye kindly, doctor,\u201d says he. \u201cYou came in in about the nick, I guess, for me and Hawkins. And so it's you, Ben Gunn!\u201d he added. \u201cWell, you're a nice one, to be sure.\u201d \u201cI'm Ben Gunn, I am,\u201d replied the maroon, wriggling like an eel in his embarrassment. \u201cAnd,\u201d he added, after a long pause, \u201chow do, Mr. Silver? Pretty well, I thank ye, says you.\u201d \u201cBen, Ben,\u201d murmured Silver, \u201cto think as you've done me!\u201d The doctor sent back Gray for one of the pick-axes deserted, in their flight, by the mutineers, and then as we proceeded leisurely downhill to where the boats were lying, related in a few words what had taken place. It was a story that profoundly interested Silver; and Ben Gunn, the half-idiot maroon, was the hero from beginning to end. Ben, in his long, lonely wanderings about the island, had found the skeleton--it was he that had rifled it; he had found the treasure; he had dug it up (it was the haft of his pick-axe that lay broken in the excavation); he had carried it on his back, in many weary journeys, from the foot of the tall pine to a cave he had on the two-pointed hill at the north-east angle of the island, and there it had lain stored in safety since two months before the arrival of the HISPANIOLA. When the doctor had wormed this secret from him on the afternoon of the attack, and when next morning he saw the anchorage deserted, he had gone to Silver, given him the chart, which was now useless--given him the stores, for Ben Gunn's cave was well supplied with goats' meat salted by himself--given anything and everything to get a chance of moving in safety from the stockade to the two-pointed hill, there to be clear of malaria and keep a guard upon the money.", " \u201cAnd when Ben Gunn is wanted, you know where to find him, Jim. Just wheer you found him today. And him that comes is to have a white thing in his hand, and he's to come alone. Oh! And you'll say this: 'Ben Gunn,' says you, 'has reasons of his own. '\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said I, \u201cI believe I understand. You have something to propose, and you wish to see the squire or the doctor, and you're to be found where I found you. Is that all?\u201d \u201cAnd when? says you,\u201d he added. \u201cWhy, from about noon observation to about six bells.\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d said I, \u201cand now may I go?\u201d \u201cYou won't forget?\u201d he inquired anxiously. \u201cPrecious sight, and reasons of his own, says you. Reasons of his own; that's the mainstay; as between man and man. Well, then\u201d--still holding me--\u201cI reckon you can go, Jim. And, Jim, if you was to see Silver, you wouldn't go for to sell Ben Gunn? Wild horses wouldn't draw it from you? No, says you. And if them pirates camp ashore, Jim, what would you say but there'd be widders in the morning?\u201d Here he was interrupted by a loud report, and a cannonball came tearing through the trees and pitched in the sand not a hundred yards from where we two were talking. The next moment each of us had taken to his heels in a different direction. For a good hour to come frequent reports shook the island, and balls kept crashing through the woods. I moved from hiding-place to hiding-place, always pursued, or so it seemed to me, by these terrifying missiles."], "Who or what features in Jim\u2019s nightmares about treasure hunting?": [" But I'll go as far with you as I dare go, and a step beyond, for I'll have my wig sorted by the captain or I'm mistaken! And first, I'll give you a bit of hope; Silver, if we both get alive out of this wolf-trap, I'll do my best to save you, short of perjury.\u201d Silver's face was radiant. \u201cYou couldn't say more, I'm sure, sir, not if you was my mother,\u201d he cried. \u201cWell, that's my first concession,\u201d added the doctor. \u201cMy second is a piece of advice: keep the boy close beside you, and when you need help, halloo. I'm off to seek it for you, and that itself will show you if I speak at random. Good-bye, Jim.\u201d And Dr. Livesey shook hands with me through the stockade, nodded to Silver, and set off at a brisk pace into the wood. 31 The Treasure-hunt--Flint's Pointer \u201cJIM,\u201d said Silver when we were alone, \u201cif I saved your life, you saved mine; and I'll not forget it. I seen the doctor waving you to run for it--with the tail of my eye, I did; and I seen you say no, as plain as hearing. Jim, that's one to you. This is the first glint of hope I had since the attack failed, and I owe it you. And now, Jim, we're to go in for this here treasure-hunting, with sealed orders too, and I don't like it; and you and me must stick close, back to back like, and we'll save our necks in spite o' fate and fortune.\u201d Just then a man hailed us from the fire that breakfast was ready, and we were soon seated here and there about the sand over biscuit and fried junk.", " I've got my piece o' news, and thanky to him for that; but it's over and done. I'll take him in a line when we go treasure-hunting, for we'll keep him like so much gold, in case of accidents, you mark, and in the meantime. Once we got the ship and treasure both and off to sea like jolly companions, why then we'll talk Mr. Hawkins over, we will, and we'll give him his share, to be sure, for all his kindness.\u201d It was no wonder the men were in a good humour now. For my part, I was horribly cast down. Should the scheme he had now sketched prove feasible, Silver, already doubly a traitor, would not hesitate to adopt it. He had still a foot in either camp, and there was no doubt he would prefer wealth and freedom with the pirates to a bare escape from hanging, which was the best he had to hope on our side. Nay, and even if things so fell out that he was forced to keep his faith with Dr. Livesey, even then what danger lay before us! What a moment that would be when the suspicions of his followers turned to certainty and he and I should have to fight for dear life--he a cripple and I a boy--against five strong and active seamen! Add to this double apprehension the mystery that still hung over the behaviour of my friends, their unexplained desertion of the stockade, their inexplicable cession of the chart, or harder still to understand, the doctor's last warning to Silver, \u201cLook out for squalls when you find it,\u201d and you will readily believe how little taste I found in my breakfast and with how uneasy a heart I set forth behind my captors on the quest for treasure.", " \u201cYou're the man to keep your word, we know that.\u201d Well, that was about the last news we had of the three pirates. Only once we heard a gunshot a great way off and supposed them to be hunting. A council was held, and it was decided that we must desert them on the island--to the huge glee, I must say, of Ben Gunn, and with the strong approval of Gray. We left a good stock of powder and shot, the bulk of the salt goat, a few medicines, and some other necessaries, tools, clothing, a spare sail, a fathom or two of rope, and by the particular desire of the doctor, a handsome present of tobacco. That was about our last doing on the island. Before that, we had got the treasure stowed and had shipped enough water and the remainder of the goat meat in case of any distress; and at last, one fine morning, we weighed anchor, which was about all that we could manage, and stood out of North Inlet, the same colours flying that the captain had flown and fought under at the palisade. The three fellows must have been watching us closer than we thought for, as we soon had proved. For coming through the narrows, we had to lie very near the southern point, and there we saw all three of them kneeling together on a spit of sand, with their arms raised in supplication. It went to all our hearts, I think, to leave them in that wretched state; but we could not risk another mutiny; and to take them home for the gibbet would have been a cruel sort of kindness.", " It seemed to me so obvious, in this case, that I could not imagine how he was to turn their anger. But he was twice the man the rest were, and his last night's victory had given him a huge preponderance on their minds. He called them all the fools and dolts you can imagine, said it was necessary I should talk to the doctor, fluttered the chart in their faces, asked them if they could afford to break the treaty the very day they were bound a-treasure-hunting. \u201cNo, by thunder!\u201d he cried. \u201cIt's us must break the treaty when the time comes; and till then I'll gammon that doctor, if I have to ile his boots with brandy.\u201d And then he bade them get the fire lit, and stalked out upon his crutch, with his hand on my shoulder, leaving them in a disarray, and silenced by his volubility rather than convinced. \u201cSlow, lad, slow,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might round upon us in a twinkle of an eye if we was seen to hurry.\u201d Very deliberately, then, did we advance across the sand to where the doctor awaited us on the other side of the stockade, and as soon as we were within easy speaking distance Silver stopped. \u201cYou'll make a note of this here also, doctor,\u201d says he, \u201cand the boy'll tell you how I saved his life, and were deposed for it too, and you may lay to that. Doctor, when a man's steering as near the wind as me--playing chuck-farthing with the last breath in his body, like--you wouldn't think it too much, mayhap, to give him one good word?"]}
