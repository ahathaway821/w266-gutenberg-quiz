{"What does Jim\u2019sfather do for a living?": [" I was about desperate to lose that much blunt, and be hanged into the bargain. But I see you was the right sort. I says to myself, you stand by Hawkins, John, and Hawkins'll stand by you. You're his last card, and by the living thunder, John, he's yours! Back to back, says I. You save your witness, and he'll save your neck!\u201d I began dimly to understand. \u201cYou mean all's lost?\u201d I asked. \u201cAye, by gum, I do!\u201d he answered. \u201cShip gone, neck gone--that's the size of it. Once I looked into that bay, Jim Hawkins, and seen no schooner--well, I'm tough, but I gave out. As for that lot and their council, mark me, they're outright fools and cowards. I'll save your life--if so be as I can--from them. But, see here, Jim--tit for tat--you save Long John from swinging.\u201d I was bewildered; it seemed a thing so hopeless he was asking--he, the old buccaneer, the ringleader throughout. \u201cWhat I can do, that I'll do,\u201d I said.", " \u201cSo, Jim,\u201d said the doctor sadly, \u201chere you are. As you have brewed, so shall you drink, my boy. Heaven knows, I cannot find it in my heart to blame you, but this much I will say, be it kind or unkind: when Captain Smollett was well, you dared not have gone off; and when he was ill and couldn't help it, by George, it was downright cowardly!\u201d I will own that I here began to weep. \u201cDoctor,\u201d I said, \u201cyou might spare me. I have blamed myself enough; my life's forfeit anyway, and I should have been dead by now if Silver hadn't stood for me; and doctor, believe this, I can die--and I dare say I deserve it--but what I fear is torture. If they come to torture me--\u201d \u201cJim,\u201d the doctor interrupted, and his voice was quite changed, \u201cJim, I can't have this. Whip over, and we'll run for it.\u201d \u201cDoctor,\u201d said I, \u201cI passed my word.\u201d \u201cI know, I know,\u201d he cried. \u201cWe can't help that, Jim, now. I'll take it on my shoulders, holus bolus, blame and shame, my boy; but stay here, I cannot let you.", " \u201cJim, Jim,\u201d says he, quite pleased apparently. \u201cWell, now, Jim, I've lived that rough as you'd be ashamed to hear of. Now, for instance, you wouldn't think I had had a pious mother--to look at me?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy, no, not in particular,\u201d I answered. \u201cAh, well,\u201d said he, \u201cbut I had--remarkable pious. And I was a civil, pious boy, and could rattle off my catechism that fast, as you couldn't tell one word from another. And here's what it come to, Jim, and it begun with chuck-farthen on the blessed grave-stones! That's what it begun with, but it went further'n that; and so my mother told me, and predicked the whole, she did, the pious woman! But it were Providence that put me here. I've thought it all out in this here lonely island, and I'm back on piety. You don't catch me tasting rum so much, but just a thimbleful for luck, of course, the first chance I have. I'm bound I'll be good, and I see the way to.", " And, Jim\u201d--looking all round him and lowering his voice to a whisper--\u201cI'm rich.\u201d I now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude, and I suppose I must have shown the feeling in my face, for he repeated the statement hotly: \u201cRich! Rich! I says. And I'll tell you what: I'll make a man of you, Jim. Ah, Jim, you'll bless your stars, you will, you was the first that found me!\u201d And at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face, and he tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly before my eyes. \u201cNow, Jim, you tell me true: that ain't Flint's ship?\u201d he asked. At this I had a happy inspiration. I began to believe that I had found an ally, and I answered him at once. \u201cIt's not Flint's ship, and Flint is dead; but I'll tell you true, as you ask me--there are some of Flint's hands aboard; worse luck for the rest of us.\u201d \u201cNot a man--with one--leg?\u201d he gasped."], "Why does Billygive Jim money each month?": [" In one way, indeed, he bade fair to ruin us, for he kept on staying week after week, and at last month after month, so that all the money had been long exhausted, and still my father never plucked up the heart to insist on having more. If ever he mentioned it, the captain blew through his nose so loudly that you might say he roared, and stared my poor father out of the room. I have seen him wringing his hands after such a rebuff, and I am sure the annoyance and the terror he lived in must have greatly hastened his early and unhappy death. All the time he lived with us the captain made no change whatever in his dress but to buy some stockings from a hawker. One of the cocks of his hat having fallen down, he let it hang from that day forth, though it was a great annoyance when it blew. I remember the appearance of his coat, which he patched himself upstairs in his room, and which, before the end, was nothing but patches.", " I've seen his top-sails with these eyes, off Trinidad, and the cowardly son of a rum-puncheon that I sailed with put back--put back, sir, into Port of Spain.\u201d \u201cWell, I've heard of him myself, in England,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cBut the point is, had he money?\u201d \u201cMoney!\u201d cried the squire. \u201cHave you heard the story? What were these villains after but money? What do they care for but money? For what would they risk their rascal carcasses but money?\u201d \u201cThat we shall soon know,\u201d replied the doctor. \u201cBut you are so confoundedly hot-headed and exclamatory that I cannot get a word in. What I want to know is this: Supposing that I have here in my pocket some clue to where Flint buried his treasure, will that treasure amount to much?\u201d \u201cAmount, sir!\u201d cried the squire. \u201cIt will amount to this: If we have the clue you talk about, I fit out a ship in Bristol dock, and take you and Hawkins here along, and I'll have that treasure if I search a year.\u201d \u201cVery well,\u201d said the doctor.", " \u201cAnd that,\u201d said he, \u201cis just about as good as nothing. They've got off clean, and there's an end. Only,\u201d he added, \u201cI'm glad I trod on Master Pew's corns,\u201d for by this time he had heard my story. I went back with him to the Admiral Benbow, and you cannot imagine a house in such a state of smash; the very clock had been thrown down by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself; and though nothing had actually been taken away except the captain's money-bag and a little silver from the till, I could see at once that we were ruined. Mr. Dance could make nothing of the scene. \u201cThey got the money, you say? Well, then, Hawkins, what in fortune were they after? More money, I suppose?\u201d \u201cNo, sir; not money, I think,\u201d replied I. \u201cIn fact, sir, I believe I have the thing in my breast pocket; and to tell you the truth, I should like to get it put in safety.\u201d \u201cTo be sure, boy; quite right,\u201d said he.", " Never a month but I've given you a silver fourpenny for yourself. And now you see, mate, I'm pretty low, and deserted by all; and Jim, you'll bring me one noggin of rum, now, won't you, matey?\u201d \u201cThe doctor--\u201d I began. But he broke in cursing the doctor, in a feeble voice but heartily. \u201cDoctors is all swabs,\u201d he said; \u201cand that doctor there, why, what do he know about seafaring men? I been in places hot as pitch, and mates dropping round with Yellow Jack, and the blessed land a-heaving like the sea with earthquakes--what to the doctor know of lands like that?--and I lived on rum, I tell you. It's been meat and drink, and man and wife, to me; and if I'm not to have my rum now I'm a poor old hulk on a lee shore, my blood'll be on you, Jim, and that doctor swab\u201d; and he ran on again for a while with curses. \u201cLook, Jim, how my fingers fidges,\u201d he continued in the pleading tone. \u201cI can't keep 'em still, not I. I haven't had a drop this blessed day."], "Where is Billywhen he receives the black spot?": [" \u201cJim,\u201d he said at length, \u201cyou saw that seafaring man today?\u201d \u201cBlack Dog?\u201d I asked. \u201cAh! Black Dog,\u201d says he. \u201cHE'S a bad un; but there's worse that put him on. Now, if I can't get away nohow, and they tip me the black spot, mind you, it's my old sea-chest they're after; you get on a horse--you can, can't you? Well, then, you get on a horse, and go to--well, yes, I will!--to that eternal doctor swab, and tell him to pipe all hands--magistrates and sich--and he'll lay 'em aboard at the Admiral Benbow--all old Flint's crew, man and boy, all on 'em that's left. I was first mate, I was, old Flint's first mate, and I'm the on'y one as knows the place. He gave it me at Savannah, when he lay a-dying, like as if I was to now, you see. But you won't peach unless they get the black spot on me, or unless you see that Black Dog again or a seafaring man with one leg, Jim--him above all.\u201d \u201cBut what is the black spot, captain?\u201d I asked.", " The captain made a sort of gasp. \u201cBlack Dog!\u201d said he. \u201cAnd who else?\u201d returned the other, getting more at his ease. \u201cBlack Dog as ever was, come for to see his old shipmate Billy, at the Admiral Benbow inn. Ah, Bill, Bill, we have seen a sight of times, us two, since I lost them two talons,\u201d holding up his mutilated hand. \u201cNow, look here,\u201d said the captain; \u201cyou've run me down; here I am; well, then, speak up; what is it?\u201d \u201cThat's you, Bill,\u201d returned Black Dog, \u201cyou're in the right of it, Billy. I'll have a glass of rum from this dear child here, as I've took such a liking to; and we'll sit down, if you please, and talk square, like old shipmates.\u201d When I returned with the rum, they were already seated on either side of the captain's breakfast-table--Black Dog next to the door and sitting sideways so as to have one eye on his old shipmate and one, as I thought, on his retreat. He bade me go and leave the door wide open.", " CONTENTS PART ONE The Old Buccaneer 1. THE OLD SEA-DOG AT THE ADMIRAL BENBOW 11 2. BLACK DOG APPEARS AND DISAPPEARS . . . . 17 3.

I remember him as if it were yesterday, as he came plodding to the inn door, his sea-chest following behind him in a hand-barrow--a tall, strong, heavy, nut-brown man, his tarry pigtail falling over the shoulder of his soiled blue coat, his hands ragged and scarred, with black, broken nails, and the sabre cut across one cheek, a dirty, livid white.", " *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TREASURE ISLAND *** Produced by Judy Boss, John Hamm and David Widger TREASURE ISLAND by Robert Louis Stevenson TREASURE ISLAND To S.L.O., an American gentleman in accordance with whose classic taste the following narrative has been designed, it is now, in return for numerous delightful hours, and with the kindest wishes, dedicated by his affectionate friend, the author. TO THE HESITATING PURCHASER If sailor tales to sailor tunes, Storm and adventure, heat and cold, If schooners, islands, and maroons, And buccaneers, and buried gold, And all the old romance, retold Exactly in the ancient way, Can please, as me they pleased of old, The wiser youngsters of today: --So be it, and fall on! If not, If studious youth no longer crave, His ancient appetites forgot, Kingston, or Ballantyne the brave, Or Cooper of the wood and wave: So be it, also! And may I And all my pirates share the grave Where these and their creations lie!", " Perhaps it was this--perhaps it was the look of the island, with its grey, melancholy woods, and wild stone spires, and the surf that we could both see and hear foaming and thundering on the steep beach--at least, although the sun shone bright and hot, and the shore birds were fishing and crying all around us, and you would have thought anyone would have been glad to get to land after being so long at sea, my heart sank, as the saying is, into my boots; and from the first look onward, I hated the very thought of Treasure Island. We had a dreary morning's work before us, for there was no sign of any wind, and the boats had to be got out and manned, and the ship warped three or four miles round the corner of the island and up the narrow passage to the haven behind Skeleton Island. I volunteered for one of the boats, where I had, of course, no business. The heat was sweltering, and the men grumbled fiercely over their work.", " Soon, however, he saw that our party had the start of him; and Ben Gunn, being fleet of foot, had been dispatched in front to do his best alone. Then it had occurred to him to work upon the superstitions of his former shipmates, and he was so far successful that Gray and the doctor had come up and were already ambushed before the arrival of the treasure-hunters. \u201cAh,\u201d said Silver, \u201cit were fortunate for me that I had Hawkins here. You would have let old John be cut to bits, and never given it a thought, doctor.\u201d \u201cNot a thought,\u201d replied Dr. Livesey cheerily. And by this time we had reached the gigs. The doctor, with the pick-axe, demolished one of them, and then we all got aboard the other and set out to go round by sea for North Inlet. This was a run of eight or nine miles. Silver, though he was almost killed already with fatigue, was set to an oar, like the rest of us, and we were soon skimming swiftly over a smooth sea."], "What is Pew\u2019smost noticeable physical feature?": [" Almost at the same time a pistol-shot, flash and report, came from the hedge side. And that was plainly the last signal of danger, for the buccaneers turned at once and ran, separating in every direction, one seaward along the cove, one slant across the hill, and so on, so that in half a minute not a sign of them remained but Pew. Him they had deserted, whether in sheer panic or out of revenge for his ill words and blows I know not; but there he remained behind, tapping up and down the road in a frenzy, and groping and calling for his comrades. Finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few steps past me, towards the hamlet, crying, \u201cJohnny, Black Dog, Dirk,\u201d and other names, \u201cyou won't leave old Pew, mates--not old Pew!\u201d Just then the noise of horses topped the rise, and four or five riders came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope. At this Pew saw his error, turned with a scream, and ran straight for the ditch, into which he rolled.", " There wasn't one of you dared face Bill, and I did it--a blind man! And I'm to lose my chance for you! I'm to be a poor, crawling beggar, sponging for rum, when I might be rolling in a coach! If you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch them still.\u201d \u201cHang it, Pew, we've got the doubloons!\u201d grumbled one. \u201cThey might have hid the blessed thing,\u201d said another. \u201cTake the Georges, Pew, and don't stand here squalling.\u201d Squalling was the word for it; Pew's anger rose so high at these objections till at last, his passion completely taking the upper hand, he struck at them right and left in his blindness and his stick sounded heavily on more than one. These, in their turn, cursed back at the blind miscreant, threatened him in horrid terms, and tried in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from his grasp. This quarrel was the saving of us, for while it was still raging, another sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the hamlet--the tramp of horses galloping.", " There was a pause, then a cry of surprise, and then a voice shouting from the house, \u201cBill's dead.\u201d But the blind man swore at them again for their delay. \u201cSearch him, some of you shirking lubbers, and the rest of you aloft and get the chest,\u201d he cried. I could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs, so that the house must have shook with it. Promptly afterwards, fresh sounds of astonishment arose; the window of the captain's room was thrown open with a slam and a jingle of broken glass, and a man leaned out into the moonlight, head and shoulders, and addressed the blind beggar on the road below him. \u201cPew,\u201d he cried, \u201cthey've been before us. Someone's turned the chest out alow and aloft.\u201d \u201cIs it there?\u201d roared Pew. \u201cThe money's there.\u201d The blind man cursed the money. \u201cFlint's fist, I mean,\u201d he cried. \u201cWe don't see it here nohow,\u201d returned the man. \u201cHere, you below there, is it on Bill?\u201d cried the blind man again.", " At that another fellow, probably him who had remained below to search the captain's body, came to the door of the inn. \u201cBill's been overhauled a'ready,\u201d said he; \u201cnothin' left.\u201d \u201cIt's these people of the inn--it's that boy. I wish I had put his eyes out!\u201d cried the blind man, Pew. \u201cThere were no time ago--they had the door bolted when I tried it. Scatter, lads, and find 'em.\u201d \u201cSure enough, they left their glim here,\u201d said the fellow from the window. \u201cScatter and find 'em! Rout the house out!\u201d reiterated Pew, striking with his stick upon the road. Then there followed a great to-do through all our old inn, heavy feet pounding to and fro, furniture thrown over, doors kicked in, until the very rocks re-echoed and the men came out again, one after another, on the road and declared that we were nowhere to be found. And just the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead captain's money was once more clearly audible through the night, but this time twice repeated."], "To whom does Jimfirst show the map?": [" \u201cVery good,\u201d said the captain. \u201cThen, as you've heard me very patiently, saying things that I could not prove, hear me a few words more. They are putting the powder and the arms in the fore hold. Now, you have a good place under the cabin; why not put them there?--first point. Then, you are bringing four of your own people with you, and they tell me some of them are to be berthed forward. Why not give them the berths here beside the cabin?--second point.\u201d \u201cAny more?\u201d asked Mr. Trelawney. \u201cOne more,\u201d said the captain. \u201cThere's been too much blabbing already.\u201d \u201cFar too much,\u201d agreed the doctor. \u201cI'll tell you what I've heard myself,\u201d continued Captain Smollett: \u201cthat you have a map of an island, that there's crosses on the map to show where treasure is, and that the island lies--\u201d And then he named the latitude and longitude exactly. \u201cI never told that,\u201d cried the squire, \u201cto a soul!\u201d \u201cThe hands know it, sir,\u201d returned the captain.", " \u201cWell now, if you want to know, I'll tell you when. The last moment I can manage, and that's when. Here's a first-rate seaman, Cap'n Smollett, sails the blessed ship for us. Here's this squire and doctor with a map and such--I don't know where it is, do I? No more do you, says you. Well then, I mean this squire and doctor shall find the stuff, and help us to get it aboard, by the powers. Then we'll see. If I was sure of you all, sons of double Dutchmen, I'd have Cap'n Smollett navigate us half-way back again before I struck.\u201d \u201cWhy, we're all seamen aboard here, I should think,\u201d said the lad Dick. \u201cWe're all forecastle hands, you mean,\u201d snapped Silver. \u201cWe can steer a course, but who's to set one? That's what all you gentlemen split on, first and last. If I had my way, I'd have Cap'n Smollett work us back into the trades at least; then we'd have no blessed miscalculations and a spoonful of water a day.", " \u201cLivesey, that must have been you or Hawkins,\u201d cried the squire. \u201cIt doesn't much matter who it was,\u201d replied the doctor. And I could see that neither he nor the captain paid much regard to Mr. Trelawney's protestations. Neither did I, to be sure, he was so loose a talker; yet in this case I believe he was really right and that nobody had told the situation of the island. \u201cWell, gentlemen,\u201d continued the captain, \u201cI don't know who has this map; but I make it a point, it shall be kept secret even from me and Mr. Arrow. Otherwise I would ask you to let me resign.\u201d \u201cI see,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cYou wish us to keep this matter dark and to make a garrison of the stern part of the ship, manned with my friend's own people, and provided with all the arms and powder on board. In other words, you fear a mutiny.\u201d \u201cSir,\u201d said Captain Smollett, \u201cwith no intention to take offence, I deny your right to put words into my mouth.", " This was not the map we found in Billy Bones's chest, but an accurate copy, complete in all things--names and heights and soundings--with the single exception of the red crosses and the written notes. Sharp as must have been his annoyance, Silver had the strength of mind to hide it. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d said he, \u201cthis is the spot, to be sure, and very prettily drawed out. Who might have done that, I wonder? The pirates were too ignorant, I reckon. Aye, here it is: 'Capt. Kidd's Anchorage'--just the name my shipmate called it. There's a strong current runs along the south, and then away nor'ard up the west coast. Right you was, sir,\u201d says he, \u201cto haul your wind and keep the weather of the island. Leastways, if such was your intention as to enter and careen, and there ain't no better place for that in these waters.\u201d \u201cThank you, my man,\u201d says Captain Smollett. \u201cI'll ask you later on to give us a help."], "What is Long JohnSilver\u2019s original job on the ship?": [" The boatswain, Job Anderson, was the likeliest man aboard, and though he kept his old title, he served in a way as mate. Mr. Trelawney had followed the sea, and his knowledge made him very useful, for he often took a watch himself in easy weather. And the coxswain, Israel Hands, was a careful, wily, old, experienced seaman who could be trusted at a pinch with almost anything. He was a great confidant of Long John Silver, and so the mention of his name leads me on to speak of our ship's cook, Barbecue, as the men called him. Aboard ship he carried his crutch by a lanyard round his neck, to have both hands as free as possible. It was something to see him wedge the foot of the crutch against a bulkhead, and propped against it, yielding to every movement of the ship, get on with his cooking like someone safe ashore. Still more strange was it to see him in the heaviest of weather cross the deck.", " I ain't partic'lar as a rule, and I don't take no blame for settling his hash, but I don't reckon him ornamental now, do you?\u201d \u201cI'm not strong enough, and I don't like the job; and there he lies, for me,\u201d said I. \u201cThis here's an unlucky ship, this HISPANIOLA, Jim,\u201d he went on, blinking. \u201cThere's a power of men been killed in this HISPANIOLA--a sight o' poor seamen dead and gone since you and me took ship to Bristol. I never seen sich dirty luck, not I. There was this here O'Brien now--he's dead, ain't he? Well now, I'm no scholar, and you're a lad as can read and figure, and to put it straight, do you take it as a dead man is dead for good, or do he come alive again?\u201d \u201cYou can kill the body, Mr. Hands, but not the spirit; you must know that already,\u201d I replied. \u201cO'Brien there is in another world, and may be watching us.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d says he. \u201cWell, that's unfort'nate--appears as if killing parties was a waste of time.", " Well now, I tell you, I'm not a boasting man, and you seen yourself how easy I keep company, but when I was quartermaster, LAMBS wasn't the word for Flint's old buccaneers. Ah, you may be sure of yourself in old John's ship.\u201d \u201cWell, I tell you now,\u201d replied the lad, \u201cI didn't half a quarter like the job till I had this talk with you, John; but there's my hand on it now.\u201d \u201cAnd a brave lad you were, and smart too,\u201d answered Silver, shaking hands so heartily that all the barrel shook, \u201cand a finer figurehead for a gentleman of fortune I never clapped my eyes on.\u201d By this time I had begun to understand the meaning of their terms. By a \u201cgentleman of fortune\u201d they plainly meant neither more nor less than a common pirate, and the little scene that I had overheard was the last act in the corruption of one of the honest hands--perhaps of the last one left aboard. But on this point I was soon to be relieved, for Silver giving a little whistle, a third man strolled up and sat down by the party.", " At the same time, observing Gray to be unarmed, I handed him my cutlass. It did all our hearts good to see him spit in his hand, knit his brows, and make the blade sing through the air. It was plain from every line of his body that our new hand was worth his salt. Forty paces farther we came to the edge of the wood and saw the stockade in front of us. We struck the enclosure about the middle of the south side, and almost at the same time, seven mutineers--Job Anderson, the boatswain, at their head--appeared in full cry at the southwestern corner. They paused as if taken aback, and before they recovered, not only the squire and I, but Hunter and Joyce from the block house, had time to fire. The four shots came in rather a scattering volley, but they did the business: one of the enemy actually fell, and the rest, without hesitation, turned and plunged into the trees. After reloading, we walked down the outside of the palisade to see to the fallen enemy."], "Where is Jim whenhe overhears Silver\u2019s plans for mutiny?": [" There's only one man I'm afraid of.\u201d \u201cAnd who's that?\u201d cried the squire. \u201cName the dog, sir!\u201d \u201cYou,\u201d replied the doctor; \u201cfor you cannot hold your tongue. We are not the only men who know of this paper. These fellows who attacked the inn tonight--bold, desperate blades, for sure--and the rest who stayed aboard that lugger, and more, I dare say, not far off, are, one and all, through thick and thin, bound that they'll get that money. We must none of us go alone till we get to sea. Jim and I shall stick together in the meanwhile; you'll take Joyce and Hunter when you ride to Bristol, and from first to last, not one of us must breathe a word of what we've found.\u201d \u201cLivesey,\u201d returned the squire, \u201cyou are always in the right of it. I'll be as silent as the grave.\u201d PART TWO--The Sea-cook 7 I Go to Bristol IT was longer than the squire imagined ere we were ready for the sea, and none of our first plans--not even Dr. Livesey's, of keeping me beside him--could be carried out as we intended.", " \u201cSo, Jim,\u201d said the doctor sadly, \u201chere you are. As you have brewed, so shall you drink, my boy. Heaven knows, I cannot find it in my heart to blame you, but this much I will say, be it kind or unkind: when Captain Smollett was well, you dared not have gone off; and when he was ill and couldn't help it, by George, it was downright cowardly!\u201d I will own that I here began to weep. \u201cDoctor,\u201d I said, \u201cyou might spare me. I have blamed myself enough; my life's forfeit anyway, and I should have been dead by now if Silver hadn't stood for me; and doctor, believe this, I can die--and I dare say I deserve it--but what I fear is torture. If they come to torture me--\u201d \u201cJim,\u201d the doctor interrupted, and his voice was quite changed, \u201cJim, I can't have this. Whip over, and we'll run for it.\u201d \u201cDoctor,\u201d said I, \u201cI passed my word.\u201d \u201cI know, I know,\u201d he cried. \u201cWe can't help that, Jim, now. I'll take it on my shoulders, holus bolus, blame and shame, my boy; but stay here, I cannot let you.", " But I'll go as far with you as I dare go, and a step beyond, for I'll have my wig sorted by the captain or I'm mistaken! And first, I'll give you a bit of hope; Silver, if we both get alive out of this wolf-trap, I'll do my best to save you, short of perjury.\u201d Silver's face was radiant. \u201cYou couldn't say more, I'm sure, sir, not if you was my mother,\u201d he cried. \u201cWell, that's my first concession,\u201d added the doctor. \u201cMy second is a piece of advice: keep the boy close beside you, and when you need help, halloo. I'm off to seek it for you, and that itself will show you if I speak at random. Good-bye, Jim.\u201d And Dr. Livesey shook hands with me through the stockade, nodded to Silver, and set off at a brisk pace into the wood. 31 The Treasure-hunt--Flint's Pointer \u201cJIM,\u201d said Silver when we were alone, \u201cif I saved your life, you saved mine; and I'll not forget it.

It's your own doing. You're either my ship's cook--and then you were treated handsome--or Cap'n Silver, a common mutineer and pirate, and then you can go hang!\u201d \u201cWell, well, cap'n,\u201d returned the sea-cook, sitting down as he was bidden on the sand, \u201cyou'll have to give me a hand up again, that's all. A sweet pretty place you have of it here. Ah, there's Jim! The top of the morning to you, Jim. Doctor, here's my service. Why, there you all are together like a happy family, in a manner of speaking.\u201d \u201cIf you have anything to say, my man, better say it,\u201d said the captain. \u201cRight you were, Cap'n Smollett,\u201d replied Silver."], "Where does Jimencounter Ben Gunn?": [" \u201cYou came in in about the nick, I guess, for me and Hawkins.

Pretty well, I thank ye, says you.\u201d \u201cBen, Ben,\u201d murmured Silver, \u201cto think as you've done me!\u201d The doctor sent back Gray for one of the pick-axes deserted, in their flight, by the mutineers, and then as we proceeded leisurely downhill to where the boats were lying, related in a few words what had taken place. It was a story that profoundly interested Silver; and Ben Gunn, the half-idiot maroon, was the hero from beginning to end. Ben, in his long, lonely wanderings about the island, had found the skeleton--it was he that had rifled it; he had found the treasure; he had dug it up (it was the haft of his pick-axe that lay broken in the excavation); he had carried it on his back, in many weary journeys, from the foot of the tall pine to a cave he had on the two-pointed hill at the north-east angle of the island, and there it had lain stored in safety since two months before the arrival of the HISPANIOLA.", " That ain't in natur', surely?\u201d This argument seemed weak enough to me. But you can never tell what will affect the superstitious, and to my wonder, George Merry was greatly relieved. \u201cWell, that's so,\u201d he said. \u201cYou've a head upon your shoulders, John, and no mistake. 'Bout ship, mates! This here crew is on a wrong tack, I do believe. And come to think on it, it was like Flint's voice, I grant you, but not just so clear-away like it, after all. It was liker somebody else's voice now--it was liker--\u201d \u201cBy the powers, Ben Gunn!\u201d roared Silver. \u201cAye, and so it were,\u201d cried Morgan, springing on his knees. \u201cBen Gunn it were!\u201d \u201cIt don't make much odds, do it, now?\u201d asked Dick. \u201cBen Gunn's not here in the body any more'n Flint.\u201d But the older hands greeted this remark with scorn. \u201cWhy, nobody minds Ben Gunn,\u201d cried Merry; \u201cdead or alive, nobody minds him.\u201d It was extraordinary how their spirits had returned and how the natural colour had revived in their faces.", " \u201cSilver?\u201d I asked. \u201cAh, Silver!\u201d says he. \u201cThat were his name.\u201d \u201cHe's the cook, and the ringleader too.\u201d He was still holding me by the wrist, and at that he give it quite a wring. \u201cIf you was sent by Long John,\u201d he said, \u201cI'm as good as pork, and I know it. But where was you, do you suppose?\u201d I had made my mind up in a moment, and by way of answer told him the whole story of our voyage and the predicament in which we found ourselves. He heard me with the keenest interest, and when I had done he patted me on the head. \u201cYou're a good lad, Jim,\u201d he said; \u201cand you're all in a clove hitch, ain't you? Well, you just put your trust in Ben Gunn--Ben Gunn's the man to do it. Would you think it likely, now, that your squire would prove a liberal-minded one in case of help--him being in a clove hitch, as you remark?\u201d I told him the squire was the most liberal of men. \u201cAye, but you see,\u201d returned Ben Gunn, \u201cI didn't mean giving me a gate to keep, and a suit of livery clothes, and such; that's not my mark, Jim.", " Ah, he was the man to have a headpiece, was Flint! Barring rum, his match were never seen. He were afraid of none, not he; on'y Silver--Silver was that genteel.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said I, \u201cthat may be so, and so be it; all the more reason that I should hurry on and join my friends.\u201d \u201cNay, mate,\u201d returned Ben, \u201cnot you. You're a good boy, or I'm mistook; but you're on'y a boy, all told. Now, Ben Gunn is fly. Rum wouldn't bring me there, where you're going--not rum wouldn't, till I see your born gen'leman and gets it on his word of honour. And you won't forget my words; 'A precious sight (that's what you'll say), a precious sight more confidence'--and then nips him.\u201d And he pinched me the third time with the same air of cleverness. \u201cAnd when Ben Gunn is wanted, you know where to find him, Jim. Just wheer you found him today. And him that comes is to have a white thing in his hand, and he's to come alone."], "What does Jimhunt for after leaving Captain Smollett in the stockade?": [" All I ask is your word, Cap'n Smollett, to let me safe and sound out of this here stockade, and one minute to get out o' shot before a gun is fired.\u201d \u201cMy man,\u201d said Captain Smollett, \u201cI have not the slightest desire to talk to you. If you wish to talk to me, you can come, that's all. If there's any treachery, it'll be on your side, and the Lord help you.\u201d \u201cThat's enough, cap'n,\u201d shouted Long John cheerily. \u201cA word from you's enough. I know a gentleman, and you may lay to that.\u201d We could see the man who carried the flag of truce attempting to hold Silver back. Nor was that wonderful, seeing how cavalier had been the captain's answer. But Silver laughed at him aloud and slapped him on the back as if the idea of alarm had been absurd. Then he advanced to the stockade, threw over his crutch, got a leg up, and with great vigour and skill succeeded in surmounting the fence and dropping safely to the other side.", " The rest of the arms and powder we dropped overboard in two fathoms and a half of water, so that we could see the bright steel shining far below us in the sun, on the clean, sandy bottom. By this time the tide was beginning to ebb, and the ship was swinging round to her anchor. Voices were heard faintly halloaing in the direction of the two gigs; and though this reassured us for Joyce and Hunter, who were well to the eastward, it warned our party to be off. Redruth retreated from his place in the gallery and dropped into the boat, which we then brought round to the ship's counter, to be handier for Captain Smollett. \u201cNow, men,\u201d said he, \u201cdo you hear me?\u201d There was no answer from the forecastle. \u201cIt's to you, Abraham Gray--it's to you I am speaking.\u201d Still no reply. \u201cGray,\u201d resumed Mr. Smollett, a little louder, \u201cI am leaving this ship, and I order you to follow your captain. I know you are a good man at bottom, and I dare say not one of the lot of you's as bad as he makes out.", " Not a bough waved, not the gleam of a musket-barrel betrayed the presence of our foes. \u201cDid you hit your man?\u201d asked the captain. \u201cNo, sir,\u201d replied Joyce. \u201cI believe not, sir.\u201d \u201cNext best thing to tell the truth,\u201d muttered Captain Smollett. \u201cLoad his gun, Hawkins. How many should say there were on your side, doctor?\u201d \u201cI know precisely,\u201d said Dr. Livesey. \u201cThree shots were fired on this side. I saw the three flashes--two close together--one farther to the west.\u201d \u201cThree!\u201d repeated the captain. \u201cAnd how many on yours, Mr. Trelawney?\u201d But this was not so easily answered. There had come many from the north--seven by the squire's computation, eight or nine according to Gray. From the east and west only a single shot had been fired. It was plain, therefore, that the attack would be developed from the north and that on the other three sides we were only to be annoyed by a show of hostilities. But Captain Smollett made no change in his arrangements.", " When the doctor had wormed this secret from him on the afternoon of the attack, and when next morning he saw the anchorage deserted, he had gone to Silver, given him the chart, which was now useless--given him the stores, for Ben Gunn's cave was well supplied with goats' meat salted by himself--given anything and everything to get a chance of moving in safety from the stockade to the two-pointed hill, there to be clear of malaria and keep a guard upon the money. \u201cAs for you, Jim,\u201d he said, \u201cit went against my heart, but I did what I thought best for those who had stood by their duty; and if you were not one of these, whose fault was it?\u201d That morning, finding that I was to be involved in the horrid disappointment he had prepared for the mutineers, he had run all the way to the cave, and leaving the squire to guard the captain, had taken Gray and the maroon and started, making the diagonal across the island to be at hand beside the pine."], "How does Jimmove the ship away from the pirate camp?": [" \u201cYou had better sit down.\u201d \u201cYou ain't a-going to let me inside, cap'n?\u201d complained Long John. \u201cIt's a main cold morning, to be sure, sir, to sit outside upon the sand.\u201d \u201cWhy, Silver,\u201d said the captain, \u201cif you had pleased to be an honest man, you might have been sitting in your galley.

But on this point I was soon to be relieved, for Silver giving a little whistle, a third man strolled up and sat down by the party.", " It was such a scene of confusion as you can hardly fancy. All the lockfast places had been broken open in quest of the chart. The floor was thick with mud where ruffians had sat down to drink or consult after wading in the marshes round their camp. The bulkheads, all painted in clear white and beaded round with gilt, bore a pattern of dirty hands. Dozens of empty bottles clinked together in corners to the rolling of the ship. One of the doctor's medical books lay open on the table, half of the leaves gutted out, I suppose, for pipelights. In the midst of all this the lamp still cast a smoky glow, obscure and brown as umber. I went into the cellar; all the barrels were gone, and of the bottles a most surprising number had been drunk out and thrown away. Certainly, since the mutiny began, not a man of them could ever have been sober. Foraging about, I found a bottle with some brandy left, for Hands; and for myself I routed out some biscuit, some pickled fruits, a great bunch of raisins, and a piece of cheese.", " Once we got the ship and treasure both and off to sea like jolly companions, why then we'll talk Mr. Hawkins over, we will, and we'll give him his share, to be sure, for all his kindness.\u201d It was no wonder the men were in a good humour now. For my part, I was horribly cast down. Should the scheme he had now sketched prove feasible, Silver, already doubly a traitor, would not hesitate to adopt it. He had still a foot in either camp, and there was no doubt he would prefer wealth and freedom with the pirates to a bare escape from hanging, which was the best he had to hope on our side. Nay, and even if things so fell out that he was forced to keep his faith with Dr. Livesey, even then what danger lay before us! What a moment that would be when the suspicions of his followers turned to certainty and he and I should have to fight for dear life--he a cripple and I a boy--against five strong and active seamen!"], "What is the nameof Long John Silver\u2019s parrot?": [" You don't, you say, like this cruise. Now, why?\u201d \u201cI was engaged, sir, on what we call sealed orders, to sail this ship for that gentleman where he should bid me,\u201d said the captain. \u201cSo far so good. But now I find that every man before the mast knows more than I do. I don't call that fair, now, do you?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Dr. Livesey, \u201cI don't.\u201d \u201cNext,\u201d said the captain, \u201cI learn we are going after treasure--hear it from my own hands, mind you. Now, treasure is ticklish work; I don't like treasure voyages on any account, and I don't like them, above all, when they are secret and when (begging your pardon, Mr. Trelawney) the secret has been told to the parrot.\u201d \u201cSilver's parrot?\u201d asked the squire. \u201cIt's a way of speaking,\u201d said the captain. \u201cBlabbed, I mean.

Yet some of the men who had sailed with him before expressed their pity to see him so reduced. \u201cHe's no common man, Barbecue,\u201d said the coxswain to me. \u201cHe had good schooling in his young days and can speak like a book when so minded; and brave--a lion's nothing alongside of Long John! I seen him grapple four and knock their heads together--him unarmed.\u201d All the crew respected and even obeyed him. He had a way of talking to each and doing everybody some particular service. To me he was unweariedly kind, and always glad to see me in the galley, which he kept as clean as a new pin, the dishes hanging up burnished and his parrot in a cage in one corner.", " \u201cCome away, Hawkins,\u201d he would say; \u201ccome and have a yarn with John. Nobody more welcome than yourself, my son. Sit you down and hear the news. Here's Cap'n Flint--I calls my parrot Cap'n Flint, after the famous buccaneer--here's Cap'n Flint predicting success to our v'yage. Wasn't you, cap'n?\u201d And the parrot would say, with great rapidity, \u201cPieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!\u201d till you wondered that it was not out of breath, or till John threw his handkerchief over the cage. \u201cNow, that bird,\u201d he would say, \u201cis, maybe, two hundred years old, Hawkins--they live forever mostly; and if anybody's seen more wickedness, it must be the devil himself. She's sailed with England, the great Cap'n England, the pirate. She's been at Madagascar, and at Malabar, and Surinam, and Providence, and Portobello. She was at the fishing up of the wrecked plate ships. It's there she learned 'Pieces of eight,' and little wonder; three hundred and fifty thousand of 'em, Hawkins!", " And then, all of a sudden, a shrill voice broke forth out of the darkness: \u201cPieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!\u201d and so forth, without pause or change, like the clacking of a tiny mill. Silver's green parrot, Captain Flint! It was she whom I had heard pecking at a piece of bark; it was she, keeping better watch than any human being, who thus announced my arrival with her wearisome refrain. I had no time left me to recover. At the sharp, clipping tone of the parrot, the sleepers awoke and sprang up; and with a mighty oath, the voice of Silver cried, \u201cWho goes?\u201d I turned to run, struck violently against one person, recoiled, and ran full into the arms of a second, who for his part closed upon and held me tight. \u201cBring a torch, Dick,\u201d said Silver when my capture was thus assured. And one of the men left the log-house and presently returned with a lighted brand."], "Who is the firstto discover Flint\u2019s treasure on the island?": [" But, there he was, you mind, and the six all dead--dead and buried. How he done it, not a man aboard us could make out. It was battle, murder, and sudden death, leastways--him against six. Billy Bones was the mate; Long John, he was quartermaster; and they asked him where the treasure was. 'Ah,' says he, 'you can go ashore, if you like, and stay,' he says; 'but as for the ship, she'll beat up for more, by thunder!' That's what he said. \u201cWell, I was in another ship three years back, and we sighted this island. 'Boys,' said I, 'here's Flint's treasure; let's land and find it.' The cap'n was displeased at that, but my messmates were all of a mind and landed. Twelve days they looked for it, and every day they had the worse word for me, until one fine morning all hands went aboard. 'As for you, Benjamin Gunn,' says they, 'here's a musket,' they says, 'and a spade, and pick-axe. You can stay here and find Flint's money for yourself,' they says.", " So it was with the CASSANDRA, as brought us all safe home from Malabar, after England took the viceroy of the Indies; so it was with the old WALRUS, Flint's old ship, as I've seen amuck with the red blood and fit to sink with gold.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d cried another voice, that of the youngest hand on board, and evidently full of admiration. \u201cHe was the flower of the flock, was Flint!\u201d \u201cDavis was a man too, by all accounts,\u201d said Silver. \u201cI never sailed along of him; first with England, then with Flint, that's my story; and now here on my own account, in a manner of speaking. I laid by nine hundred safe, from England, and two thousand after Flint. That ain't bad for a man before the mast--all safe in bank. 'Tain't earning now, it's saving does it, you may lay to that.

Ah, Jim, you'll bless your stars, you will, you was the first that found me!\u201d And at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face, and he tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly before my eyes. \u201cNow, Jim, you tell me true: that ain't Flint's ship?\u201d he asked. At this I had a happy inspiration. I began to believe that I had found an ally, and I answered him at once. \u201cIt's not Flint's ship, and Flint is dead; but I'll tell you true, as you ask me--there are some of Flint's hands aboard; worse luck for the rest of us.\u201d \u201cNot a man--with one--leg?\u201d he gasped."], "How does BenGunn frighten the pirates?": [" \u201cDon't he?\u201d replied the doctor. \u201cWell, step up here, Dick, and let me see your tongue. No, I should be surprised if he did! The man's tongue is fit to frighten the French. Another fever.\u201d \u201cAh, there,\u201d said Morgan, \u201cthat comed of sp'iling Bibles.\u201d \u201cThat comes--as you call it--of being arrant asses,\u201d retorted the doctor, \u201cand not having sense enough to know honest air from poison, and the dry land from a vile, pestiferous slough. I think it most probable--though of course it's only an opinion--that you'll all have the deuce to pay before you get that malaria out of your systems. Camp in a bog, would you? Silver, I'm surprised at you. You're less of a fool than many, take you all round; but you don't appear to me to have the rudiments of a notion of the rules of health. \u201cWell,\u201d he added after he had dosed them round and they had taken his prescriptions, with really laughable humility, more like charity schoolchildren than blood-guilty mutineers and pirates--\u201cwell, that's done for today.", " The more we told of our troubles, the more--man, woman, and child--they clung to the shelter of their houses. The name of Captain Flint, though it was strange to me, was well enough known to some there and carried a great weight of terror. Some of the men who had been to field-work on the far side of the Admiral Benbow remembered, besides, to have seen several strangers on the road, and taking them to be smugglers, to have bolted away; and one at least had seen a little lugger in what we called Kitt's Hole. For that matter, anyone who was a comrade of the captain's was enough to frighten them to death. And the short and the long of the matter was, that while we could get several who were willing enough to ride to Dr. Livesey's, which lay in another direction, not one would help us to defend the inn. They say cowardice is infectious; but then argument is, on the other hand, a great emboldener; and so when each had said his say, my mother made them a speech.", " Once we got the ship and treasure both and off to sea like jolly companions, why then we'll talk Mr. Hawkins over, we will, and we'll give him his share, to be sure, for all his kindness.\u201d It was no wonder the men were in a good humour now. For my part, I was horribly cast down. Should the scheme he had now sketched prove feasible, Silver, already doubly a traitor, would not hesitate to adopt it. He had still a foot in either camp, and there was no doubt he would prefer wealth and freedom with the pirates to a bare escape from hanging, which was the best he had to hope on our side. Nay, and even if things so fell out that he was forced to keep his faith with Dr. Livesey, even then what danger lay before us! What a moment that would be when the suspicions of his followers turned to certainty and he and I should have to fight for dear life--he a cripple and I a boy--against five strong and active seamen!", " \u201cYou would lose your precious life, and you may lay to that. I'm on your side now, hand and glove; and I shouldn't wish for to see the party weakened, let alone yourself, seeing as I know what I owes you. But these men down there, they couldn't keep their word--no, not supposing they wished to; and what's more, they couldn't believe as you could.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cYou're the man to keep your word, we know that.\u201d Well, that was about the last news we had of the three pirates. Only once we heard a gunshot a great way off and supposed them to be hunting. A council was held, and it was decided that we must desert them on the island--to the huge glee, I must say, of Ben Gunn, and with the strong approval of Gray. We left a good stock of powder and shot, the bulk of the salt goat, a few medicines, and some other necessaries, tools, clothing, a spare sail, a fathom or two of rope, and by the particular desire of the doctor, a handsome present of tobacco."], "Who interruptsJim\u2019s narration to tell the story for a while?": [" \u201cAnd that,\u201d said he, \u201cis just about as good as nothing. They've got off clean, and there's an end. Only,\u201d he added, \u201cI'm glad I trod on Master Pew's corns,\u201d for by this time he had heard my story. I went back with him to the Admiral Benbow, and you cannot imagine a house in such a state of smash; the very clock had been thrown down by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself; and though nothing had actually been taken away except the captain's money-bag and a little silver from the till, I could see at once that we were ruined. Mr. Dance could make nothing of the scene. \u201cThey got the money, you say? Well, then, Hawkins, what in fortune were they after? More money, I suppose?\u201d \u201cNo, sir; not money, I think,\u201d replied I. \u201cIn fact, sir, I believe I have the thing in my breast pocket; and to tell you the truth, I should like to get it put in safety.\u201d \u201cTo be sure, boy; quite right,\u201d said he.", " \u201cThat's a summons, mate. I'll tell you if they get that. But you keep your weather-eye open, Jim, and I'll share with you equals, upon my honour.\u201d He wandered a little longer, his voice growing weaker; but soon after I had given him his medicine, which he took like a child, with the remark, \u201cIf ever a seaman wanted drugs, it's me,\u201d he fell at last into a heavy, swoon-like sleep, in which I left him. What I should have done had all gone well I do not know. Probably I should have told the whole story to the doctor, for I was in mortal fear lest the captain should repent of his confessions and make an end of me. But as things fell out, my poor father died quite suddenly that evening, which put all other matters on one side. Our natural distress, the visits of the neighbours, the arranging of the funeral, and all the work of the inn to be carried on in the meanwhile kept me so busy that I had scarcely time to think of the captain, far less to be afraid of him.", " And, Jim\u201d--looking all round him and lowering his voice to a whisper--\u201cI'm rich.\u201d I now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude, and I suppose I must have shown the feeling in my face, for he repeated the statement hotly: \u201cRich! Rich! I says. And I'll tell you what: I'll make a man of you, Jim. Ah, Jim, you'll bless your stars, you will, you was the first that found me!\u201d And at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face, and he tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly before my eyes. \u201cNow, Jim, you tell me true: that ain't Flint's ship?\u201d he asked. At this I had a happy inspiration. I began to believe that I had found an ally, and I answered him at once. \u201cIt's not Flint's ship, and Flint is dead; but I'll tell you true, as you ask me--there are some of Flint's hands aboard; worse luck for the rest of us.\u201d \u201cNot a man--with one--leg?\u201d he gasped.", " Captain Smollett, the squire, and Dr. Livesey were talking together on the quarter-deck, and anxious as I was to tell them my story, I durst not interrupt them openly. While I was still casting about in my thoughts to find some probable excuse, Dr. Livesey called me to his side. He had left his pipe below, and being a slave to tobacco, had meant that I should fetch it; but as soon as I was near enough to speak and not to be overheard, I broke immediately, \u201cDoctor, let me speak. Get the captain and squire down to the cabin, and then make some pretence to send for me. I have terrible news.\u201d The doctor changed countenance a little, but next moment he was master of himself. \u201cThank you, Jim,\u201d said he quite loudly, \u201cthat was all I wanted to know,\u201d as if he had asked me a question. And with that he turned on his heel and rejoined the other two. They spoke together for a little, and though none of them started, or raised his voice, or so much as whistled, it was plain enough that Dr. Livesey had communicated my request, for the next thing that I heard was the captain giving an order to Job Anderson, and all hands were piped on deck."], "Whom does Jimfight on the ship when he sneaks on board?": [" The honest hands--and I was soon to see it proved that there were such on board--must have been very stupid fellows. Or rather, I suppose the truth was this, that all hands were disaffected by the example of the ringleaders--only some more, some less; and a few, being good fellows in the main, could neither be led nor driven any further. It is one thing to be idle and skulk and quite another to take a ship and murder a number of innocent men. At last, however, the party was made up. Six fellows were to stay on board, and the remaining thirteen, including Silver, began to embark. Then it was that there came into my head the first of the mad notions that contributed so much to save our lives. If six men were left by Silver, it was plain our party could not take and fight the ship; and since only six were left, it was equally plain that the cabin party had no present need of my assistance. It occurred to me at once to go ashore.", " \u201cAnd now,\u201d added the doctor, \u201cJim may come on board with us, may he not?\u201d \u201cTo be sure he may,\u201d says squire. \u201cTake your hat, Hawkins, and we'll see the ship.\u201d 9 Powder and Arms THE HISPANIOLA lay some way out, and we went under the figureheads and round the sterns of many other ships, and their cables sometimes grated underneath our keel, and sometimes swung above us. At last, however, we got alongside, and were met and saluted as we stepped aboard by the mate, Mr. Arrow, a brown old sailor with earrings in his ears and a squint. He and the squire were very thick and friendly, but I soon observed that things were not the same between Mr. Trelawney and the captain. This last was a sharp-looking man who seemed angry with everything on board and was soon to tell us why, for we had hardly got down into the cabin when a sailor followed us. \u201cCaptain Smollett, sir, axing to speak with you,\u201d said he.", " The captain, on his part, never spoke but when he was spoken to, and then sharp and short and dry, and not a word wasted. He owned, when driven into a corner, that he seemed to have been wrong about the crew, that some of them were as brisk as he wanted to see and all had behaved fairly well. As for the ship, he had taken a downright fancy to her. \u201cShe'll lie a point nearer the wind than a man has a right to expect of his own married wife, sir. But,\u201d he would add, \u201call I say is, we're not home again, and I don't like the cruise.\u201d The squire, at this, would turn away and march up and down the deck, chin in air. \u201cA trifle more of that man,\u201d he would say, \u201cand I shall explode.\u201d We had some heavy weather, which only proved the qualities of the HISPANIOLA. Every man on board seemed well content, and they must have been hard to please if they had been otherwise, for it is my belief there was never a ship's company so spoiled since Noah put to sea.", " Ben Gunn was on deck alone, and as soon as we came on board he began, with wonderful contortions, to make us a confession. Silver was gone. The maroon had connived at his escape in a shore boat some hours ago, and he now assured us he had only done so to preserve our lives, which would certainly have been forfeit if \u201cthat man with the one leg had stayed aboard.\u201d But this was not all. The sea-cook had not gone empty-handed. He had cut through a bulkhead unobserved and had removed one of the sacks of coin, worth perhaps three or four hundred guineas, to help him on his further wanderings. I think we were all pleased to be so cheaply quit of him. Well, to make a long story short, we got a few hands on board, made a good cruise home, and the HISPANIOLA reached Bristol just as Mr. Blandly was beginning to think of fitting out her consort. Five men only of those who had sailed returned with her."], "When the treasurewas initially discovered, where was it taken immediately after itsexcavation?": [" \u201cFlag of truce!\u201d I heard someone say; and then, immediately after, with a cry of surprise, \u201cSilver himself!\u201d And at that, up I jumped, and rubbing my eyes, ran to a loophole in the wall. 20 Silver's Embassy SURE enough, there were two men just outside the stockade, one of them waving a white cloth, the other, no less a person than Silver himself, standing placidly by. It was still quite early, and the coldest morning that I think I ever was abroad in--a chill that pierced into the marrow. The sky was bright and cloudless overhead, and the tops of the trees shone rosily in the sun. But where Silver stood with his lieutenant, all was still in shadow, and they waded knee-deep in a low white vapour that had crawled during the night out of the morass. The chill and the vapour taken together told a poor tale of the island. It was plainly a damp, feverish, unhealthy spot. \u201cKeep indoors, men,\u201d said the captain.", " He had hobbled down there that morning, he said, to get a smell of the salt. I was monstrously touched--so would you have been--and, out of pure pity, I engaged him on the spot to be ship's cook. Long John Silver, he is called, and has lost a leg; but that I regarded as a recommendation, since he lost it in his country's service, under the immortal Hawke. He has no pension, Livesey. Imagine the abominable age we live in! Well, sir, I thought I had only found a cook, but it was a crew I had discovered. Between Silver and myself we got together in a few days a company of the toughest old salts imaginable--not pretty to look at, but fellows, by their faces, of the most indomitable spirit. I declare we could fight a frigate. Long John even got rid of two out of the six or seven I had already engaged. He showed me in a moment that they were just the sort of fresh-water swabs we had to fear in an adventure of importance.", " Even as I looked, there came another red flash and another report that sent the echoes clattering, and one more round-shot whistled through the air. It was the last of the cannonade. I lay for some time watching the bustle which succeeded the attack. Men were demolishing something with axes on the beach near the stockade--the poor jolly-boat, I afterwards discovered. Away, near the mouth of the river, a great fire was glowing among the trees, and between that point and the ship one of the gigs kept coming and going, the men, whom I had seen so gloomy, shouting at the oars like children. But there was a sound in their voices which suggested rum. At length I thought I might return towards the stockade. I was pretty far down on the low, sandy spit that encloses the anchorage to the east, and is joined at half-water to Skeleton Island; and now, as I rose to my feet, I saw, some distance further down the spit and rising from among low bushes, an isolated rock, pretty high, and peculiarly white in colour.", " When I came again to myself the monster had pulled himself together, his crutch under his arm, his hat upon his head. Just before him Tom lay motionless upon the sward; but the murderer minded him not a whit, cleansing his blood-stained knife the while upon a wisp of grass. Everything else was unchanged, the sun still shining mercilessly on the steaming marsh and the tall pinnacle of the mountain, and I could scarce persuade myself that murder had been actually done and a human life cruelly cut short a moment since before my eyes. But now John put his hand into his pocket, brought out a whistle, and blew upon it several modulated blasts that rang far across the heated air. I could not tell, of course, the meaning of the signal, but it instantly awoke my fears. More men would be coming. I might be discovered. They had already slain two of the honest people; after Tom and Alan, might not I come next?"], "Why does Silvervisit Smollett in the stockade?": [" All I ask is your word, Cap'n Smollett, to let me safe and sound out of this here stockade, and one minute to get out o' shot before a gun is fired.\u201d \u201cMy man,\u201d said Captain Smollett, \u201cI have not the slightest desire to talk to you. If you wish to talk to me, you can come, that's all. If there's any treachery, it'll be on your side, and the Lord help you.\u201d \u201cThat's enough, cap'n,\u201d shouted Long John cheerily. \u201cA word from you's enough. I know a gentleman, and you may lay to that.\u201d We could see the man who carried the flag of truce attempting to hold Silver back. Nor was that wonderful, seeing how cavalier had been the captain's answer. But Silver laughed at him aloud and slapped him on the back as if the idea of alarm had been absurd. Then he advanced to the stockade, threw over his crutch, got a leg up, and with great vigour and skill succeeded in surmounting the fence and dropping safely to the other side.", " \u201cWell now, if you want to know, I'll tell you when. The last moment I can manage, and that's when. Here's a first-rate seaman, Cap'n Smollett, sails the blessed ship for us. Here's this squire and doctor with a map and such--I don't know where it is, do I? No more do you, says you. Well then, I mean this squire and doctor shall find the stuff, and help us to get it aboard, by the powers. Then we'll see. If I was sure of you all, sons of double Dutchmen, I'd have Cap'n Smollett navigate us half-way back again before I struck.\u201d \u201cWhy, we're all seamen aboard here, I should think,\u201d said the lad Dick. \u201cWe're all forecastle hands, you mean,\u201d snapped Silver. \u201cWe can steer a course, but who's to set one? That's what all you gentlemen split on, first and last. If I had my way, I'd have Cap'n Smollett work us back into the trades at least; then we'd have no blessed miscalculations and a spoonful of water a day.", " Thomas Redruth, owner's servant, landsman, shot by the mutineers; James Hawkins, cabin-boy-- And at the same time, I was wondering over poor Jim Hawkins' fate.

No, that's your friends.

Well, then, you get on a horse, and go to--well, yes, I will!--to that eternal doctor swab, and tell him to pipe all hands--magistrates and sich--and he'll lay 'em aboard at the Admiral Benbow--all old Flint's crew, man and boy, all on 'em that's left. I was first mate, I was, old Flint's first mate, and I'm the on'y one as knows the place. He gave it me at Savannah, when he lay a-dying, like as if I was to now, you see.

Why, it was Anderson, and Hands, and you, George Merry!

No, not us; he might be our last chance, and I shouldn't wonder. Kill that boy? Not me, mates! And number three? Ah, well, there's a deal to say to number three. Maybe you don't count it nothing to have a real college doctor to see you every day--you, John, with your head broke--or you, George Merry, that had the ague shakes upon you not six hours agone, and has your eyes the colour of lemon peel to this same moment on the clock? And maybe, perhaps, you didn't know there was a consort coming either? But there is, and not so long till then; and we'll see who'll be glad to have a hostage when it comes to that.

But no, this here's too much. If you won't tell me what you mean plain out, just say so and I'll leave the helm.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said the doctor musingly; \u201cI've no right to say more; it's not my secret, you see, Silver, or, I give you my word, I'd tell it you."], "How does BillyBones die?": [" First he recognized the doctor with an unmistakable frown; then his glance fell upon me, and he looked relieved. But suddenly his colour changed, and he tried to raise himself, crying, \u201cWhere's Black Dog?\u201d \u201cThere is no Black Dog here,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cexcept what you have on your own back. You have been drinking rum; you have had a stroke, precisely as I told you; and I have just, very much against my own will, dragged you headforemost out of the grave. Now, Mr. Bones--\u201d \u201cThat's not my name,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cMuch I care,\u201d returned the doctor. \u201cIt's the name of a buccaneer of my acquaintance; and I call you by it for the sake of shortness, and what I have to say to you is this; one glass of rum won't kill you, but if you take one you'll take another and another, and I stake my wig if you don't break off short, you'll die--do you understand that?--die, and go to your own place, like the man in the Bible.", " He stood where he was, resting lightly on his crutch, watching his companion like a snake about to spring. \u201cJohn!\u201d said the sailor, stretching out his hand. \u201cHands off!\u201d cried Silver, leaping back a yard, as it seemed to me, with the speed and security of a trained gymnast. \u201cHands off, if you like, John Silver,\u201d said the other. \u201cIt's a black conscience that can make you feared of me. But in heaven's name, tell me, what was that?\u201d \u201cThat?\u201d returned Silver, smiling away, but warier than ever, his eye a mere pin-point in his big face, but gleaming like a crumb of glass. \u201cThat? Oh, I reckon that'll be Alan.\u201d And at this point Tom flashed out like a hero. \u201cAlan!\u201d he cried. \u201cThen rest his soul for a true seaman! And as for you, John Silver, long you've been a mate of mine, but you're mate of mine no more. If I die like a dog, I'll die in my dooty. You've killed Alan, have you? Kill me too, if you can.", " But they continued to call us by name and appeal to us, for God's sake, to be merciful and not leave them to die in such a place. At last, seeing the ship still bore on her course and was now swiftly drawing out of earshot, one of them--I know not which it was--leapt to his feet with a hoarse cry, whipped his musket to his shoulder, and sent a shot whistling over Silver's head and through the main-sail. After that, we kept under cover of the bulwarks, and when next I looked out they had disappeared from the spit, and the spit itself had almost melted out of sight in the growing distance. That was, at least, the end of that; and before noon, to my inexpressible joy, the highest rock of Treasure Island had sunk into the blue round of sea. We were so short of men that everyone on board had to bear a hand--only the captain lying on a mattress in the stern and giving his orders, for though greatly recovered he was still in want of quiet.", " As for them, they've tramped; I don't know where's they are.\u201d He drew again quietly at his pipe. \u201cAnd lest you should take it into that head of yours,\u201d he went on, \u201cthat you was included in the treaty, here's the last word that was said: 'How many are you,' says I, 'to leave?' 'Four,' says he; 'four, and one of us wounded. As for that boy, I don't know where he is, confound him,' says he, 'nor I don't much care. We're about sick of him.' These was his words. \u201cIs that all?\u201d I asked. \u201cWell, it's all that you're to hear, my son,\u201d returned Silver. \u201cAnd now I am to choose?\u201d \u201cAnd now you are to choose, and you may lay to that,\u201d said Silver. \u201cWell,\u201d said I, \u201cI am not such a fool but I know pretty well what I have to look for. Let the worst come to the worst, it's little I care. I've seen too many die since I fell in with you. But there's a thing or two I have to tell you,\u201d I said, and by this time I was quite excited; \u201cand the first is this: here you are, in a bad way--ship lost, treasure lost, men lost, your whole business gone to wreck; and if you want to know who did it--it was I!"], "What is the lastclue guiding the pirates to the treasure site?": [" *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TREASURE ISLAND *** Produced by Judy Boss, John Hamm and David Widger TREASURE ISLAND by Robert Louis Stevenson TREASURE ISLAND To S.L.O., an American gentleman in accordance with whose classic taste the following narrative has been designed, it is now, in return for numerous delightful hours, and with the kindest wishes, dedicated by his affectionate friend, the author.

And may I And all my pirates share the grave Where these and their creations lie!", " You don't, you say, like this cruise. Now, why?\u201d \u201cI was engaged, sir, on what we call sealed orders, to sail this ship for that gentleman where he should bid me,\u201d said the captain. \u201cSo far so good. But now I find that every man before the mast knows more than I do. I don't call that fair, now, do you?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Dr. Livesey, \u201cI don't.\u201d \u201cNext,\u201d said the captain, \u201cI learn we are going after treasure--hear it from my own hands, mind you. Now, treasure is ticklish work; I don't like treasure voyages on any account, and I don't like them, above all, when they are secret and when (begging your pardon, Mr. Trelawney) the secret has been told to the parrot.\u201d \u201cSilver's parrot?\u201d asked the squire. \u201cIt's a way of speaking,\u201d said the captain. \u201cBlabbed, I mean. It's my belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about, but I'll tell you my way of it--life or death, and a close run.\u201d \u201cThat is all clear, and, I dare say, true enough,\u201d replied Dr. Livesey.", " Once we got the ship and treasure both and off to sea like jolly companions, why then we'll talk Mr. Hawkins over, we will, and we'll give him his share, to be sure, for all his kindness.\u201d It was no wonder the men were in a good humour now. For my part, I was horribly cast down. Should the scheme he had now sketched prove feasible, Silver, already doubly a traitor, would not hesitate to adopt it. He had still a foot in either camp, and there was no doubt he would prefer wealth and freedom with the pirates to a bare escape from hanging, which was the best he had to hope on our side. Nay, and even if things so fell out that he was forced to keep his faith with Dr. Livesey, even then what danger lay before us! What a moment that would be when the suspicions of his followers turned to certainty and he and I should have to fight for dear life--he a cripple and I a boy--against five strong and active seamen!", " I had quite made up my mind that the mutineers, after their repulse of the morning, had nothing nearer their hearts than to up anchor and away to sea; this, I thought, it would be a fine thing to prevent, and now that I had seen how they left their watchmen unprovided with a boat, I thought it might be done with little risk. Down I sat to wait for darkness, and made a hearty meal of biscuit. It was a night out of ten thousand for my purpose. The fog had now buried all heaven. As the last rays of daylight dwindled and disappeared, absolute blackness settled down on Treasure Island. And when, at last, I shouldered the coracle and groped my way stumblingly out of the hollow where I had supped, there were but two points visible on the whole anchorage. One was the great fire on shore, by which the defeated pirates lay carousing in the swamp. The other, a mere blur of light upon the darkness, indicated the position of the anchored ship."], "What happensto Silver at the end of the novel?": [" Now, however, when I had nothing else to do, I began to pay more heed. One I recognized for the coxswain's, Israel Hands, that had been Flint's gunner in former days. The other was, of course, my friend of the red night-cap. Both men were plainly the worse of drink, and they were still drinking, for even while I was listening, one of them, with a drunken cry, opened the stern window and threw out something, which I divined to be an empty bottle. But they were not only tipsy; it was plain that they were furiously angry. Oaths flew like hailstones, and every now and then there came forth such an explosion as I thought was sure to end in blows. But each time the quarrel passed off and the voices grumbled lower for a while, until the next crisis came and in its turn passed away without result. On shore, I could see the glow of the great camp-fire burning warmly through the shore-side trees. Someone was singing, a dull, old, droning sailor's song, with a droop and a quaver at the end of every verse, and seemingly no end to it at all but the patience of the singer.", " Oh, by Jupiter, and talking of Ben Gunn! Why, this is the mischief in person. Silver!\u201d he cried. \u201cSilver!

Maybe you thought you was cap'n here, perhaps. By the powers, but I'll teach you better! Cross me, and you'll go where many a good man's gone before you, first and last, these thirty year back--some to the yard-arm, shiver my timbers, and some by the board, and all to feed the fishes. There's never a man looked me between the eyes and seen a good day a'terwards, Tom Morgan, you may lay to that.\u201d Morgan paused, but a hoarse murmur rose from the others. \u201cTom's right,\u201d said one. \u201cI stood hazing long enough from one,\u201d added another. \u201cI'll be hanged if I'll be hazed by you, John Silver.\u201d \u201cDid any of you gentlemen want to have it out with ME?\u201d roared Silver, bending far forward from his position on the keg, with his pipe still glowing in his right hand. \u201cPut a name on what you're at; you ain't dumb, I reckon. Him that wants shall get it. Have I lived this many years, and a son of a rum puncheon cock his hat athwart my hawse at the latter end of it?", " I had heard it on the voyage more than once and remembered these words: \u201cBut one man of her crew alive, What put to sea with seventy-five.\u201d And I thought it was a ditty rather too dolefully appropriate for a company that had met such cruel losses in the morning. But, indeed, from what I saw, all these buccaneers were as callous as the sea they sailed on. At last the breeze came; the schooner sidled and drew nearer in the dark; I felt the hawser slacken once more, and with a good, tough effort, cut the last fibres through. The breeze had but little action on the coracle, and I was almost instantly swept against the bows of the HISPANIOLA. At the same time, the schooner began to turn upon her heel, spinning slowly, end for end, across the current. I wrought like a fiend, for I expected every moment to be swamped; and since I found I could not push the coracle directly off, I now shoved straight astern."], "What flag doesSmollett fly over the stockade?": [" Thomas Redruth, owner's servant, landsman, shot by the mutineers; James Hawkins, cabin-boy-- And at the same time, I was wondering over poor Jim Hawkins' fate. A hail on the land side. \u201cSomebody hailing us,\u201d said Hunter, who was on guard. \u201cDoctor! Squire! Captain! Hullo, Hunter, is that you?\u201d came the cries. And I ran to the door in time to see Jim Hawkins, safe and sound, come climbing over the stockade. 19 Narrative Resumed by Jim Hawkins: The Garrison in the Stockade AS soon as Ben Gunn saw the colours he came to a halt, stopped me by the arm, and sat down. \u201cNow,\u201d said he, \u201cthere's your friends, sure enough.\u201d \u201cFar more likely it's the mutineers,\u201d I answered. \u201cThat!\u201d he cried. \u201cWhy, in a place like this, where nobody puts in but gen'lemen of fortune, Silver would fly the Jolly Roger, you don't make no doubt of that. No, that's your friends. There's been blows too, and I reckon your friends has had the best of it; and here they are ashore in the old stockade, as was made years and years ago by Flint.", " All I ask is your word, Cap'n Smollett, to let me safe and sound out of this here stockade, and one minute to get out o' shot before a gun is fired.\u201d \u201cMy man,\u201d said Captain Smollett, \u201cI have not the slightest desire to talk to you. If you wish to talk to me, you can come, that's all. If there's any treachery, it'll be on your side, and the Lord help you.\u201d \u201cThat's enough, cap'n,\u201d shouted Long John cheerily. \u201cA word from you's enough. I know a gentleman, and you may lay to that.\u201d We could see the man who carried the flag of truce attempting to hold Silver back. Nor was that wonderful, seeing how cavalier had been the captain's answer. But Silver laughed at him aloud and slapped him on the back as if the idea of alarm had been absurd. Then he advanced to the stockade, threw over his crutch, got a leg up, and with great vigour and skill succeeded in surmounting the fence and dropping safely to the other side.", " \u201cTen to one this is a trick.\u201d Then he hailed the buccaneer. \u201cWho goes? Stand, or we fire.\u201d \u201cFlag of truce,\u201d cried Silver. The captain was in the porch, keeping himself carefully out of the way of a treacherous shot, should any be intended. He turned and spoke to us, \u201cDoctor's watch on the lookout. Dr. Livesey take the north side, if you please; Jim, the east; Gray, west. The watch below, all hands to load muskets. Lively, men, and careful.\u201d And then he turned again to the mutineers. \u201cAnd what do you want with your flag of truce?\u201d he cried. This time it was the other man who replied. \u201cCap'n Silver, sir, to come on board and make terms,\u201d he shouted. \u201cCap'n Silver! Don't know him. Who's he?\u201d cried the captain. And we could hear him adding to himself, \u201cCap'n, is it? My heart, and here's promotion!\u201d Long John answered for himself. \u201cMe, sir. These poor lads have chosen me cap'n, after your desertion, sir\u201d--laying a particular emphasis upon the word \u201cdesertion.\u201d \u201cWe're willing to submit, if we can come to terms, and no bones about it.", " \u201cYou see the mounds? I come here and prayed, nows and thens, when I thought maybe a Sunday would be about doo. It weren't quite a chapel, but it seemed more solemn like; and then, says you, Ben Gunn was short-handed--no chapling, nor so much as a Bible and a flag, you says.\u201d So he kept talking as I ran, neither expecting nor receiving any answer. The cannon-shot was followed after a considerable interval by a volley of small arms. Another pause, and then, not a quarter of a mile in front of me, I beheld the Union Jack flutter in the air above a wood. PART FOUR--The Stockade 16 Narrative Continued by the Doctor: How the Ship Was Abandoned IT was about half past one--three bells in the sea phrase--that the two boats went ashore from the HISPANIOLA. The captain, the squire, and I were talking matters over in the cabin. Had there been a breath of wind, we should have fallen on the six mutineers who were left aboard with us, slipped our cable, and away to sea."], "In what time period does the novel take place?": [" \u201cDown, dog!\u201d cries the captain. And the head popped back again; and we heard no more, for the time, of these six very faint-hearted seamen. By this time, tumbling things in as they came, we had the jolly-boat loaded as much as we dared. Joyce and I got out through the stern-port, and we made for shore again as fast as oars could take us. This second trip fairly aroused the watchers along shore. \u201cLillibullero\u201d was dropped again; and just before we lost sight of them behind the little point, one of them whipped ashore and disappeared. I had half a mind to change my plan and destroy their boats, but I feared that Silver and the others might be close at hand, and all might very well be lost by trying for too much. We had soon touched land in the same place as before and set to provision the block house. All three made the first journey, heavily laden, and tossed our stores over the palisade.", " \u201cI'll take it, if you like.\u201d \u201cI thought perhaps Dr. Livesey--\u201d I began. \u201cPerfectly right,\u201d he interrupted very cheerily, \u201cperfectly right--a gentleman and a magistrate. And, now I come to think of it, I might as well ride round there myself and report to him or squire. Master Pew's dead, when all's done; not that I regret it, but he's dead, you see, and people will make it out against an officer of his Majesty's revenue, if make it out they can. Now, I'll tell you, Hawkins, if you like, I'll take you along.\u201d I thanked him heartily for the offer, and we walked back to the hamlet where the horses were. By the time I had told mother of my purpose they were all in the saddle. \u201cDogger,\u201d said Mr. Dance, \u201cyou have a good horse; take up this lad behind you.\u201d As soon as I was mounted, holding on to Dogger's belt, the supervisor gave the word, and the party struck out at a bouncing trot on the road to Dr. Livesey's house.", " First he recognized the doctor with an unmistakable frown; then his glance fell upon me, and he looked relieved. But suddenly his colour changed, and he tried to raise himself, crying, \u201cWhere's Black Dog?\u201d \u201cThere is no Black Dog here,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cexcept what you have on your own back. You have been drinking rum; you have had a stroke, precisely as I told you; and I have just, very much against my own will, dragged you headforemost out of the grave. Now, Mr. Bones--\u201d \u201cThat's not my name,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cMuch I care,\u201d returned the doctor. \u201cIt's the name of a buccaneer of my acquaintance; and I call you by it for the sake of shortness, and what I have to say to you is this; one glass of rum won't kill you, but if you take one you'll take another and another, and I stake my wig if you don't break off short, you'll die--do you understand that?--die, and go to your own place, like the man in the Bible.", " Right before us, at the southern end, we saw the wreck of a ship in the last stages of dilapidation. It had been a great vessel of three masts but had lain so long exposed to the injuries of the weather that it was hung about with great webs of dripping seaweed, and on the deck of it shore bushes had taken root and now flourished thick with flowers. It was a sad sight, but it showed us that the anchorage was calm. \u201cNow,\u201d said Hands, \u201clook there; there's a pet bit for to beach a ship in. Fine flat sand, never a cat's paw, trees all around of it, and flowers a-blowing like a garding on that old ship.\u201d \u201cAnd once beached,\u201d I inquired, \u201chow shall we get her off again?\u201d \u201cWhy, so,\u201d he replied: \u201cyou take a line ashore there on the other side at low water, take a turn about one of them big pines; bring it back, take a turn around the capstan, and lie to for the tide. Come high water, all hands take a pull upon the line, and off she comes as sweet as natur'."], "What pirate symbol of guilt do Billy Bones and Long John Silver receive?": [" \u201cWell, and where are they now? Pew was that sort, and he died a beggar-man. Flint was, and he died of rum at Savannah. Ah, they was a sweet crew, they was! On'y, where are they?\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d asked Dick, \u201cwhen we do lay 'em athwart, what are we to do with 'em, anyhow?\u201d \u201cThere's the man for me!\u201d cried the cook admiringly. \u201cThat's what I call business. Well, what would you think? Put 'em ashore like maroons? That would have been England's way. Or cut 'em down like that much pork? That would have been Flint's, or Billy Bones's.\u201d \u201cBilly was the man for that,\u201d said Israel. \u201c'Dead men don't bite,' says he. Well, he's dead now hisself; he knows the long and short on it now; and if ever a rough hand come to port, it was Billy.\u201d \u201cRight you are,\u201d said Silver; \u201crough and ready. But mark you here, I'm an easy man--I'm quite the gentleman, says you; but this time it's serious. Dooty is dooty, mates. I give my vote--death.", " For my part, I must do my best to save this fellow's trebly worthless life; Jim, you get me a basin.\u201d When I got back with the basin, the doctor had already ripped up the captain's sleeve and exposed his great sinewy arm. It was tattooed in several places. \u201cHere's luck,\u201d \u201cA fair wind,\u201d and \u201cBilly Bones his fancy,\u201d were very neatly and clearly executed on the forearm; and up near the shoulder there was a sketch of a gallows and a man hanging from it--done, as I thought, with great spirit. \u201cProphetic,\u201d said the doctor, touching this picture with his finger. \u201cAnd now, Master Billy Bones, if that be your name, we'll have a look at the colour of your blood. Jim,\u201d he said, \u201care you afraid of blood?\u201d \u201cNo, sir,\u201d said I. \u201cWell, then,\u201d said he, \u201cyou hold the basin\u201d; and with that he took his lancet and opened a vein. A great deal of blood was taken before the captain opened his eyes and looked mistily about him.", " They're long bones, and the hair's been yellow. Aye, that would be Allardyce. You mind Allardyce, Tom Morgan?\u201d \u201cAye, aye,\u201d returned Morgan; \u201cI mind him; he owed me money, he did, and took my knife ashore with him.\u201d \u201cSpeaking of knives,\u201d said another, \u201cwhy don't we find his'n lying round? Flint warn't the man to pick a seaman's pocket; and the birds, I guess, would leave it be.\u201d \u201cBy the powers, and that's true!\u201d cried Silver. \u201cThere ain't a thing left here,\u201d said Merry, still feeling round among the bones; \u201cnot a copper doit nor a baccy box. It don't look nat'ral to me.\u201d \u201cNo, by gum, it don't,\u201d agreed Silver; \u201cnot nat'ral, nor not nice, says you. Great guns! Messmates, but if Flint was living, this would be a hot spot for you and me. Six they were, and six are we; and bones is what they are now.\u201d \u201cI saw him dead with these here deadlights,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cBilly took me in. There he laid, with penny-pieces on his eyes.\u201d \u201cDead--aye, sure enough he's dead and gone below,\u201d said the fellow with the bandage; \u201cbut if ever sperrit walked, it would be Flint's.", " And while they were still staring, I broke out again, \u201cAnd now, Mr. Silver,\u201d I said, \u201cI believe you're the best man here, and if things go to the worst, I'll take it kind of you to let the doctor know the way I took it.\u201d \u201cI'll bear it in mind,\u201d said Silver with an accent so curious that I could not, for the life of me, decide whether he were laughing at my request or had been favourably affected by my courage. \u201cI'll put one to that,\u201d cried the old mahogany-faced seaman--Morgan by name--whom I had seen in Long John's public-house upon the quays of Bristol. \u201cIt was him that knowed Black Dog.\u201d \u201cWell, and see here,\u201d added the sea-cook. \u201cI'll put another again to that, by thunder!

They are putting the powder and the arms in the fore hold. Now, you have a good place under the cabin; why not put them there?--first point. Then, you are bringing four of your own people with you, and they tell me some of them are to be berthed forward. Why not give them the berths here beside the cabin?--second point.\u201d \u201cAny more?\u201d asked Mr. Trelawney. \u201cOne more,\u201d said the captain. \u201cThere's been too much blabbing already.\u201d \u201cFar too much,\u201d agreed the doctor. \u201cI'll tell you what I've heard myself,\u201d continued Captain Smollett: \u201cthat you have a map of an island, that there's crosses on the map to show where treasure is, and that the island lies--\u201d And then he named the latitude and longitude exactly. \u201cI never told that,\u201d cried the squire, \u201cto a soul!\u201d \u201cThe hands know it, sir,\u201d returned the captain.", " But soon the anchor was short up; soon it was hanging dripping at the bows; soon the sails began to draw, and the land and shipping to flit by on either side; and before I could lie down to snatch an hour of slumber the HISPANIOLA had begun her voyage to the Isle of Treasure. I am not going to relate that voyage in detail. It was fairly prosperous. The ship proved to be a good ship, the crew were capable seamen, and the captain thoroughly understood his business. But before we came the length of Treasure Island, two or three things had happened which require to be known. Mr. Arrow, first of all, turned out even worse than the captain had feared. He had no command among the men, and people did what they pleased with him. But that was by no means the worst of it, for after a day or two at sea he began to appear on deck with hazy eye, red cheeks, stuttering tongue, and other marks of drunkenness.", " \u201cJim,\u201d he said at length, \u201cyou saw that seafaring man today?\u201d \u201cBlack Dog?\u201d I asked. \u201cAh!

Well, then, you get on a horse, and go to--well, yes, I will!--to that eternal doctor swab, and tell him to pipe all hands--magistrates and sich--and he'll lay 'em aboard at the Admiral Benbow--all old Flint's crew, man and boy, all on 'em that's left. I was first mate, I was, old Flint's first mate, and I'm the on'y one as knows the place. He gave it me at Savannah, when he lay a-dying, like as if I was to now, you see.

At last--I think it was on the third night--the doctor and I were strolling on the shoulder of the hill where it overlooks the lowlands of the isle, when, from out the thick darkness below, the wind brought us a noise between shrieking and singing.

One I recognized for the coxswain's, Israel Hands, that had been Flint's gunner in former days. The other was, of course, my friend of the red night-cap. Both men were plainly the worse of drink, and they were still drinking, for even while I was listening, one of them, with a drunken cry, opened the stern window and threw out something, which I divined to be an empty bottle. But they were not only tipsy; it was plain that they were furiously angry. Oaths flew like hailstones, and every now and then there came forth such an explosion as I thought was sure to end in blows. But each time the quarrel passed off and the voices grumbled lower for a while, until the next crisis came and in its turn passed away without result. On shore, I could see the glow of the great camp-fire burning warmly through the shore-side trees. Someone was singing, a dull, old, droning sailor's song, with a droop and a quaver at the end of every verse, and seemingly no end to it at all but the patience of the singer.", " Thomas Redruth, owner's servant, landsman, shot by the mutineers; James Hawkins, cabin-boy-- And at the same time, I was wondering over poor Jim Hawkins' fate.

He roared aloud, and his hanger went up above his head, flashing in the sunlight. I had not time to be afraid, but as the blow still hung impending, leaped in a trice upon one side, and missing my foot in the soft sand, rolled headlong down the slope. When I had first sallied from the door, the other mutineers had been already swarming up the palisade to make an end of us. One man, in a red night-cap, with his cutlass in his mouth, had even got upon the top and thrown a leg across. Well, so short had been the interval that when I found my feet again all was in the same posture, the fellow with the red night-cap still half-way over, another still just showing his head above the top of the stockade. And yet, in this breath of time, the fight was over and the victory was ours. Gray, following close behind me, had cut down the big boatswain ere he had time to recover from his last blow."], "Who narrates almost the entire novel?": [" The sight of the trees so near at hand had almost made me sick with longing, but the current had soon carried me past the point, and as the next reach of sea opened out, I beheld a sight that changed the nature of my thoughts. Right in front of me, not half a mile away, I beheld the HISPANIOLA under sail. I made sure, of course, that I should be taken; but I was so distressed for want of water that I scarce knew whether to be glad or sorry at the thought, and long before I had come to a conclusion, surprise had taken entire possession of my mind and I could do nothing but stare and wonder. The HISPANIOLA was under her main-sail and two jibs, and the beautiful white canvas shone in the sun like snow or silver. When I first sighted her, all her sails were drawing; she was lying a course about north-west, and I presumed the men on board were going round the island on their way back to the anchorage.", " Day after day this work went on; by every evening a fortune had been stowed aboard, but there was another fortune waiting for the morrow; and all this time we heard nothing of the three surviving mutineers.

This is the first glint of hope I had since the attack failed, and I owe it you. And now, Jim, we're to go in for this here treasure-hunting, with sealed orders too, and I don't like it; and you and me must stick close, back to back like, and we'll save our necks in spite o' fate and fortune.\u201d Just then a man hailed us from the fire that breakfast was ready, and we were soon seated here and there about the sand over biscuit and fried junk. They had lit a fire fit to roast an ox, and it was now grown so hot that they could only approach it from the windward, and even there not without precaution. In the same wasteful spirit, they had cooked, I suppose, three times more than we could eat; and one of them, with an empty laugh, threw what was left into the fire, which blazed and roared again over this unusual fuel. I never in my life saw men so careless of the morrow; hand to mouth is the only word that can describe their way of doing; and what with wasted food and sleeping sentries, though they were bold enough for a brush and be done with it, I could see their entire unfitness for anything like a prolonged campaign.", " I could hear people tumbling up from the cabin and the forecastle, and slipping in an instant outside my barrel, I dived behind the fore-sail, made a double towards the stern, and came out upon the open deck in time to join Hunter and Dr. Livesey in the rush for the weather bow. There all hands were already congregated. A belt of fog had lifted almost simultaneously with the appearance of the moon. Away to the south-west of us we saw two low hills, about a couple of miles apart, and rising behind one of them a third and higher hill, whose peak was still buried in the fog. All three seemed sharp and conical in figure. So much I saw, almost in a dream, for I had not yet recovered from my horrid fear of a minute or two before. And then I heard the voice of Captain Smollett issuing orders. The HISPANIOLA was laid a couple of points nearer the wind and now sailed a course that would just clear the island on the east."], "On what pirate crew did Billy Bones once serve?": [" \u201cWell, and where are they now?

The bundle was sewn together, and the doctor had to get out his instrument case and cut the stitches with his medical scissors. It contained two things--a book and a sealed paper. \u201cFirst of all we'll try the book,\u201d observed the doctor. The squire and I were both peering over his shoulder as he opened it, for Dr. Livesey had kindly motioned me to come round from the side-table, where I had been eating, to enjoy the sport of the search. On the first page there were only some scraps of writing, such as a man with a pen in his hand might make for idleness or practice. One was the same as the tattoo mark, \u201cBilly Bones his fancy\u201d; then there was \u201cMr. W.

While I was still casting about in my thoughts to find some probable excuse, Dr. Livesey called me to his side. He had left his pipe below, and being a slave to tobacco, had meant that I should fetch it; but as soon as I was near enough to speak and not to be overheard, I broke immediately, \u201cDoctor, let me speak. Get the captain and squire down to the cabin, and then make some pretence to send for me. I have terrible news.\u201d The doctor changed countenance a little, but next moment he was master of himself. \u201cThank you, Jim,\u201d said he quite loudly, \u201cthat was all I wanted to know,\u201d as if he had asked me a question. And with that he turned on his heel and rejoined the other two. They spoke together for a little, and though none of them started, or raised his voice, or so much as whistled, it was plain enough that Dr. Livesey had communicated my request, for the next thing that I heard was the captain giving an order to Job Anderson, and all hands were piped on deck.", " You don't, you say, like this cruise. Now, why?\u201d \u201cI was engaged, sir, on what we call sealed orders, to sail this ship for that gentleman where he should bid me,\u201d said the captain. \u201cSo far so good. But now I find that every man before the mast knows more than I do. I don't call that fair, now, do you?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Dr. Livesey, \u201cI don't.\u201d \u201cNext,\u201d said the captain, \u201cI learn we are going after treasure--hear it from my own hands, mind you. Now, treasure is ticklish work; I don't like treasure voyages on any account, and I don't like them, above all, when they are secret and when (begging your pardon, Mr. Trelawney) the secret has been told to the parrot.\u201d \u201cSilver's parrot?\u201d asked the squire. \u201cIt's a way of speaking,\u201d said the captain. \u201cBlabbed, I mean. It's my belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about, but I'll tell you my way of it--life or death, and a close run.\u201d \u201cThat is all clear, and, I dare say, true enough,\u201d replied Dr. Livesey.", " \u201cSo, Jim,\u201d said the doctor sadly, \u201chere you are. As you have brewed, so shall you drink, my boy. Heaven knows, I cannot find it in my heart to blame you, but this much I will say, be it kind or unkind: when Captain Smollett was well, you dared not have gone off; and when he was ill and couldn't help it, by George, it was downright cowardly!\u201d I will own that I here began to weep. \u201cDoctor,\u201d I said, \u201cyou might spare me. I have blamed myself enough; my life's forfeit anyway, and I should have been dead by now if Silver hadn't stood for me; and doctor, believe this, I can die--and I dare say I deserve it--but what I fear is torture. If they come to torture me--\u201d \u201cJim,\u201d the doctor interrupted, and his voice was quite changed, \u201cJim, I can't have this.

How many should say there were on your side, doctor?\u201d \u201cI know precisely,\u201d said Dr. Livesey. \u201cThree shots were fired on this side. I saw the three flashes--two close together--one farther to the west.\u201d \u201cThree!\u201d repeated the captain. \u201cAnd how many on yours, Mr. Trelawney?\u201d But this was not so easily answered. There had come many from the north--seven by the squire's computation, eight or nine according to Gray. From the east and west only a single shot had been fired. It was plain, therefore, that the attack would be developed from the north and that on the other three sides we were only to be annoyed by a show of hostilities. But Captain Smollett made no change in his arrangements."], "What character is most associated with civic authority and social power?": [" The top of the plateau was dotted thickly with pine-trees of varying height. Every here and there, one of a different species rose forty or fifty feet clear above its neighbours, and which of these was the particular \u201ctall tree\u201d of Captain Flint could only be decided on the spot, and by the readings of the compass. Yet, although that was the case, every man on board the boats had picked a favourite of his own ere we were half-way over, Long John alone shrugging his shoulders and bidding them wait till they were there. We pulled easily, by Silver's directions, not to weary the hands prematurely, and after quite a long passage, landed at the mouth of the second river--that which runs down a woody cleft of the Spy-glass. Thence, bending to our left, we began to ascend the slope towards the plateau. At the first outset, heavy, miry ground and a matted, marish vegetation greatly delayed our progress; but by little and little the hill began to steepen and become stony under foot, and the wood to change its character and to grow in a more open order.", " I ain't partic'lar as a rule, and I don't take no blame for settling his hash, but I don't reckon him ornamental now, do you?\u201d \u201cI'm not strong enough, and I don't like the job; and there he lies, for me,\u201d said I. \u201cThis here's an unlucky ship, this HISPANIOLA, Jim,\u201d he went on, blinking. \u201cThere's a power of men been killed in this HISPANIOLA--a sight o' poor seamen dead and gone since you and me took ship to Bristol. I never seen sich dirty luck, not I. There was this here O'Brien now--he's dead, ain't he? Well now, I'm no scholar, and you're a lad as can read and figure, and to put it straight, do you take it as a dead man is dead for good, or do he come alive again?\u201d \u201cYou can kill the body, Mr. Hands, but not the spirit; you must know that already,\u201d I replied. \u201cO'Brien there is in another world, and may be watching us.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d says he. \u201cWell, that's unfort'nate--appears as if killing parties was a waste of time.", " You may go.\u201d I was surprised at the coolness with which John avowed his knowledge of the island, and I own I was half-frightened when I saw him drawing nearer to myself. He did not know, to be sure, that I had overheard his council from the apple barrel, and yet I had by this time taken such a horror of his cruelty, duplicity, and power that I could scarce conceal a shudder when he laid his hand upon my arm. \u201cAh,\u201d says he, \u201cthis here is a sweet spot, this island--a sweet spot for a lad to get ashore on. You'll bathe, and you'll climb trees, and you'll hunt goats, you will; and you'll get aloft on them hills like a goat yourself. Why, it makes me young again. I was going to forget my timber leg, I was. It's a pleasant thing to be young and have ten toes, and you may lay to that. When you want to go a bit of exploring, you just ask old John, and he'll put up a snack for you to take along.\u201d And clapping me in the friendliest way upon the shoulder, he hobbled off forward and went below.", " All the time I was washing out the block house, and then washing up the things from dinner, this disgust and envy kept growing stronger and stronger, till at last, being near a bread-bag, and no one then observing me, I took the first step towards my escapade and filled both pockets of my coat with biscuit. I was a fool, if you like, and certainly I was going to do a foolish, over-bold act; but I was determined to do it with all the precautions in my power. These biscuits, should anything befall me, would keep me, at least, from starving till far on in the next day. The next thing I laid hold of was a brace of pistols, and as I already had a powder-horn and bullets, I felt myself well supplied with arms. As for the scheme I had in my head, it was not a bad one in itself. I was to go down the sandy spit that divides the anchorage on the east from the open sea, find the white rock I had observed last evening, and ascertain whether it was there or not that Ben Gunn had hidden his boat, a thing quite worth doing, as I still believe."], "Who is the only pirate character to be reformed?": [" The top of the plateau was dotted thickly with pine-trees of varying height. Every here and there, one of a different species rose forty or fifty feet clear above its neighbours, and which of these was the particular \u201ctall tree\u201d of Captain Flint could only be decided on the spot, and by the readings of the compass. Yet, although that was the case, every man on board the boats had picked a favourite of his own ere we were half-way over, Long John alone shrugging his shoulders and bidding them wait till they were there. We pulled easily, by Silver's directions, not to weary the hands prematurely, and after quite a long passage, landed at the mouth of the second river--that which runs down a woody cleft of the Spy-glass. Thence, bending to our left, we began to ascend the slope towards the plateau. At the first outset, heavy, miry ground and a matted, marish vegetation greatly delayed our progress; but by little and little the hill began to steepen and become stony under foot, and the wood to change its character and to grow in a more open order.", " \u201cYou had better sit down.\u201d \u201cYou ain't a-going to let me inside, cap'n?\u201d complained Long John. \u201cIt's a main cold morning, to be sure, sir, to sit outside upon the sand.\u201d \u201cWhy, Silver,\u201d said the captain, \u201cif you had pleased to be an honest man, you might have been sitting in your galley. It's your own doing. You're either my ship's cook--and then you were treated handsome--or Cap'n Silver, a common mutineer and pirate, and then you can go hang!\u201d \u201cWell, well, cap'n,\u201d returned the sea-cook, sitting down as he was bidden on the sand, \u201cyou'll have to give me a hand up again, that's all. A sweet pretty place you have of it here. Ah, there's Jim! The top of the morning to you, Jim. Doctor, here's my service. Why, there you all are together like a happy family, in a manner of speaking.\u201d \u201cIf you have anything to say, my man, better say it,\u201d said the captain. \u201cRight you were, Cap'n Smollett,\u201d replied Silver.", " Well now, I tell you, I'm not a boasting man, and you seen yourself how easy I keep company, but when I was quartermaster, LAMBS wasn't the word for Flint's old buccaneers. Ah, you may be sure of yourself in old John's ship.\u201d \u201cWell, I tell you now,\u201d replied the lad, \u201cI didn't half a quarter like the job till I had this talk with you, John; but there's my hand on it now.\u201d \u201cAnd a brave lad you were, and smart too,\u201d answered Silver, shaking hands so heartily that all the barrel shook, \u201cand a finer figurehead for a gentleman of fortune I never clapped my eyes on.\u201d By this time I had begun to understand the meaning of their terms. By a \u201cgentleman of fortune\u201d they plainly meant neither more nor less than a common pirate, and the little scene that I had overheard was the last act in the corruption of one of the honest hands--perhaps of the last one left aboard. But on this point I was soon to be relieved, for Silver giving a little whistle, a third man strolled up and sat down by the party.", " It's child's play to find the stuff now. I've half a mind to dine first.\u201d \u201cI don't feel sharp,\u201d growled Morgan. \u201cThinkin' o' Flint--I think it were--as done me.\u201d \u201cAh, well, my son, you praise your stars he's dead,\u201d said Silver. \u201cHe were an ugly devil,\u201d cried a third pirate with a shudder; \u201cthat blue in the face too!\u201d \u201cThat was how the rum took him,\u201d added Merry. \u201cBlue! Well, I reckon he was blue. That's a true word.\u201d Ever since they had found the skeleton and got upon this train of thought, they had spoken lower and lower, and they had almost got to whispering by now, so that the sound of their talk hardly interrupted the silence of the wood. All of a sudden, out of the middle of the trees in front of us, a thin, high, trembling voice struck up the well-known air and words: \u201cFifteen men on the dead man's chest-- Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!\u201d I never have seen men more dreadfully affected than the pirates."], "What best characterizes the change that Jim undergoes in the course of his adventures?": [" Jump! One jump, and you're out, and we'll run for it like antelopes.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I replied; \u201cyou know right well you wouldn't do the thing yourself--neither you nor squire nor captain; and no more will I. Silver trusted me; I passed my word, and back I go. But, doctor, you did not let me finish. If they come to torture me, I might let slip a word of where the ship is, for I got the ship, part by luck and part by risking, and she lies in North Inlet, on the southern beach, and just below high water. At half tide she must be high and dry.\u201d \u201cThe ship!\u201d exclaimed the doctor. Rapidly I described to him my adventures, and he heard me out in silence. \u201cThere is a kind of fate in this,\u201d he observed when I had done. \u201cEvery step, it's you that saves our lives; and do you suppose by any chance that we are going to let you lose yours? That would be a poor return, my boy. You found out the plot; you found Ben Gunn--the best deed that ever you did, or will do, though you live to ninety.", " \u201cJim, Jim,\u201d says he, quite pleased apparently. \u201cWell, now, Jim, I've lived that rough as you'd be ashamed to hear of. Now, for instance, you wouldn't think I had had a pious mother--to look at me?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy, no, not in particular,\u201d I answered. \u201cAh, well,\u201d said he, \u201cbut I had--remarkable pious. And I was a civil, pious boy, and could rattle off my catechism that fast, as you couldn't tell one word from another. And here's what it come to, Jim, and it begun with chuck-farthen on the blessed grave-stones! That's what it begun with, but it went further'n that; and so my mother told me, and predicked the whole, she did, the pious woman! But it were Providence that put me here. I've thought it all out in this here lonely island, and I'm back on piety. You don't catch me tasting rum so much, but just a thimbleful for luck, of course, the first chance I have. I'm bound I'll be good, and I see the way to.", " The doctor had to go to London for a physician to take charge of his practice; the squire was hard at work at Bristol; and I lived on at the hall under the charge of old Redruth, the gamekeeper, almost a prisoner, but full of sea-dreams and the most charming anticipations of strange islands and adventures. I brooded by the hour together over the map, all the details of which I well remembered. Sitting by the fire in the housekeeper's room, I approached that island in my fancy from every possible direction; I explored every acre of its surface; I climbed a thousand times to that tall hill they call the Spy-glass, and from the top enjoyed the most wonderful and changing prospects. Sometimes the isle was thick with savages, with whom we fought, sometimes full of dangerous animals that hunted us, but in all my fancies nothing occurred to me so strange and tragic as our actual adventures. So the weeks passed on, till one fine day there came a letter addressed to Dr. Livesey, with this addition, \u201cTo be opened, in the case of his absence, by Tom Redruth or young Hawkins.\u201d Obeying this order, we found, or rather I found--for the gamekeeper was a poor hand at reading anything but print--the following important news: Old Anchor Inn, Bristol, March 1, 17-- Dear Livesey--As I do not know whether you are at the hall or still in London, I send this in double to both places.", " At the same moment, she yawed sharply and seemed to change her course. The speed in the meantime had strangely increased. I opened my eyes at once. All round me were little ripples, combing over with a sharp, bristling sound and slightly phosphorescent. The HISPANIOLA herself, a few yards in whose wake I was still being whirled along, seemed to stagger in her course, and I saw her spars toss a little against the blackness of the night; nay, as I looked longer, I made sure she also was wheeling to the southward. I glanced over my shoulder, and my heart jumped against my ribs. There, right behind me, was the glow of the camp-fire. The current had turned at right angles, sweeping round along with it the tall schooner and the little dancing coracle; ever quickening, ever bubbling higher, ever muttering louder, it went spinning through the narrows for the open sea. Suddenly the schooner in front of me gave a violent yaw, turning, perhaps, through twenty degrees; and almost at the same moment one shout followed another from on board; I could hear feet pounding on the companion ladder and I knew that the two drunkards had at last been interrupted in their quarrel and awakened to a sense of their disaster."], "What specific details does Jim include in his narrative that make the heroic claims of grownups seem like empty bluster?": [" NARRATIVE CONTINUED BY THE DOCTOR: THE JOLLY-BOAT'S LAST TRIP . . . . . . 105 18.

On the top of that the three gentlemen went below, and not long after, word was sent forward that Jim Hawkins was wanted in the cabin. I found them all three seated round the table, a bottle of Spanish wine and some raisins before them, and the doctor smoking away, with his wig on his lap, and that, I knew, was a sign that he was agitated. The stern window was open, for it was a warm night, and you could see the moon shining behind on the ship's wake. \u201cNow, Hawkins,\u201d said the squire, \u201cyou have something to say. Speak up.\u201d I did as I was bid, and as short as I could make it, told the whole details of Silver's conversation. Nobody interrupted me till I was done, nor did any one of the three of them make so much as a movement, but they kept their eyes upon my face from first to last. \u201cJim,\u201d said Dr. Livesey, \u201ctake a seat.\u201d And they made me sit down at table beside them, poured me out a glass of wine, filled my hands with raisins, and all three, one after the other, and each with a bow, drank my good health, and their service to me, for my luck and courage.", " Thomas Redruth, owner's servant, landsman, shot by the mutineers; James Hawkins, cabin-boy-- And at the same time, I was wondering over poor Jim Hawkins' fate. A hail on the land side. \u201cSomebody hailing us,\u201d said Hunter, who was on guard. \u201cDoctor! Squire! Captain! Hullo, Hunter, is that you?\u201d came the cries. And I ran to the door in time to see Jim Hawkins, safe and sound, come climbing over the stockade. 19 Narrative Resumed by Jim Hawkins: The Garrison in the Stockade AS soon as Ben Gunn saw the colours he came to a halt, stopped me by the arm, and sat down. \u201cNow,\u201d said he, \u201cthere's your friends, sure enough.\u201d \u201cFar more likely it's the mutineers,\u201d I answered. \u201cThat!\u201d he cried. \u201cWhy, in a place like this, where nobody puts in but gen'lemen of fortune, Silver would fly the Jolly Roger, you don't make no doubt of that. No, that's your friends. There's been blows too, and I reckon your friends has had the best of it; and here they are ashore in the old stockade, as was made years and years ago by Flint.", " Silver leant back against the wall, his arms crossed, his pipe in the corner of his mouth, as calm as though he had been in church; yet his eye kept wandering furtively, and he kept the tail of it on his unruly followers. They, on their part, drew gradually together towards the far end of the block house, and the low hiss of their whispering sounded in my ear continuously, like a stream. One after another, they would look up, and the red light of the torch would fall for a second on their nervous faces; but it was not towards me, it was towards Silver that they turned their eyes. \u201cYou seem to have a lot to say,\u201d remarked Silver, spitting far into the air. \u201cPipe up and let me hear it, or lay to.\u201d \u201cAx your pardon, sir,\u201d returned one of the men; \u201cyou're pretty free with some of the rules; maybe you'll kindly keep an eye upon the rest. This crew's dissatisfied; this crew don't vally bullying a marlin-spike; this crew has its rights like other crews, I'll make so free as that; and by your own rules, I take it we can talk together."], "What does Silver\u2019s murder of Tom Redruth demonstrate that he cares little about?": [" When I came again to myself the monster had pulled himself together, his crutch under his arm, his hat upon his head. Just before him Tom lay motionless upon the sward; but the murderer minded him not a whit, cleansing his blood-stained knife the while upon a wisp of grass. Everything else was unchanged, the sun still shining mercilessly on the steaming marsh and the tall pinnacle of the mountain, and I could scarce persuade myself that murder had been actually done and a human life cruelly cut short a moment since before my eyes. But now John put his hand into his pocket, brought out a whistle, and blew upon it several modulated blasts that rang far across the heated air. I could not tell, of course, the meaning of the signal, but it instantly awoke my fears. More men would be coming. I might be discovered. They had already slain two of the honest people; after Tom and Alan, might not I come next?", " \u201cAvast, there!\u201d cried Silver. \u201cWho are you, Tom Morgan? Maybe you thought you was cap'n here, perhaps. By the powers, but I'll teach you better! Cross me, and you'll go where many a good man's gone before you, first and last, these thirty year back--some to the yard-arm, shiver my timbers, and some by the board, and all to feed the fishes. There's never a man looked me between the eyes and seen a good day a'terwards, Tom Morgan, you may lay to that.\u201d Morgan paused, but a hoarse murmur rose from the others. \u201cTom's right,\u201d said one. \u201cI stood hazing long enough from one,\u201d added another. \u201cI'll be hanged if I'll be hazed by you, John Silver.\u201d \u201cDid any of you gentlemen want to have it out with ME?\u201d roared Silver, bending far forward from his position on the keg, with his pipe still glowing in his right hand. \u201cPut a name on what you're at; you ain't dumb, I reckon. Him that wants shall get it. Have I lived this many years, and a son of a rum puncheon cock his hat athwart my hawse at the latter end of it?", " Our chimney was a square hole in the roof; it was but a little part of the smoke that found its way out, and the rest eddied about the house and kept us coughing and piping the eye. Add to this that Gray, the new man, had his face tied up in a bandage for a cut he had got in breaking away from the mutineers and that poor old Tom Redruth, still unburied, lay along the wall, stiff and stark, under the Union Jack. If we had been allowed to sit idle, we should all have fallen in the blues, but Captain Smollett was never the man for that. All hands were called up before him, and he divided us into watches. The doctor and Gray and I for one; the squire, Hunter, and Joyce upon the other. Tired though we all were, two were sent out for firewood; two more were set to dig a grave for Redruth; the doctor was named cook; I was put sentry at the door; and the captain himself went from one to another, keeping up our spirits and lending a hand wherever it was wanted.", " I forgot to tell you that Silver is a man of substance; I know of my own knowledge that he has a banker's account, which has never been overdrawn. He leaves his wife to manage the inn; and as she is a woman of colour, a pair of old bachelors like you and I may be excused for guessing that it is the wife, quite as much as the health, that sends him back to roving. J. T. P.P.S.--Hawkins may stay one night with his mother. J. T. You can fancy the excitement into which that letter put me. I was half beside myself with glee; and if ever I despised a man, it was old Tom Redruth, who could do nothing but grumble and lament. Any of the under-gamekeepers would gladly have changed places with him; but such was not the squire's pleasure, and the squire's pleasure was like law among them all. Nobody but old Redruth would have dared so much as even to grumble. The next morning he and I set out on foot for the Admiral Benbow, and there I found my mother in good health and spirits."], "What characteristic does Silver seem to share with Dr. Livesey?": [" Captain Smollett, the squire, and Dr. Livesey were talking together on the quarter-deck, and anxious as I was to tell them my story, I durst not interrupt them openly. While I was still casting about in my thoughts to find some probable excuse, Dr. Livesey called me to his side. He had left his pipe below, and being a slave to tobacco, had meant that I should fetch it; but as soon as I was near enough to speak and not to be overheard, I broke immediately, \u201cDoctor, let me speak. Get the captain and squire down to the cabin, and then make some pretence to send for me. I have terrible news.\u201d The doctor changed countenance a little, but next moment he was master of himself. \u201cThank you, Jim,\u201d said he quite loudly, \u201cthat was all I wanted to know,\u201d as if he had asked me a question. And with that he turned on his heel and rejoined the other two. They spoke together for a little, and though none of them started, or raised his voice, or so much as whistled, it was plain enough that Dr. Livesey had communicated my request, for the next thing that I heard was the captain giving an order to Job Anderson, and all hands were piped on deck.", " That was Flint's treasure that we had come so far to seek and that had cost already the lives of seventeen men from the HISPANIOLA. How many it had cost in the amassing, what blood and sorrow, what good ships scuttled on the deep, what brave men walking the plank blindfold, what shot of cannon, what shame and lies and cruelty, perhaps no man alive could tell. Yet there were still three upon that island--Silver, and old Morgan, and Ben Gunn--who had each taken his share in these crimes, as each had hoped in vain to share in the reward. \u201cCome in, Jim,\u201d said the captain. \u201cYou're a good boy in your line, Jim, but I don't think you and me'll go to sea again. You're too much of the born favourite for me. Is that you, John Silver? What brings you here, man?\u201d \u201cCome back to my dooty, sir,\u201d returned Silver. \u201cAh!\u201d said the captain, and that was all he said. What a supper I had of it that night, with all my friends around me; and what a meal it was, with Ben Gunn's salted goat and some delicacies and a bottle of old wine from the HISPANIOLA.", " Once we got the ship and treasure both and off to sea like jolly companions, why then we'll talk Mr. Hawkins over, we will, and we'll give him his share, to be sure, for all his kindness.\u201d It was no wonder the men were in a good humour now. For my part, I was horribly cast down. Should the scheme he had now sketched prove feasible, Silver, already doubly a traitor, would not hesitate to adopt it. He had still a foot in either camp, and there was no doubt he would prefer wealth and freedom with the pirates to a bare escape from hanging, which was the best he had to hope on our side. Nay, and even if things so fell out that he was forced to keep his faith with Dr. Livesey, even then what danger lay before us! What a moment that would be when the suspicions of his followers turned to certainty and he and I should have to fight for dear life--he a cripple and I a boy--against five strong and active seamen!", " 6 The Captain's Papers WE rode hard all the way till we drew up before Dr. Livesey's door. The house was all dark to the front. Mr. Dance told me to jump down and knock, and Dogger gave me a stirrup to descend by. The door was opened almost at once by the maid. \u201cIs Dr. Livesey in?\u201d I asked. No, she said, he had come home in the afternoon but had gone up to the hall to dine and pass the evening with the squire. \u201cSo there we go, boys,\u201d said Mr. Dance. This time, as the distance was short, I did not mount, but ran with Dogger's stirrup-leather to the lodge gates and up the long, leafless, moonlit avenue to where the white line of the hall buildings looked on either hand on great old gardens. Here Mr. Dance dismounted, and taking me along with him, was admitted at a word into the house. The servant led us down a matted passage and showed us at the end into a great library, all lined with bookcases and busts upon the top of them, where the squire and Dr. Livesey sat, pipe in hand, on either side of a bright fire."], "What does Dr. Livesey never do, unlike Jim or the pirates?": [" Captain Smollett, the squire, and Dr. Livesey were talking together on the quarter-deck, and anxious as I was to tell them my story, I durst not interrupt them openly.

On the far side of the open stood one of the hills, with two quaint, craggy peaks shining vividly in the sun. I now felt for the first time the joy of exploration. The isle was uninhabited; my shipmates I had left behind, and nothing lived in front of me but dumb brutes and fowls. I turned hither and thither among the trees. Here and there were flowering plants, unknown to me; here and there I saw snakes, and one raised his head from a ledge of rock and hissed at me with a noise not unlike the spinning of a top. Little did I suppose that he was a deadly enemy and that the noise was the famous rattle.", " 6 The Captain's Papers WE rode hard all the way till we drew up before Dr. Livesey's door.

Heaven knows, I cannot find it in my heart to blame you, but this much I will say, be it kind or unkind: when Captain Smollett was well, you dared not have gone off; and when he was ill and couldn't help it, by George, it was downright cowardly!\u201d I will own that I here began to weep. \u201cDoctor,\u201d I said, \u201cyou might spare me. I have blamed myself enough; my life's forfeit anyway, and I should have been dead by now if Silver hadn't stood for me; and doctor, believe this, I can die--and I dare say I deserve it--but what I fear is torture. If they come to torture me--\u201d \u201cJim,\u201d the doctor interrupted, and his voice was quite changed, \u201cJim, I can't have this. Whip over, and we'll run for it.\u201d \u201cDoctor,\u201d said I, \u201cI passed my word.\u201d \u201cI know, I know,\u201d he cried. \u201cWe can't help that, Jim, now. I'll take it on my shoulders, holus bolus, blame and shame, my boy; but stay here, I cannot let you.", " \u201cWe've quite a surprise for you too, sir,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe've a little stranger here--he! he! A noo boarder and lodger, sir, and looking fit and taut as a fiddle; slep' like a supercargo, he did, right alongside of John--stem to stem we was, all night.\u201d Dr. Livesey was by this time across the stockade and pretty near the cook, and I could hear the alteration in his voice as he said, \u201cNot Jim?\u201d \u201cThe very same Jim as ever was,\u201d says Silver. The doctor stopped outright, although he did not speak, and it was some seconds before he seemed able to move on. \u201cWell, well,\u201d he said at last, \u201cduty first and pleasure afterwards, as you might have said yourself, Silver. Let us overhaul these patients of yours.\u201d A moment afterwards he had entered the block house and with one grim nod to me proceeded with his work among the sick. He seemed under no apprehension, though he must have known that his life, among these treacherous demons, depended on a hair; and he rattled on to his patients as if he were paying an ordinary professional visit in a quiet English family.", " Oh, by Jupiter, and talking of Ben Gunn! Why, this is the mischief in person. Silver!\u201d he cried. \u201cSilver! I'll give you a piece of advice,\u201d he continued as the cook drew near again; \u201cdon't you be in any great hurry after that treasure.\u201d \u201cWhy, sir, I do my possible, which that ain't,\u201d said Silver. \u201cI can only, asking your pardon, save my life and the boy's by seeking for that treasure; and you may lay to that.\u201d \u201cWell, Silver,\u201d replied the doctor, \u201cif that is so, I'll go one step further: look out for squalls when you find it.\u201d \u201cSir,\u201d said Silver, \u201cas between man and man, that's too much and too little. What you're after, why you left the block house, why you given me that there chart, I don't know, now, do I? And yet I done your bidding with my eyes shut and never a word of hope! But no, this here's too much. If you won't tell me what you mean plain out, just say so and I'll leave the helm.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said the doctor musingly; \u201cI've no right to say more; it's not my secret, you see, Silver, or, I give you my word, I'd tell it you.", " \u201cDick's square,\u201d said Silver. \u201cOh, I know'd Dick was square,\u201d returned the voice of the coxswain, Israel Hands. \u201cHe's no fool, is Dick.\u201d And he turned his quid and spat. \u201cBut look here,\u201d he went on, \u201chere's what I want to know, Barbecue: how long are we a-going to stand off and on like a blessed bumboat? I've had a'most enough o' Cap'n Smollett; he's hazed me long enough, by thunder! I want to go into that cabin, I do. I want their pickles and wines, and that.\u201d \u201cIsrael,\u201d said Silver, \u201cyour head ain't much account, nor ever was. But you're able to hear, I reckon; leastways, your ears is big enough. Now, here's what I say: you'll berth forward, and you'll live hard, and you'll speak soft, and you'll keep sober till I give the word; and you may lay to that, my son.\u201d \u201cWell, I don't say no, do I?\u201d growled the coxswain. \u201cWhat I say is, when? That's what I say.\u201d \u201cWhen! By the powers!\u201d cried Silver."], "What symbol is linked to Stevenson\u2019s thematic exploration of the futility of desire?": [" I should, I think, have had nothing left me to desire but for the eyes of the coxswain as they followed me derisively about the deck and the odd smile that appeared continually on his face. It was a smile that had in it something both of pain and weakness--a haggard old man's smile; but there was, besides that, a grain of derision, a shadow of treachery, in his expression as he craftily watched, and watched, and watched me at my work. 26 Israel Hands THE wind, serving us to a desire, now hauled into the west. We could run so much the easier from the north-east corner of the island to the mouth of the North Inlet. Only, as we had no power to anchor and dared not beach her till the tide had flowed a good deal farther, time hung on our hands. The coxswain told me how to lay the ship to; after a good many trials I succeeded, and we both sat in silence over another meal. \u201cCap'n,\u201d said he at length with that same uncomfortable smile, \u201chere's my old shipmate, O'Brien; s'pose you was to heave him overboard.", " I had crossed a marshy tract full of willows, bulrushes, and odd, outlandish, swampy trees; and I had now come out upon the skirts of an open piece of undulating, sandy country, about a mile long, dotted with a few pines and a great number of contorted trees, not unlike the oak in growth, but pale in the foliage, like willows. On the far side of the open stood one of the hills, with two quaint, craggy peaks shining vividly in the sun. I now felt for the first time the joy of exploration. The isle was uninhabited; my shipmates I had left behind, and nothing lived in front of me but dumb brutes and fowls. I turned hither and thither among the trees. Here and there were flowering plants, unknown to me; here and there I saw snakes, and one raised his head from a ledge of rock and hissed at me with a noise not unlike the spinning of a top. Little did I suppose that he was a deadly enemy and that the noise was the famous rattle.", " *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TREASURE ISLAND *** Produced by Judy Boss, John Hamm and David Widger TREASURE ISLAND by Robert Louis Stevenson TREASURE ISLAND To S.L.O., an American gentleman in accordance with whose classic taste the following narrative has been designed, it is now, in return for numerous delightful hours, and with the kindest wishes, dedicated by his affectionate friend, the author.

Nor was that wonderful, seeing how cavalier had been the captain's answer. But Silver laughed at him aloud and slapped him on the back as if the idea of alarm had been absurd. Then he advanced to the stockade, threw over his crutch, got a leg up, and with great vigour and skill succeeded in surmounting the fence and dropping safely to the other side."], "By setting his narrative in a romanticized past, what does Stevenson imply that the modern age is missing?": [" NARRATIVE CONTINUED BY THE DOCTOR: THE JOLLY-BOAT'S LAST TRIP . . . . . . 105 18.

I come here and prayed, nows and thens, when I thought maybe a Sunday would be about doo. It weren't quite a chapel, but it seemed more solemn like; and then, says you, Ben Gunn was short-handed--no chapling, nor so much as a Bible and a flag, you says.\u201d So he kept talking as I ran, neither expecting nor receiving any answer. The cannon-shot was followed after a considerable interval by a volley of small arms. Another pause, and then, not a quarter of a mile in front of me, I beheld the Union Jack flutter in the air above a wood. PART FOUR--The Stockade 16 Narrative Continued by the Doctor: How the Ship Was Abandoned IT was about half past one--three bells in the sea phrase--that the two boats went ashore from the HISPANIOLA. The captain, the squire, and I were talking matters over in the cabin. Had there been a breath of wind, we should have fallen on the six mutineers who were left aboard with us, slipped our cable, and away to sea.", " The captain, who had so long been a cause of so much discomfort, was gone where the wicked cease from troubling. The squire had had everything repaired, and the public rooms and the sign repainted, and had added some furniture--above all a beautiful armchair for mother in the bar. He had found her a boy as an apprentice also so that she should not want help while I was gone. It was on seeing that boy that I understood, for the first time, my situation. I had thought up to that moment of the adventures before me, not at all of the home that I was leaving; and now, at sight of this clumsy stranger, who was to stay here in my place beside my mother, I had my first attack of tears. I am afraid I led that boy a dog's life, for as he was new to the work, I had a hundred opportunities of setting him right and putting him down, and I was not slow to profit by them. The night passed, and the next day, after dinner, Redruth and I were afoot again and on the road."], "Which of the following motifs does Stevenson often invoke in his descriptions of the pirates?": [" *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TREASURE ISLAND *** Produced by Judy Boss, John Hamm and David Widger TREASURE ISLAND by Robert Louis Stevenson TREASURE ISLAND To S.L.O., an American gentleman in accordance with whose classic taste the following narrative has been designed, it is now, in return for numerous delightful hours, and with the kindest wishes, dedicated by his affectionate friend, the author.

They had \u201cgot their rations for that day,\u201d as the captain put it, and we had the place to ourselves and a quiet time to overhaul the wounded and get dinner. Squire and I cooked outside in spite of the danger, and even outside we could hardly tell what we were at, for horror of the loud groans that reached us from the doctor's patients. Out of the eight men who had fallen in the action, only three still breathed--that one of the pirates who had been shot at the loophole, Hunter, and Captain Smollett; and of these, the first two were as good as dead; the mutineer indeed died under the doctor's knife, and Hunter, do what we could, never recovered consciousness in this world. He lingered all day, breathing loudly like the old buccaneer at home in his apoplectic fit, but the bones of his chest had been crushed by the blow and his skull fractured in falling, and some time in the following night, without sign or sound, he went to his Maker.", " To see him leap and run and pursue me over hedge and ditch was the worst of nightmares. And altogether I paid pretty dear for my monthly fourpenny piece, in the shape of these abominable fancies. But though I was so terrified by the idea of the seafaring man with one leg, I was far less afraid of the captain himself than anybody else who knew him. There were nights when he took a deal more rum and water than his head would carry; and then he would sometimes sit and sing his wicked, old, wild sea-songs, minding nobody; but sometimes he would call for glasses round and force all the trembling company to listen to his stories or bear a chorus to his singing. Often I have heard the house shaking with \u201cYo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum,\u201d all the neighbours joining in for dear life, with the fear of death upon them, and each singing louder than the other to avoid remark. For in these fits he was the most overriding companion ever known; he would slap his hand on the table for silence all round; he would fly up in a passion of anger at a question, or sometimes because none was put, and so he judged the company was not following his story.", " Next moment I was face to face with Anderson. He roared aloud, and his hanger went up above his head, flashing in the sunlight. I had not time to be afraid, but as the blow still hung impending, leaped in a trice upon one side, and missing my foot in the soft sand, rolled headlong down the slope. When I had first sallied from the door, the other mutineers had been already swarming up the palisade to make an end of us. One man, in a red night-cap, with his cutlass in his mouth, had even got upon the top and thrown a leg across. Well, so short had been the interval that when I found my feet again all was in the same posture, the fellow with the red night-cap still half-way over, another still just showing his head above the top of the stockade. And yet, in this breath of time, the fight was over and the victory was ours. Gray, following close behind me, had cut down the big boatswain ere he had time to recover from his last blow."], "What symbolic object serves as a kind of magical talisman in the way it draws people into the adventure story?": [" Nor would he allow anyone to leave the inn till he had drunk himself sleepy and reeled off to bed. His stories were what frightened people worst of all. Dreadful stories they were--about hanging, and walking the plank, and storms at sea, and the Dry Tortugas, and wild deeds and places on the Spanish Main. By his own account he must have lived his life among some of the wickedest men that God ever allowed upon the sea, and the language in which he told these stories shocked our plain country people almost as much as the crimes that he described. My father was always saying the inn would be ruined, for people would soon cease coming there to be tyrannized over and put down, and sent shivering to their beds; but I really believe his presence did us good. People were frightened at the time, but on looking back they rather liked it; it was a fine excitement in a quiet country life, and there was even a party of the younger men who pretended to admire him, calling him a \u201ctrue sea-dog\u201d and a \u201creal old salt\u201d and such like names, and saying there was the sort of man that made England terrible at sea.", " It's trying on a man, I know. It would be pleasanter to come to blows. But there's no help for it till we know our men. Lay to, and whistle for a wind, that's my view.\u201d \u201cJim here,\u201d said the doctor, \u201ccan help us more than anyone. The men are not shy with him, and Jim is a noticing lad.\u201d \u201cHawkins, I put prodigious faith in you,\u201d added the squire. I began to feel pretty desperate at this, for I felt altogether helpless; and yet, by an odd train of circumstances, it was indeed through me that safety came. In the meantime, talk as we pleased, there were only seven out of the twenty-six on whom we knew we could rely; and out of these seven one was a boy, so that the grown men on our side were six to their nineteen. PART THREE--My Shore Adventure 13 How My Shore Adventure Began THE appearance of the island when I came on deck next morning was altogether changed. Although the breeze had now utterly ceased, we had made a great deal of way during the night and were now lying becalmed about half a mile to the south-east of the low eastern coast.", " PART FIVE--My Sea Adventure 22 How My Sea Adventure Began THERE was no return of the mutineers--not so much as another shot out of the woods.

I remember him as if it were yesterday, as he came plodding to the inn door, his sea-chest following behind him in a hand-barrow--a tall, strong, heavy, nut-brown man, his tarry pigtail falling over the shoulder of his soiled blue coat, his hands ragged and scarred, with black, broken nails, and the sabre cut across one cheek, a dirty, livid white.", " We never had a night at the Admiral Benbow when I had half the work; and I was dog-tired when, a little before dawn, the boatswain sounded his pipe and the crew began to man the capstan-bars. I might have been twice as weary, yet I would not have left the deck, all was so new and interesting to me--the brief commands, the shrill note of the whistle, the men bustling to their places in the glimmer of the ship's lanterns. \u201cNow, Barbecue, tip us a stave,\u201d cried one voice. \u201cThe old one,\u201d cried another. \u201cAye, aye, mates,\u201d said Long John, who was standing by, with his crutch under his arm, and at once broke out in the air and words I knew so well: \u201cFifteen men on the dead man's chest--\u201d And then the whole crew bore chorus:-- \u201cYo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!\u201d And at the third \u201cHo!\u201d drove the bars before them with a will. Even at that exciting moment it carried me back to the old Admiral Benbow in a second, and I seemed to hear the voice of the captain piping in the chorus.", " I forgot to tell you that Silver is a man of substance; I know of my own knowledge that he has a banker's account, which has never been overdrawn. He leaves his wife to manage the inn; and as she is a woman of colour, a pair of old bachelors like you and I may be excused for guessing that it is the wife, quite as much as the health, that sends him back to roving. J. T. P.P.S.--Hawkins may stay one night with his mother. J. T. You can fancy the excitement into which that letter put me. I was half beside myself with glee; and if ever I despised a man, it was old Tom Redruth, who could do nothing but grumble and lament. Any of the under-gamekeepers would gladly have changed places with him; but such was not the squire's pleasure, and the squire's pleasure was like law among them all. Nobody but old Redruth would have dared so much as even to grumble. The next morning he and I set out on foot for the Admiral Benbow, and there I found my mother in good health and spirits.", " The captain made a sort of gasp. \u201cBlack Dog!\u201d said he. \u201cAnd who else?\u201d returned the other, getting more at his ease. \u201cBlack Dog as ever was, come for to see his old shipmate Billy, at the Admiral Benbow inn. Ah, Bill, Bill, we have seen a sight of times, us two, since I lost them two talons,\u201d holding up his mutilated hand. \u201cNow, look here,\u201d said the captain; \u201cyou've run me down; here I am; well, then, speak up; what is it?\u201d \u201cThat's you, Bill,\u201d returned Black Dog, \u201cyou're in the right of it, Billy. I'll have a glass of rum from this dear child here, as I've took such a liking to; and we'll sit down, if you please, and talk square, like old shipmates.\u201d When I returned with the rum, they were already seated on either side of the captain's breakfast-table--Black Dog next to the door and sitting sideways so as to have one eye on his old shipmate and one, as I thought, on his retreat. He bade me go and leave the door wide open."], "The sailor who hires Jim tells him to look out for a ___ man.": [" \u201cAnd now,\u201d added the doctor, \u201cJim may come on board with us, may he not?\u201d \u201cTo be sure he may,\u201d says squire. \u201cTake your hat, Hawkins, and we'll see the ship.\u201d 9 Powder and Arms THE HISPANIOLA lay some way out, and we went under the figureheads and round the sterns of many other ships, and their cables sometimes grated underneath our keel, and sometimes swung above us. At last, however, we got alongside, and were met and saluted as we stepped aboard by the mate, Mr. Arrow, a brown old sailor with earrings in his ears and a squint. He and the squire were very thick and friendly, but I soon observed that things were not the same between Mr. Trelawney and the captain. This last was a sharp-looking man who seemed angry with everything on board and was soon to tell us why, for we had hardly got down into the cabin when a sailor followed us. \u201cCaptain Smollett, sir, axing to speak with you,\u201d said he.", " \u201cWell, Jim, three years have I been here, and not a bite of Christian diet from that day to this. But now, you look here; look at me. Do I look like a man before the mast? No, says you. Nor I weren't, neither, I says.\u201d And with that he winked and pinched me hard. \u201cJust you mention them words to your squire, Jim,\u201d he went on. \u201cNor he weren't, neither--that's the words. Three years he were the man of this island, light and dark, fair and rain; and sometimes he would maybe think upon a prayer (says you), and sometimes he would maybe think of his old mother, so be as she's alive (you'll say); but the most part of Gunn's time (this is what you'll say)--the most part of his time was took up with another matter. And then you'll give him a nip, like I do.\u201d And he pinched me again in the most confidential manner. \u201cThen,\u201d he continued, \u201cthen you'll up, and you'll say this: Gunn is a good man (you'll say), and he puts a precious sight more confidence--a precious sight, mind that--in a gen'leman born than in these gen'leman of fortune, having been one hisself.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cI don't understand one word that you've been saying.", " \u201cAh, he'd be a lucky one as knowed that!\u201d \u201cYou'll perhaps batten down your hatches till you're spoke to, my friend,\u201d cried Silver truculently to this speaker. And then, in his first gracious tones, he replied to me, \u201cYesterday morning, Mr. Hawkins,\u201d said he, \u201cin the dog-watch, down came Doctor Livesey with a flag of truce. Says he, 'Cap'n Silver, you're sold out. Ship's gone.' Well, maybe we'd been taking a glass, and a song to help it round. I won't say no. Leastways, none of us had looked out. We looked out, and by thunder, the old ship was gone! I never seen a pack o' fools look fishier; and you may lay to that, if I tells you that looked the fishiest. 'Well,' says the doctor, 'let's bargain.' We bargained, him and I, and here we are: stores, brandy, block house, the firewood you was thoughtful enough to cut, and in a manner of speaking, the whole blessed boat, from cross-trees to kelson.", " He was very tall and strong, with a face as big as a ham--plain and pale, but intelligent and smiling. Indeed, he seemed in the most cheerful spirits, whistling as he moved about among the tables, with a merry word or a slap on the shoulder for the more favoured of his guests. Now, to tell you the truth, from the very first mention of Long John in Squire Trelawney's letter I had taken a fear in my mind that he might prove to be the very one-legged sailor whom I had watched for so long at the old Benbow. But one look at the man before me was enough. I had seen the captain, and Black Dog, and the blind man, Pew, and I thought I knew what a buccaneer was like--a very different creature, according to me, from this clean and pleasant-tempered landlord. I plucked up courage at once, crossed the threshold, and walked right up to the man where he stood, propped on his crutch, talking to a customer."], "What happens to Billy Bones as he is attempting to kill Black Dog with his sword?": [" The captain made a sort of gasp. \u201cBlack Dog!\u201d said he. \u201cAnd who else?\u201d returned the other, getting more at his ease. \u201cBlack Dog as ever was, come for to see his old shipmate Billy, at the Admiral Benbow inn. Ah, Bill, Bill, we have seen a sight of times, us two, since I lost them two talons,\u201d holding up his mutilated hand. \u201cNow, look here,\u201d said the captain; \u201cyou've run me down; here I am; well, then, speak up; what is it?\u201d \u201cThat's you, Bill,\u201d returned Black Dog, \u201cyou're in the right of it, Billy. I'll have a glass of rum from this dear child here, as I've took such a liking to; and we'll sit down, if you please, and talk square, like old shipmates.\u201d When I returned with the rum, they were already seated on either side of the captain's breakfast-table--Black Dog next to the door and sitting sideways so as to have one eye on his old shipmate and one, as I thought, on his retreat. He bade me go and leave the door wide open.", " First he recognized the doctor with an unmistakable frown; then his glance fell upon me, and he looked relieved. But suddenly his colour changed, and he tried to raise himself, crying, \u201cWhere's Black Dog?\u201d \u201cThere is no Black Dog here,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cexcept what you have on your own back. You have been drinking rum; you have had a stroke, precisely as I told you; and I have just, very much against my own will, dragged you headforemost out of the grave. Now, Mr. Bones--\u201d \u201cThat's not my name,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cMuch I care,\u201d returned the doctor. \u201cIt's the name of a buccaneer of my acquaintance; and I call you by it for the sake of shortness, and what I have to say to you is this; one glass of rum won't kill you, but if you take one you'll take another and another, and I stake my wig if you don't break off short, you'll die--do you understand that?--die, and go to your own place, like the man in the Bible.", " \u201cJim,\u201d he said at length, \u201cyou saw that seafaring man today?\u201d \u201cBlack Dog?\u201d I asked. \u201cAh!

Well, then, you get on a horse, and go to--well, yes, I will!--to that eternal doctor swab, and tell him to pipe all hands--magistrates and sich--and he'll lay 'em aboard at the Admiral Benbow--all old Flint's crew, man and boy, all on 'em that's left. I was first mate, I was, old Flint's first mate, and I'm the on'y one as knows the place. He gave it me at Savannah, when he lay a-dying, like as if I was to now, you see.

My father was always saying the inn would be ruined, for people would soon cease coming there to be tyrannized over and put down, and sent shivering to their beds; but I really believe his presence did us good.

Then there followed a great to-do through all our old inn, heavy feet pounding to and fro, furniture thrown over, doors kicked in, until the very rocks re-echoed and the men came out again, one after another, on the road and declared that we were nowhere to be found.

It was just at sundown when we cast anchor in a most beautiful land-locked gulf, and were immediately surrounded by shore boats full of Negroes and Mexican Indians and half-bloods selling fruits and vegetables and offering to dive for bits of money. The sight of so many good-humoured faces (especially the blacks), the taste of the tropical fruits, and above all the lights that began to shine in the town made a most charming contrast to our dark and bloody sojourn on the island; and the doctor and the squire, taking me along with them, went ashore to pass the early part of the night.

At this I had a happy inspiration.

When we were about half-way through, I suddenly put my hand upon her arm, for I had heard in the silent frosty air a sound that brought my heart into my mouth--the tap-tapping of the blind man's stick upon the frozen road.", " The captain made a sort of gasp. \u201cBlack Dog!\u201d said he. \u201cAnd who else?\u201d returned the other, getting more at his ease. \u201cBlack Dog as ever was, come for to see his old shipmate Billy, at the Admiral Benbow inn. Ah, Bill, Bill, we have seen a sight of times, us two, since I lost them two talons,\u201d holding up his mutilated hand. \u201cNow, look here,\u201d said the captain; \u201cyou've run me down; here I am; well, then, speak up; what is it?\u201d \u201cThat's you, Bill,\u201d returned Black Dog, \u201cyou're in the right of it, Billy. I'll have a glass of rum from this dear child here, as I've took such a liking to; and we'll sit down, if you please, and talk square, like old shipmates.\u201d When I returned with the rum, they were already seated on either side of the captain's breakfast-table--Black Dog next to the door and sitting sideways so as to have one eye on his old shipmate and one, as I thought, on his retreat. He bade me go and leave the door wide open."], "Where does Jim find Dr. Livesey after deciding to show him Billy\u2019s papers?": [" Captain Smollett, the squire, and Dr. Livesey were talking together on the quarter-deck, and anxious as I was to tell them my story, I durst not interrupt them openly. While I was still casting about in my thoughts to find some probable excuse, Dr. Livesey called me to his side. He had left his pipe below, and being a slave to tobacco, had meant that I should fetch it; but as soon as I was near enough to speak and not to be overheard, I broke immediately, \u201cDoctor, let me speak. Get the captain and squire down to the cabin, and then make some pretence to send for me. I have terrible news.\u201d The doctor changed countenance a little, but next moment he was master of himself. \u201cThank you, Jim,\u201d said he quite loudly, \u201cthat was all I wanted to know,\u201d as if he had asked me a question. And with that he turned on his heel and rejoined the other two. They spoke together for a little, and though none of them started, or raised his voice, or so much as whistled, it was plain enough that Dr. Livesey had communicated my request, for the next thing that I heard was the captain giving an order to Job Anderson, and all hands were piped on deck.", " 6 The Captain's Papers WE rode hard all the way till we drew up before Dr. Livesey's door. The house was all dark to the front. Mr. Dance told me to jump down and knock, and Dogger gave me a stirrup to descend by. The door was opened almost at once by the maid. \u201cIs Dr. Livesey in?\u201d I asked. No, she said, he had come home in the afternoon but had gone up to the hall to dine and pass the evening with the squire. \u201cSo there we go, boys,\u201d said Mr. Dance. This time, as the distance was short, I did not mount, but ran with Dogger's stirrup-leather to the lodge gates and up the long, leafless, moonlit avenue to where the white line of the hall buildings looked on either hand on great old gardens. Here Mr. Dance dismounted, and taking me along with him, was admitted at a word into the house. The servant led us down a matted passage and showed us at the end into a great library, all lined with bookcases and busts upon the top of them, where the squire and Dr. Livesey sat, pipe in hand, on either side of a bright fire.", " \u201cWell, and where are they now? Pew was that sort, and he died a beggar-man. Flint was, and he died of rum at Savannah. Ah, they was a sweet crew, they was! On'y, where are they?\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d asked Dick, \u201cwhen we do lay 'em athwart, what are we to do with 'em, anyhow?\u201d \u201cThere's the man for me!\u201d cried the cook admiringly. \u201cThat's what I call business. Well, what would you think? Put 'em ashore like maroons? That would have been England's way. Or cut 'em down like that much pork? That would have been Flint's, or Billy Bones's.\u201d \u201cBilly was the man for that,\u201d said Israel. \u201c'Dead men don't bite,' says he. Well, he's dead now hisself; he knows the long and short on it now; and if ever a rough hand come to port, it was Billy.\u201d \u201cRight you are,\u201d said Silver; \u201crough and ready. But mark you here, I'm an easy man--I'm quite the gentleman, says you; but this time it's serious. Dooty is dooty, mates. I give my vote--death.", " But I'll go as far with you as I dare go, and a step beyond, for I'll have my wig sorted by the captain or I'm mistaken! And first, I'll give you a bit of hope; Silver, if we both get alive out of this wolf-trap, I'll do my best to save you, short of perjury.\u201d Silver's face was radiant. \u201cYou couldn't say more, I'm sure, sir, not if you was my mother,\u201d he cried. \u201cWell, that's my first concession,\u201d added the doctor. \u201cMy second is a piece of advice: keep the boy close beside you, and when you need help, halloo. I'm off to seek it for you, and that itself will show you if I speak at random. Good-bye, Jim.\u201d And Dr. Livesey shook hands with me through the stockade, nodded to Silver, and set off at a brisk pace into the wood. 31 The Treasure-hunt--Flint's Pointer \u201cJIM,\u201d said Silver when we were alone, \u201cif I saved your life, you saved mine; and I'll not forget it. I seen the doctor waving you to run for it--with the tail of my eye, I did; and I seen you say no, as plain as hearing."], "Trelawney and Livesey plan for Jim to be a/an ___ in their expedition to recover Flint\u2019s treasure.": [" And, Jim\u201d--looking all round him and lowering his voice to a whisper--\u201cI'm rich.\u201d I now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude, and I suppose I must have shown the feeling in my face, for he repeated the statement hotly: \u201cRich! Rich! I says. And I'll tell you what: I'll make a man of you, Jim. Ah, Jim, you'll bless your stars, you will, you was the first that found me!\u201d And at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face, and he tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly before my eyes. \u201cNow, Jim, you tell me true: that ain't Flint's ship?\u201d he asked. At this I had a happy inspiration. I began to believe that I had found an ally, and I answered him at once. \u201cIt's not Flint's ship, and Flint is dead; but I'll tell you true, as you ask me--there are some of Flint's hands aboard; worse luck for the rest of us.\u201d \u201cNot a man--with one--leg?\u201d he gasped.", " You don't, you say, like this cruise. Now, why?\u201d \u201cI was engaged, sir, on what we call sealed orders, to sail this ship for that gentleman where he should bid me,\u201d said the captain. \u201cSo far so good. But now I find that every man before the mast knows more than I do. I don't call that fair, now, do you?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Dr. Livesey, \u201cI don't.\u201d \u201cNext,\u201d said the captain, \u201cI learn we are going after treasure--hear it from my own hands, mind you. Now, treasure is ticklish work; I don't like treasure voyages on any account, and I don't like them, above all, when they are secret and when (begging your pardon, Mr. Trelawney) the secret has been told to the parrot.\u201d \u201cSilver's parrot?\u201d asked the squire. \u201cIt's a way of speaking,\u201d said the captain. \u201cBlabbed, I mean. It's my belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about, but I'll tell you my way of it--life or death, and a close run.\u201d \u201cThat is all clear, and, I dare say, true enough,\u201d replied Dr. Livesey.", " \u201cSquire,\u201d said he, \u201cwhen Dance has had his ale he must, of course, be off on his Majesty's service; but I mean to keep Jim Hawkins here to sleep at my house, and with your permission, I propose we should have up the cold pie and let him sup.\u201d \u201cAs you will, Livesey,\u201d said the squire; \u201cHawkins has earned better than cold pie.\u201d So a big pigeon pie was brought in and put on a sidetable, and I made a hearty supper, for I was as hungry as a hawk, while Mr. Dance was further complimented and at last dismissed. \u201cAnd now, squire,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cAnd now, Livesey,\u201d said the squire in the same breath. \u201cOne at a time, one at a time,\u201d laughed Dr. Livesey. \u201cYou have heard of this Flint, I suppose?\u201d \u201cHeard of him!\u201d cried the squire. \u201cHeard of him, you say! He was the bloodthirstiest buccaneer that sailed. Blackbeard was a child to Flint. The Spaniards were so prodigiously afraid of him that, I tell you, sir, I was sometimes proud he was an Englishman.", " So it was with the CASSANDRA, as brought us all safe home from Malabar, after England took the viceroy of the Indies; so it was with the old WALRUS, Flint's old ship, as I've seen amuck with the red blood and fit to sink with gold.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d cried another voice, that of the youngest hand on board, and evidently full of admiration. \u201cHe was the flower of the flock, was Flint!\u201d \u201cDavis was a man too, by all accounts,\u201d said Silver. \u201cI never sailed along of him; first with England, then with Flint, that's my story; and now here on my own account, in a manner of speaking. I laid by nine hundred safe, from England, and two thousand after Flint. That ain't bad for a man before the mast--all safe in bank. 'Tain't earning now, it's saving does it, you may lay to that. Where's all England's men now? I dunno. Where's Flint's? Why, most on 'em aboard here, and glad to get the duff--been begging before that, some on 'em."], "Who does Trelawney hire as the ship\u2019s cook?": [" The boatswain, Job Anderson, was the likeliest man aboard, and though he kept his old title, he served in a way as mate. Mr. Trelawney had followed the sea, and his knowledge made him very useful, for he often took a watch himself in easy weather. And the coxswain, Israel Hands, was a careful, wily, old, experienced seaman who could be trusted at a pinch with almost anything. He was a great confidant of Long John Silver, and so the mention of his name leads me on to speak of our ship's cook, Barbecue, as the men called him. Aboard ship he carried his crutch by a lanyard round his neck, to have both hands as free as possible. It was something to see him wedge the foot of the crutch against a bulkhead, and propped against it, yielding to every movement of the ship, get on with his cooking like someone safe ashore. Still more strange was it to see him in the heaviest of weather cross the deck.", " But the worst of it was that with the course I now held we turned our broadside instead of our stern to the HISPANIOLA and offered a target like a barn door. I could hear as well as see that brandy-faced rascal Israel Hands plumping down a round-shot on the deck. \u201cWho's the best shot?\u201d asked the captain. \u201cMr. Trelawney, out and away,\u201d said I. \u201cMr. Trelawney, will you please pick me off one of these men, sir? Hands, if possible,\u201d said the captain. Trelawney was as cool as steel. He looked to the priming of his gun. \u201cNow,\u201d cried the captain, \u201ceasy with that gun, sir, or you'll swamp the boat. All hands stand by to trim her when he aims.\u201d The squire raised his gun, the rowing ceased, and we leaned over to the other side to keep the balance, and all was so nicely contrived that we did not ship a drop. They had the gun, by this time, slewed round upon the swivel, and Hands, who was at the muzzle with the rammer, was in consequence the most exposed.", " \u201cWhy, by the powers,\u201d cried Long John, \u201cif we do, we'll miss the morning tide!\u201d \u201cMy orders!\u201d said the captain shortly. \u201cYou may go below, my man. Hands will want supper.\u201d \u201cAye, aye, sir,\u201d answered the cook, and touching his forelock, he disappeared at once in the direction of his galley. \u201cThat's a good man, captain,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cVery likely, sir,\u201d replied Captain Smollett. \u201cEasy with that, men--easy,\u201d he ran on, to the fellows who were shifting the powder; and then suddenly observing me examining the swivel we carried amidships, a long brass nine, \u201cHere you, ship's boy,\u201d he cried, \u201cout o' that! Off with you to the cook and get some work.\u201d And then as I was hurrying off I heard him say, quite loudly, to the doctor, \u201cI'll have no favourites on my ship.\u201d I assure you I was quite of the squire's way of thinking, and hated the captain deeply. 10 The Voyage ALL that night we were in a great bustle getting things stowed in their place, and boatfuls of the squire's friends, Mr. Blandly and the like, coming off to wish him a good voyage and a safe return.", " \u201cYou had better sit down.\u201d \u201cYou ain't a-going to let me inside, cap'n?\u201d complained Long John. \u201cIt's a main cold morning, to be sure, sir, to sit outside upon the sand.\u201d \u201cWhy, Silver,\u201d said the captain, \u201cif you had pleased to be an honest man, you might have been sitting in your galley. It's your own doing. You're either my ship's cook--and then you were treated handsome--or Cap'n Silver, a common mutineer and pirate, and then you can go hang!\u201d \u201cWell, well, cap'n,\u201d returned the sea-cook, sitting down as he was bidden on the sand, \u201cyou'll have to give me a hand up again, that's all. A sweet pretty place you have of it here. Ah, there's Jim! The top of the morning to you, Jim. Doctor, here's my service. Why, there you all are together like a happy family, in a manner of speaking.\u201d \u201cIf you have anything to say, my man, better say it,\u201d said the captain. \u201cRight you were, Cap'n Smollett,\u201d replied Silver."], "From what city does Trelawney\u2019s ship, the Hispaniola, sail?": [" And I was going to sea myself, to sea in a schooner, with a piping boatswain and pig-tailed singing seamen, to sea, bound for an unknown island, and to seek for buried treasure! While I was still in this delightful dream, we came suddenly in front of a large inn and met Squire Trelawney, all dressed out like a sea-officer, in stout blue cloth, coming out of the door with a smile on his face and a capital imitation of a sailor's walk. \u201cHere you are,\u201d he cried, \u201cand the doctor came last night from London. Bravo! The ship's company complete!\u201d \u201cOh, sir,\u201d cried I, \u201cwhen do we sail?\u201d \u201cSail!\u201d says he. \u201cWe sail tomorrow!\u201d 8 At the Sign of the Spy-glass WHEN I had done breakfasting the squire gave me a note addressed to John Silver, at the sign of the Spy-glass, and told me I should easily find the place by following the line of the docks and keeping a bright lookout for a little tavern with a large brass telescope for sign.", " The sight of the trees so near at hand had almost made me sick with longing, but the current had soon carried me past the point, and as the next reach of sea opened out, I beheld a sight that changed the nature of my thoughts. Right in front of me, not half a mile away, I beheld the HISPANIOLA under sail. I made sure, of course, that I should be taken; but I was so distressed for want of water that I scarce knew whether to be glad or sorry at the thought, and long before I had come to a conclusion, surprise had taken entire possession of my mind and I could do nothing but stare and wonder. The HISPANIOLA was under her main-sail and two jibs, and the beautiful white canvas shone in the sun like snow or silver. When I first sighted her, all her sails were drawing; she was lying a course about north-west, and I presumed the men on board were going round the island on their way back to the anchorage.", " Well, HE'S dead now, he is--as dead as bilge; and who's to sail this ship, I don't see. Without I gives you a hint, you ain't that man, as far's I can tell. Now, look here, you gives me food and drink and a old scarf or ankecher to tie my wound up, you do, and I'll tell you how to sail her, and that's about square all round, I take it.\u201d \u201cI'll tell you one thing,\u201d says I: \u201cI'm not going back to Captain Kidd's anchorage. I mean to get into North Inlet and beach her quietly there.\u201d \u201cTo be sure you did,\u201d he cried. \u201cWhy, I ain't sich an infernal lubber after all. I can see, can't I? I've tried my fling, I have, and I've lost, and it's you has the wind of me. North Inlet? Why, I haven't no ch'ice, not I! I'd help you sail her up to Execution Dock, by thunder! So I would.\u201d Well, as it seemed to me, there was some sense in this. We struck our bargain on the spot. In three minutes I had the HISPANIOLA sailing easily before the wind along the coast of Treasure Island, with good hopes of turning the northern point ere noon and beating down again as far as North Inlet before high water, when we might beach her safely and wait till the subsiding tide permitted us to land.", " If you won't, my name is Alexander Smollett, I've flown my sovereign's colours, and I'll see you all to Davy Jones. You can't find the treasure. You can't sail the ship--there's not a man among you fit to sail the ship. You can't fight us--Gray, there, got away from five of you. Your ship's in irons, Master Silver; you're on a lee shore, and so you'll find. I stand here and tell you so; and they're the last good words you'll get from me, for in the name of heaven, I'll put a bullet in your back when next I meet you. Tramp, my lad. Bundle out of this, please, hand over hand, and double quick.\u201d Silver's face was a picture; his eyes started in his head with wrath. He shook the fire out of his pipe. \u201cGive me a hand up!\u201d he cried. \u201cNot I,\u201d returned the captain. \u201cWho'll give me a hand up?\u201d he roared. Not a man among us moved. Growling the foulest imprecations, he crawled along the sand till he got hold of the porch and could hoist himself again upon his crutch."], "Who speaks openly about his dislike of the crew and his bad feeling about the voyage?": [" But soon the anchor was short up; soon it was hanging dripping at the bows; soon the sails began to draw, and the land and shipping to flit by on either side; and before I could lie down to snatch an hour of slumber the HISPANIOLA had begun her voyage to the Isle of Treasure. I am not going to relate that voyage in detail. It was fairly prosperous. The ship proved to be a good ship, the crew were capable seamen, and the captain thoroughly understood his business. But before we came the length of Treasure Island, two or three things had happened which require to be known. Mr. Arrow, first of all, turned out even worse than the captain had feared. He had no command among the men, and people did what they pleased with him. But that was by no means the worst of it, for after a day or two at sea he began to appear on deck with hazy eye, red cheeks, stuttering tongue, and other marks of drunkenness.", " \u201cWhy, by the powers,\u201d cried Long John, \u201cif we do, we'll miss the morning tide!\u201d \u201cMy orders!\u201d said the captain shortly. \u201cYou may go below, my man.

Then you can talk.\u201d \u201cThanky, George,\u201d replied the sea-cook. \u201cYou always was brisk for business, and has the rules by heart, George, as I'm pleased to see. Well, what is it, anyway? Ah! 'Deposed'--that's it, is it? Very pretty wrote, to be sure; like print, I swear. Your hand o' write, George? Why, you was gettin' quite a leadin' man in this here crew.

Thither we had now to walk, and our way, to my great delight, lay along the quays and beside the great multitude of ships of all sizes and rigs and nations. In one, sailors were singing at their work, in another there were men aloft, high over my head, hanging to threads that seemed no thicker than a spider's. Though I had lived by the shore all my life, I seemed never to have been near the sea till then. The smell of tar and salt was something new. I saw the most wonderful figureheads, that had all been far over the ocean. I saw, besides, many old sailors, with rings in their ears, and whiskers curled in ringlets, and tarry pigtails, and their swaggering, clumsy sea-walk; and if I had seen as many kings or archbishops I could not have been more delighted.", " I could tell the direction of the speakers pretty exactly, not only by the sound of their voices but by the behaviour of the few birds that still hung in alarm above the heads of the intruders. Crawling on all fours, I made steadily but slowly towards them, till at last, raising my head to an aperture among the leaves, I could see clear down into a little green dell beside the marsh, and closely set about with trees, where Long John Silver and another of the crew stood face to face in conversation. The sun beat full upon them. Silver had thrown his hat beside him on the ground, and his great, smooth, blond face, all shining with heat, was lifted to the other man's in a kind of appeal. \u201cMate,\u201d he was saying, \u201cit's because I thinks gold dust of you--gold dust, and you may lay to that!

But, see here, Jim--tit for tat--you save Long John from swinging.\u201d I was bewildered; it seemed a thing so hopeless he was asking--he, the old buccaneer, the ringleader throughout. \u201cWhat I can do, that I'll do,\u201d I said."], "What feature is missing from the copy of the treasure map that Jim sees Smollett using?": [" \u201cVery good,\u201d said the captain. \u201cThen, as you've heard me very patiently, saying things that I could not prove, hear me a few words more. They are putting the powder and the arms in the fore hold. Now, you have a good place under the cabin; why not put them there?--first point. Then, you are bringing four of your own people with you, and they tell me some of them are to be berthed forward. Why not give them the berths here beside the cabin?--second point.\u201d \u201cAny more?\u201d asked Mr. Trelawney. \u201cOne more,\u201d said the captain. \u201cThere's been too much blabbing already.\u201d \u201cFar too much,\u201d agreed the doctor. \u201cI'll tell you what I've heard myself,\u201d continued Captain Smollett: \u201cthat you have a map of an island, that there's crosses on the map to show where treasure is, and that the island lies--\u201d And then he named the latitude and longitude exactly. \u201cI never told that,\u201d cried the squire, \u201cto a soul!\u201d \u201cThe hands know it, sir,\u201d returned the captain.", " This was not the map we found in Billy Bones's chest, but an accurate copy, complete in all things--names and heights and soundings--with the single exception of the red crosses and the written notes. Sharp as must have been his annoyance, Silver had the strength of mind to hide it. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d said he, \u201cthis is the spot, to be sure, and very prettily drawed out. Who might have done that, I wonder? The pirates were too ignorant, I reckon. Aye, here it is: 'Capt. Kidd's Anchorage'--just the name my shipmate called it. There's a strong current runs along the south, and then away nor'ard up the west coast. Right you was, sir,\u201d says he, \u201cto haul your wind and keep the weather of the island. Leastways, if such was your intention as to enter and careen, and there ain't no better place for that in these waters.\u201d \u201cThank you, my man,\u201d says Captain Smollett. \u201cI'll ask you later on to give us a help.", " \u201cWell now, if you want to know, I'll tell you when. The last moment I can manage, and that's when. Here's a first-rate seaman, Cap'n Smollett, sails the blessed ship for us. Here's this squire and doctor with a map and such--I don't know where it is, do I? No more do you, says you. Well then, I mean this squire and doctor shall find the stuff, and help us to get it aboard, by the powers. Then we'll see. If I was sure of you all, sons of double Dutchmen, I'd have Cap'n Smollett navigate us half-way back again before I struck.\u201d \u201cWhy, we're all seamen aboard here, I should think,\u201d said the lad Dick. \u201cWe're all forecastle hands, you mean,\u201d snapped Silver. \u201cWe can steer a course, but who's to set one? That's what all you gentlemen split on, first and last. If I had my way, I'd have Cap'n Smollett work us back into the trades at least; then we'd have no blessed miscalculations and a spoonful of water a day.", " \u201cSo, Jim,\u201d said the doctor sadly, \u201chere you are. As you have brewed, so shall you drink, my boy. Heaven knows, I cannot find it in my heart to blame you, but this much I will say, be it kind or unkind: when Captain Smollett was well, you dared not have gone off; and when he was ill and couldn't help it, by George, it was downright cowardly!\u201d I will own that I here began to weep. \u201cDoctor,\u201d I said, \u201cyou might spare me. I have blamed myself enough; my life's forfeit anyway, and I should have been dead by now if Silver hadn't stood for me; and doctor, believe this, I can die--and I dare say I deserve it--but what I fear is torture. If they come to torture me--\u201d \u201cJim,\u201d the doctor interrupted, and his voice was quite changed, \u201cJim, I can't have this. Whip over, and we'll run for it.\u201d \u201cDoctor,\u201d said I, \u201cI passed my word.\u201d \u201cI know, I know,\u201d he cried. \u201cWe can't help that, Jim, now. I'll take it on my shoulders, holus bolus, blame and shame, my boy; but stay here, I cannot let you."], "Who notices that Jim has hidden in one of the pirate\u2019s boats and is catching a ride to the island?": [" Perhaps it was this--perhaps it was the look of the island, with its grey, melancholy woods, and wild stone spires, and the surf that we could both see and hear foaming and thundering on the steep beach--at least, although the sun shone bright and hot, and the shore birds were fishing and crying all around us, and you would have thought anyone would have been glad to get to land after being so long at sea, my heart sank, as the saying is, into my boots; and from the first look onward, I hated the very thought of Treasure Island. We had a dreary morning's work before us, for there was no sign of any wind, and the boats had to be got out and manned, and the ship warped three or four miles round the corner of the island and up the narrow passage to the haven behind Skeleton Island. I volunteered for one of the boats, where I had, of course, no business. The heat was sweltering, and the men grumbled fiercely over their work.", " \u201cYou had better sit down.\u201d \u201cYou ain't a-going to let me inside, cap'n?\u201d complained Long John. \u201cIt's a main cold morning, to be sure, sir, to sit outside upon the sand.\u201d \u201cWhy, Silver,\u201d said the captain, \u201cif you had pleased to be an honest man, you might have been sitting in your galley. It's your own doing. You're either my ship's cook--and then you were treated handsome--or Cap'n Silver, a common mutineer and pirate, and then you can go hang!\u201d \u201cWell, well, cap'n,\u201d returned the sea-cook, sitting down as he was bidden on the sand, \u201cyou'll have to give me a hand up again, that's all. A sweet pretty place you have of it here. Ah, there's Jim! The top of the morning to you, Jim. Doctor, here's my service. Why, there you all are together like a happy family, in a manner of speaking.\u201d \u201cIf you have anything to say, my man, better say it,\u201d said the captain. \u201cRight you were, Cap'n Smollett,\u201d replied Silver.", " \u201cCut me a junk o' that,\u201d says he, \u201cfor I haven't no knife and hardly strength enough, so be as I had. Ah, Jim, Jim, I reckon I've missed stays!

You've broken your trust; you've lived in sin and lies and blood; there's a man you killed lying at your feet this moment, and you ask me why! For God's mercy, Mr. Hands, that's why.\u201d I spoke with a little heat, thinking of the bloody dirk he had hidden in his pocket and designed, in his ill thoughts, to end me with. He, for his part, took a great draught of the wine and spoke with the most unusual solemnity. \u201cFor thirty years,\u201d he said, \u201cI've sailed the seas and seen good and bad, better and worse, fair weather and foul, provisions running out, knives going, and what not.", " There's only one man I'm afraid of.\u201d \u201cAnd who's that?\u201d cried the squire. \u201cName the dog, sir!\u201d \u201cYou,\u201d replied the doctor; \u201cfor you cannot hold your tongue. We are not the only men who know of this paper. These fellows who attacked the inn tonight--bold, desperate blades, for sure--and the rest who stayed aboard that lugger, and more, I dare say, not far off, are, one and all, through thick and thin, bound that they'll get that money. We must none of us go alone till we get to sea. Jim and I shall stick together in the meanwhile; you'll take Joyce and Hunter when you ride to Bristol, and from first to last, not one of us must breathe a word of what we've found.\u201d \u201cLivesey,\u201d returned the squire, \u201cyou are always in the right of it.

Maybe you thought you was cap'n here, perhaps. By the powers, but I'll teach you better! Cross me, and you'll go where many a good man's gone before you, first and last, these thirty year back--some to the yard-arm, shiver my timbers, and some by the board, and all to feed the fishes. There's never a man looked me between the eyes and seen a good day a'terwards, Tom Morgan, you may lay to that.\u201d Morgan paused, but a hoarse murmur rose from the others. \u201cTom's right,\u201d said one. \u201cI stood hazing long enough from one,\u201d added another. \u201cI'll be hanged if I'll be hazed by you, John Silver.\u201d \u201cDid any of you gentlemen want to have it out with ME?\u201d roared Silver, bending far forward from his position on the keg, with his pipe still glowing in his right hand. \u201cPut a name on what you're at; you ain't dumb, I reckon. Him that wants shall get it. Have I lived this many years, and a son of a rum puncheon cock his hat athwart my hawse at the latter end of it?", " In half a minute he had reached the port scuppers and picked, out of a coil of rope, a long knife, or rather a short dirk, discoloured to the hilt with blood. He looked upon it for a moment, thrusting forth his under jaw, tried the point upon his hand, and then, hastily concealing it in the bosom of his jacket, trundled back again into his old place against the bulwark. This was all that I required to know. Israel could move about, he was now armed, and if he had been at so much trouble to get rid of me, it was plain that I was meant to be the victim. What he would do afterwards--whether he would try to crawl right across the island from North Inlet to the camp among the swamps or whether he would fire Long Tom, trusting that his own comrades might come first to help him--was, of course, more than I could say. Yet I felt sure that I could trust him in one point, since in that our interests jumped together, and that was in the disposition of the schooner.", " The doctor had to go to London for a physician to take charge of his practice; the squire was hard at work at Bristol; and I lived on at the hall under the charge of old Redruth, the gamekeeper, almost a prisoner, but full of sea-dreams and the most charming anticipations of strange islands and adventures. I brooded by the hour together over the map, all the details of which I well remembered. Sitting by the fire in the housekeeper's room, I approached that island in my fancy from every possible direction; I explored every acre of its surface; I climbed a thousand times to that tall hill they call the Spy-glass, and from the top enjoyed the most wonderful and changing prospects. Sometimes the isle was thick with savages, with whom we fought, sometimes full of dangerous animals that hunted us, but in all my fancies nothing occurred to me so strange and tragic as our actual adventures. So the weeks passed on, till one fine day there came a letter addressed to Dr. Livesey, with this addition, \u201cTo be opened, in the case of his absence, by Tom Redruth or young Hawkins.\u201d Obeying this order, we found, or rather I found--for the gamekeeper was a poor hand at reading anything but print--the following important news: Old Anchor Inn, Bristol, March 1, 17-- Dear Livesey--As I do not know whether you are at the hall or still in London, I send this in double to both places.", " Our chimney was a square hole in the roof; it was but a little part of the smoke that found its way out, and the rest eddied about the house and kept us coughing and piping the eye. Add to this that Gray, the new man, had his face tied up in a bandage for a cut he had got in breaking away from the mutineers and that poor old Tom Redruth, still unburied, lay along the wall, stiff and stark, under the Union Jack. If we had been allowed to sit idle, we should all have fallen in the blues, but Captain Smollett was never the man for that. All hands were called up before him, and he divided us into watches. The doctor and Gray and I for one; the squire, Hunter, and Joyce upon the other. Tired though we all were, two were sent out for firewood; two more were set to dig a grave for Redruth; the doctor was named cook; I was put sentry at the door; and the captain himself went from one to another, keeping up our spirits and lending a hand wherever it was wanted."], "What does Silver throw at Tom\u2019s back when Tom refuses to join the mutiny?": [" \u201cAvast, there!\u201d cried Silver. \u201cWho are you, Tom Morgan?

Perhaps you don't happen to rightly know who you was speaking to, perhaps? Come, now, what was he jawing--v'yages, cap'ns, ships? Pipe up! What was it?\u201d \u201cWe was a-talkin' of keel-hauling,\u201d answered Morgan. \u201cKeel-hauling, was you? And a mighty suitable thing, too, and you may lay to that. Get back to your place for a lubber, Tom.\u201d And then, as Morgan rolled back to his seat, Silver added to me in a confidential whisper that was very flattering, as I thought, \u201cHe's quite an honest man, Tom Morgan, on'y stupid. And now,\u201d he ran on again, aloud, \u201clet's see--Black Dog? No, I don't know the name, not I. Yet I kind of think I've--yes, I've seen the swab. He used to come here with a blind beggar, he used.\u201d \u201cThat he did, you may be sure,\u201d said I.", " He was stone dead--shot through the heart. We began to rejoice over our good success when just at that moment a pistol cracked in the bush, a ball whistled close past my ear, and poor Tom Redruth stumbled and fell his length on the ground. Both the squire and I returned the shot, but as we had nothing to aim at, it is probable we only wasted powder. Then we reloaded and turned our attention to poor Tom. The captain and Gray were already examining him, and I saw with half an eye that all was over. I believe the readiness of our return volley had scattered the mutineers once more, for we were suffered without further molestation to get the poor old gamekeeper hoisted over the stockade and carried, groaning and bleeding, into the log-house. Poor old fellow, he had not uttered one word of surprise, complaint, fear, or even acquiescence from the very beginning of our troubles till now, when we had laid him down in the log-house to die.", " When I came again to myself the monster had pulled himself together, his crutch under his arm, his hat upon his head. Just before him Tom lay motionless upon the sward; but the murderer minded him not a whit, cleansing his blood-stained knife the while upon a wisp of grass. Everything else was unchanged, the sun still shining mercilessly on the steaming marsh and the tall pinnacle of the mountain, and I could scarce persuade myself that murder had been actually done and a human life cruelly cut short a moment since before my eyes. But now John put his hand into his pocket, brought out a whistle, and blew upon it several modulated blasts that rang far across the heated air. I could not tell, of course, the meaning of the signal, but it instantly awoke my fears. More men would be coming. I might be discovered. They had already slain two of the honest people; after Tom and Alan, might not I come next?"], "While fleeing the pirates, who does Jim find in the woods of the island?": [" If the mutineers succeeded in crossing the stockade, he argued, they would take possession of any unprotected loophole and shoot us down like rats in our own stronghold. Nor had we much time left to us for thought. Suddenly, with a loud huzza, a little cloud of pirates leaped from the woods on the north side and ran straight on the stockade. At the same moment, the fire was once more opened from the woods, and a rifle ball sang through the doorway and knocked the doctor's musket into bits. The boarders swarmed over the fence like monkeys. Squire and Gray fired again and yet again; three men fell, one forwards into the enclosure, two back on the outside. But of these, one was evidently more frightened than hurt, for he was on his feet again in a crack and instantly disappeared among the trees. Two had bit the dust, one had fled, four had made good their footing inside our defences, while from the shelter of the woods seven or eight men, each evidently supplied with several muskets, kept up a hot though useless fire on the log-house.", " Perhaps it was this--perhaps it was the look of the island, with its grey, melancholy woods, and wild stone spires, and the surf that we could both see and hear foaming and thundering on the steep beach--at least, although the sun shone bright and hot, and the shore birds were fishing and crying all around us, and you would have thought anyone would have been glad to get to land after being so long at sea, my heart sank, as the saying is, into my boots; and from the first look onward, I hated the very thought of Treasure Island.

Reasons of his own; that's the mainstay; as between man and man. Well, then\u201d--still holding me--\u201cI reckon you can go, Jim. And, Jim, if you was to see Silver, you wouldn't go for to sell Ben Gunn? Wild horses wouldn't draw it from you? No, says you. And if them pirates camp ashore, Jim, what would you say but there'd be widders in the morning?\u201d Here he was interrupted by a loud report, and a cannonball came tearing through the trees and pitched in the sand not a hundred yards from where we two were talking."], "What does Gunn promise to do in exchange for a safe passage home?": [" So it was with the CASSANDRA, as brought us all safe home from Malabar, after England took the viceroy of the Indies; so it was with the old WALRUS, Flint's old ship, as I've seen amuck with the red blood and fit to sink with gold.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d cried another voice, that of the youngest hand on board, and evidently full of admiration. \u201cHe was the flower of the flock, was Flint!\u201d \u201cDavis was a man too, by all accounts,\u201d said Silver. \u201cI never sailed along of him; first with England, then with Flint, that's my story; and now here on my own account, in a manner of speaking. I laid by nine hundred safe, from England, and two thousand after Flint. That ain't bad for a man before the mast--all safe in bank. 'Tain't earning now, it's saving does it, you may lay to that. Where's all England's men now? I dunno. Where's Flint's? Why, most on 'em aboard here, and glad to get the duff--been begging before that, some on 'em.", " What I mean is, would he be likely to come down to the toon of, say one thousand pounds out of money that's as good as a man's own already?\u201d \u201cI am sure he would,\u201d said I. \u201cAs it was, all hands were to share.\u201d \u201cAND a passage home?\u201d he added with a look of great shrewdness. \u201cWhy,\u201d I cried, \u201cthe squire's a gentleman. And besides, if we got rid of the others, we should want you to help work the vessel home.\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d said he, \u201cso you would.\u201d And he seemed very much relieved. \u201cNow, I'll tell you what,\u201d he went on. \u201cSo much I'll tell you, and no more. I were in Flint's ship when he buried the treasure; he and six along--six strong seamen. They was ashore nigh on a week, and us standing off and on in the old WALRUS. One fine day up went the signal, and here come Flint by himself in a little boat, and his head done up in a blue scarf. The sun was getting up, and mortal white he looked about the cutwater.", " Anderson was in command of my boat, and instead of keeping the crew in order, he grumbled as loud as the worst. \u201cWell,\u201d he said with an oath, \u201cit's not forever.\u201d I thought this was a very bad sign, for up to that day the men had gone briskly and willingly about their business; but the very sight of the island had relaxed the cords of discipline. All the way in, Long John stood by the steersman and conned the ship. He knew the passage like the palm of his hand, and though the man in the chains got everywhere more water than was down in the chart, John never hesitated once. \u201cThere's a strong scour with the ebb,\u201d he said, \u201cand this here passage has been dug out, in a manner of speaking, with a spade.\u201d We brought up just where the anchor was in the chart, about a third of a mile from each shore, the mainland on one side and Skeleton Island on the other. The bottom was clean sand. The plunge of our anchor sent up clouds of birds wheeling and crying over the woods, but in less than a minute they were down again and all was once more silent.", " That ain't in natur', surely?\u201d This argument seemed weak enough to me. But you can never tell what will affect the superstitious, and to my wonder, George Merry was greatly relieved. \u201cWell, that's so,\u201d he said. \u201cYou've a head upon your shoulders, John, and no mistake. 'Bout ship, mates! This here crew is on a wrong tack, I do believe. And come to think on it, it was like Flint's voice, I grant you, but not just so clear-away like it, after all. It was liker somebody else's voice now--it was liker--\u201d \u201cBy the powers, Ben Gunn!\u201d roared Silver. \u201cAye, and so it were,\u201d cried Morgan, springing on his knees. \u201cBen Gunn it were!\u201d \u201cIt don't make much odds, do it, now?\u201d asked Dick. \u201cBen Gunn's not here in the body any more'n Flint.\u201d But the older hands greeted this remark with scorn. \u201cWhy, nobody minds Ben Gunn,\u201d cried Merry; \u201cdead or alive, nobody minds him.\u201d It was extraordinary how their spirits had returned and how the natural colour had revived in their faces."], "Who takes over narration from Jim, beginning his story at the mutineers\u2019 departure for the island?": [" She would not, she declared, lose money that belonged to her fatherless boy; \u201cIf none of the rest of you dare,\u201d she said, \u201cJim and I dare. Back we will go, the way we came, and small thanks to you big, hulking, chicken-hearted men. We'll have that chest open, if we die for it. And I'll thank you for that bag, Mrs. Crossley, to bring back our lawful money in.\u201d Of course I said I would go with my mother, and of course they all cried out at our foolhardiness, but even then not a man would go along with us. All they would do was to give me a loaded pistol lest we were attacked, and to promise to have horses ready saddled in case we were pursued on our return, while one lad was to ride forward to the doctor's in search of armed assistance. My heart was beating finely when we two set forth in the cold night upon this dangerous venture. A full moon was beginning to rise and peered redly through the upper edges of the fog, and this increased our haste, for it was plain, before we came forth again, that all would be as bright as day, and our departure exposed to the eyes of any watchers.", " \u201cYou came in in about the nick, I guess, for me and Hawkins. And so it's you, Ben Gunn!\u201d he added. \u201cWell, you're a nice one, to be sure.\u201d \u201cI'm Ben Gunn, I am,\u201d replied the maroon, wriggling like an eel in his embarrassment. \u201cAnd,\u201d he added, after a long pause, \u201chow do, Mr. Silver? Pretty well, I thank ye, says you.\u201d \u201cBen, Ben,\u201d murmured Silver, \u201cto think as you've done me!\u201d The doctor sent back Gray for one of the pick-axes deserted, in their flight, by the mutineers, and then as we proceeded leisurely downhill to where the boats were lying, related in a few words what had taken place. It was a story that profoundly interested Silver; and Ben Gunn, the half-idiot maroon, was the hero from beginning to end. Ben, in his long, lonely wanderings about the island, had found the skeleton--it was he that had rifled it; he had found the treasure; he had dug it up (it was the haft of his pick-axe that lay broken in the excavation); he had carried it on his back, in many weary journeys, from the foot of the tall pine to a cave he had on the two-pointed hill at the north-east angle of the island, and there it had lain stored in safety since two months before the arrival of the HISPANIOLA.", " Thomas Redruth, owner's servant, landsman, shot by the mutineers; James Hawkins, cabin-boy-- And at the same time, I was wondering over poor Jim Hawkins' fate. A hail on the land side. \u201cSomebody hailing us,\u201d said Hunter, who was on guard. \u201cDoctor! Squire! Captain! Hullo, Hunter, is that you?\u201d came the cries. And I ran to the door in time to see Jim Hawkins, safe and sound, come climbing over the stockade. 19 Narrative Resumed by Jim Hawkins: The Garrison in the Stockade AS soon as Ben Gunn saw the colours he came to a halt, stopped me by the arm, and sat down. \u201cNow,\u201d said he, \u201cthere's your friends, sure enough.\u201d \u201cFar more likely it's the mutineers,\u201d I answered. \u201cThat!\u201d he cried. \u201cWhy, in a place like this, where nobody puts in but gen'lemen of fortune, Silver would fly the Jolly Roger, you don't make no doubt of that. No, that's your friends. There's been blows too, and I reckon your friends has had the best of it; and here they are ashore in the old stockade, as was made years and years ago by Flint.", " Volunteers to go and bring in pork.\u201d Gray and Hunter were the first to come forward. Well armed, they stole out of the stockade, but it proved a useless mission. The mutineers were bolder than we fancied or they put more trust in Israel's gunnery. For four or five of them were busy carrying off our stores and wading out with them to one of the gigs that lay close by, pulling an oar or so to hold her steady against the current. Silver was in the stern-sheets in command; and every man of them was now provided with a musket from some secret magazine of their own. The captain sat down to his log, and here is the beginning of the entry: Alexander Smollett, master; David Livesey, ship's doctor; Abraham Gray, carpenter's mate; John Trelawney, owner; John Hunter and Richard Joyce, owner's servants, landsmen--being all that is left faithful of the ship's company--with stores for ten days at short rations, came ashore this day and flew British colours on the log-house in Treasure Island."], "What endangers the lives of the crewmembers traveling from the ship to the island?": [" Jump! One jump, and you're out, and we'll run for it like antelopes.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I replied; \u201cyou know right well you wouldn't do the thing yourself--neither you nor squire nor captain; and no more will I. Silver trusted me; I passed my word, and back I go. But, doctor, you did not let me finish. If they come to torture me, I might let slip a word of where the ship is, for I got the ship, part by luck and part by risking, and she lies in North Inlet, on the southern beach, and just below high water. At half tide she must be high and dry.\u201d \u201cThe ship!\u201d exclaimed the doctor. Rapidly I described to him my adventures, and he heard me out in silence. \u201cThere is a kind of fate in this,\u201d he observed when I had done. \u201cEvery step, it's you that saves our lives; and do you suppose by any chance that we are going to let you lose yours? That would be a poor return, my boy. You found out the plot; you found Ben Gunn--the best deed that ever you did, or will do, though you live to ninety.", " \u201cDrink and the devil had done for the rest,\u201d with a vengeance, although, to be sure, we were not quite in so bad a case as that other ship they sang about: With one man of her crew alive, What put to sea with seventy-five. All of us had an ample share of the treasure and used it wisely or foolishly, according to our natures. Captain Smollett is now retired from the sea. Gray not only saved his money, but being suddenly smit with the desire to rise, also studied his profession, and he is now mate and part owner of a fine full-rigged ship, married besides, and the father of a family. As for Ben Gunn, he got a thousand pounds, which he spent or lost in three weeks, or to be more exact, in nineteen days, for he was back begging on the twentieth. Then he was given a lodge to keep, exactly as he had feared upon the island; and he still lives, a great favourite, though something of a butt, with the country boys, and a notable singer in church on Sundays and saints' days.", " Perhaps it was this--perhaps it was the look of the island, with its grey, melancholy woods, and wild stone spires, and the surf that we could both see and hear foaming and thundering on the steep beach--at least, although the sun shone bright and hot, and the shore birds were fishing and crying all around us, and you would have thought anyone would have been glad to get to land after being so long at sea, my heart sank, as the saying is, into my boots; and from the first look onward, I hated the very thought of Treasure Island. We had a dreary morning's work before us, for there was no sign of any wind, and the boats had to be got out and manned, and the ship warped three or four miles round the corner of the island and up the narrow passage to the haven behind Skeleton Island. I volunteered for one of the boats, where I had, of course, no business. The heat was sweltering, and the men grumbled fiercely over their work.", " Every time we had a crack at them, we were to take it, saving our own lives, with the extremest care. And besides that, we had two able allies--rum and the climate. As for the first, though we were about half a mile away, we could hear them roaring and singing late into the night; and as for the second, the doctor staked his wig that, camped where they were in the marsh and unprovided with remedies, the half of them would be on their backs before a week. \u201cSo,\u201d he added, \u201cif we are not all shot down first they'll be glad to be packing in the schooner. It's always a ship, and they can get to buccaneering again, I suppose.\u201d \u201cFirst ship that ever I lost,\u201d said Captain Smollett. I was dead tired, as you may fancy; and when I got to sleep, which was not till after a great deal of tossing, I slept like a log of wood. The rest had long been up and had already breakfasted and increased the pile of firewood by about half as much again when I was wakened by a bustle and the sound of voices."], "Where do the good sailors weather cannon fire from the mutineers?": [" \u201cBristol,\u201d said Tom. \u201cGet down.\u201d Mr. Trelawney had taken up his residence at an inn far down the docks to superintend the work upon the schooner. Thither we had now to walk, and our way, to my great delight, lay along the quays and beside the great multitude of ships of all sizes and rigs and nations. In one, sailors were singing at their work, in another there were men aloft, high over my head, hanging to threads that seemed no thicker than a spider's. Though I had lived by the shore all my life, I seemed never to have been near the sea till then. The smell of tar and salt was something new. I saw the most wonderful figureheads, that had all been far over the ocean. I saw, besides, many old sailors, with rings in their ears, and whiskers curled in ringlets, and tarry pigtails, and their swaggering, clumsy sea-walk; and if I had seen as many kings or archbishops I could not have been more delighted.", " Another had been shot at a loophole in the very act of firing into the house and now lay in agony, the pistol still smoking in his hand. A third, as I had seen, the doctor had disposed of at a blow. Of the four who had scaled the palisade, one only remained unaccounted for, and he, having left his cutlass on the field, was now clambering out again with the fear of death upon him. \u201cFire--fire from the house!\u201d cried the doctor. \u201cAnd you, lads, back into cover.\u201d But his words were unheeded, no shot was fired, and the last boarder made good his escape and disappeared with the rest into the wood. In three seconds nothing remained of the attacking party but the five who had fallen, four on the inside and one on the outside of the palisade. The doctor and Gray and I ran full speed for shelter. The survivors would soon be back where they had left their muskets, and at any moment the fire might recommence.", " \u201cYou see the mounds? I come here and prayed, nows and thens, when I thought maybe a Sunday would be about doo. It weren't quite a chapel, but it seemed more solemn like; and then, says you, Ben Gunn was short-handed--no chapling, nor so much as a Bible and a flag, you says.\u201d So he kept talking as I ran, neither expecting nor receiving any answer. The cannon-shot was followed after a considerable interval by a volley of small arms. Another pause, and then, not a quarter of a mile in front of me, I beheld the Union Jack flutter in the air above a wood. PART FOUR--The Stockade 16 Narrative Continued by the Doctor: How the Ship Was Abandoned IT was about half past one--three bells in the sea phrase--that the two boats went ashore from the HISPANIOLA. The captain, the squire, and I were talking matters over in the cabin. Had there been a breath of wind, we should have fallen on the six mutineers who were left aboard with us, slipped our cable, and away to sea.", " The boatswain, Job Anderson, was the likeliest man aboard, and though he kept his old title, he served in a way as mate. Mr. Trelawney had followed the sea, and his knowledge made him very useful, for he often took a watch himself in easy weather. And the coxswain, Israel Hands, was a careful, wily, old, experienced seaman who could be trusted at a pinch with almost anything. He was a great confidant of Long John Silver, and so the mention of his name leads me on to speak of our ship's cook, Barbecue, as the men called him. Aboard ship he carried his crutch by a lanyard round his neck, to have both hands as free as possible. It was something to see him wedge the foot of the crutch against a bulkhead, and propped against it, yielding to every movement of the ship, get on with his cooking like someone safe ashore. Still more strange was it to see him in the heaviest of weather cross the deck."], "What does Silver call himself before proposing a compromise with Smollett?": [" You don't, you say, like this cruise. Now, why?\u201d \u201cI was engaged, sir, on what we call sealed orders, to sail this ship for that gentleman where he should bid me,\u201d said the captain. \u201cSo far so good. But now I find that every man before the mast knows more than I do. I don't call that fair, now, do you?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Dr. Livesey, \u201cI don't.\u201d \u201cNext,\u201d said the captain, \u201cI learn we are going after treasure--hear it from my own hands, mind you. Now, treasure is ticklish work; I don't like treasure voyages on any account, and I don't like them, above all, when they are secret and when (begging your pardon, Mr. Trelawney) the secret has been told to the parrot.\u201d \u201cSilver's parrot?\u201d asked the squire. \u201cIt's a way of speaking,\u201d said the captain. \u201cBlabbed, I mean. It's my belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about, but I'll tell you my way of it--life or death, and a close run.\u201d \u201cThat is all clear, and, I dare say, true enough,\u201d replied Dr. Livesey.", " \u201cWell now, if you want to know, I'll tell you when. The last moment I can manage, and that's when. Here's a first-rate seaman, Cap'n Smollett, sails the blessed ship for us. Here's this squire and doctor with a map and such--I don't know where it is, do I? No more do you, says you. Well then, I mean this squire and doctor shall find the stuff, and help us to get it aboard, by the powers. Then we'll see. If I was sure of you all, sons of double Dutchmen, I'd have Cap'n Smollett navigate us half-way back again before I struck.\u201d \u201cWhy, we're all seamen aboard here, I should think,\u201d said the lad Dick. \u201cWe're all forecastle hands, you mean,\u201d snapped Silver. \u201cWe can steer a course, but who's to set one? That's what all you gentlemen split on, first and last. If I had my way, I'd have Cap'n Smollett work us back into the trades at least; then we'd have no blessed miscalculations and a spoonful of water a day.", " I'll stay here a bit,\u201d he continued. \u201cI'm a plain man; rum and bacon and eggs is what I want, and that head up there for to watch ships off. What you mought call me? You mought call me captain. Oh, I see what you're at--there\u201d; and he threw down three or four gold pieces on the threshold. \u201cYou can tell me when I've worked through that,\u201d says he, looking as fierce as a commander. And indeed bad as his clothes were and coarsely as he spoke, he had none of the appearance of a man who sailed before the mast, but seemed like a mate or skipper accustomed to be obeyed or to strike. The man who came with the barrow told us the mail had set him down the morning before at the Royal George, that he had inquired what inns there were along the coast, and hearing ours well spoken of, I suppose, and described as lonely, had chosen it from the others for his place of residence. And that was all we could learn of our guest.", " All I ask is your word, Cap'n Smollett, to let me safe and sound out of this here stockade, and one minute to get out o' shot before a gun is fired.\u201d \u201cMy man,\u201d said Captain Smollett, \u201cI have not the slightest desire to talk to you. If you wish to talk to me, you can come, that's all. If there's any treachery, it'll be on your side, and the Lord help you.\u201d \u201cThat's enough, cap'n,\u201d shouted Long John cheerily. \u201cA word from you's enough. I know a gentleman, and you may lay to that.\u201d We could see the man who carried the flag of truce attempting to hold Silver back. Nor was that wonderful, seeing how cavalier had been the captain's answer. But Silver laughed at him aloud and slapped him on the back as if the idea of alarm had been absurd. Then he advanced to the stockade, threw over his crutch, got a leg up, and with great vigour and skill succeeded in surmounting the fence and dropping safely to the other side."], "What does Silver demand from Smollett in exchange for the safe voyage he offers?": [" \u201cWhy, by the powers,\u201d cried Long John, \u201cif we do, we'll miss the morning tide!\u201d \u201cMy orders!\u201d said the captain shortly. \u201cYou may go below, my man. Hands will want supper.\u201d \u201cAye, aye, sir,\u201d answered the cook, and touching his forelock, he disappeared at once in the direction of his galley. \u201cThat's a good man, captain,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cVery likely, sir,\u201d replied Captain Smollett. \u201cEasy with that, men--easy,\u201d he ran on, to the fellows who were shifting the powder; and then suddenly observing me examining the swivel we carried amidships, a long brass nine, \u201cHere you, ship's boy,\u201d he cried, \u201cout o' that! Off with you to the cook and get some work.\u201d And then as I was hurrying off I heard him say, quite loudly, to the doctor, \u201cI'll have no favourites on my ship.\u201d I assure you I was quite of the squire's way of thinking, and hated the captain deeply. 10 The Voyage ALL that night we were in a great bustle getting things stowed in their place, and boatfuls of the squire's friends, Mr. Blandly and the like, coming off to wish him a good voyage and a safe return.", " So it was with the CASSANDRA, as brought us all safe home from Malabar, after England took the viceroy of the Indies; so it was with the old WALRUS, Flint's old ship, as I've seen amuck with the red blood and fit to sink with gold.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d cried another voice, that of the youngest hand on board, and evidently full of admiration. \u201cHe was the flower of the flock, was Flint!\u201d \u201cDavis was a man too, by all accounts,\u201d said Silver. \u201cI never sailed along of him; first with England, then with Flint, that's my story; and now here on my own account, in a manner of speaking. I laid by nine hundred safe, from England, and two thousand after Flint. That ain't bad for a man before the mast--all safe in bank. 'Tain't earning now, it's saving does it, you may lay to that. Where's all England's men now? I dunno. Where's Flint's? Why, most on 'em aboard here, and glad to get the duff--been begging before that, some on 'em.", " All I ask is your word, Cap'n Smollett, to let me safe and sound out of this here stockade, and one minute to get out o' shot before a gun is fired.\u201d \u201cMy man,\u201d said Captain Smollett, \u201cI have not the slightest desire to talk to you. If you wish to talk to me, you can come, that's all.

Then he advanced to the stockade, threw over his crutch, got a leg up, and with great vigour and skill succeeded in surmounting the fence and dropping safely to the other side.", " But soon the anchor was short up; soon it was hanging dripping at the bows; soon the sails began to draw, and the land and shipping to flit by on either side; and before I could lie down to snatch an hour of slumber the HISPANIOLA had begun her voyage to the Isle of Treasure. I am not going to relate that voyage in detail. It was fairly prosperous. The ship proved to be a good ship, the crew were capable seamen, and the captain thoroughly understood his business. But before we came the length of Treasure Island, two or three things had happened which require to be known. Mr. Arrow, first of all, turned out even worse than the captain had feared. He had no command among the men, and people did what they pleased with him. But that was by no means the worst of it, for after a day or two at sea he began to appear on deck with hazy eye, red cheeks, stuttering tongue, and other marks of drunkenness."], "What does Jim plan to do with the Hispaniola after sailing out to it in the coracle?": [" The current was bearing coracle and schooner southward at an equal rate. As for the latter's sailing, it was so wild and intermittent, and she hung each time so long in irons, that she certainly gained nothing, if she did not even lose. If only I dared to sit up and paddle, I made sure that I could overhaul her. The scheme had an air of adventure that inspired me, and the thought of the water breaker beside the fore companion doubled my growing courage. Up I got, was welcomed almost instantly by another cloud of spray, but this time stuck to my purpose and set myself, with all my strength and caution, to paddle after the unsteered HISPANIOLA. Once I shipped a sea so heavy that I had to stop and bail, with my heart fluttering like a bird, but gradually I got into the way of the thing and guided my coracle among the waves, with only now and then a blow upon her bows and a dash of foam in my face.", " The thing was extremely small, even for me, and I can hardly imagine that it could have floated with a full-sized man. There was one thwart set as low as possible, a kind of stretcher in the bows, and a double paddle for propulsion. I had not then seen a coracle, such as the ancient Britons made, but I have seen one since, and I can give you no fairer idea of Ben Gunn's boat than by saying it was like the first and the worst coracle ever made by man. But the great advantage of the coracle it certainly possessed, for it was exceedingly light and portable. Well, now that I had found the boat, you would have thought I had had enough of truantry for once, but in the meantime I had taken another notion and become so obstinately fond of it that I would have carried it out, I believe, in the teeth of Captain Smollett himself. This was to slip out under cover of the night, cut the HISPANIOLA adrift, and let her go ashore where she fancied.", " Immensely tall she looked to me from my low station in the coracle. And then, of a sudden, I began to comprehend. I had scarce time to think--scarce time to act and save myself. I was on the summit of one swell when the schooner came stooping over the next. The bowsprit was over my head. I sprang to my feet and leaped, stamping the coracle under water. With one hand I caught the jib-boom, while my foot was lodged between the stay and the brace; and as I still clung there panting, a dull blow told me that the schooner had charged down upon and struck the coracle and that I was left without retreat on the HISPANIOLA. 25 I Strike the Jolly Roger I HAD scarce gained a position on the bowsprit when the flying jib flapped and filled upon the other tack, with a report like a gun. The schooner trembled to her keel under the reverse, but next moment, the other sails still drawing, the jib flapped back again and hung idle.", " I was drenched and terrified, and fell instantly back into my old position, whereupon the coracle seemed to find her head again and led me as softly as before among the billows. It was plain she was not to be interfered with, and at that rate, since I could in no way influence her course, what hope had I left of reaching land? I began to be horribly frightened, but I kept my head, for all that. First, moving with all care, I gradually baled out the coracle with my sea-cap; then, getting my eye once more above the gunwale, I set myself to study how it was she managed to slip so quietly through the rollers. I found each wave, instead of the big, smooth glossy mountain it looks from shore or from a vessel's deck, was for all the world like any range of hills on dry land, full of peaks and smooth places and valleys. The coracle, left to herself, turning from side to side, threaded, so to speak, her way through these lower parts and avoided the steep slopes and higher, toppling summits of the wave."], "What distraction prevents the pirates from noticing that Jim has cut the ship adrift?": [" It's trying on a man, I know. It would be pleasanter to come to blows. But there's no help for it till we know our men. Lay to, and whistle for a wind, that's my view.\u201d \u201cJim here,\u201d said the doctor, \u201ccan help us more than anyone. The men are not shy with him, and Jim is a noticing lad.\u201d \u201cHawkins, I put prodigious faith in you,\u201d added the squire. I began to feel pretty desperate at this, for I felt altogether helpless; and yet, by an odd train of circumstances, it was indeed through me that safety came. In the meantime, talk as we pleased, there were only seven out of the twenty-six on whom we knew we could rely; and out of these seven one was a boy, so that the grown men on our side were six to their nineteen. PART THREE--My Shore Adventure 13 How My Shore Adventure Began THE appearance of the island when I came on deck next morning was altogether changed. Although the breeze had now utterly ceased, we had made a great deal of way during the night and were now lying becalmed about half a mile to the south-east of the low eastern coast.", " The thing was extremely small, even for me, and I can hardly imagine that it could have floated with a full-sized man. There was one thwart set as low as possible, a kind of stretcher in the bows, and a double paddle for propulsion. I had not then seen a coracle, such as the ancient Britons made, but I have seen one since, and I can give you no fairer idea of Ben Gunn's boat than by saying it was like the first and the worst coracle ever made by man.

This was to slip out under cover of the night, cut the HISPANIOLA adrift, and let her go ashore where she fancied.", " \u201cCut me a junk o' that,\u201d says he, \u201cfor I haven't no knife and hardly strength enough, so be as I had. Ah, Jim, Jim, I reckon I've missed stays! Cut me a quid, as'll likely be the last, lad, for I'm for my long home, and no mistake.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said I, \u201cI'll cut you some tobacco, but if I was you and thought myself so badly, I would go to my prayers like a Christian man.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d said he. \u201cNow, you tell me why.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d I cried. \u201cYou were asking me just now about the dead. You've broken your trust; you've lived in sin and lies and blood; there's a man you killed lying at your feet this moment, and you ask me why! For God's mercy, Mr. Hands, that's why.\u201d I spoke with a little heat, thinking of the bloody dirk he had hidden in his pocket and designed, in his ill thoughts, to end me with. He, for his part, took a great draught of the wine and spoke with the most unusual solemnity. \u201cFor thirty years,\u201d he said, \u201cI've sailed the seas and seen good and bad, better and worse, fair weather and foul, provisions running out, knives going, and what not.", " And, Jim\u201d--looking all round him and lowering his voice to a whisper--\u201cI'm rich.\u201d I now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude, and I suppose I must have shown the feeling in my face, for he repeated the statement hotly: \u201cRich! Rich! I says. And I'll tell you what: I'll make a man of you, Jim. Ah, Jim, you'll bless your stars, you will, you was the first that found me!\u201d And at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face, and he tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly before my eyes. \u201cNow, Jim, you tell me true: that ain't Flint's ship?\u201d he asked. At this I had a happy inspiration. I began to believe that I had found an ally, and I answered him at once. \u201cIt's not Flint's ship, and Flint is dead; but I'll tell you true, as you ask me--there are some of Flint's hands aboard; worse luck for the rest of us.\u201d \u201cNot a man--with one--leg?\u201d he gasped."], "What does Jim do after drifting too near to the pirates\u2019 campfire on shore?": [" However, we had no luck, for just as Trelawney fired, down he stooped, the ball whistled over him, and it was one of the other four who fell. The cry he gave was echoed not only by his companions on board but by a great number of voices from the shore, and looking in that direction I saw the other pirates trooping out from among the trees and tumbling into their places in the boats. \u201cHere come the gigs, sir,\u201d said I. \u201cGive way, then,\u201d cried the captain. \u201cWe mustn't mind if we swamp her now. If we can't get ashore, all's up.\u201d \u201cOnly one of the gigs is being manned, sir,\u201d I added; \u201cthe crew of the other most likely going round by shore to cut us off.\u201d \u201cThey'll have a hot run, sir,\u201d returned the captain. \u201cJack ashore, you know. It's not them I mind; it's the round-shot. Carpet bowls! My lady's maid couldn't miss. Tell us, squire, when you see the match, and we'll hold water.\u201d In the meanwhile we had been making headway at a good pace for a boat so overloaded, and we had shipped but little water in the process.", " Oh! And you'll say this: 'Ben Gunn,' says you, 'has reasons of his own. '\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said I, \u201cI believe I understand. You have something to propose, and you wish to see the squire or the doctor, and you're to be found where I found you. Is that all?\u201d \u201cAnd when? says you,\u201d he added. \u201cWhy, from about noon observation to about six bells.\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d said I, \u201cand now may I go?\u201d \u201cYou won't forget?\u201d he inquired anxiously. \u201cPrecious sight, and reasons of his own, says you. Reasons of his own; that's the mainstay; as between man and man. Well, then\u201d--still holding me--\u201cI reckon you can go, Jim. And, Jim, if you was to see Silver, you wouldn't go for to sell Ben Gunn? Wild horses wouldn't draw it from you? No, says you. And if them pirates camp ashore, Jim, what would you say but there'd be widders in the morning?\u201d Here he was interrupted by a loud report, and a cannonball came tearing through the trees and pitched in the sand not a hundred yards from where we two were talking.", " It's trying on a man, I know. It would be pleasanter to come to blows. But there's no help for it till we know our men. Lay to, and whistle for a wind, that's my view.\u201d \u201cJim here,\u201d said the doctor, \u201ccan help us more than anyone. The men are not shy with him, and Jim is a noticing lad.\u201d \u201cHawkins, I put prodigious faith in you,\u201d added the squire. I began to feel pretty desperate at this, for I felt altogether helpless; and yet, by an odd train of circumstances, it was indeed through me that safety came. In the meantime, talk as we pleased, there were only seven out of the twenty-six on whom we knew we could rely; and out of these seven one was a boy, so that the grown men on our side were six to their nineteen. PART THREE--My Shore Adventure 13 How My Shore Adventure Began THE appearance of the island when I came on deck next morning was altogether changed. Although the breeze had now utterly ceased, we had made a great deal of way during the night and were now lying becalmed about half a mile to the south-east of the low eastern coast.", " Never a month but I've given you a silver fourpenny for yourself. And now you see, mate, I'm pretty low, and deserted by all; and Jim, you'll bring me one noggin of rum, now, won't you, matey?\u201d \u201cThe doctor--\u201d I began. But he broke in cursing the doctor, in a feeble voice but heartily. \u201cDoctors is all swabs,\u201d he said; \u201cand that doctor there, why, what do he know about seafaring men? I been in places hot as pitch, and mates dropping round with Yellow Jack, and the blessed land a-heaving like the sea with earthquakes--what to the doctor know of lands like that?--and I lived on rum, I tell you. It's been meat and drink, and man and wife, to me; and if I'm not to have my rum now I'm a poor old hulk on a lee shore, my blood'll be on you, Jim, and that doctor swab\u201d; and he ran on again for a while with curses. \u201cLook, Jim, how my fingers fidges,\u201d he continued in the pleading tone. \u201cI can't keep 'em still, not I. I haven't had a drop this blessed day."], "What risk does Jim know that he runs by pursuing the drifting Hispaniola in his coracle?": [" She had swung round to the ebb--her bow was now towards me--the only lights on board were in the cabin, and what I saw was merely a reflection on the fog of the strong rays that flowed from the stern window. The ebb had already run some time, and I had to wade through a long belt of swampy sand, where I sank several times above the ankle, before I came to the edge of the retreating water, and wading a little way in, with some strength and dexterity, set my coracle, keel downwards, on the surface. 23 The Ebb-tide Runs THE coracle--as I had ample reason to know before I was done with her--was a very safe boat for a person of my height and weight, both buoyant and clever in a seaway; but she was the most cross-grained, lop-sided craft to manage. Do as you pleased, she always made more leeway than anything else, and turning round and round was the manoeuvre she was best at. Even Ben Gunn himself has admitted that she was \u201cqueer to handle till you knew her way.\u201d Certainly I did not know her way.", " The thing was extremely small, even for me, and I can hardly imagine that it could have floated with a full-sized man. There was one thwart set as low as possible, a kind of stretcher in the bows, and a double paddle for propulsion. I had not then seen a coracle, such as the ancient Britons made, but I have seen one since, and I can give you no fairer idea of Ben Gunn's boat than by saying it was like the first and the worst coracle ever made by man. But the great advantage of the coracle it certainly possessed, for it was exceedingly light and portable. Well, now that I had found the boat, you would have thought I had had enough of truantry for once, but in the meantime I had taken another notion and become so obstinately fond of it that I would have carried it out, I believe, in the teeth of Captain Smollett himself. This was to slip out under cover of the night, cut the HISPANIOLA adrift, and let her go ashore where she fancied.", " Immensely tall she looked to me from my low station in the coracle. And then, of a sudden, I began to comprehend. I had scarce time to think--scarce time to act and save myself. I was on the summit of one swell when the schooner came stooping over the next. The bowsprit was over my head. I sprang to my feet and leaped, stamping the coracle under water. With one hand I caught the jib-boom, while my foot was lodged between the stay and the brace; and as I still clung there panting, a dull blow told me that the schooner had charged down upon and struck the coracle and that I was left without retreat on the HISPANIOLA. 25 I Strike the Jolly Roger I HAD scarce gained a position on the bowsprit when the flying jib flapped and filled upon the other tack, with a report like a gun. The schooner trembled to her keel under the reverse, but next moment, the other sails still drawing, the jib flapped back again and hung idle.", " \u201cIt's a bargain!\u201d cried Long John. \u201cYou speak up plucky, and by thunder, I've a chance!\u201d He hobbled to the torch, where it stood propped among the firewood, and took a fresh light to his pipe. \u201cUnderstand me, Jim,\u201d he said, returning. \u201cI've a head on my shoulders, I have. I'm on squire's side now. I know you've got that ship safe somewheres. How you done it, I don't know, but safe it is. I guess Hands and O'Brien turned soft. I never much believed in neither of THEM. Now you mark me. I ask no questions, nor I won't let others. I know when a game's up, I do; and I know a lad that's staunch. Ah, you that's young--you and me might have done a power of good together!\u201d He drew some cognac from the cask into a tin cannikin. \u201cWill you taste, messmate?\u201d he asked; and when I had refused: \u201cWell, I'll take a dram myself, Jim,\u201d said he. \u201cI need a caulker, for there's trouble on hand. And talking o' trouble, why did that doctor give me the chart, Jim?\u201d My face expressed a wonder so unaffected that he saw the needlessness of further questions."], "What sound does Jim hear after climbing aboard the drifting ship?": [" Thomas Redruth, owner's servant, landsman, shot by the mutineers; James Hawkins, cabin-boy-- And at the same time, I was wondering over poor Jim Hawkins' fate. A hail on the land side. \u201cSomebody hailing us,\u201d said Hunter, who was on guard. \u201cDoctor! Squire! Captain! Hullo, Hunter, is that you?\u201d came the cries. And I ran to the door in time to see Jim Hawkins, safe and sound, come climbing over the stockade. 19 Narrative Resumed by Jim Hawkins: The Garrison in the Stockade AS soon as Ben Gunn saw the colours he came to a halt, stopped me by the arm, and sat down. \u201cNow,\u201d said he, \u201cthere's your friends, sure enough.\u201d \u201cFar more likely it's the mutineers,\u201d I answered. \u201cThat!\u201d he cried. \u201cWhy, in a place like this, where nobody puts in but gen'lemen of fortune, Silver would fly the Jolly Roger, you don't make no doubt of that. No, that's your friends. There's been blows too, and I reckon your friends has had the best of it; and here they are ashore in the old stockade, as was made years and years ago by Flint.", " And, Jim\u201d--looking all round him and lowering his voice to a whisper--\u201cI'm rich.\u201d I now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude, and I suppose I must have shown the feeling in my face, for he repeated the statement hotly: \u201cRich! Rich! I says. And I'll tell you what: I'll make a man of you, Jim. Ah, Jim, you'll bless your stars, you will, you was the first that found me!\u201d And at this there came suddenly a lowering shadow over his face, and he tightened his grasp upon my hand and raised a forefinger threateningly before my eyes. \u201cNow, Jim, you tell me true: that ain't Flint's ship?\u201d he asked. At this I had a happy inspiration. I began to believe that I had found an ally, and I answered him at once. \u201cIt's not Flint's ship, and Flint is dead; but I'll tell you true, as you ask me--there are some of Flint's hands aboard; worse luck for the rest of us.\u201d \u201cNot a man--with one--leg?\u201d he gasped.", " The boatswain, Job Anderson, was the likeliest man aboard, and though he kept his old title, he served in a way as mate. Mr. Trelawney had followed the sea, and his knowledge made him very useful, for he often took a watch himself in easy weather. And the coxswain, Israel Hands, was a careful, wily, old, experienced seaman who could be trusted at a pinch with almost anything. He was a great confidant of Long John Silver, and so the mention of his name leads me on to speak of our ship's cook, Barbecue, as the men called him. Aboard ship he carried his crutch by a lanyard round his neck, to have both hands as free as possible. It was something to see him wedge the foot of the crutch against a bulkhead, and propped against it, yielding to every movement of the ship, get on with his cooking like someone safe ashore. Still more strange was it to see him in the heaviest of weather cross the deck.", " No captain, sir, would be justified in going to sea at all if he had ground enough to say that. As for Mr. Arrow, I believe him thoroughly honest; some of the men are the same; all may be for what I know. But I am responsible for the ship's safety and the life of every man Jack aboard of her. I see things going, as I think, not quite right. And I ask you to take certain precautions or let me resign my berth. And that's all.\u201d \u201cCaptain Smollett,\u201d began the doctor with a smile, \u201cdid ever you hear the fable of the mountain and the mouse? You'll excuse me, I dare say, but you remind me of that fable. When you came in here, I'll stake my wig, you meant more than this.\u201d \u201cDoctor,\u201d said the captain, \u201cyou are smart. When I came in here I meant to get discharged. I had no thought that Mr. Trelawney would hear a word.\u201d \u201cNo more I would,\u201d cried the squire. \u201cHad Livesey not been here I should have seen you to the deuce."], "What is the drunken Israel Hands covered in when Jim discovers him aboard the drifting ship?": [" At the same time, I observed, around both of them, splashes of dark blood upon the planks and began to feel sure that they had killed each other in their drunken wrath. While I was thus looking and wondering, in a calm moment, when the ship was still, Israel Hands turned partly round and with a low moan writhed himself back to the position in which I had seen him first. The moan, which told of pain and deadly weakness, and the way in which his jaw hung open went right to my heart. But when I remembered the talk I had overheard from the apple barrel, all pity left me. I walked aft until I reached the main-mast. \u201cCome aboard, Mr. Hands,\u201d I said ironically. He rolled his eyes round heavily, but he was too far gone to express surprise. All he could do was to utter one word, \u201cBrandy.\u201d It occurred to me there was no time to lose, and dodging the boom as it once more lurched across the deck, I slipped aft and down the companion stairs into the cabin.", " The boatswain, Job Anderson, was the likeliest man aboard, and though he kept his old title, he served in a way as mate.

One I recognized for the coxswain's, Israel Hands, that had been Flint's gunner in former days. The other was, of course, my friend of the red night-cap. Both men were plainly the worse of drink, and they were still drinking, for even while I was listening, one of them, with a drunken cry, opened the stern window and threw out something, which I divined to be an empty bottle. But they were not only tipsy; it was plain that they were furiously angry. Oaths flew like hailstones, and every now and then there came forth such an explosion as I thought was sure to end in blows. But each time the quarrel passed off and the voices grumbled lower for a while, until the next crisis came and in its turn passed away without result. On shore, I could see the glow of the great camp-fire burning warmly through the shore-side trees. Someone was singing, a dull, old, droning sailor's song, with a droop and a quaver at the end of every verse, and seemingly no end to it at all but the patience of the singer."], "What does Jim ask Hands to do after discovering him aboard the drifting ship?": [" And, Jim\u201d--looking all round him and lowering his voice to a whisper--\u201cI'm rich.\u201d I now felt sure that the poor fellow had gone crazy in his solitude, and I suppose I must have shown the feeling in my face, for he repeated the statement hotly: \u201cRich!

On the top of that the three gentlemen went below, and not long after, word was sent forward that Jim Hawkins was wanted in the cabin. I found them all three seated round the table, a bottle of Spanish wine and some raisins before them, and the doctor smoking away, with his wig on his lap, and that, I knew, was a sign that he was agitated. The stern window was open, for it was a warm night, and you could see the moon shining behind on the ship's wake. \u201cNow, Hawkins,\u201d said the squire, \u201cyou have something to say. Speak up.\u201d I did as I was bid, and as short as I could make it, told the whole details of Silver's conversation.

I'll chance it with the sperrits, Jim. And now, you've spoke up free, and I'll take it kind if you'd step down into that there cabin and get me a--well, a--shiver my timbers! I can't hit the name on 't; well, you get me a bottle of wine, Jim--this here brandy's too strong for my head.\u201d Now, the coxswain's hesitation seemed to be unnatural, and as for the notion of his preferring wine to brandy, I entirely disbelieved it. The whole story was a pretext. He wanted me to leave the deck--so much was plain; but with what purpose I could in no way imagine. His eyes never met mine; they kept wandering to and fro, up and down, now with a look to the sky, now with a flitting glance upon the dead O'Brien. All the time he kept smiling and putting his tongue out in the most guilty, embarrassed manner, so that a child could have told that he was bent on some deception.", " I was prompt with my answer, however, for I saw where my advantage lay and that with a fellow so densely stupid I could easily conceal my suspicions to the end. \u201cSome wine?\u201d I said. \u201cFar better. Will you have white or red?\u201d \u201cWell, I reckon it's about the blessed same to me, shipmate,\u201d he replied; \u201cso it's strong, and plenty of it, what's the odds?\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d I answered. \u201cI'll bring you port, Mr. Hands. But I'll have to dig for it.\u201d With that I scuttled down the companion with all the noise I could, slipped off my shoes, ran quietly along the sparred gallery, mounted the forecastle ladder, and popped my head out of the fore companion. I knew he would not expect to see me there, yet I took every precaution possible, and certainly the worst of my suspicions proved too true. He had risen from his position to his hands and knees, and though his leg obviously hurt him pretty sharply when he moved--for I could hear him stifle a groan--yet it was at a good, rattling rate that he trailed himself across the deck.", " \u201cCut me a junk o' that,\u201d says he, \u201cfor I haven't no knife and hardly strength enough, so be as I had.

Three years he were the man of this island, light and dark, fair and rain; and sometimes he would maybe think upon a prayer (says you), and sometimes he would maybe think of his old mother, so be as she's alive (you'll say); but the most part of Gunn's time (this is what you'll say)--the most part of his time was took up with another matter. And then you'll give him a nip, like I do.\u201d And he pinched me again in the most confidential manner. \u201cThen,\u201d he continued, \u201cthen you'll up, and you'll say this: Gunn is a good man (you'll say), and he puts a precious sight more confidence--a precious sight, mind that--in a gen'leman born than in these gen'leman of fortune, having been one hisself.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cI don't understand one word that you've been saying."], "Whose voice wakes up the men in the stockade by crying \u201cPieces of eight!\u201d?": [" And then, all of a sudden, a shrill voice broke forth out of the darkness: \u201cPieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!\u201d and so forth, without pause or change, like the clacking of a tiny mill. Silver's green parrot, Captain Flint! It was she whom I had heard pecking at a piece of bark; it was she, keeping better watch than any human being, who thus announced my arrival with her wearisome refrain. I had no time left me to recover. At the sharp, clipping tone of the parrot, the sleepers awoke and sprang up; and with a mighty oath, the voice of Silver cried, \u201cWho goes?\u201d I turned to run, struck violently against one person, recoiled, and ran full into the arms of a second, who for his part closed upon and held me tight. \u201cBring a torch, Dick,\u201d said Silver when my capture was thus assured. And one of the men left the log-house and presently returned with a lighted brand.", " \u201cCome away, Hawkins,\u201d he would say; \u201ccome and have a yarn with John. Nobody more welcome than yourself, my son. Sit you down and hear the news. Here's Cap'n Flint--I calls my parrot Cap'n Flint, after the famous buccaneer--here's Cap'n Flint predicting success to our v'yage. Wasn't you, cap'n?\u201d And the parrot would say, with great rapidity, \u201cPieces of eight! Pieces of eight! Pieces of eight!\u201d till you wondered that it was not out of breath, or till John threw his handkerchief over the cage. \u201cNow, that bird,\u201d he would say, \u201cis, maybe, two hundred years old, Hawkins--they live forever mostly; and if anybody's seen more wickedness, it must be the devil himself. She's sailed with England, the great Cap'n England, the pirate. She's been at Madagascar, and at Malabar, and Surinam, and Providence, and Portobello. She was at the fishing up of the wrecked plate ships. It's there she learned 'Pieces of eight,' and little wonder; three hundred and fifty thousand of 'em, Hawkins!", " Two of the bars, slung in a rope's end, made a good load for a grown man--one that he was glad to walk slowly with. For my part, as I was not much use at carrying, I was kept busy all day in the cave packing the minted money into bread-bags. It was a strange collection, like Billy Bones's hoard for the diversity of coinage, but so much larger and so much more varied that I think I never had more pleasure than in sorting them. English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Georges, and Louises, doubloons and double guineas and moidores and sequins, the pictures of all the kings of Europe for the last hundred years, strange Oriental pieces stamped with what looked like wisps of string or bits of spider's web, round pieces and square pieces, and pieces bored through the middle, as if to wear them round your neck--nearly every variety of money in the world must, I think, have found a place in that collection; and for number, I am sure they were like autumn leaves, so that my back ached with stooping and my fingers with sorting them out.", " NARRATIVE CONTINUED BY THE DOCTOR: THE JOLLY-BOAT'S LAST TRIP . . . . . . 105 18.

After that, we'll see.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d replied George, \u201cyou don't be under no kind of apprehension; WE'RE all square, we are. First, you've made a hash of this cruise--you'll be a bold man to say no to that. Second, you let the enemy out o' this here trap for nothing. Why did they want out? I dunno, but it's pretty plain they wanted it. Third, you wouldn't let us go at them upon the march. Oh, we see through you, John Silver; you want to play booty, that's what's wrong with you. And then, fourth, there's this here boy.\u201d \u201cIs that all?\u201d asked Silver quietly. \u201cEnough, too,\u201d retorted George. \u201cWe'll all swing and sun-dry for your bungling.\u201d \u201cWell now, look here, I'll answer these four p'ints; one after another I'll answer 'em.", " First he recognized the doctor with an unmistakable frown; then his glance fell upon me, and he looked relieved. But suddenly his colour changed, and he tried to raise himself, crying, \u201cWhere's Black Dog?\u201d \u201cThere is no Black Dog here,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cexcept what you have on your own back. You have been drinking rum; you have had a stroke, precisely as I told you; and I have just, very much against my own will, dragged you headforemost out of the grave. Now, Mr. Bones--\u201d \u201cThat's not my name,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cMuch I care,\u201d returned the doctor. \u201cIt's the name of a buccaneer of my acquaintance; and I call you by it for the sake of shortness, and what I have to say to you is this; one glass of rum won't kill you, but if you take one you'll take another and another, and I stake my wig if you don't break off short, you'll die--do you understand that?--die, and go to your own place, like the man in the Bible.", " You'll please bear in mind it's not my life only now--it's that boy's into the bargain; and you'll speak me fair, doctor, and give me a bit o' hope to go on, for the sake of mercy.\u201d Silver was a changed man once he was out there and had his back to his friends and the block house; his cheeks seemed to have fallen in, his voice trembled; never was a soul more dead in earnest. \u201cWhy, John, you're not afraid?\u201d asked Dr. Livesey. \u201cDoctor, I'm no coward; no, not I--not SO much!\u201d and he snapped his fingers. \u201cIf I was I wouldn't say it. But I'll own up fairly, I've the shakes upon me for the gallows. You're a good man and a true; I never seen a better man! And you'll not forget what I done good, not any more than you'll forget the bad, I know. And I step aside--see here--and leave you and Jim alone. And you'll put that down for me too, for it's a long stretch, is that!\u201d So saying, he stepped back a little way, till he was out of earshot, and there sat down upon a tree-stump and began to whistle, spinning round now and again upon his seat so as to command a sight, sometimes of me and the doctor and sometimes of his unruly ruffians as they went to and fro in the sand between the fire--which they were busy rekindling--and the house, from which they brought forth pork and bread to make the breakfast.", " \u201cJim, Jim,\u201d says he, quite pleased apparently. \u201cWell, now, Jim, I've lived that rough as you'd be ashamed to hear of. Now, for instance, you wouldn't think I had had a pious mother--to look at me?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhy, no, not in particular,\u201d I answered. \u201cAh, well,\u201d said he, \u201cbut I had--remarkable pious. And I was a civil, pious boy, and could rattle off my catechism that fast, as you couldn't tell one word from another. And here's what it come to, Jim, and it begun with chuck-farthen on the blessed grave-stones! That's what it begun with, but it went further'n that; and so my mother told me, and predicked the whole, she did, the pious woman! But it were Providence that put me here. I've thought it all out in this here lonely island, and I'm back on piety. You don't catch me tasting rum so much, but just a thimbleful for luck, of course, the first chance I have. I'm bound I'll be good, and I see the way to."], "What does Silver reveal that Livesey has given him, to Jim\u2019s great astonishment?": [" When the doctor had wormed this secret from him on the afternoon of the attack, and when next morning he saw the anchorage deserted, he had gone to Silver, given him the chart, which was now useless--given him the stores, for Ben Gunn's cave was well supplied with goats' meat salted by himself--given anything and everything to get a chance of moving in safety from the stockade to the two-pointed hill, there to be clear of malaria and keep a guard upon the money. \u201cAs for you, Jim,\u201d he said, \u201cit went against my heart, but I did what I thought best for those who had stood by their duty; and if you were not one of these, whose fault was it?\u201d That morning, finding that I was to be involved in the horrid disappointment he had prepared for the mutineers, he had run all the way to the cave, and leaving the squire to guard the captain, had taken Gray and the maroon and started, making the diagonal across the island to be at hand beside the pine.", " Oh, by Jupiter, and talking of Ben Gunn! Why, this is the mischief in person. Silver!\u201d he cried. \u201cSilver! I'll give you a piece of advice,\u201d he continued as the cook drew near again; \u201cdon't you be in any great hurry after that treasure.\u201d \u201cWhy, sir, I do my possible, which that ain't,\u201d said Silver. \u201cI can only, asking your pardon, save my life and the boy's by seeking for that treasure; and you may lay to that.\u201d \u201cWell, Silver,\u201d replied the doctor, \u201cif that is so, I'll go one step further: look out for squalls when you find it.\u201d \u201cSir,\u201d said Silver, \u201cas between man and man, that's too much and too little. What you're after, why you left the block house, why you given me that there chart, I don't know, now, do I? And yet I done your bidding with my eyes shut and never a word of hope! But no, this here's too much. If you won't tell me what you mean plain out, just say so and I'll leave the helm.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said the doctor musingly; \u201cI've no right to say more; it's not my secret, you see, Silver, or, I give you my word, I'd tell it you.", " In a jiffy I had slipped over the side and curled up in the fore-sheets of the nearest boat, and almost at the same moment she shoved off. No one took notice of me, only the bow oar saying, \u201cIs that you, Jim? Keep your head down.\u201d But Silver, from the other boat, looked sharply over and called out to know if that were me; and from that moment I began to regret what I had done. The crews raced for the beach, but the boat I was in, having some start and being at once the lighter and the better manned, shot far ahead of her consort, and the bow had struck among the shore-side trees and I had caught a branch and swung myself out and plunged into the nearest thicket while Silver and the rest were still a hundred yards behind. \u201cJim, Jim!\u201d I heard him shouting. But you may suppose I paid no heed; jumping, ducking, and breaking through, I ran straight before my nose till I could run no longer. 14 The First Blow I WAS so pleased at having given the slip to Long John that I began to enjoy myself and look around me with some interest on the strange land that I was in.", " Never a month but I've given you a silver fourpenny for yourself. And now you see, mate, I'm pretty low, and deserted by all; and Jim, you'll bring me one noggin of rum, now, won't you, matey?\u201d \u201cThe doctor--\u201d I began. But he broke in cursing the doctor, in a feeble voice but heartily. \u201cDoctors is all swabs,\u201d he said; \u201cand that doctor there, why, what do he know about seafaring men? I been in places hot as pitch, and mates dropping round with Yellow Jack, and the blessed land a-heaving like the sea with earthquakes--what to the doctor know of lands like that?--and I lived on rum, I tell you. It's been meat and drink, and man and wife, to me; and if I'm not to have my rum now I'm a poor old hulk on a lee shore, my blood'll be on you, Jim, and that doctor swab\u201d; and he ran on again for a while with curses. \u201cLook, Jim, how my fingers fidges,\u201d he continued in the pleading tone. \u201cI can't keep 'em still, not I. I haven't had a drop this blessed day."], "What does Silver use to regain the confidence of his men after they hand him a black spot?": [" \u201cJim,\u201d he said at length, \u201cyou saw that seafaring man today?\u201d \u201cBlack Dog?\u201d I asked. \u201cAh! Black Dog,\u201d says he. \u201cHE'S a bad un; but there's worse that put him on. Now, if I can't get away nohow, and they tip me the black spot, mind you, it's my old sea-chest they're after; you get on a horse--you can, can't you? Well, then, you get on a horse, and go to--well, yes, I will!--to that eternal doctor swab, and tell him to pipe all hands--magistrates and sich--and he'll lay 'em aboard at the Admiral Benbow--all old Flint's crew, man and boy, all on 'em that's left. I was first mate, I was, old Flint's first mate, and I'm the on'y one as knows the place. He gave it me at Savannah, when he lay a-dying, like as if I was to now, you see. But you won't peach unless they get the black spot on me, or unless you see that Black Dog again or a seafaring man with one leg, Jim--him above all.\u201d \u201cBut what is the black spot, captain?\u201d I asked.", " Old Pew, as had lost his sight, and might have thought shame, spends twelve hundred pound in a year, like a lord in Parliament. Where is he now? Well, he's dead now and under hatches; but for two year before that, shiver my timbers, the man was starving! He begged, and he stole, and he cut throats, and starved at that, by the powers!\u201d \u201cWell, it ain't much use, after all,\u201d said the young seaman. \u201c'Tain't much use for fools, you may lay to it--that, nor nothing,\u201d cried Silver. \u201cBut now, you look here: you're young, you are, but you're as smart as paint. I see that when I set my eyes on you, and I'll talk to you like a man.\u201d You may imagine how I felt when I heard this abominable old rogue addressing another in the very same words of flattery as he had used to myself. I think, if I had been able, that I would have killed him through the barrel. Meantime, he ran on, little supposing he was overheard.", " Hand it over, lubber. I know the rules, I do; I won't hurt a depytation.\u201d Thus encouraged, the buccaneer stepped forth more briskly, and having passed something to Silver, from hand to hand, slipped yet more smartly back again to his companions. The sea-cook looked at what had been given him. \u201cThe black spot! I thought so,\u201d he observed. \u201cWhere might you have got the paper? Why, hillo! Look here, now; this ain't lucky! You've gone and cut this out of a Bible. What fool's cut a Bible?\u201d \u201cAh, there!\u201d said Morgan. \u201cThere! Wot did I say? No good'll come o' that, I said.\u201d \u201cWell, you've about fixed it now, among you,\u201d continued Silver. \u201cYou'll all swing now, I reckon. What soft-headed lubber had a Bible?\u201d \u201cIt was Dick,\u201d said one. \u201cDick, was it? Then Dick can get to prayers,\u201d said Silver. \u201cHe's seen his slice of luck, has Dick, and you may lay to that.\u201d But here the long man with the yellow eyes struck in.", " Of all the gloomy features of that gloomy afternoon, this obvious anxiety on the part of Long John appeared the worst. We held a council in the cabin. \u201cSir,\u201d said the captain, \u201cif I risk another order, the whole ship'll come about our ears by the run. You see, sir, here it is. I get a rough answer, do I not? Well, if I speak back, pikes will be going in two shakes; if I don't, Silver will see there's something under that, and the game's up. Now, we've only one man to rely on.\u201d \u201cAnd who is that?\u201d asked the squire. \u201cSilver, sir,\u201d returned the captain; \u201che's as anxious as you and I to smother things up. This is a tiff; he'd soon talk 'em out of it if he had the chance, and what I propose to do is to give him the chance. Let's allow the men an afternoon ashore. If they all go, why we'll fight the ship. If they none of them go, well then, we hold the cabin, and God defend the right. If some go, you mark my words, sir, Silver'll bring 'em aboard again as mild as lambs.\u201d It was so decided; loaded pistols were served out to all the sure men; Hunter, Joyce, and Redruth were taken into our confidence and received the news with less surprise and a better spirit than we had looked for, and then the captain went on deck and addressed the crew."], "What is the purpose of Dr. Livesey\u2019s visit to the pirate camp?": [" I began to see that here was one of the best of possible shipmates. When we got to the inn, the squire and Dr. Livesey were seated together, finishing a quart of ale with a toast in it, before they should go aboard the schooner on a visit of inspection. Long John told the story from first to last, with a great deal of spirit and the most perfect truth. \u201cThat was how it were, now, weren't it, Hawkins?\u201d he would say, now and again, and I could always bear him entirely out. The two gentlemen regretted that Black Dog had got away, but we all agreed there was nothing to be done, and after he had been complimented, Long John took up his crutch and departed. \u201cAll hands aboard by four this afternoon,\u201d shouted the squire after him. \u201cAye, aye, sir,\u201d cried the cook, in the passage. \u201cWell, squire,\u201d said Dr. Livesey, \u201cI don't put much faith in your discoveries, as a general thing; but I will say this, John Silver suits me.\u201d \u201cThe man's a perfect trump,\u201d declared the squire.", " \u201cI'll take it, if you like.\u201d \u201cI thought perhaps Dr. Livesey--\u201d I began. \u201cPerfectly right,\u201d he interrupted very cheerily, \u201cperfectly right--a gentleman and a magistrate. And, now I come to think of it, I might as well ride round there myself and report to him or squire. Master Pew's dead, when all's done; not that I regret it, but he's dead, you see, and people will make it out against an officer of his Majesty's revenue, if make it out they can. Now, I'll tell you, Hawkins, if you like, I'll take you along.\u201d I thanked him heartily for the offer, and we walked back to the hamlet where the horses were. By the time I had told mother of my purpose they were all in the saddle. \u201cDogger,\u201d said Mr. Dance, \u201cyou have a good horse; take up this lad behind you.\u201d As soon as I was mounted, holding on to Dogger's belt, the supervisor gave the word, and the party struck out at a bouncing trot on the road to Dr. Livesey's house.", " Captain Smollett, the squire, and Dr. Livesey were talking together on the quarter-deck, and anxious as I was to tell them my story, I durst not interrupt them openly. While I was still casting about in my thoughts to find some probable excuse, Dr. Livesey called me to his side. He had left his pipe below, and being a slave to tobacco, had meant that I should fetch it; but as soon as I was near enough to speak and not to be overheard, I broke immediately, \u201cDoctor, let me speak. Get the captain and squire down to the cabin, and then make some pretence to send for me. I have terrible news.\u201d The doctor changed countenance a little, but next moment he was master of himself. \u201cThank you, Jim,\u201d said he quite loudly, \u201cthat was all I wanted to know,\u201d as if he had asked me a question. And with that he turned on his heel and rejoined the other two. They spoke together for a little, and though none of them started, or raised his voice, or so much as whistled, it was plain enough that Dr. Livesey had communicated my request, for the next thing that I heard was the captain giving an order to Job Anderson, and all hands were piped on deck.", " 6 The Captain's Papers WE rode hard all the way till we drew up before Dr. Livesey's door. The house was all dark to the front. Mr. Dance told me to jump down and knock, and Dogger gave me a stirrup to descend by. The door was opened almost at once by the maid. \u201cIs Dr. Livesey in?\u201d I asked. No, she said, he had come home in the afternoon but had gone up to the hall to dine and pass the evening with the squire. \u201cSo there we go, boys,\u201d said Mr. Dance. This time, as the distance was short, I did not mount, but ran with Dogger's stirrup-leather to the lodge gates and up the long, leafless, moonlit avenue to where the white line of the hall buildings looked on either hand on great old gardens. Here Mr. Dance dismounted, and taking me along with him, was admitted at a word into the house. The servant led us down a matted passage and showed us at the end into a great library, all lined with bookcases and busts upon the top of them, where the squire and Dr. Livesey sat, pipe in hand, on either side of a bright fire."], "On what basis does Silver claim to trust Livesey with his hostage, Jim?": [" When I'm in Parlyment and riding in my coach, I don't want none of these sea-lawyers in the cabin a-coming home, unlooked for, like the devil at prayers. Wait is what I say; but when the time comes, why, let her rip!\u201d \u201cJohn,\u201d cries the coxswain, \u201cyou're a man!\u201d \u201cYou'll say so, Israel when you see,\u201d said Silver. \u201cOnly one thing I claim--I claim Trelawney. I'll wring his calf's head off his body with these hands, Dick!\u201d he added, breaking off. \u201cYou just jump up, like a sweet lad, and get me an apple, to wet my pipe like.\u201d You may fancy the terror I was in! I should have leaped out and run for it if I had found the strength, but my limbs and heart alike misgave me. I heard Dick begin to rise, and then someone seemingly stopped him, and the voice of Hands exclaimed, \u201cOh, stow that! Don't you get sucking of that bilge, John. Let's have a go of the rum.\u201d \u201cDick,\u201d said Silver, \u201cI trust you. I've a gauge on the keg, mind.", " Now, that's about where we are, every mother's son of us, thanks to him, and Hands, and Anderson, and other ruination fools of you. And if you want to know about number four, and that boy, why, shiver my timbers, isn't he a hostage? Are we a-going to waste a hostage? No, not us; he might be our last chance, and I shouldn't wonder. Kill that boy? Not me, mates! And number three? Ah, well, there's a deal to say to number three. Maybe you don't count it nothing to have a real college doctor to see you every day--you, John, with your head broke--or you, George Merry, that had the ague shakes upon you not six hours agone, and has your eyes the colour of lemon peel to this same moment on the clock? And maybe, perhaps, you didn't know there was a consort coming either? But there is, and not so long till then; and we'll see who'll be glad to have a hostage when it comes to that. And as for number two, and why I made a bargain--well, you came crawling on your knees to me to make it--on your knees you came, you was that downhearted--and you'd have starved too if I hadn't--but that's a trifle!", " \u201cSilver?\u201d I asked. \u201cAh, Silver!\u201d says he. \u201cThat were his name.\u201d \u201cHe's the cook, and the ringleader too.\u201d He was still holding me by the wrist, and at that he give it quite a wring. \u201cIf you was sent by Long John,\u201d he said, \u201cI'm as good as pork, and I know it. But where was you, do you suppose?\u201d I had made my mind up in a moment, and by way of answer told him the whole story of our voyage and the predicament in which we found ourselves. He heard me with the keenest interest, and when I had done he patted me on the head. \u201cYou're a good lad, Jim,\u201d he said; \u201cand you're all in a clove hitch, ain't you? Well, you just put your trust in Ben Gunn--Ben Gunn's the man to do it. Would you think it likely, now, that your squire would prove a liberal-minded one in case of help--him being in a clove hitch, as you remark?\u201d I told him the squire was the most liberal of men. \u201cAye, but you see,\u201d returned Ben Gunn, \u201cI didn't mean giving me a gate to keep, and a suit of livery clothes, and such; that's not my mark, Jim.", " I ax your pardon, sir, acknowledging you for to be captaing at this present; but I claim my right, and steps outside for a council.\u201d And with an elaborate sea-salute, this fellow, a long, ill-looking, yellow-eyed man of five and thirty, stepped coolly towards the door and disappeared out of the house. One after another the rest followed his example, each making a salute as he passed, each adding some apology. \u201cAccording to rules,\u201d said one. \u201cForecastle council,\u201d said Morgan. And so with one remark or another all marched out and left Silver and me alone with the torch. The sea-cook instantly removed his pipe. \u201cNow, look you here, Jim Hawkins,\u201d he said in a steady whisper that was no more than audible, \u201cyou're within half a plank of death, and what's a long sight worse, of torture. They're going to throw me off. But, you mark, I stand by you through thick and thin. I didn't mean to; no, not till you spoke up."], "What marker do the pirates find pointing in the direction the treasure?": [" But for some disarray (the work, perhaps, of the birds that had fed upon him or of the slow-growing creeper that had gradually enveloped his remains) the man lay perfectly straight--his feet pointing in one direction, his hands, raised above his head like a diver's, pointing directly in the opposite. \u201cI've taken a notion into my old numbskull,\u201d observed Silver. \u201cHere's the compass; there's the tip-top p'int o' Skeleton Island, stickin' out like a tooth. Just take a bearing, will you, along the line of them bones.\u201d It was done. The body pointed straight in the direction of the island, and the compass read duly E.S.E. and by E. \u201cI thought so,\u201d cried the cook; \u201cthis here is a p'inter. Right up there is our line for the Pole Star and the jolly dollars. But, by thunder! If it don't make me cold inside to think of Flint. This is one of HIS jokes, and no mistake. Him and these six was alone here; he killed 'em, every man; and this one he hauled here and laid down by compass, shiver my timbers!", " But, there he was, you mind, and the six all dead--dead and buried. How he done it, not a man aboard us could make out. It was battle, murder, and sudden death, leastways--him against six. Billy Bones was the mate; Long John, he was quartermaster; and they asked him where the treasure was. 'Ah,' says he, 'you can go ashore, if you like, and stay,' he says; 'but as for the ship, she'll beat up for more, by thunder!' That's what he said. \u201cWell, I was in another ship three years back, and we sighted this island. 'Boys,' said I, 'here's Flint's treasure; let's land and find it.' The cap'n was displeased at that, but my messmates were all of a mind and landed. Twelve days they looked for it, and every day they had the worse word for me, until one fine morning all hands went aboard. 'As for you, Benjamin Gunn,' says they, 'here's a musket,' they says, 'and a spade, and pick-axe. You can stay here and find Flint's money for yourself,' they says.", " You don't, you say, like this cruise. Now, why?\u201d \u201cI was engaged, sir, on what we call sealed orders, to sail this ship for that gentleman where he should bid me,\u201d said the captain. \u201cSo far so good. But now I find that every man before the mast knows more than I do. I don't call that fair, now, do you?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Dr. Livesey, \u201cI don't.\u201d \u201cNext,\u201d said the captain, \u201cI learn we are going after treasure--hear it from my own hands, mind you. Now, treasure is ticklish work; I don't like treasure voyages on any account, and I don't like them, above all, when they are secret and when (begging your pardon, Mr. Trelawney) the secret has been told to the parrot.\u201d \u201cSilver's parrot?\u201d asked the squire. \u201cIt's a way of speaking,\u201d said the captain. \u201cBlabbed, I mean. It's my belief neither of you gentlemen know what you are about, but I'll tell you my way of it--life or death, and a close run.\u201d \u201cThat is all clear, and, I dare say, true enough,\u201d replied Dr. Livesey.", " *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TREASURE ISLAND *** Produced by Judy Boss, John Hamm and David Widger TREASURE ISLAND by Robert Louis Stevenson TREASURE ISLAND To S.L.O., an American gentleman in accordance with whose classic taste the following narrative has been designed, it is now, in return for numerous delightful hours, and with the kindest wishes, dedicated by his affectionate friend, the author.

And may I And all my pirates share the grave Where these and their creations lie!", " This put me in a great fear, and I crawled under cover of the nearest live-oak and squatted there, hearkening, as silent as a mouse. Another voice answered, and then the first voice, which I now recognized to be Silver's, once more took up the story and ran on for a long while in a stream, only now and again interrupted by the other. By the sound they must have been talking earnestly, and almost fiercely; but no distinct word came to my hearing. At last the speakers seemed to have paused and perhaps to have sat down, for not only did they cease to draw any nearer, but the birds themselves began to grow more quiet and to settle again to their places in the swamp. And now I began to feel that I was neglecting my business, that since I had been so foolhardy as to come ashore with these desperadoes, the least I could do was to overhear them at their councils, and that my plain and obvious duty was to draw as close as I could manage, under the favourable ambush of the crouching trees.", " Jim, that's one to you. This is the first glint of hope I had since the attack failed, and I owe it you. And now, Jim, we're to go in for this here treasure-hunting, with sealed orders too, and I don't like it; and you and me must stick close, back to back like, and we'll save our necks in spite o' fate and fortune.\u201d Just then a man hailed us from the fire that breakfast was ready, and we were soon seated here and there about the sand over biscuit and fried junk. They had lit a fire fit to roast an ox, and it was now grown so hot that they could only approach it from the windward, and even there not without precaution. In the same wasteful spirit, they had cooked, I suppose, three times more than we could eat; and one of them, with an empty laugh, threw what was left into the fire, which blazed and roared again over this unusual fuel. I never in my life saw men so careless of the morrow; hand to mouth is the only word that can describe their way of doing; and what with wasted food and sleeping sentries, though they were bold enough for a brush and be done with it, I could see their entire unfitness for anything like a prolonged campaign.", " But I'll go as far with you as I dare go, and a step beyond, for I'll have my wig sorted by the captain or I'm mistaken! And first, I'll give you a bit of hope; Silver, if we both get alive out of this wolf-trap, I'll do my best to save you, short of perjury.\u201d Silver's face was radiant. \u201cYou couldn't say more, I'm sure, sir, not if you was my mother,\u201d he cried. \u201cWell, that's my first concession,\u201d added the doctor. \u201cMy second is a piece of advice: keep the boy close beside you, and when you need help, halloo. I'm off to seek it for you, and that itself will show you if I speak at random. Good-bye, Jim.\u201d And Dr. Livesey shook hands with me through the stockade, nodded to Silver, and set off at a brisk pace into the wood. 31 The Treasure-hunt--Flint's Pointer \u201cJIM,\u201d said Silver when we were alone, \u201cif I saved your life, you saved mine; and I'll not forget it. I seen the doctor waving you to run for it--with the tail of my eye, I did; and I seen you say no, as plain as hearing."], "Who found Flint\u2019s treasure and moved it to a cave, rendering the original treasure map useless?": [" When the doctor had wormed this secret from him on the afternoon of the attack, and when next morning he saw the anchorage deserted, he had gone to Silver, given him the chart, which was now useless--given him the stores, for Ben Gunn's cave was well supplied with goats' meat salted by himself--given anything and everything to get a chance of moving in safety from the stockade to the two-pointed hill, there to be clear of malaria and keep a guard upon the money. \u201cAs for you, Jim,\u201d he said, \u201cit went against my heart, but I did what I thought best for those who had stood by their duty; and if you were not one of these, whose fault was it?\u201d That morning, finding that I was to be involved in the horrid disappointment he had prepared for the mutineers, he had run all the way to the cave, and leaving the squire to guard the captain, had taken Gray and the maroon and started, making the diagonal across the island to be at hand beside the pine.", " \u201cVery good,\u201d said the captain. \u201cThen, as you've heard me very patiently, saying things that I could not prove, hear me a few words more. They are putting the powder and the arms in the fore hold. Now, you have a good place under the cabin; why not put them there?--first point. Then, you are bringing four of your own people with you, and they tell me some of them are to be berthed forward. Why not give them the berths here beside the cabin?--second point.\u201d \u201cAny more?\u201d asked Mr. Trelawney. \u201cOne more,\u201d said the captain. \u201cThere's been too much blabbing already.\u201d \u201cFar too much,\u201d agreed the doctor. \u201cI'll tell you what I've heard myself,\u201d continued Captain Smollett: \u201cthat you have a map of an island, that there's crosses on the map to show where treasure is, and that the island lies--\u201d And then he named the latitude and longitude exactly. \u201cI never told that,\u201d cried the squire, \u201cto a soul!\u201d \u201cThe hands know it, sir,\u201d returned the captain.", " But, there he was, you mind, and the six all dead--dead and buried.

What were these villains after but money? What do they care for but money? For what would they risk their rascal carcasses but money?\u201d \u201cThat we shall soon know,\u201d replied the doctor. \u201cBut you are so confoundedly hot-headed and exclamatory that I cannot get a word in. What I want to know is this: Supposing that I have here in my pocket some clue to where Flint buried his treasure, will that treasure amount to much?\u201d \u201cAmount, sir!\u201d cried the squire. \u201cIt will amount to this: If we have the clue you talk about, I fit out a ship in Bristol dock, and take you and Hawkins here along, and I'll have that treasure if I search a year.\u201d \u201cVery well,\u201d said the doctor."], "What most fascinates Jim about the coins that the men find in the cave?": [" When the doctor had wormed this secret from him on the afternoon of the attack, and when next morning he saw the anchorage deserted, he had gone to Silver, given him the chart, which was now useless--given him the stores, for Ben Gunn's cave was well supplied with goats' meat salted by himself--given anything and everything to get a chance of moving in safety from the stockade to the two-pointed hill, there to be clear of malaria and keep a guard upon the money. \u201cAs for you, Jim,\u201d he said, \u201cit went against my heart, but I did what I thought best for those who had stood by their duty; and if you were not one of these, whose fault was it?\u201d That morning, finding that I was to be involved in the horrid disappointment he had prepared for the mutineers, he had run all the way to the cave, and leaving the squire to guard the captain, had taken Gray and the maroon and started, making the diagonal across the island to be at hand beside the pine.", " A gentle slope ran up from the beach to the entrance of the cave. At the top, the squire met us. To me he was cordial and kind, saying nothing of my escapade either in the way of blame or praise. At Silver's polite salute he somewhat flushed. \u201cJohn Silver,\u201d he said, \u201cyou're a prodigious villain and imposter--a monstrous imposter, sir. I am told I am not to prosecute you. Well, then, I will not. But the dead men, sir, hang about your neck like mill-stones.\u201d \u201cThank you kindly, sir,\u201d replied Long John, again saluting. \u201cI dare you to thank me!\u201d cried the squire. \u201cIt is a gross dereliction of my duty. Stand back.\u201d And thereupon we all entered the cave. It was a large, airy place, with a little spring and a pool of clear water, overhung with ferns. The floor was sand. Before a big fire lay Captain Smollett; and in a far corner, only duskily flickered over by the blaze, I beheld great heaps of coin and quadrilaterals built of bars of gold.", " \u201cSo, Jim,\u201d said the doctor sadly, \u201chere you are. As you have brewed, so shall you drink, my boy. Heaven knows, I cannot find it in my heart to blame you, but this much I will say, be it kind or unkind: when Captain Smollett was well, you dared not have gone off; and when he was ill and couldn't help it, by George, it was downright cowardly!\u201d I will own that I here began to weep. \u201cDoctor,\u201d I said, \u201cyou might spare me. I have blamed myself enough; my life's forfeit anyway, and I should have been dead by now if Silver hadn't stood for me; and doctor, believe this, I can die--and I dare say I deserve it--but what I fear is torture. If they come to torture me--\u201d \u201cJim,\u201d the doctor interrupted, and his voice was quite changed, \u201cJim, I can't have this. Whip over, and we'll run for it.\u201d \u201cDoctor,\u201d said I, \u201cI passed my word.\u201d \u201cI know, I know,\u201d he cried. \u201cWe can't help that, Jim, now. I'll take it on my shoulders, holus bolus, blame and shame, my boy; but stay here, I cannot let you.", " This sudden noise startled us shockingly; but the news was good, for it was only six. \u201cNow, Jim,\u201d she said, \u201cthat key.\u201d I felt in his pockets, one after another. A few small coins, a thimble, and some thread and big needles, a piece of pigtail tobacco bitten away at the end, his gully with the crooked handle, a pocket compass, and a tinder box were all that they contained, and I began to despair. \u201cPerhaps it's round his neck,\u201d suggested my mother. Overcoming a strong repugnance, I tore open his shirt at the neck, and there, sure enough, hanging to a bit of tarry string, which I cut with his own gully, we found the key. At this triumph we were filled with hope and hurried upstairs without delay to the little room where he had slept so long and where his box had stood since the day of his arrival. It was like any other seaman's chest on the outside, the initial \u201cB\u201d burned on the top of it with a hot iron, and the corners somewhat smashed and broken as by long, rough usage."], "Who or what features in Jim\u2019s nightmares about treasure hunting?": [" Even Silver, eating away, with Captain Flint upon his shoulder, had not a word of blame for their recklessness. And this the more surprised me, for I thought he had never shown himself so cunning as he did then. \u201cAye, mates,\u201d said he, \u201cit's lucky you have Barbecue to think for you with this here head. I got what I wanted, I did. Sure enough, they have the ship. Where they have it, I don't know yet; but once we hit the treasure, we'll have to jump about and find out. And then, mates, us that has the boats, I reckon, has the upper hand.\u201d Thus he kept running on, with his mouth full of the hot bacon; thus he restored their hope and confidence, and, I more than suspect, repaired his own at the same time. \u201cAs for hostage,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat's his last talk, I guess, with them he loves so dear. I've got my piece o' news, and thanky to him for that; but it's over and done. I'll take him in a line when we go treasure-hunting, for we'll keep him like so much gold, in case of accidents, you mark, and in the meantime.", " Jim, that's one to you. This is the first glint of hope I had since the attack failed, and I owe it you. And now, Jim, we're to go in for this here treasure-hunting, with sealed orders too, and I don't like it; and you and me must stick close, back to back like, and we'll save our necks in spite o' fate and fortune.\u201d Just then a man hailed us from the fire that breakfast was ready, and we were soon seated here and there about the sand over biscuit and fried junk.

But by this time we had all long ceased to pay any particular notice to the song; it was new, that night, to nobody but Dr. Livesey, and on him I observed it did not produce an agreeable effect, for he looked up for a moment quite angrily before he went on with his talk to old Taylor, the gardener, on a new cure for the rheumatics. In the meantime, the captain gradually brightened up at his own music, and at last flapped his hand upon the table before him in a way we all knew to mean silence. The voices stopped at once, all but Dr. Livesey's; he went on as before speaking clear and kind and drawing briskly at his pipe between every word or two.", " \u201cThen, doctor,\u201d said Silver, \u201cyou just step outside o' that stockade, and once you're there I'll bring the boy down on the inside, and I reckon you can yarn through the spars. Good day to you, sir, and all our dooties to the squire and Cap'n Smollett.\u201d The explosion of disapproval, which nothing but Silver's black looks had restrained, broke out immediately the doctor had left the house. Silver was roundly accused of playing double--of trying to make a separate peace for himself, of sacrificing the interests of his accomplices and victims, and, in one word, of the identical, exact thing that he was doing. It seemed to me so obvious, in this case, that I could not imagine how he was to turn their anger. But he was twice the man the rest were, and his last night's victory had given him a huge preponderance on their minds. He called them all the fools and dolts you can imagine, said it was necessary I should talk to the doctor, fluttered the chart in their faces, asked them if they could afford to break the treaty the very day they were bound a-treasure-hunting."]}
