But wherefore could not I pronounce \u201cAmen\u201d? I had most need of blessing, and \u201cAmen\u201d Stuck in my throat. LADY MACBETH. These deeds must not be thought After these ways; so, it will make us mad. MACBETH. Methought I heard a voice cry, \u201cSleep no more!

As whence the sun \u2019gins his reflection Shipwracking storms and direful thunders break, So from that spring, whence comfort seem\u2019d to come Discomfort swells. Mark, King of Scotland, mark: No sooner justice had, with valour arm\u2019d, Compell\u2019d these skipping kerns to trust their heels, But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage, With furbish\u2019d arms and new supplies of men, Began a fresh assault."], "Who flees Scotlandimmediately after Duncan\u2019s death?": [" LADY MACBETH.

The worthy Thane of Ross. LENNOX. What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look That seems to speak things strange. ROSS. God save the King! DUNCAN. Whence cam\u2019st thou, worthy thane? ROSS. From Fife, great King, Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky And fan our people cold. Norway himself, with terrible numbers, Assisted by that most disloyal traitor, The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict; Till that Bellona\u2019s bridegroom, lapp\u2019d in proof, Confronted him with self-comparisons, Point against point, rebellious arm \u2019gainst arm, Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude, The victory fell on us. DUNCAN. Great happiness! ROSS. That now Sweno, the Norways\u2019 king, craves composition; Nor would we deign him burial of his men Till he disbursed at Saint Colme\u2019s Inch Ten thousand dollars to our general use. DUNCAN. No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive Our bosom interest.", " MALCOLM. My liege, They are not yet come back. But I have spoke With one that saw him die, who did report, That very frankly he confess\u2019d his treasons, Implor\u2019d your Highness\u2019 pardon, and set forth A deep repentance. Nothing in his life Became him like the leaving it; he died As one that had been studied in his death, To throw away the dearest thing he ow\u2019d As \u2019twere a careless trifle. DUNCAN. There\u2019s no art To find the mind\u2019s construction in the face: He was a gentleman on whom I built An absolute trust. Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Ross and Angus. O worthiest cousin! The sin of my ingratitude even now Was heavy on me. Thou art so far before, That swiftest wing of recompense is slow To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserv\u2019d; That the proportion both of thanks and payment Might have been mine! only I have left to say, More is thy due than more than all can pay. MACBETH. The service and the loyalty I owe, In doing it, pays itself.

The gracious Duncan Was pitied of Macbeth:\u2014marry, he was dead:\u2014 And the right valiant Banquo walk\u2019d too late; Whom, you may say, if\u2019t please you, Fleance kill\u2019d, For Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late. Who cannot want the thought, how monstrous It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain To kill their gracious father? damned fact! How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight, In pious rage, the two delinquents tear That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep? Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too; For \u2019twould have anger\u2019d any heart alive, To hear the men deny\u2019t. So that, I say, He has borne all things well: and I do think, That had he Duncan\u2019s sons under his key (As, and\u2019t please heaven, he shall not) they should find What \u2019twere to kill a father; so should Fleance. But, peace!\u2014for from broad words, and \u2019cause he fail\u2019d His presence at the tyrant\u2019s feast, I hear, Macduff lives in disgrace."], "Who jokes thathe works at \u201chell gate\u201d?": [" LADY MACBETH. What\u2019s to be done? MACBETH. Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck, Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night, Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day, And with thy bloody and invisible hand Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond Which keeps me pale!\u2014Light thickens; and the crow Makes wing to th\u2019 rooky wood. Good things of day begin to droop and drowse, Whiles night\u2019s black agents to their preys do rouse.

A Park or Lawn, with a gate leading to the Palace. Enter three Murderers. FIRST MURDERER. But who did bid thee join with us? THIRD MURDERER. Macbeth. SECOND MURDERER. He needs not our mistrust; since he delivers Our offices and what we have to do To the direction just. FIRST MURDERER. Then stand with us. The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day. Now spurs the lated traveller apace, To gain the timely inn; and near approaches The subject of our watch. THIRD MURDERER. Hark! I hear horses. BANQUO. [_Within._] Give us a light there, ho! SECOND MURDERER. Then \u2019tis he; the rest That are within the note of expectation Already are i\u2019 th\u2019 court. FIRST MURDERER. His horses go about. THIRD MURDERER. Almost a mile; but he does usually, So all men do, from hence to the palace gate Make it their walk. Enter Banquo and Fleance with a torch.", " LADY MACBETH. Infirm of purpose! Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead Are but as pictures. \u2019Tis the eye of childhood That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed, I\u2019ll gild the faces of the grooms withal, For it must seem their guilt. [_Exit. Knocking within._] MACBETH. Whence is that knocking? How is\u2019t with me, when every noise appals me? What hands are here? Ha, they pluck out mine eyes! Will all great Neptune\u2019s ocean wash this blood Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather The multitudinous seas incarnadine, Making the green one red. Enter Lady Macbeth. LADY MACBETH. My hands are of your color, but I shame To wear a heart so white. [_Knocking within._] I hear knocking At the south entry:\u2014retire we to our chamber. A little water clears us of this deed: How easy is it then! Your constancy Hath left you unattended.\u2014[_Knocking within._] Hark, more knocking. Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us And show us to be watchers. Be not lost So poorly in your thoughts. MACBETH. To know my deed, \u2019twere best not know myself. [_Knocking within._] Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst! [_Exeunt._] SCENE III. The same. Enter a Porter. Knocking within. PORTER. Here\u2019s a knocking indeed! If a man were porter of hell gate, he should have old turning the key. [_Knocking._] Knock, knock, knock. Who\u2019s there, i\u2019 th\u2019 name of Belzebub?

[_Knocking._] Knock, knock, knock! Who\u2019s there? Faith, here\u2019s an English tailor come hither, for stealing out of a French hose: come in, tailor; here you may roast your goose. [_Knocking._] Knock, knock. Never at quiet! What are you?\u2014But this place is too cold for hell. I\u2019ll devil-porter it no further: I had thought to have let in some of all professions, that go the primrose way to th\u2019 everlasting bonfire. [_Knocking._] Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter. [_Opens the gate._] Enter Macduff and Lennox. MACDUFF. Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed, That you do lie so late? PORTER. Faith, sir, we were carousing till the second cock; and drink, sir, is a great provoker of three things. MACDUFF. What three things does drink especially provoke? PORTER. Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes and unprovokes; it provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him, and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and giving him the lie, leaves him.", " Is\u2019t far you ride?

Fail not our feast. BANQUO. My lord, I will not. MACBETH. We hear our bloody cousins are bestow\u2019d In England and in Ireland; not confessing Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers With strange invention.

Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon\u2019s. MACBETH. I wish your horses swift and sure of foot; And so I do commend you to their backs. Farewell.\u2014 [_Exit Banquo._] Let every man be master of his time Till seven at night; to make society The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself Till supper time alone: while then, God be with you.

[_Exit Servant._] To be thus is nothing, But to be safely thus. Our fears in Banquo Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature Reigns that which would be fear\u2019d: \u2019tis much he dares; And, to that dauntless temper of his mind, He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour To act in safety.

ROSS. From Fife, great King, Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky And fan our people cold. Norway himself, with terrible numbers, Assisted by that most disloyal traitor, The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict; Till that Bellona\u2019s bridegroom, lapp\u2019d in proof, Confronted him with self-comparisons, Point against point, rebellious arm \u2019gainst arm, Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude, The victory fell on us.

Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes and unprovokes; it provokes the desire, but it takes away the performance. Therefore much drink may be said to be an equivocator with lechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it sets him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him, and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him in a sleep, and giving him the lie, leaves him.", " LADY MACBETH.
