Norway himself, with terrible numbers, Assisted by that most disloyal traitor, The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict; Till that Bellona\u2019s bridegroom, lapp\u2019d in proof, Confronted him with self-comparisons, Point against point, rebellious arm \u2019gainst arm, Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude, The victory fell on us.

This diamond he greets your wife withal, By the name of most kind hostess, and shut up In measureless content. MACBETH. Being unprepar\u2019d, Our will became the servant to defect, Which else should free have wrought. BANQUO. All\u2019s well. I dreamt last night of the three Weird Sisters: To you they have show\u2019d some truth. MACBETH.

Doubtful it stood; As two spent swimmers that do cling together And choke their art.

What sights, my lord? LADY MACBETH. I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse; Question enrages him. At once, good night:\u2014 Stand not upon the order of your going, But go at once. LENNOX. Good night; and better health Attend his Majesty! LADY MACBETH. A kind good night to all! [_Exeunt all Lords and Atendants._] MACBETH. It will have blood, they say, blood will have blood.

But I have spoke With one that saw him die, who did report, That very frankly he confess\u2019d his treasons, Implor\u2019d your Highness\u2019 pardon, and set forth A deep repentance.

The time approaches, That will with due decision make us know What we shall say we have, and what we owe.

On Tuesday last, A falcon, towering in her pride of place, Was by a mousing owl hawk\u2019d at and kill\u2019d. ROSS. And Duncan\u2019s horses (a thing most strange and certain) Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race, Turn\u2019d wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out, Contending \u2019gainst obedience, as they would make War with mankind. OLD MAN. \u2019Tis said they eat each other. ROSS. They did so; to the amazement of mine eyes, That look\u2019d upon\u2019t. Here comes the good Macduff. Enter Macduff. How goes the world, sir, now? MACDUFF. Why, see you not? ROSS. Is\u2019t known who did this more than bloody deed? MACDUFF. Those that Macbeth hath slain. ROSS. Alas, the day! What good could they pretend? MACDUFF. They were suborn\u2019d. Malcolm and Donalbain, the King\u2019s two sons, Are stol\u2019n away and fled; which puts upon them Suspicion of the deed.

There is none but he Whose being I do fear: and under him My genius is rebuk\u2019d; as, it is said, Mark Antony\u2019s was by Caesar. He chid the sisters When first they put the name of king upon me, And bade them speak to him; then, prophet-like, They hail\u2019d him father to a line of kings: Upon my head they plac\u2019d a fruitless crown, And put a barren sceptre in my gripe, Thence to be wrench\u2019d with an unlineal hand, No son of mine succeeding. If\u2019t be so, For Banquo\u2019s issue have I fil\u2019d my mind; For them the gracious Duncan have I murder\u2019d; Put rancours in the vessel of my peace Only for them; and mine eternal jewel Given to the common enemy of man, To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!"], "How does Lady Macbeth achieve her ambitious plans for Macbeth?": [" It was the owl that shriek\u2019d, the fatal bellman, Which gives the stern\u2019st good night.

Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane, You do unbend your noble strength to think So brainsickly of things. Go get some water, And wash this filthy witness from your hand.\u2014 Why did you bring these daggers from the place? They must lie there: go carry them, and smear The sleepy grooms with blood. MACBETH. I\u2019ll go no more: I am afraid to think what I have done; Look on\u2019t again I dare not. LADY MACBETH. Infirm of purpose! Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead Are but as pictures. \u2019Tis the eye of childhood That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed, I\u2019ll gild the faces of the grooms withal, For it must seem their guilt.

O gentle lady, \u2019Tis not for you to hear what I can speak: The repetition, in a woman\u2019s ear, Would murder as it fell. Enter Banquo. O Banquo, Banquo! Our royal master\u2019s murder\u2019d! LADY MACBETH. Woe, alas! What, in our house? BANQUO. Too cruel anywhere.\u2014 Dear Duff, I pr\u2019ythee, contradict thyself, And say it is not so. Enter Macbeth and Lennox with Ross. MACBETH. Had I but died an hour before this chance, I had liv\u2019d a blessed time; for, from this instant There\u2019s nothing serious in mortality. All is but toys: renown and grace is dead; The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees Is left this vault to brag of. Enter Malcolm and Donalbain. DONALBAIN. What is amiss? MACBETH.
