{"A Taleof Two Cities opens in Which of the following does not characterize this period?": [" The Period It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way-- in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only. There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general were settled for ever. It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period, as at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally deficient in originality) rapped out theirs.", " Suffer them and forbid them not. They see my Father's face. O Father, blessed words! Thus, the rustling of an Angel's wings got blended with the other echoes, and they were not wholly of earth, but had in them that breath of Heaven. Sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden-tomb were mingled with them also, and both were audible to Lucie, in a hushed murmur--like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore--as the little Lucie, comically studious at the task of the morning, or dressing a doll at her mother's footstool, chattered in the tongues of the Two Cities that were blended in her life. The Echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of Sydney Carton. Some half-dozen times a year, at most, he claimed his privilege of coming in uninvited, and would sit among them through the evening, as he had once done often. He never came there heated with wine. And one other thing regarding him was whispered in the echoes, which has been whispered by all true echoes for ages and ages. No man ever really loved a woman, lost her, and knew her with a blameless though an unchanged mind, when she was a wife and a mother, but her children had a strange sympathy with him--an instinctive delicacy of pity for him. What fine hidden sensibilities are touched in such a case, no echoes tell; but it is so, and it was so here. Carton was the first stranger to whom little Lucie held out her chubby arms, and he kept his place with her as she grew.", " In your own heart, do you feel quite certain?\u201d Her father answered, with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could scarcely have assumed, \u201cQuite sure, my darling! More than that,\u201d he added, as he tenderly kissed her: \u201cmy future is far brighter, Lucie, seen through your marriage, than it could have been--nay, than it ever was--without it.\u201d \u201cIf I could hope _that_, my father!--\u201d \u201cBelieve it, love! Indeed it is so. Consider how natural and how plain it is, my dear, that it should be so. You, devoted and young, cannot fully appreciate the anxiety I have felt that your life should not be wasted--\u201d She moved her hand towards his lips, but he took it in his, and repeated the word. \u201c--wasted, my child--should not be wasted, struck aside from the natural order of things--for my sake. Your unselfishness cannot entirely comprehend how much my mind has gone on this; but, only ask yourself, how could my happiness be perfect, while yours was incomplete?\u201d \u201cIf I had never seen Charles, my father, I should have been quite happy with you.\u201d He smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy without Charles, having seen him; and replied: \u201cMy child, you did see him, and it is Charles. If it had not been Charles, it would have been another. Or, if it had been no other, I should have been the cause, and then the dark part of my life would have cast its shadow beyond myself, and would have fallen on you.\u201d It was the first time, except at the trial, of her ever hearing him refer to the period of his suffering.", " Finally, he had proposed, after anxious consideration, that Miss Pross and Jerry, who were at liberty to leave the city, should leave it at three o'clock in the lightest-wheeled conveyance known to that period. Unencumbered with luggage, they would soon overtake the coach, and, passing it and preceding it on the road, would order its horses in advance, and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours of the night, when delay was the most to be dreaded. Seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that pressing emergency, Miss Pross hailed it with joy. She and Jerry had beheld the coach start, had known who it was that Solomon brought, had passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense, and were now concluding their arrangements to follow the coach, even as Madame Defarge, taking her way through the streets, now drew nearer and nearer to the else-deserted lodging in which they held their consultation. \u201cNow what do you think, Mr. Cruncher,\u201d said Miss Pross, whose agitation was so great that she could hardly speak, or stand, or move, or live: \u201cwhat do you think of our not starting from this courtyard? Another carriage having already gone from here to-day, it might awaken suspicion.\u201d \u201cMy opinion, miss,\u201d returned Mr. Cruncher, \u201cis as you're right. Likewise wot I'll stand by you, right or wrong.\u201d \u201cI am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures,\u201d said Miss Pross, wildly crying, \u201cthat I am incapable of forming any plan."], "Why are the driversof the Dover mail coach hesitant to stop for Jerry Cruncher\u2019s message?": [" In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer, and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer's boy of sixpence. All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded, those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights with a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small creatures--the creatures of this chronicle among the rest--along the roads that lay before them. II. The Mail It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November, before the first of the persons with whom this history has business. The Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up Shooter's Hill. He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail, as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill, and the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back to Blackheath.", " \u201cNo, Jerry, no!\u201d said the messenger, harping on one theme as he rode. \u201cIt wouldn't do for you, Jerry. Jerry, you honest tradesman, it wouldn't suit _your_ line of business! Recalled--! Bust me if I don't think he'd been a drinking!\u201d His message perplexed his mind to that degree that he was fain, several times, to take off his hat to scratch his head. Except on the crown, which was raggedly bald, he had stiff, black hair, standing jaggedly all over it, and growing down hill almost to his broad, blunt nose. It was so like Smith's work, so much more like the top of a strongly spiked wall than a head of hair, that the best of players at leap-frog might have declined him, as the most dangerous man in the world to go over. While he trotted back with the message he was to deliver to the night watchman in his box at the door of Tellson's Bank, by Temple Bar, who was to deliver it to greater authorities within, the shadows of the night took such shapes to him as arose out of the message, and took such shapes to the mare as arose out of _her_ private topics of uneasiness. They seemed to be numerous, for she shied at every shadow on the road. What time, the mail-coach lumbered, jolted, rattled, and bumped upon its tedious way, with its three fellow-inscrutables inside. To whom, likewise, the shadows of the night revealed themselves, in the forms their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested.", " The passenger booked by this history, was on the coach-step, getting in; the two other passengers were close behind him, and about to follow. He remained on the step, half in the coach and half out of; they remained in the road below him. They all looked from the coachman to the guard, and from the guard to the coachman, and listened. The coachman looked back and the guard looked back, and even the emphatic leader pricked up his ears and looked back, without contradicting. The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet indeed. The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to the coach, as if it were in a state of agitation. The hearts of the passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding the breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation. The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill. \u201cSo-ho!\u201d the guard sang out, as loud as he could roar. \u201cYo there! Stand! I shall fire!\u201d The pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering, a man's voice called from the mist, \u201cIs that the Dover mail?\u201d \u201cNever you mind what it is!\u201d the guard retorted. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d \u201c_Is_ that the Dover mail?\u201d \u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d \u201cI want a passenger, if it is.\u201d \u201cWhat passenger?\u201d \u201cMr.", " Young Jerry, walking with the stool under his arm at his father's side along sunny and crowded Fleet-street, was a very different Young Jerry from him of the previous night, running home through darkness and solitude from his grim pursuer. His cunning was fresh with the day, and his qualms were gone with the night--in which particulars it is not improbable that he had compeers in Fleet-street and the City of London, that fine morning. \u201cFather,\u201d said Young Jerry, as they walked along: taking care to keep at arm's length and to have the stool well between them: \u201cwhat's a Resurrection-Man?\u201d Mr. Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered, \u201cHow should I know?\u201d \u201cI thought you knowed everything, father,\u201d said the artless boy. \u201cHem! Well,\u201d returned Mr. Cruncher, going on again, and lifting off his hat to give his spikes free play, \u201che's a tradesman.\u201d \u201cWhat's his goods, father?\u201d asked the brisk Young Jerry. \u201cHis goods,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, after turning it over in his mind, \u201cis a branch of Scientific goods.\u201d \u201cPersons' bodies, ain't it, father?\u201d asked the lively boy. \u201cI believe it is something of that sort,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher. \u201cOh, father, I should so like to be a Resurrection-Man when I'm quite growed up!\u201d Mr. Cruncher was soothed, but shook his head in a dubious and moral way. \u201cIt depends upon how you dewelop your talents. Be careful to dewelop your talents, and never to say no more than you can help to nobody, and there's no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit for.\u201d As Young Jerry, thus encouraged, went on a few yards in advance, to plant the stool in the shadow of the Bar, Mr. Cruncher added to himself: \u201cJerry, you honest tradesman, there's hopes wot that boy will yet be a blessing to you, and a recompense to you for his mother!\u201d XV."], "What object doesDoctor Manette keep during his imprisonment in order to escape \u201cinspirit\u201d?": [" Among the lookers-on there was the same expression in all quarters of the court; insomuch, that a great majority of the foreheads there, might have been mirrors reflecting the witness, when the Judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous heresy about George Washington. Mr. Attorney-General now signified to my Lord, that he deemed it necessary, as a matter of precaution and form, to call the young lady's father, Doctor Manette. Who was called accordingly. \u201cDoctor Manette, look upon the prisoner. Have you ever seen him before?\u201d \u201cOnce. When he called at my lodgings in London. Some three years, or three years and a half ago.\u201d \u201cCan you identify him as your fellow-passenger on board the packet, or speak to his conversation with your daughter?\u201d \u201cSir, I can do neither.\u201d \u201cIs there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do either?\u201d He answered, in a low voice, \u201cThere is.\u201d \u201cHas it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment, without trial, or even accusation, in your native country, Doctor Manette?\u201d He answered, in a tone that went to every heart, \u201cA long imprisonment.\u201d \u201cWere you newly released on the occasion in question?\u201d \u201cThey tell me so.\u201d \u201cHave you no remembrance of the occasion?\u201d \u201cNone. My mind is a blank, from some time--I cannot even say what time--when I employed myself, in my captivity, in making shoes, to the time when I found myself living in London with my dear daughter here.", " Not only do I feel, since last night, that I dare not confide to him the details of my projects; but also I feel that if I delay, there is danger of his giving warning, and then they might escape.\u201d \u201cThat must never be,\u201d croaked Jacques Three; \u201cno one must escape. We have not half enough as it is. We ought to have six score a day.\u201d \u201cIn a word,\u201d Madame Defarge went on, \u201cmy husband has not my reason for pursuing this family to annihilation, and I have not his reason for regarding this Doctor with any sensibility. I must act for myself, therefore. Come hither, little citizen.\u201d The wood-sawyer, who held her in the respect, and himself in the submission, of mortal fear, advanced with his hand to his red cap. \u201cTouching those signals, little citizen,\u201d said Madame Defarge, sternly, \u201cthat she made to the prisoners; you are ready to bear witness to them this very day?\u201d \u201cAy, ay, why not!\u201d cried the sawyer. \u201cEvery day, in all weathers, from two to four, always signalling, sometimes with the little one, sometimes without. I know what I know. I have seen with my eyes.\u201d He made all manner of gestures while he spoke, as if in incidental imitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had never seen. \u201cClearly plots,\u201d said Jacques Three. \u201cTransparently!\u201d \u201cThere is no doubt of the Jury?\u201d inquired Madame Defarge, letting her eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile. \u201cRely upon the patriotic Jury, dear citizeness.", " IV. Congratulatory From the dimly-lighted passages of the court, the last sediment of the human stew that had been boiling there all day, was straining off, when Doctor Manette, Lucie Manette, his daughter, Mr. Lorry, the solicitor for the defence, and its counsel, Mr. Stryver, stood gathered round Mr. Charles Darnay--just released--congratulating him on his escape from death. It would have been difficult by a far brighter light, to recognise in Doctor Manette, intellectual of face and upright of bearing, the shoemaker of the garret in Paris. Yet, no one could have looked at him twice, without looking again: even though the opportunity of observation had not extended to the mournful cadence of his low grave voice, and to the abstraction that overclouded him fitfully, without any apparent reason. While one external cause, and that a reference to his long lingering agony, would always--as on the trial--evoke this condition from the depths of his soul, it was also in its nature to arise of itself, and to draw a gloom over him, as incomprehensible to those unacquainted with his story as if they had seen the shadow of the actual Bastille thrown upon him by a summer sun, when the substance was three hundred miles away. Only his daughter had the power of charming this black brooding from his mind. She was the golden thread that united him to a Past beyond his misery, and to a Present beyond his misery: and the sound of her voice, the light of her face, the touch of her hand, had a strong beneficial influence with him almost always.", " Not absolutely always, for she could recall some occasions on which her power had failed; but they were few and slight, and she believed them over. Mr. Darnay had kissed her hand fervently and gratefully, and had turned to Mr. Stryver, whom he warmly thanked. Mr. Stryver, a man of little more than thirty, but looking twenty years older than he was, stout, loud, red, bluff, and free from any drawback of delicacy, had a pushing way of shouldering himself (morally and physically) into companies and conversations, that argued well for his shouldering his way up in life. He still had his wig and gown on, and he said, squaring himself at his late client to that degree that he squeezed the innocent Mr. Lorry clean out of the group: \u201cI am glad to have brought you off with honour, Mr. Darnay. It was an infamous prosecution, grossly infamous; but not the less likely to succeed on that account.\u201d \u201cYou have laid me under an obligation to you for life--in two senses,\u201d said his late client, taking his hand. \u201cI have done my best for you, Mr. Darnay; and my best is as good as another man's, I believe.\u201d It clearly being incumbent on some one to say, \u201cMuch better,\u201d Mr. Lorry said it; perhaps not quite disinterestedly, but with the interested object of squeezing himself back again. \u201cYou think so?\u201d said Mr. Stryver. \u201cWell! you have been present all day, and you ought to know. You are a man of business, too.\u201d \u201cAnd as such,\u201d quoth Mr. Lorry, whom the counsel learned in the law had now shouldered back into the group, just as he had previously shouldered him out of it--\u201cas such I will appeal to Doctor Manette, to break up this conference and order us all to our homes."], "By what name dothe men in Defarge\u2019s wine shop call their fellow revolutionaries?": [" Knitting There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. As early as six o'clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping through its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending over measures of wine. Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that he sold at this time. A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy. No vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur Defarge: but, a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay hidden in the dregs of it. This had been the third morning in succession, on which there had been early drinking at the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. It had begun on Monday, and here was Wednesday come. There had been more of early brooding than drinking; for, many men had listened and whispered and slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door, who could not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls. These were to the full as interested in the place, however, as if they could have commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided from seat to seat, and from corner to corner, swallowing talk in lieu of drink, with greedy looks. Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company, the master of the wine-shop was not visible. He was not missed; for, nobody who crossed the threshold looked for him, nobody asked for him, nobody wondered to see only Madame Defarge in her seat, presiding over the distribution of wine, with a bowl of battered small coins before her, as much defaced and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come.", " A suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind, were perhaps observed by the spies who looked in at the wine-shop, as they looked in at every place, high and low, from the king's palace to the criminal's gaol. Games at cards languished, players at dominoes musingly built towers with them, drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops of wine, Madame Defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve with her toothpick, and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible a long way off. Thus, Saint Antoine in this vinous feature of his, until midday. It was high noontide, when two dusty men passed through his streets and under his swinging lamps: of whom, one was Monsieur Defarge: the other a mender of roads in a blue cap. All adust and athirst, the two entered the wine-shop. Their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast of Saint Antoine, fast spreading as they came along, which stirred and flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows. Yet, no one had followed them, and no man spoke when they entered the wine-shop, though the eyes of every man there were turned upon them. \u201cGood day, gentlemen!\u201d said Monsieur Defarge. It may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue. It elicited an answering chorus of \u201cGood day!\u201d \u201cIt is bad weather, gentlemen,\u201d said Defarge, shaking his head. Upon which, every man looked at his neighbour, and then all cast down their eyes and sat silent.", " Come, now. Business, business!\u201d They went up slowly and softly. The staircase was short, and they were soon at the top. There, as it had an abrupt turn in it, they came all at once in sight of three men, whose heads were bent down close together at the side of a door, and who were intently looking into the room to which the door belonged, through some chinks or holes in the wall. On hearing footsteps close at hand, these three turned, and rose, and showed themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the wine-shop. \u201cI forgot them in the surprise of your visit,\u201d explained Monsieur Defarge. \u201cLeave us, good boys; we have business here.\u201d The three glided by, and went silently down. There appearing to be no other door on that floor, and the keeper of the wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone, Mr. Lorry asked him in a whisper, with a little anger: \u201cDo you make a show of Monsieur Manette?\u201d \u201cI show him, in the way you have seen, to a chosen few.\u201d \u201cIs that well?\u201d \u201c_I_ think it is well.\u201d \u201cWho are the few? How do you choose them?\u201d \u201cI choose them as real men, of my name--Jacques is my name--to whom the sight is likely to do good. Enough; you are English; that is another thing. Stay there, if you please, a little moment.\u201d With an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he stooped, and looked in through the crevice in the wall. Soon raising his head again, he struck twice or thrice upon the door--evidently with no other object than to make a noise there.", " Ah! the poor Gaspard!\u201d With a sigh of great compassion. \u201cMy faith!\u201d returned madame, coolly and lightly, \u201cif people use knives for such purposes, they have to pay for it. He knew beforehand what the price of his luxury was; he has paid the price.\u201d \u201cI believe,\u201d said the spy, dropping his soft voice to a tone that invited confidence, and expressing an injured revolutionary susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face: \u201cI believe there is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood, touching the poor fellow? Between ourselves.\u201d \u201cIs there?\u201d asked madame, vacantly. \u201cIs there not?\u201d \u201c--Here is my husband!\u201d said Madame Defarge. As the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door, the spy saluted him by touching his hat, and saying, with an engaging smile, \u201cGood day, Jacques!\u201d Defarge stopped short, and stared at him. \u201cGood day, Jacques!\u201d the spy repeated; with not quite so much confidence, or quite so easy a smile under the stare. \u201cYou deceive yourself, monsieur,\u201d returned the keeper of the wine-shop. \u201cYou mistake me for another. That is not my name. I am Ernest Defarge.\u201d \u201cIt is all the same,\u201d said the spy, airily, but discomfited too: \u201cgood day!\u201d \u201cGood day!\u201d answered Defarge, drily. \u201cI was saying to madame, with whom I had the pleasure of chatting when you entered, that they tell me there is--and no wonder!--much sympathy and anger in Saint Antoine, touching the unhappy fate of poor Gaspard.\u201d \u201cNo one has told me so,\u201d said Defarge, shaking his head."], "What skill didDoctor Manette develop in order to pass the time during his incarceration?": [" \u201cSay on.\u201d The figure in the chair between them, was all the time monotonously rocking itself to and fro, and moaning. They spoke in such a tone as they would have used if they had been watching by a sick-bed in the night. Carton stooped to pick up the coat, which lay almost entangling his feet. As he did so, a small case in which the Doctor was accustomed to carry the lists of his day's duties, fell lightly on the floor. Carton took it up, and there was a folded paper in it. \u201cWe should look at this!\u201d he said. Mr. Lorry nodded his consent. He opened it, and exclaimed, \u201cThank _God!_\u201d \u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Mr. Lorry, eagerly. \u201cA moment! Let me speak of it in its place. First,\u201d he put his hand in his coat, and took another paper from it, \u201cthat is the certificate which enables me to pass out of this city. Look at it. You see--Sydney Carton, an Englishman?\u201d Mr. Lorry held it open in his hand, gazing in his earnest face. \u201cKeep it for me until to-morrow. I shall see him to-morrow, you remember, and I had better not take it into the prison.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u201cI don't know; I prefer not to do so. Now, take this paper that Doctor Manette has carried about him. It is a similar certificate, enabling him and his daughter and her child, at any time, to pass the barrier and the frontier! You see?\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d \u201cPerhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against evil, yesterday. When is it dated?", " I mark this cross of blood upon him, as a sign that I do it.' \u201cTwice, he put his hand to the wound in his breast, and with his forefinger drew a cross in the air. He stood for an instant with the finger yet raised, and as it dropped, he dropped with it, and I laid him down dead. ***** \u201cWhen I returned to the bedside of the young woman, I found her raving in precisely the same order of continuity. I knew that this might last for many hours, and that it would probably end in the silence of the grave. \u201cI repeated the medicines I had given her, and I sat at the side of the bed until the night was far advanced. She never abated the piercing quality of her shrieks, never stumbled in the distinctness or the order of her words. They were always 'My husband, my father, and my brother! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve. Hush!' \u201cThis lasted twenty-six hours from the time when I first saw her. I had come and gone twice, and was again sitting by her, when she began to falter. I did what little could be done to assist that opportunity, and by-and-bye she sank into a lethargy, and lay like the dead. \u201cIt was as if the wind and rain had lulled at last, after a long and fearful storm. I released her arms, and called the woman to assist me to compose her figure and the dress she had torn. It was then that I knew her condition to be that of one in whom the first expectations of being a mother have arisen; and it was then that I lost the little hope I had had of her.", " Good day, one and all!\u201d \u201cHave the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a mouthful of cool fresh water, madame.\u201d Madame complied with a polite air. \u201cMarvellous cognac this, madame!\u201d It was the first time it had ever been so complimented, and Madame Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better. She said, however, that the cognac was flattered, and took up her knitting. The visitor watched her fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity of observing the place in general. \u201cYou knit with great skill, madame.\u201d \u201cI am accustomed to it.\u201d \u201cA pretty pattern too!\u201d \u201c_You_ think so?\u201d said madame, looking at him with a smile. \u201cDecidedly.

'Let me examine it.' \u201c'I do not want it examined,' he answered; 'let it be.' \u201cIt was under his hand, and I soothed him to let me move his hand away. The wound was a sword-thrust, received from twenty to twenty-four hours before, but no skill could have saved him if it had been looked to without delay. He was then dying fast. As I turned my eyes to the elder brother, I saw him looking down at this handsome boy whose life was ebbing out, as if he were a wounded bird, or hare, or rabbit; not at all as if he were a fellow-creature. \u201c'How has this been done, monsieur?' said I. \u201c'A crazed young common dog! A serf! Forced my brother to draw upon him, and has fallen by my brother's sword--like a gentleman.' \u201cThere was no touch of pity, sorrow, or kindred humanity, in this answer. The speaker seemed to acknowledge that it was inconvenient to have that different order of creature dying there, and that it would have been better if he had died in the usual obscure routine of his vermin kind. He was quite incapable of any compassionate feeling about the boy, or about his fate. \u201cThe boy's eyes had slowly moved to him as he had spoken, and they now slowly moved to me. \u201c'Doctor, they are very proud, these Nobles; but we common dogs are proud too, sometimes."], "What symbol doesDickens use to portend the bloodshed of the French Revolution?": [" Good day, one and all!\u201d \u201cHave the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a mouthful of cool fresh water, madame.\u201d Madame complied with a polite air. \u201cMarvellous cognac this, madame!\u201d It was the first time it had ever been so complimented, and Madame Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better.

If there had been any eyes to notice the influence of her look, on Sydney Carton, it would have been seen to be the same influence exactly. Before that unjust Tribunal, there was little or no order of procedure, ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing. There could have been no such Revolution, if all laws, forms, and ceremonies, had not first been so monstrously abused, that the suicidal vengeance of the Revolution was to scatter them all to the winds. Every eye was turned to the jury. The same determined patriots and good republicans as yesterday and the day before, and to-morrow and the day after. Eager and prominent among them, one man with a craving face, and his fingers perpetually hovering about his lips, whose appearance gave great satisfaction to the spectators. A life-thirsting, cannibal-looking, bloody-minded juryman, the Jacques Three of St. Antoine. The whole jury, as a jury of dogs empannelled to try the deer. Every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor. No favourable leaning in that quarter to-day. A fell, uncompromising, murderous business-meaning there.

He began to have suspicions of the prisoner, and to keep an eye upon him, soon afterwards. In arranging his clothes, while travelling, he had seen similar lists to these in the prisoner's pockets, over and over again. He had taken these lists from the drawer of the prisoner's desk. He had not put them there first. He had seen the prisoner show these identical lists to French gentlemen at Calais, and similar lists to French gentlemen, both at Calais and Boulogne. He loved his country, and couldn't bear it, and had given information. He had never been suspected of stealing a silver tea-pot; he had been maligned respecting a mustard-pot, but it turned out to be only a plated one. He had known the last witness seven or eight years; that was merely a coincidence. He didn't call it a particularly curious coincidence; most coincidences were curious. Neither did he call it a curious coincidence that true patriotism was _his_ only motive too. He was a true Briton, and hoped there were many like him.

But it's not worth your while to apostrophise me, or the air, about it; what you want to do, you do. You were always in the front rank, and I was always behind.\u201d \u201cI had to get into the front rank; I was not born there, was I?\u201d \u201cI was not present at the ceremony; but my opinion is you were,\u201d said Carton. At this, he laughed again, and they both laughed. \u201cBefore Shrewsbury, and at Shrewsbury, and ever since Shrewsbury,\u201d pursued Carton, \u201cyou have fallen into your rank, and I have fallen into mine."], "A Taleof Two Cities was published in weekly installments fromApril to November of what year?": [" In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer, and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer's boy of sixpence. All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded, those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights with a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small creatures--the creatures of this chronicle among the rest--along the roads that lay before them. II. The Mail It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November, before the first of the persons with whom this history has business. The Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up Shooter's Hill. He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail, as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill, and the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back to Blackheath.", " Suffer them and forbid them not. They see my Father's face. O Father, blessed words! Thus, the rustling of an Angel's wings got blended with the other echoes, and they were not wholly of earth, but had in them that breath of Heaven. Sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden-tomb were mingled with them also, and both were audible to Lucie, in a hushed murmur--like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore--as the little Lucie, comically studious at the task of the morning, or dressing a doll at her mother's footstool, chattered in the tongues of the Two Cities that were blended in her life. The Echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of Sydney Carton. Some half-dozen times a year, at most, he claimed his privilege of coming in uninvited, and would sit among them through the evening, as he had once done often. He never came there heated with wine. And one other thing regarding him was whispered in the echoes, which has been whispered by all true echoes for ages and ages. No man ever really loved a woman, lost her, and knew her with a blameless though an unchanged mind, when she was a wife and a mother, but her children had a strange sympathy with him--an instinctive delicacy of pity for him. What fine hidden sensibilities are touched in such a case, no echoes tell; but it is so, and it was so here. Carton was the first stranger to whom little Lucie held out her chubby arms, and he kept his place with her as she grew.", " He could now assure Lucie that her husband was no longer confined alone, but was mixed with the general body of prisoners; he saw her husband weekly, and brought sweet messages to her, straight from his lips; sometimes her husband himself sent a letter to her (though never by the Doctor's hand), but she was not permitted to write to him: for, among the many wild suspicions of plots in the prisons, the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad. This new life of the Doctor's was an anxious life, no doubt; still, the sagacious Mr. Lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it. Nothing unbecoming tinged the pride; it was a natural and worthy one; but he observed it as a curiosity. The Doctor knew, that up to that time, his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter and his friend, with his personal affliction, deprivation, and weakness. Now that this was changed, and he knew himself to be invested through that old trial with forces to which they both looked for Charles's ultimate safety and deliverance, he became so far exalted by the change, that he took the lead and direction, and required them as the weak, to trust to him as the strong. The preceding relative positions of himself and Lucie were reversed, yet only as the liveliest gratitude and affection could reverse them, for he could have had no pride but in rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him.", " All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the ears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said, from anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from the eyes of the body, of his two companions. In those days, travellers were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on the road might be a robber or in league with robbers. As to the latter, when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in \u201cthe Captain's\u201d pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. So the guard of the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter's Hill, as he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet, and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols, deposited on a substratum of cutlass. The Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected the passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they all suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but the horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have taken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the journey."], "What image doesDickens frequently use to describe Lucie Manette?": [" And yet I have had the weakness, and have still the weakness, to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me, heap of ashes that I am, into fire--a fire, however, inseparable in its nature from myself, quickening nothing, lighting nothing, doing no service, idly burning away.\u201d \u201cSince it is my misfortune, Mr. Carton, to have made you more unhappy than you were before you knew me--\u201d \u201cDon't say that, Miss Manette, for you would have reclaimed me, if anything could. You will not be the cause of my becoming worse.\u201d \u201cSince the state of your mind that you describe, is, at all events, attributable to some influence of mine--this is what I mean, if I can make it plain--can I use no influence to serve you? Have I no power for good, with you, at all?\u201d \u201cThe utmost good that I am capable of now, Miss Manette, I have come here to realise. Let me carry through the rest of my misdirected life, the remembrance that I opened my heart to you, last of all the world; and that there was something left in me at this time which you could deplore and pity.\u201d \u201cWhich I entreated you to believe, again and again, most fervently, with all my heart, was capable of better things, Mr. Carton!\u201d \u201cEntreat me to believe it no more, Miss Manette. I have proved myself, and I know better. I distress you; I draw fast to an end. Will you let me believe, when I recall this day, that the last confidence of my life was reposed in your pure and innocent breast, and that it lies there alone, and will be shared by no one?\u201d \u201cIf that will be a consolation to you, yes.\u201d \u201cNot even by the dearest one ever to be known to you?\u201d \u201cMr.", " They were armed. I was not. \u201c'Gentlemen,' said I, 'pardon me; but I usually inquire who does me the honour to seek my assistance, and what is the nature of the case to which I am summoned.' \u201cThe reply to this was made by him who had spoken second. 'Doctor, your clients are people of condition. As to the nature of the case, our confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for yourself better than we can describe it. Enough. Will you please to enter the carriage?' \u201cI could do nothing but comply, and I entered it in silence. They both entered after me--the last springing in, after putting up the steps. The carriage turned about, and drove on at its former speed. \u201cI repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred. I have no doubt that it is, word for word, the same. I describe everything exactly as it took place, constraining my mind not to wander from the task. Where I make the broken marks that follow here, I leave off for the time, and put my paper in its hiding-place. ***** \u201cThe carriage left the streets behind, passed the North Barrier, and emerged upon the country road. At two-thirds of a league from the Barrier--I did not estimate the distance at that time, but afterwards when I traversed it--it struck out of the main avenue, and presently stopped at a solitary house, We all three alighted, and walked, by a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had overflowed, to the door of the house.", " It was the close of the summer day, and he knew Lucie to be out with Miss Pross. He found the Doctor reading in his arm-chair at a window. The energy which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated their sharpness, had been gradually restored to him. He was now a very energetic man indeed, with great firmness of purpose, strength of resolution, and vigour of action. In his recovered energy he was sometimes a little fitful and sudden, as he had at first been in the exercise of his other recovered faculties; but, this had never been frequently observable, and had grown more and more rare. He studied much, slept little, sustained a great deal of fatigue with ease, and was equably cheerful. To him, now entered Charles Darnay, at sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand. \u201cCharles Darnay! I rejoice to see you. We have been counting on your return these three or four days past. Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton were both here yesterday, and both made you out to be more than due.\u201d \u201cI am obliged to them for their interest in the matter,\u201d he answered, a little coldly as to them, though very warmly as to the Doctor. \u201cMiss Manette--\u201d \u201cIs well,\u201d said the Doctor, as he stopped short, \u201cand your return will delight us all. She has gone out on some household matters, but will soon be home.\u201d \u201cDoctor Manette, I knew she was from home. I took the opportunity of her being from home, to beg to speak to you.\u201d There was a blank silence.", " Good day, one and all!\u201d \u201cHave the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a mouthful of cool fresh water, madame.\u201d Madame complied with a polite air. \u201cMarvellous cognac this, madame!\u201d It was the first time it had ever been so complimented, and Madame Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better. She said, however, that the cognac was flattered, and took up her knitting. The visitor watched her fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity of observing the place in general. \u201cYou knit with great skill, madame.\u201d \u201cI am accustomed to it.\u201d \u201cA pretty pattern too!\u201d \u201c_You_ think so?\u201d said madame, looking at him with a smile. \u201cDecidedly. May one ask what it is for?\u201d \u201cPastime,\u201d said madame, still looking at him with a smile while her fingers moved nimbly. \u201cNot for use?\u201d \u201cThat depends. I may find a use for it one day. If I do--Well,\u201d said madame, drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of coquetry, \u201cI'll use it!\u201d It was remarkable; but, the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge. Two men had entered separately, and had been about to order drink, when, catching sight of that novelty, they faltered, made a pretence of looking about as if for some friend who was not there, and went away. Nor, of those who had been there when this visitor entered, was there one left. They had all dropped off."], "What sound doesLucie often hear echoing off the street when she is in her home?": [" In the midst of these fluttering thoughts, the escort appeared, took her in, and took her away. \u201cIs there any noise in the streets?\u201d she asked him. \u201cThe usual noises,\u201d Mr. Cruncher replied; and looked surprised by the question and by her aspect. \u201cI don't hear you,\u201d said Miss Pross. \u201cWhat do you say?\u201d It was in vain for Mr. Cruncher to repeat what he said; Miss Pross could not hear him. \u201cSo I'll nod my head,\u201d thought Mr. Cruncher, amazed, \u201cat all events she'll see that.\u201d And she did. \u201cIs there any noise in the streets now?\u201d asked Miss Pross again, presently. Again Mr. Cruncher nodded his head. \u201cI don't hear it.\u201d \u201cGone deaf in an hour?\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, ruminating, with his mind much disturbed; \u201cwot's come to her?\u201d \u201cI feel,\u201d said Miss Pross, \u201cas if there had been a flash and a crash, and that crash was the last thing I should ever hear in this life.\u201d \u201cBlest if she ain't in a queer condition!\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, more and more disturbed. \u201cWot can she have been a takin', to keep her courage up? Hark! There's the roll of them dreadful carts! You can hear that, miss?\u201d \u201cI can hear,\u201d said Miss Pross, seeing that he spoke to her, \u201cnothing. O, my good man, there was first a great crash, and then a great stillness, and that stillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable, never to be broken any more as long as my life lasts.\u201d \u201cIf she don't hear the roll of those dreadful carts, now very nigh their journey's end,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, glancing over his shoulder, \u201cit's my opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world.\u201d And indeed she never did.", " Occasionally, a stray workman putting his coat on, traversed the hall, or a stranger peered about there, or a distant clink was heard across the courtyard, or a thump from the golden giant. These, however, were only the exceptions required to prove the rule that the sparrows in the plane-tree behind the house, and the echoes in the corner before it, had their own way from Sunday morning unto Saturday night. Doctor Manette received such patients here as his old reputation, and its revival in the floating whispers of his story, brought him. His scientific knowledge, and his vigilance and skill in conducting ingenious experiments, brought him otherwise into moderate request, and he earned as much as he wanted. These things were within Mr. Jarvis Lorry's knowledge, thoughts, and notice, when he rang the door-bell of the tranquil house in the corner, on the fine Sunday afternoon. \u201cDoctor Manette at home?\u201d Expected home. \u201cMiss Lucie at home?\u201d Expected home. \u201cMiss Pross at home?\u201d Possibly at home, but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to anticipate intentions of Miss Pross, as to admission or denial of the fact. \u201cAs I am at home myself,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, \u201cI'll go upstairs.\u201d Although the Doctor's daughter had known nothing of the country of her birth, she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability to make much of little means, which is one of its most useful and most agreeable characteristics.", " \u201cI will always remember it, dear Heart! I will remember it as long as I live.\u201d He bent over the golden head, and put the rosy lips to his, and folded her in his arms. If one forlorn wanderer then pacing the dark streets, could have heard her innocent disclosure, and could have seen the drops of pity kissed away by her husband from the soft blue eyes so loving of that husband, he might have cried to the night--and the words would not have parted from his lips for the first time-- \u201cGod bless her for her sweet compassion!\u201d XXI. Echoing Footsteps A wonderful corner for echoes, it has been remarked, that corner where the Doctor lived. Ever busily winding the golden thread which bound her husband, and her father, and herself, and her old directress and companion, in a life of quiet bliss, Lucie sat in the still house in the tranquilly resounding corner, listening to the echoing footsteps of years. At first, there were times, though she was a perfectly happy young wife, when her work would slowly fall from her hands, and her eyes would be dimmed. For, there was something coming in the echoes, something light, afar off, and scarcely audible yet, that stirred her heart too much. Fluttering hopes and doubts--hopes, of a love as yet unknown to her: doubts, of her remaining upon earth, to enjoy that new delight--divided her breast. Among the echoes then, there would arise the sound of footsteps at her own early grave; and thoughts of the husband who would be left so desolate, and who would mourn for her so much, swelled to her eyes, and broke like waves.", " He was also in the habit of declaiming to Mrs. Stryver, over his full-bodied wine, on the arts Mrs. Darnay had once put in practice to \u201ccatch\u201d him, and on the diamond-cut-diamond arts in himself, madam, which had rendered him \u201cnot to be caught.\u201d Some of his King's Bench familiars, who were occasionally parties to the full-bodied wine and the lie, excused him for the latter by saying that he had told it so often, that he believed it himself--which is surely such an incorrigible aggravation of an originally bad offence, as to justify any such offender's being carried off to some suitably retired spot, and there hanged out of the way. These were among the echoes to which Lucie, sometimes pensive, sometimes amused and laughing, listened in the echoing corner, until her little daughter was six years old. How near to her heart the echoes of her child's tread came, and those of her own dear father's, always active and self-possessed, and those of her dear husband's, need not be told. Nor, how the lightest echo of their united home, directed by herself with such a wise and elegant thrift that it was more abundant than any waste, was music to her. Nor, how there were echoes all about her, sweet in her ears, of the many times her father had told her that he found her more devoted to him married (if that could be) than single, and of the many times her husband had said to her that no cares and duties seemed to divide her love for him or her help to him, and asked her \u201cWhat is the magic secret, my darling, of your being everything to all of us, as if there were only one of us, yet never seeming to be hurried, or to have too much to do?\u201d But, there were other echoes, from a distance, that rumbled menacingly in the corner all through this space of time."], "Which of thefollowing characters is related to the Marquis, whose carriage runsdown a small child?": [" \u201cPardon, Monsieur the Marquis!\u201d said a ragged and submissive man, \u201cit is a child.\u201d \u201cWhy does he make that abominable noise? Is it his child?\u201d \u201cExcuse me, Monsieur the Marquis--it is a pity--yes.\u201d The fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it was, into a space some ten or twelve yards square. As the tall man suddenly got up from the ground, and came running at the carriage, Monsieur the Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-hilt. \u201cKilled!\u201d shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both arms at their length above his head, and staring at him. \u201cDead!\u201d The people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis. There was nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness and eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger. Neither did the people say anything; after the first cry, they had been silent, and they remained so. The voice of the submissive man who had spoken, was flat and tame in its extreme submission. Monsieur the Marquis ran his eyes over them all, as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes. He took out his purse. \u201cIt is extraordinary to me,\u201d said he, \u201cthat you people cannot take care of yourselves and your children. One or the other of you is for ever in the way. How do I know what injury you have done my horses. See! Give him that.\u201d He threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up, and all the heads craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell.", " As I stood aside to let that carriage pass, apprehensive that it might otherwise run me down, a head was put out at the window, and a voice called to the driver to stop. \u201cThe carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses, and the same voice called to me by my name. I answered. The carriage was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the door and alight before I came up with it. \u201cI observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks, and appeared to conceal themselves. As they stood side by side near the carriage door, I also observed that they both looked of about my own age, or rather younger, and that they were greatly alike, in stature, manner, voice, and (as far as I could see) face too. \u201c'You are Doctor Manette?' said one. \u201cI am.\u201d \u201c'Doctor Manette, formerly of Beauvais,' said the other; 'the young physician, originally an expert surgeon, who within the last year or two has made a rising reputation in Paris?' \u201c'Gentlemen,' I returned, 'I am that Doctor Manette of whom you speak so graciously.' \u201c'We have been to your residence,' said the first, 'and not being so fortunate as to find you there, and being informed that you were probably walking in this direction, we followed, in the hope of overtaking you. Will you please to enter the carriage?' \u201cThe manner of both was imperious, and they both moved, as these words were spoken, so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door.", " The water of the fountain ran, the swift river ran, the day ran into evening, so much life in the city ran into death according to rule, time and tide waited for no man, the rats were sleeping close together in their dark holes again, the Fancy Ball was lighted up at supper, all things ran their course. VIII. Monseigneur in the Country A beautiful landscape, with the corn bright in it, but not abundant. Patches of poor rye where corn should have been, patches of poor peas and beans, patches of most coarse vegetable substitutes for wheat. On inanimate nature, as on the men and women who cultivated it, a prevalent tendency towards an appearance of vegetating unwillingly--a dejected disposition to give up, and wither away. Monsieur the Marquis in his travelling carriage (which might have been lighter), conducted by four post-horses and two postilions, fagged up a steep hill. A blush on the countenance of Monsieur the Marquis was no impeachment of his high breeding; it was not from within; it was occasioned by an external circumstance beyond his control--the setting sun. The sunset struck so brilliantly into the travelling carriage when it gained the hill-top, that its occupant was steeped in crimson. \u201cIt will die out,\u201d said Monsieur the Marquis, glancing at his hands, \u201cdirectly.\u201d In effect, the sun was so low that it dipped at the moment. When the heavy drag had been adjusted to the wheel, and the carriage slid down hill, with a cinderous smell, in a cloud of dust, the red glow departed quickly; the sun and the Marquis going down together, there was no glow left when the drag was taken off.", " The tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry, \u201cDead!\u201d He was arrested by the quick arrival of another man, for whom the rest made way. On seeing him, the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder, sobbing and crying, and pointing to the fountain, where some women were stooping over the motionless bundle, and moving gently about it. They were as silent, however, as the men. \u201cI know all, I know all,\u201d said the last comer. \u201cBe a brave man, my Gaspard! It is better for the poor little plaything to die so, than to live. It has died in a moment without pain. Could it have lived an hour as happily?\u201d \u201cYou are a philosopher, you there,\u201d said the Marquis, smiling. \u201cHow do they call you?\u201d \u201cThey call me Defarge.\u201d \u201cOf what trade?\u201d \u201cMonsieur the Marquis, vendor of wine.\u201d \u201cPick up that, philosopher and vendor of wine,\u201d said the Marquis, throwing him another gold coin, \u201cand spend it as you will. The horses there; are they right?\u201d Without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time, Monsieur the Marquis leaned back in his seat, and was just being driven away with the air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing, and had paid for it, and could afford to pay for it; when his ease was suddenly disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage, and ringing on its floor. \u201cHold!\u201d said Monsieur the Marquis. \u201cHold the horses! Who threw that?\u201d He looked to the spot where Defarge the vendor of wine had stood, a moment before; but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on the pavement in that spot, and the figure that stood beside him was the figure of a dark stout woman, knitting."], "Who does MissPross believe is the ideal suitor for Lucie Manette?": [" Charles Darnay, mysteries arise out of close love, as well as out of wide division; in the former case, they are subtle and delicate, and difficult to penetrate. My daughter Lucie is, in this one respect, such a mystery to me; I can make no guess at the state of her heart.\u201d \u201cMay I ask, sir, if you think she is--\u201d As he hesitated, her father supplied the rest. \u201cIs sought by any other suitor?\u201d \u201cIt is what I meant to say.\u201d Her father considered a little before he answered: \u201cYou have seen Mr. Carton here, yourself. Mr. Stryver is here too, occasionally. If it be at all, it can only be by one of these.\u201d \u201cOr both,\u201d said Darnay. \u201cI had not thought of both; I should not think either, likely. You want a promise from me. Tell me what it is.\u201d \u201cIt is, that if Miss Manette should bring to you at any time, on her own part, such a confidence as I have ventured to lay before you, you will bear testimony to what I have said, and to your belief in it. I hope you may be able to think so well of me, as to urge no influence against me. I say nothing more of my stake in this; this is what I ask. The condition on which I ask it, and which you have an undoubted right to require, I will observe immediately.\u201d \u201cI give the promise,\u201d said the Doctor, \u201cwithout any condition. I believe your object to be, purely and truthfully, as you have stated it. I believe your intention is to perpetuate, and not to weaken, the ties between me and my other and far dearer self.", " A struggle was evidently in his face; a struggle with that occasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread. \u201cYou speak so feelingly and so manfully, Charles Darnay, that I thank you with all my heart, and will open all my heart--or nearly so. Have you any reason to believe that Lucie loves you?\u201d \u201cNone. As yet, none.\u201d \u201cIs it the immediate object of this confidence, that you may at once ascertain that, with my knowledge?\u201d \u201cNot even so. I might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks; I might (mistaken or not mistaken) have that hopefulness to-morrow.\u201d \u201cDo you seek any guidance from me?\u201d \u201cI ask none, sir. But I have thought it possible that you might have it in your power, if you should deem it right, to give me some.\u201d \u201cDo you seek any promise from me?\u201d \u201cI do seek that.\u201d \u201cWhat is it?\u201d \u201cI well understand that, without you, I could have no hope. I well understand that, even if Miss Manette held me at this moment in her innocent heart--do not think I have the presumption to assume so much--I could retain no place in it against her love for her father.\u201d \u201cIf that be so, do you see what, on the other hand, is involved in it?\u201d \u201cI understand equally well, that a word from her father in any suitor's favour, would outweigh herself and all the world. For which reason, Doctor Manette,\u201d said Darnay, modestly but firmly, \u201cI would not ask that word, to save my life.\u201d \u201cI am sure of it.", " And yet I have had the weakness, and have still the weakness, to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me, heap of ashes that I am, into fire--a fire, however, inseparable in its nature from myself, quickening nothing, lighting nothing, doing no service, idly burning away.\u201d \u201cSince it is my misfortune, Mr. Carton, to have made you more unhappy than you were before you knew me--\u201d \u201cDon't say that, Miss Manette, for you would have reclaimed me, if anything could. You will not be the cause of my becoming worse.\u201d \u201cSince the state of your mind that you describe, is, at all events, attributable to some influence of mine--this is what I mean, if I can make it plain--can I use no influence to serve you? Have I no power for good, with you, at all?\u201d \u201cThe utmost good that I am capable of now, Miss Manette, I have come here to realise. Let me carry through the rest of my misdirected life, the remembrance that I opened my heart to you, last of all the world; and that there was something left in me at this time which you could deplore and pity.\u201d \u201cWhich I entreated you to believe, again and again, most fervently, with all my heart, was capable of better things, Mr. Carton!\u201d \u201cEntreat me to believe it no more, Miss Manette. I have proved myself, and I know better. I distress you; I draw fast to an end. Will you let me believe, when I recall this day, that the last confidence of my life was reposed in your pure and innocent breast, and that it lies there alone, and will be shared by no one?\u201d \u201cIf that will be a consolation to you, yes.\u201d \u201cNot even by the dearest one ever to be known to you?\u201d \u201cMr.", " But I love her. Heaven is my witness that I love her!\u201d \u201cI believe it,\u201d answered her father, mournfully. \u201cI have thought so before now. I believe it.\u201d \u201cBut, do not believe,\u201d said Darnay, upon whose ear the mournful voice struck with a reproachful sound, \u201cthat if my fortune were so cast as that, being one day so happy as to make her my wife, I must at any time put any separation between her and you, I could or would breathe a word of what I now say. Besides that I should know it to be hopeless, I should know it to be a baseness. If I had any such possibility, even at a remote distance of years, harboured in my thoughts, and hidden in my heart--if it ever had been there--if it ever could be there--I could not now touch this honoured hand.\u201d He laid his own upon it as he spoke. \u201cNo, dear Doctor Manette. Like you, a voluntary exile from France; like you, driven from it by its distractions, oppressions, and miseries; like you, striving to live away from it by my own exertions, and trusting in a happier future; I look only to sharing your fortunes, sharing your life and home, and being faithful to you to the death. Not to divide with Lucie her privilege as your child, companion, and friend; but to come in aid of it, and bind her closer to you, if such a thing can be.\u201d His touch still lingered on her father's hand. Answering the touch for a moment, but not coldly, her father rested his hands upon the arms of his chair, and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the conference."], "What does Mr.Lorry try to persuade Mr. Stryver not to do?": [" \u201cOh dear you, sir? What may your meaning be, Mr. Lorry?\u201d \u201cMy meaning,\u201d answered the man of business, \u201cis, of course, friendly and appreciative, and that it does you the greatest credit, and--in short, my meaning is everything you could desire. But--really, you know, Mr. Stryver--\u201d Mr. Lorry paused, and shook his head at him in the oddest manner, as if he were compelled against his will to add, internally, \u201cyou know there really is so much too much of you!\u201d \u201cWell!\u201d said Stryver, slapping the desk with his contentious hand, opening his eyes wider, and taking a long breath, \u201cif I understand you, Mr. Lorry, I'll be hanged!\u201d Mr. Lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that end, and bit the feather of a pen. \u201cD--n it all, sir!\u201d said Stryver, staring at him, \u201cam I not eligible?\u201d \u201cOh dear yes! Yes. Oh yes, you're eligible!\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cIf you say eligible, you are eligible.\u201d \u201cAm I not prosperous?\u201d asked Stryver. \u201cOh! if you come to prosperous, you are prosperous,\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cAnd advancing?\u201d \u201cIf you come to advancing you know,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, delighted to be able to make another admission, \u201cnobody can doubt that.\u201d \u201cThen what on earth is your meaning, Mr. Lorry?\u201d demanded Stryver, perceptibly crestfallen. \u201cWell! I--Were you going there now?\u201d asked Mr. Lorry. \u201cStraight!\u201d said Stryver, with a plump of his fist on the desk. \u201cThen I think I wouldn't, if I was you.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d said Stryver.", " He was so much too big for Tellson's, that old clerks in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance, as though he squeezed them against the wall. The House itself, magnificently reading the paper quite in the far-off perspective, lowered displeased, as if the Stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat. The discreet Mr. Lorry said, in a sample tone of the voice he would recommend under the circumstances, \u201cHow do you do, Mr. Stryver? How do you do, sir?\u201d and shook hands. There was a peculiarity in his manner of shaking hands, always to be seen in any clerk at Tellson's who shook hands with a customer when the House pervaded the air. He shook in a self-abnegating way, as one who shook for Tellson and Co. \u201cCan I do anything for you, Mr. Stryver?\u201d asked Mr. Lorry, in his business character. \u201cWhy, no, thank you; this is a private visit to yourself, Mr. Lorry; I have come for a private word.\u201d \u201cOh indeed!\u201d said Mr. Lorry, bending down his ear, while his eye strayed to the House afar off. \u201cI am going,\u201d said Mr. Stryver, leaning his arms confidentially on the desk: whereupon, although it was a large double one, there appeared to be not half desk enough for him: \u201cI am going to make an offer of myself in marriage to your agreeable little friend, Miss Manette, Mr. Lorry.\u201d \u201cOh dear me!\u201d cried Mr. Lorry, rubbing his chin, and looking at his visitor dubiously. \u201cOh dear me, sir?\u201d repeated Stryver, drawing back.", " \u201cThat is what I mean to tell you, sir,\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cPray let there be no mistake about it.\u201d Mr. Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while, and then stood hitting a tune out of his teeth with it, which probably gave him the toothache. He broke the awkward silence by saying: \u201cThis is something new to me, Mr. Lorry. You deliberately advise me not to go up to Soho and offer myself--_my_self, Stryver of the King's Bench bar?\u201d \u201cDo you ask me for my advice, Mr. Stryver?\u201d \u201cYes, I do.\u201d \u201cVery good. Then I give it, and you have repeated it correctly.\u201d \u201cAnd all I can say of it is,\u201d laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh, \u201cthat this--ha, ha!--beats everything past, present, and to come.\u201d \u201cNow understand me,\u201d pursued Mr. Lorry. \u201cAs a man of business, I am not justified in saying anything about this matter, for, as a man of business, I know nothing of it. But, as an old fellow, who has carried Miss Manette in his arms, who is the trusted friend of Miss Manette and of her father too, and who has a great affection for them both, I have spoken. The confidence is not of my seeking, recollect. Now, you think I may not be right?\u201d \u201cNot I!\u201d said Stryver, whistling. \u201cI can't undertake to find third parties in common sense; I can only find it for myself. I suppose sense in certain quarters; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense. It's new to me, but you are right, I dare say.\u201d \u201cWhat I suppose, Mr. Stryver, I claim to characterise for myself--And understand me, sir,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, quickly flushing again, \u201cI will not--not even at Tellson's--have it characterised for me by any gentleman breathing.\u201d \u201cThere!", " \u201cNow, I'll put you in a corner,\u201d forensically shaking a forefinger at him. \u201cYou are a man of business and bound to have a reason. State your reason. Why wouldn't you go?\u201d \u201cBecause,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, \u201cI wouldn't go on such an object without having some cause to believe that I should succeed.\u201d \u201cD--n _me_!\u201d cried Stryver, \u201cbut this beats everything.\u201d Mr. Lorry glanced at the distant House, and glanced at the angry Stryver. \u201cHere's a man of business--a man of years--a man of experience--_in_ a Bank,\u201d said Stryver; \u201cand having summed up three leading reasons for complete success, he says there's no reason at all! Says it with his head on!\u201d Mr. Stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have been infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off. \u201cWhen I speak of success, I speak of success with the young lady; and when I speak of causes and reasons to make success probable, I speak of causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady. The young lady, my good sir,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, mildly tapping the Stryver arm, \u201cthe young lady. The young lady goes before all.\u201d \u201cThen you mean to tell me, Mr. Lorry,\u201d said Stryver, squaring his elbows, \u201cthat it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at present in question is a mincing Fool?\u201d \u201cNot exactly so. I mean to tell you, Mr. Stryver,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, reddening, \u201cthat I will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady from any lips; and that if I knew any man--which I hope I do not--whose taste was so coarse, and whose temper was so overbearing, that he could not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at this desk, not even Tellson's should prevent my giving him a piece of my mind.\u201d The necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put Mr. Stryver's blood-vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry; Mr. Lorry's veins, methodical as their courses could usually be, were in no better state now it was his turn."], "Who promisesLucie Manette that he would, if necessary, die for her?": [" \u201cThe door is locked then, my friend?\u201d said Mr. Lorry, surprised. \u201cAy. Yes,\u201d was the grim reply of Monsieur Defarge. \u201cYou think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired?\u201d \u201cI think it necessary to turn the key.\u201d Monsieur Defarge whispered it closer in his ear, and frowned heavily. \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cWhy! Because he has lived so long, locked up, that he would be frightened--rave--tear himself to pieces--die--come to I know not what harm--if his door was left open.\u201d \u201cIs it possible!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Lorry. \u201cIs it possible!\u201d repeated Defarge, bitterly. \u201cYes. And a beautiful world we live in, when it _is_ possible, and when many other such things are possible, and not only possible, but done--done, see you!--under that sky there, every day. Long live the Devil. Let us go on.\u201d This dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper, that not a word of it had reached the young lady's ears. But, by this time she trembled under such strong emotion, and her face expressed such deep anxiety, and, above all, such dread and terror, that Mr. Lorry felt it incumbent on him to speak a word or two of reassurance. \u201cCourage, dear miss! Courage! Business! The worst will be over in a moment; it is but passing the room-door, and the worst is over. Then, all the good you bring to him, all the relief, all the happiness you bring to him, begin. Let our good friend here, assist you on that side. That's well, friend Defarge.", " Among the lookers-on there was the same expression in all quarters of the court; insomuch, that a great majority of the foreheads there, might have been mirrors reflecting the witness, when the Judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous heresy about George Washington. Mr. Attorney-General now signified to my Lord, that he deemed it necessary, as a matter of precaution and form, to call the young lady's father, Doctor Manette. Who was called accordingly. \u201cDoctor Manette, look upon the prisoner. Have you ever seen him before?\u201d \u201cOnce. When he called at my lodgings in London. Some three years, or three years and a half ago.\u201d \u201cCan you identify him as your fellow-passenger on board the packet, or speak to his conversation with your daughter?\u201d \u201cSir, I can do neither.\u201d \u201cIs there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do either?\u201d He answered, in a low voice, \u201cThere is.\u201d \u201cHas it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment, without trial, or even accusation, in your native country, Doctor Manette?\u201d He answered, in a tone that went to every heart, \u201cA long imprisonment.\u201d \u201cWere you newly released on the occasion in question?\u201d \u201cThey tell me so.\u201d \u201cHave you no remembrance of the occasion?\u201d \u201cNone. My mind is a blank, from some time--I cannot even say what time--when I employed myself, in my captivity, in making shoes, to the time when I found myself living in London with my dear daughter here.", " But he never says a word of the true reason of his restlessness, to her, and she finds it best not to hint at it to him. In silence they go walking up and down together, walking up and down together, till her love and company have brought him to himself.\u201d Notwithstanding Miss Pross's denial of her own imagination, there was a perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea, in her repetition of the phrase, walking up and down, which testified to her possessing such a thing. The corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes; it had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet, that it seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had set it going. \u201cHere they are!\u201d said Miss Pross, rising to break up the conference; \u201cand now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon!\u201d It was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties, such a peculiar Ear of a place, that as Mr. Lorry stood at the open window, looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard, he fancied they would never approach. Not only would the echoes die away, as though the steps had gone; but, echoes of other steps that never came would be heard in their stead, and would die away for good when they seemed close at hand. However, father and daughter did at last appear, and Miss Pross was ready at the street door to receive them. Miss Pross was a pleasant sight, albeit wild, and red, and grim, taking off her darling's bonnet when she came up-stairs, and touching it up with the ends of her handkerchief, and blowing the dust off it, and folding her mantle ready for laying by, and smoothing her rich hair with as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she had been the vainest and handsomest of women.", " The likeness passed away, like a breath along the surface of the gaunt pier-glass behind her, on the frame of which, a hospital procession of negro cupids, several headless and all cripples, were offering black baskets of Dead Sea fruit to black divinities of the feminine gender--and he made his formal bow to Miss Manette. \u201cPray take a seat, sir.\u201d In a very clear and pleasant young voice; a little foreign in its accent, but a very little indeed. \u201cI kiss your hand, miss,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, with the manners of an earlier date, as he made his formal bow again, and took his seat. \u201cI received a letter from the Bank, sir, yesterday, informing me that some intelligence--or discovery--\u201d \u201cThe word is not material, miss; either word will do.\u201d \u201c--respecting the small property of my poor father, whom I never saw--so long dead--\u201d Mr. Lorry moved in his chair, and cast a troubled look towards the hospital procession of negro cupids. As if _they_ had any help for anybody in their absurd baskets! \u201c--rendered it necessary that I should go to Paris, there to communicate with a gentleman of the Bank, so good as to be despatched to Paris for the purpose.\u201d \u201cMyself.\u201d \u201cAs I was prepared to hear, sir.\u201d She curtseyed to him (young ladies made curtseys in those days), with a pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he was than she. He made her another bow. \u201cI replied to the Bank, sir, that as it was considered necessary, by those who know, and who are so kind as to advise me, that I should go to France, and that as I am an orphan and have no friend who could go with me, I should esteem it highly if I might be permitted to place myself, during the journey, under that worthy gentleman's protection."], "What does JerryCruncher frequently go out to do at night?": [" It was the close of the summer day, and he knew Lucie to be out with Miss Pross. He found the Doctor reading in his arm-chair at a window. The energy which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated their sharpness, had been gradually restored to him. He was now a very energetic man indeed, with great firmness of purpose, strength of resolution, and vigour of action. In his recovered energy he was sometimes a little fitful and sudden, as he had at first been in the exercise of his other recovered faculties; but, this had never been frequently observable, and had grown more and more rare. He studied much, slept little, sustained a great deal of fatigue with ease, and was equably cheerful. To him, now entered Charles Darnay, at sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand. \u201cCharles Darnay! I rejoice to see you. We have been counting on your return these three or four days past. Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton were both here yesterday, and both made you out to be more than due.\u201d \u201cI am obliged to them for their interest in the matter,\u201d he answered, a little coldly as to them, though very warmly as to the Doctor. \u201cMiss Manette--\u201d \u201cIs well,\u201d said the Doctor, as he stopped short, \u201cand your return will delight us all. She has gone out on some household matters, but will soon be home.\u201d \u201cDoctor Manette, I knew she was from home. I took the opportunity of her being from home, to beg to speak to you.\u201d There was a blank silence.", " \u201cTell me when I ask you, not now. If your suit should prosper, if Lucie should love you, you shall tell me on your marriage morning. Do you promise?\u201d \u201cWillingly. \u201cGive me your hand. She will be home directly, and it is better she should not see us together to-night. Go! God bless you!\u201d It was dark when Charles Darnay left him, and it was an hour later and darker when Lucie came home; she hurried into the room alone--for Miss Pross had gone straight up-stairs--and was surprised to find his reading-chair empty. \u201cMy father!\u201d she called to him. \u201cFather dear!\u201d Nothing was said in answer, but she heard a low hammering sound in his bedroom. Passing lightly across the intermediate room, she looked in at his door and came running back frightened, crying to herself, with her blood all chilled, \u201cWhat shall I do! What shall I do!\u201d Her uncertainty lasted but a moment; she hurried back, and tapped at his door, and softly called to him. The noise ceased at the sound of her voice, and he presently came out to her, and they walked up and down together for a long time. She came down from her bed, to look at him in his sleep that night. He slept heavily, and his tray of shoemaking tools, and his old unfinished work, were all as usual. XI. A Companion Picture \u201cSydney,\u201d said Mr. Stryver, on that self-same night, or morning, to his jackal; \u201cmix another bowl of punch; I have something to say to you.\u201d Sydney had been working double tides that night, and the night before, and the night before that, and a good many nights in succession, making a grand clearance among Mr. Stryver's papers before the setting in of the long vacation.", " Now, a judicious selection from these with the least possible delay, and the burying of them, or otherwise getting of them out of harm's way, is within the power (without loss of precious time) of scarcely any one but myself, if any one. And shall I hang back, when Tellson's knows this and says this--Tellson's, whose bread I have eaten these sixty years--because I am a little stiff about the joints? Why, I am a boy, sir, to half a dozen old codgers here!\u201d \u201cHow I admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit, Mr. Lorry.\u201d \u201cTut! Nonsense, sir!--And, my dear Charles,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, glancing at the House again, \u201cyou are to remember, that getting things out of Paris at this present time, no matter what things, is next to an impossibility. Papers and precious matters were this very day brought to us here (I speak in strict confidence; it is not business-like to whisper it, even to you), by the strangest bearers you can imagine, every one of whom had his head hanging on by a single hair as he passed the Barriers. At another time, our parcels would come and go, as easily as in business-like Old England; but now, everything is stopped.\u201d \u201cAnd do you really go to-night?\u201d \u201cI really go to-night, for the case has become too pressing to admit of delay.\u201d \u201cAnd do you take no one with you?\u201d \u201cAll sorts of people have been proposed to me, but I will have nothing to say to any of them. I intend to take Jerry.", " It would seem to be always the same question, for, it is always followed by a press of people towards the third cart. The horsemen abreast of that cart, frequently point out one man in it with their swords. The leading curiosity is, to know which is he; he stands at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down, to converse with a mere girl who sits on the side of the cart, and holds his hand. He has no curiosity or care for the scene about him, and always speaks to the girl. Here and there in the long street of St. Honore, cries are raised against him. If they move him at all, it is only to a quiet smile, as he shakes his hair a little more loosely about his face. He cannot easily touch his face, his arms being bound. On the steps of a church, awaiting the coming-up of the tumbrils, stands the Spy and prison-sheep. He looks into the first of them: not there. He looks into the second: not there. He already asks himself, \u201cHas he sacrificed me?\u201d when his face clears, as he looks into the third. \u201cWhich is Evremonde?\u201d says a man behind him. \u201cThat. At the back there.\u201d \u201cWith his hand in the girl's?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d The man cries, \u201cDown, Evremonde! To the Guillotine all aristocrats! Down, Evremonde!\u201d \u201cHush, hush!\u201d the Spy entreats him, timidly. \u201cAnd why not, citizen?\u201d \u201cHe is going to pay the forfeit: it will be paid in five minutes more. Let him be at peace.\u201d But the man continuing to exclaim, \u201cDown, Evremonde!\u201d the face of Evremonde is for a moment turned towards him."], "Who informs theDefarges that Lucie Manette has married Charles Darnay?": [" \u201cVery interesting remembrances!\u201d said the spy. \u201cI have known Doctor Manette and his daughter, in England.\u201d \u201cYes?\u201d said Defarge. \u201cYou don't hear much about them now?\u201d said the spy. \u201cNo,\u201d said Defarge. \u201cIn effect,\u201d madame struck in, looking up from her work and her little song, \u201cwe never hear about them. We received the news of their safe arrival, and perhaps another letter, or perhaps two; but, since then, they have gradually taken their road in life--we, ours--and we have held no correspondence.\u201d \u201cPerfectly so, madame,\u201d replied the spy. \u201cShe is going to be married.\u201d \u201cGoing?\u201d echoed madame. \u201cShe was pretty enough to have been married long ago. You English are cold, it seems to me.\u201d \u201cOh! You know I am English.\u201d \u201cI perceive your tongue is,\u201d returned madame; \u201cand what the tongue is, I suppose the man is.\u201d He did not take the identification as a compliment; but he made the best of it, and turned it off with a laugh. After sipping his cognac to the end, he added: \u201cYes, Miss Manette is going to be married. But not to an Englishman; to one who, like herself, is French by birth. And speaking of Gaspard (ah, poor Gaspard! It was cruel, cruel! ), it is a curious thing that she is going to marry the nephew of Monsieur the Marquis, for whom Gaspard was exalted to that height of so many feet; in other words, the present Marquis. But he lives unknown in England, he is no Marquis there; he is Mr. Charles Darnay.", " The door of the Doctor's room opened, and he came out with Charles Darnay. He was so deadly pale--which had not been the case when they went in together--that no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face. But, in the composure of his manner he was unaltered, except that to the shrewd glance of Mr. Lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him, like a cold wind. He gave his arm to his daughter, and took her down-stairs to the chariot which Mr. Lorry had hired in honour of the day. The rest followed in another carriage, and soon, in a neighbouring church, where no strange eyes looked on, Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily married. Besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little group when it was done, some diamonds, very bright and sparkling, glanced on the bride's hand, which were newly released from the dark obscurity of one of Mr. Lorry's pockets. They returned home to breakfast, and all went well, and in due course the golden hair that had mingled with the poor shoemaker's white locks in the Paris garret, were mingled with them again in the morning sunlight, on the threshold of the door at parting. It was a hard parting, though it was not for long. But her father cheered her, and said at last, gently disengaging himself from her enfolding arms, \u201cTake her, Charles! She is yours!\u201d And her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window, and she was gone.", " Miss Lucie looks ill, Mr. Darnay has had a terrible day, we are worn out.\u201d \u201cSpeak for yourself, Mr. Lorry,\u201d said Stryver; \u201cI have a night's work to do yet. Speak for yourself.\u201d \u201cI speak for myself,\u201d answered Mr. Lorry, \u201cand for Mr. Darnay, and for Miss Lucie, and--Miss Lucie, do you not think I may speak for us all?\u201d He asked her the question pointedly, and with a glance at her father. His face had become frozen, as it were, in a very curious look at Darnay: an intent look, deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust, not even unmixed with fear. With this strange expression on him his thoughts had wandered away. \u201cMy father,\u201d said Lucie, softly laying her hand on his. He slowly shook the shadow off, and turned to her. \u201cShall we go home, my father?\u201d With a long breath, he answered \u201cYes.\u201d The friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the impression--which he himself had originated--that he would not be released that night. The lights were nearly all extinguished in the passages, the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle, and the dismal place was deserted until to-morrow morning's interest of gallows, pillory, whipping-post, and branding-iron, should repeople it. Walking between her father and Mr. Darnay, Lucie Manette passed into the open air. A hackney-coach was called, and the father and daughter departed in it. Mr. Stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back to the robing-room.", " You have loved yourself; let your old love speak for me!\u201d The Doctor sat with his face turned away, and his eyes bent on the ground. At the last words, he stretched out his hand again, hurriedly, and cried: \u201cNot that, sir! Let that be! I adjure you, do not recall that!\u201d His cry was so like a cry of actual pain, that it rang in Charles Darnay's ears long after he had ceased. He motioned with the hand he had extended, and it seemed to be an appeal to Darnay to pause. The latter so received it, and remained silent. \u201cI ask your pardon,\u201d said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, after some moments. \u201cI do not doubt your loving Lucie; you may be satisfied of it.\u201d He turned towards him in his chair, but did not look at him, or raise his eyes. His chin dropped upon his hand, and his white hair overshadowed his face: \u201cHave you spoken to Lucie?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cNor written?\u201d \u201cNever.\u201d \u201cIt would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self-denial is to be referred to your consideration for her father. Her father thanks you.\u201d He offered his hand; but his eyes did not go with it. \u201cI know,\u201d said Darnay, respectfully, \u201chow can I fail to know, Doctor Manette, I who have seen you together from day to day, that between you and Miss Manette there is an affection so unusual, so touching, so belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured, that it can have few parallels, even in the tenderness between a father and child."], "On the nightafter Lucie and Charles are married, what does Doctor Manette do?": [" \u201cVery interesting remembrances!\u201d said the spy. \u201cI have known Doctor Manette and his daughter, in England.\u201d \u201cYes?\u201d said Defarge. \u201cYou don't hear much about them now?\u201d said the spy. \u201cNo,\u201d said Defarge. \u201cIn effect,\u201d madame struck in, looking up from her work and her little song, \u201cwe never hear about them. We received the news of their safe arrival, and perhaps another letter, or perhaps two; but, since then, they have gradually taken their road in life--we, ours--and we have held no correspondence.\u201d \u201cPerfectly so, madame,\u201d replied the spy. \u201cShe is going to be married.\u201d \u201cGoing?\u201d echoed madame. \u201cShe was pretty enough to have been married long ago. You English are cold, it seems to me.\u201d \u201cOh! You know I am English.\u201d \u201cI perceive your tongue is,\u201d returned madame; \u201cand what the tongue is, I suppose the man is.\u201d He did not take the identification as a compliment; but he made the best of it, and turned it off with a laugh. After sipping his cognac to the end, he added: \u201cYes, Miss Manette is going to be married. But not to an Englishman; to one who, like herself, is French by birth. And speaking of Gaspard (ah, poor Gaspard! It was cruel, cruel! ), it is a curious thing that she is going to marry the nephew of Monsieur the Marquis, for whom Gaspard was exalted to that height of so many feet; in other words, the present Marquis. But he lives unknown in England, he is no Marquis there; he is Mr. Charles Darnay.", " Lucie and her father! Lucie with her arms stretched out to him, and with that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified, that it seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give force and power to it in this one passage of her life. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d cried Mr. Lorry, breathless and confused. \u201cWhat is the matter? Lucie! Manette! What has happened? What has brought you here? What is it?\u201d With the look fixed upon him, in her paleness and wildness, she panted out in his arms, imploringly, \u201cO my dear friend! My husband!\u201d \u201cYour husband, Lucie?\u201d \u201cCharles.\u201d \u201cWhat of Charles?\u201d \u201cHere. \u201cHere, in Paris?\u201d \u201cHas been here some days--three or four--I don't know how many--I can't collect my thoughts. An errand of generosity brought him here unknown to us; he was stopped at the barrier, and sent to prison.\u201d The old man uttered an irrepressible cry. Almost at the same moment, the bell of the great gate rang again, and a loud noise of feet and voices came pouring into the courtyard. \u201cWhat is that noise?\u201d said the Doctor, turning towards the window. \u201cDon't look!\u201d cried Mr. Lorry. \u201cDon't look out! Manette, for your life, don't touch the blind!\u201d The Doctor turned, with his hand upon the fastening of the window, and said, with a cool, bold smile: \u201cMy dear friend, I have a charmed life in this city. I have been a Bastille prisoner. There is no patriot in Paris--in Paris?", " Undoubtedly it was. Was he not an emigrant then? What did he call himself? Not an emigrant, he hoped, within the sense and spirit of the law. Why not? the President desired to know. Because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful to him, and a station that was distasteful to him, and had left his country--he submitted before the word emigrant in the present acceptation by the Tribunal was in use--to live by his own industry in England, rather than on the industry of the overladen people of France. What proof had he of this? He handed in the names of two witnesses; Theophile Gabelle, and Alexandre Manette. But he had married in England? the President reminded him. True, but not an English woman. A citizeness of France? Yes. By birth. Her name and family? \u201cLucie Manette, only daughter of Doctor Manette, the good physician who sits there.\u201d This answer had a happy effect upon the audience. Cries in exaltation of the well-known good physician rent the hall. So capriciously were the people moved, that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before, as if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill him. On these few steps of his dangerous way, Charles Darnay had set his foot according to Doctor Manette's reiterated instructions. The same cautious counsel directed every step that lay before him, and had prepared every inch of his road.", " \u201cYes?\u201d said the Doctor, with evident constraint. \u201cBring your chair here, and speak on.\u201d He complied as to the chair, but appeared to find the speaking on less easy. \u201cI have had the happiness, Doctor Manette, of being so intimate here,\u201d so he at length began, \u201cfor some year and a half, that I hope the topic on which I am about to touch may not--\u201d He was stayed by the Doctor's putting out his hand to stop him. When he had kept it so a little while, he said, drawing it back: \u201cIs Lucie the topic?\u201d \u201cShe is.\u201d \u201cIt is hard for me to speak of her at any time. It is very hard for me to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours, Charles Darnay.\u201d \u201cIt is a tone of fervent admiration, true homage, and deep love, Doctor Manette!\u201d he said deferentially. There was another blank silence before her father rejoined: \u201cI believe it. I do you justice; I believe it.\u201d His constraint was so manifest, and it was so manifest, too, that it originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject, that Charles Darnay hesitated. \u201cShall I go on, sir?\u201d Another blank. \u201cYes, go on.\u201d \u201cYou anticipate what I would say, though you cannot know how earnestly I say it, how earnestly I feel it, without knowing my secret heart, and the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been laden. Dear Doctor Manette, I love your daughter fondly, dearly, disinterestedly, devotedly. If ever there were love in the world, I love her."], "During the stormingof the Bastille, who decapitates the fortress\u2019s guard?": [" Jarvis Lorry.\u201d Our booked passenger showed in a moment that it was his name. The guard, the coachman, and the two other passengers eyed him distrustfully. \u201cKeep where you are,\u201d the guard called to the voice in the mist, \u201cbecause, if I should make a mistake, it could never be set right in your lifetime. Gentleman of the name of Lorry answer straight.\u201d \u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d asked the passenger, then, with mildly quavering speech. \u201cWho wants me? Is it Jerry?\u201d (\u201cI don't like Jerry's voice, if it is Jerry,\u201d growled the guard to himself. \u201cHe's hoarser than suits me, is Jerry.\u201d) \u201cYes, Mr. Lorry.\u201d \u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d \u201cA despatch sent after you from over yonder. T. and Co.\u201d \u201cI know this messenger, guard,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, getting down into the road--assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two passengers, who immediately scrambled into the coach, shut the door, and pulled up the window. \u201cHe may come close; there's nothing wrong.\u201d \u201cI hope there ain't, but I can't make so 'Nation sure of that,\u201d said the guard, in gruff soliloquy. \u201cHallo you!\u201d \u201cWell! And hallo you!\u201d said Jerry, more hoarsely than before. \u201cCome on at a footpace! d'ye mind me? And if you've got holsters to that saddle o' yourn, don't let me see your hand go nigh 'em. For I'm a devil at a quick mistake, and when I make one it takes the form of Lead. So now let's look at you.\u201d The figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist, and came to the side of the mail, where the passenger stood.", " The passenger booked by this history, was on the coach-step, getting in; the two other passengers were close behind him, and about to follow. He remained on the step, half in the coach and half out of; they remained in the road below him. They all looked from the coachman to the guard, and from the guard to the coachman, and listened. The coachman looked back and the guard looked back, and even the emphatic leader pricked up his ears and looked back, without contradicting. The stillness consequent on the cessation of the rumbling and labouring of the coach, added to the stillness of the night, made it very quiet indeed. The panting of the horses communicated a tremulous motion to the coach, as if it were in a state of agitation. The hearts of the passengers beat loud enough perhaps to be heard; but at any rate, the quiet pause was audibly expressive of people out of breath, and holding the breath, and having the pulses quickened by expectation. The sound of a horse at a gallop came fast and furiously up the hill. \u201cSo-ho!\u201d the guard sang out, as loud as he could roar. \u201cYo there! Stand! I shall fire!\u201d The pace was suddenly checked, and, with much splashing and floundering, a man's voice called from the mist, \u201cIs that the Dover mail?\u201d \u201cNever you mind what it is!\u201d the guard retorted. \u201cWhat are you?\u201d \u201c_Is_ that the Dover mail?\u201d \u201cWhy do you want to know?\u201d \u201cI want a passenger, if it is.\u201d \u201cWhat passenger?\u201d \u201cMr.", " The rider stooped, and, casting up his eyes at the guard, handed the passenger a small folded paper. The rider's horse was blown, and both horse and rider were covered with mud, from the hoofs of the horse to the hat of the man. \u201cGuard!\u201d said the passenger, in a tone of quiet business confidence. The watchful guard, with his right hand at the stock of his raised blunderbuss, his left at the barrel, and his eye on the horseman, answered curtly, \u201cSir.\u201d \u201cThere is nothing to apprehend. I belong to Tellson's Bank. You must know Tellson's Bank in London. I am going to Paris on business. A crown to drink. I may read this?\u201d \u201cIf so be as you're quick, sir.\u201d He opened it in the light of the coach-lamp on that side, and read--first to himself and then aloud: \u201c'Wait at Dover for Mam'selle.' It's not long, you see, guard. Jerry, say that my answer was, RECALLED TO LIFE.\u201d Jerry started in his saddle. \u201cThat's a Blazing strange answer, too,\u201d said he, at his hoarsest. \u201cTake that message back, and they will know that I received this, as well as if I wrote. Make the best of your way. Good night.\u201d With those words the passenger opened the coach-door and got in; not at all assisted by his fellow-passengers, who had expeditiously secreted their watches and purses in their boots, and were now making a general pretence of being asleep. With no more definite purpose than to escape the hazard of originating any other kind of action.", " It may be too late, I don't know, but let it not be a minute later!\u201d Doctor Manette pressed his hand, hastened bareheaded out of the room, and was in the courtyard when Mr. Lorry regained the blind. His streaming white hair, his remarkable face, and the impetuous confidence of his manner, as he put the weapons aside like water, carried him in an instant to the heart of the concourse at the stone. For a few moments there was a pause, and a hurry, and a murmur, and the unintelligible sound of his voice; and then Mr. Lorry saw him, surrounded by all, and in the midst of a line of twenty men long, all linked shoulder to shoulder, and hand to shoulder, hurried out with cries of--\u201cLive the Bastille prisoner! Help for the Bastille prisoner's kindred in La Force! Room for the Bastille prisoner in front there! Save the prisoner Evremonde at La Force!\u201d and a thousand answering shouts. He closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart, closed the window and the curtain, hastened to Lucie, and told her that her father was assisted by the people, and gone in search of her husband. He found her child and Miss Pross with her; but, it never occurred to him to be surprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards, when he sat watching them in such quiet as the night knew. Lucie had, by that time, fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet, clinging to his hand. Miss Pross had laid the child down on his own bed, and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty charge."], "Why does theParis mob kill Foulon?": [" From such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded, from their children, from their aged and their sick crouching on the bare ground famished and naked, they ran out with streaming hair, urging one another, and themselves, to madness with the wildest cries and actions. Villain Foulon taken, my sister! Old Foulon taken, my mother! Miscreant Foulon taken, my daughter! Then, a score of others ran into the midst of these, beating their breasts, tearing their hair, and screaming, Foulon alive! Foulon who told the starving people they might eat grass! Foulon who told my old father that he might eat grass, when I had no bread to give him! Foulon who told my baby it might suck grass, when these breasts were dry with want! O mother of God, this Foulon! O Heaven our suffering! Hear me, my dead baby and my withered father: I swear on my knees, on these stones, to avenge you on Foulon! Husbands, and brothers, and young men, Give us the blood of Foulon, Give us the head of Foulon, Give us the heart of Foulon, Give us the body and soul of Foulon, Rend Foulon to pieces, and dig him into the ground, that grass may grow from him! With these cries, numbers of the women, lashed into blind frenzy, whirled about, striking and tearing at their own friends until they dropped into a passionate swoon, and were only saved by the men belonging to them from being trampled under foot. Nevertheless, not a moment was lost; not a moment!", " But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous. In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night; families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their furniture to upholsterers' warehouses for security; the highwayman in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of \u201cthe Captain,\u201d gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and then got shot dead himself by the other four, \u201cin consequence of the failure of his ammunition:\u201d after which the mail was robbed in peace; that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball; thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles's, to search for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences much out of the common way.", " Ecod!\u201d growled Mr. Cruncher, \u201cit's you I have got a old grudge again, is it, with your shameful impositions upon tradesmen! I'd catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea.\u201d Sydney Carton, who, with Mr. Lorry, had been lost in amazement at this turn of the business, here requested Mr. Cruncher to moderate and explain himself. \u201cAt another time, sir,\u201d he returned, evasively, \u201cthe present time is ill-conwenient for explainin'. What I stand to, is, that he knows well wot that there Cly was never in that there coffin. Let him say he was, in so much as a word of one syllable, and I'll either catch hold of his throat and choke him for half a guinea;\u201d Mr. Cruncher dwelt upon this as quite a liberal offer; \u201cor I'll out and announce him.\u201d \u201cHumph! I see one thing,\u201d said Carton. \u201cI hold another card, Mr. Barsad. Impossible, here in raging Paris, with Suspicion filling the air, for you to outlive denunciation, when you are in communication with another aristocratic spy of the same antecedents as yourself, who, moreover, has the mystery about him of having feigned death and come to life again! A plot in the prisons, of the foreigner against the Republic. A strong card--a certain Guillotine card! Do you play?\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d returned the spy. \u201cI throw up. I confess that we were so unpopular with the outrageous mob, that I only got away from England at the risk of being ducked to death, and that Cly was so ferreted up and down, that he never would have got away at all but for that sham.", " Thus, with beer-drinking, pipe-smoking, song-roaring, and infinite caricaturing of woe, the disorderly procession went its way, recruiting at every step, and all the shops shutting up before it. Its destination was the old church of Saint Pancras, far off in the fields. It got there in course of time; insisted on pouring into the burial-ground; finally, accomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way, and highly to its own satisfaction. The dead man disposed of, and the crowd being under the necessity of providing some other entertainment for itself, another brighter genius (or perhaps the same) conceived the humour of impeaching casual passers-by, as Old Bailey spies, and wreaking vengeance on them. Chase was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near the Old Bailey in their lives, in the realisation of this fancy, and they were roughly hustled and maltreated. The transition to the sport of window-breaking, and thence to the plundering of public-houses, was easy and natural. At last, after several hours, when sundry summer-houses had been pulled down, and some area-railings had been torn up, to arm the more belligerent spirits, a rumour got about that the Guards were coming. Before this rumour, the crowd gradually melted away, and perhaps the Guards came, and perhaps they never came, and this was the usual progress of a mob. Mr. Cruncher did not assist at the closing sports, but had remained behind in the churchyard, to confer and condole with the undertakers."], "What is the durationof Manette\u2019s psychological relapse after Lucie leaves for her honeymoon?": [" The mind. It is the case of a shock under which the sufferer was borne down, one cannot say for how long, because I believe he cannot calculate the time himself, and there are no other means of getting at it. It is the case of a shock from which the sufferer recovered, by a process that he cannot trace himself--as I once heard him publicly relate in a striking manner. It is the case of a shock from which he has recovered, so completely, as to be a highly intelligent man, capable of close application of mind, and great exertion of body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his stock of knowledge, which was already very large. But, unfortunately, there has been,\u201d he paused and took a deep breath--\u201ca slight relapse.\u201d The Doctor, in a low voice, asked, \u201cOf how long duration?\u201d \u201cNine days and nights.\u201d \u201cHow did it show itself? I infer,\u201d glancing at his hands again, \u201cin the resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock?\u201d \u201cThat is the fact.\u201d \u201cNow, did you ever see him,\u201d asked the Doctor, distinctly and collectedly, though in the same low voice, \u201cengaged in that pursuit originally?\u201d \u201cOnce.\u201d \u201cAnd when the relapse fell on him, was he in most respects--or in all respects--as he was then?\u201d \u201cI think in all respects.\u201d \u201cYou spoke of his daughter. Does his daughter know of the relapse?\u201d \u201cNo. It has been kept from her, and I hope will always be kept from her. It is known only to myself, and to one other who may be trusted.\u201d The Doctor grasped his hand, and murmured, \u201cThat was very kind.", " That was very thoughtful!\u201d Mr. Lorry grasped his hand in return, and neither of the two spoke for a little while. \u201cNow, my dear Manette,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, at length, in his most considerate and most affectionate way, \u201cI am a mere man of business, and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters. I do not possess the kind of information necessary; I do not possess the kind of intelligence; I want guiding. There is no man in this world on whom I could so rely for right guidance, as on you. Tell me, how does this relapse come about? Is there danger of another? Could a repetition of it be prevented? How should a repetition of it be treated? How does it come about at all? What can I do for my friend? No man ever can have been more desirous in his heart to serve a friend, than I am to serve mine, if I knew how. \u201cBut I don't know how to originate, in such a case. If your sagacity, knowledge, and experience, could put me on the right track, I might be able to do so much; unenlightened and undirected, I can do so little. Pray discuss it with me; pray enable me to see it a little more clearly, and teach me how to be a little more useful.\u201d Doctor Manette sat meditating after these earnest words were spoken, and Mr. Lorry did not press him. \u201cI think it probable,\u201d said the Doctor, breaking silence with an effort, \u201cthat the relapse you have described, my dear friend, was not quite unforeseen by its subject.\u201d \u201cWas it dreaded by him?\u201d Mr. Lorry ventured to ask.", " Lucie and her father!

When the tea-table was done with, they all moved to one of the windows, and looked out into the heavy twilight. Lucie sat by her father; Darnay sat beside her; Carton leaned against a window. The curtains were long and white, and some of the thunder-gusts that whirled into the corner, caught them up to the ceiling, and waved them like spectral wings. \u201cThe rain-drops are still falling, large, heavy, and few,\u201d said Doctor Manette. \u201cIt comes slowly.\u201d \u201cIt comes surely,\u201d said Carton.

There was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to get shelter before the storm broke; the wonderful corner for echoes resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going, yet not a footstep was there. \u201cA multitude of people, and yet a solitude!\u201d said Darnay, when they had listened for a while. \u201cIs it not impressive, Mr. Darnay?\u201d asked Lucie. \u201cSometimes, I have sat here of an evening, until I have fancied--but even the shade of a foolish fancy makes me shudder to-night, when all is so black and solemn--\u201d \u201cLet us shudder too.", " He always resolutely answered: \u201cNothing can happen to him without my knowledge, and I know that I can save him, Lucie.\u201d They had not made the round of their changed life many weeks, when her father said to her, on coming home one evening: \u201cMy dear, there is an upper window in the prison, to which Charles can sometimes gain access at three in the afternoon. When he can get to it--which depends on many uncertainties and incidents--he might see you in the street, he thinks, if you stood in a certain place that I can show you. But you will not be able to see him, my poor child, and even if you could, it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition.\u201d \u201cO show me the place, my father, and I will go there every day.\u201d From that time, in all weathers, she waited there two hours. As the clock struck two, she was there, and at four she turned resignedly away. When it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with her, they went together; at other times she was alone; but, she never missed a single day. It was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street. The hovel of a cutter of wood into lengths for burning, was the only house at that end; all else was wall. On the third day of her being there, he noticed her. \u201cGood day, citizeness.\u201d \u201cGood day, citizen.\u201d This mode of address was now prescribed by decree. It had been established voluntarily some time ago, among the more thorough patriots; but, was now law for everybody.", " And it was now, about little Lucie's sixth birthday, that they began to have an awful sound, as of a great storm in France with a dreadful sea rising. On a night in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine, Mr. Lorry came in late, from Tellson's, and sat himself down by Lucie and her husband in the dark window. It was a hot, wild night, and they were all three reminded of the old Sunday night when they had looked at the lightning from the same place. \u201cI began to think,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, pushing his brown wig back, \u201cthat I should have to pass the night at Tellson's. We have been so full of business all day, that we have not known what to do first, or which way to turn. There is such an uneasiness in Paris, that we have actually a run of confidence upon us! Our customers over there, seem not to be able to confide their property to us fast enough. There is positively a mania among some of them for sending it to England.\u201d \u201cThat has a bad look,\u201d said Darnay-- \u201cA bad look, you say, my dear Darnay? Yes, but we don't know what reason there is in it. People are so unreasonable! Some of us at Tellson's are getting old, and we really can't be troubled out of the ordinary course without due occasion.\u201d \u201cStill,\u201d said Darnay, \u201cyou know how gloomy and threatening the sky is.\u201d \u201cI know that, to be sure,\u201d assented Mr. Lorry, trying to persuade himself that his sweet temper was soured, and that he grumbled, \u201cbut I am determined to be peevish after my long day's botheration.", " Do you not believe it is the truth?\u201d \u201cA bad truth for you,\u201d said Defarge, speaking with knitted brows, and looking straight before him. \u201cIndeed I am lost here. All here is so unprecedented, so changed, so sudden and unfair, that I am absolutely lost. Will you render me a little help?\u201d \u201cNone.\u201d Defarge spoke, always looking straight before him. \u201cWill you answer me a single question?\u201d \u201cPerhaps. According to its nature. You can say what it is.\u201d \u201cIn this prison that I am going to so unjustly, shall I have some free communication with the world outside?\u201d \u201cYou will see.\u201d \u201cI am not to be buried there, prejudged, and without any means of presenting my case?\u201d \u201cYou will see. But, what then? Other people have been similarly buried in worse prisons, before now.\u201d \u201cBut never by me, Citizen Defarge.\u201d Defarge glanced darkly at him for answer, and walked on in a steady and set silence. The deeper he sank into this silence, the fainter hope there was--or so Darnay thought--of his softening in any slight degree. He, therefore, made haste to say: \u201cIt is of the utmost importance to me (you know, Citizen, even better than I, of how much importance), that I should be able to communicate to Mr. Lorry of Tellson's Bank, an English gentleman who is now in Paris, the simple fact, without comment, that I have been thrown into the prison of La Force. Will you cause that to be done for me?\u201d \u201cI will do,\u201d Defarge doggedly rejoined, \u201cnothing for you."], "Who does thespy John Barsad turn out to be?": [" Might I ask the favour? As to whether your name is John Solomon, or Solomon John?\u201d The official turned towards him with sudden distrust. He had not previously uttered a word. \u201cCome!\u201d said Mr. Cruncher. \u201cSpeak out, you know.\u201d (Which, by the way, was more than he could do himself.) \u201cJohn Solomon, or Solomon John? She calls you Solomon, and she must know, being your sister. And _I_ know you're John, you know. Which of the two goes first? And regarding that name of Pross, likewise. That warn't your name over the water.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cWell, I don't know all I mean, for I can't call to mind what your name was, over the water.\u201d \u201cNo?\u201d \u201cNo. But I'll swear it was a name of two syllables.\u201d \u201cIndeed?\u201d \u201cYes. T'other one's was one syllable. I know you. You was a spy--witness at the Bailey. What, in the name of the Father of Lies, own father to yourself, was you called at that time?\u201d \u201cBarsad,\u201d said another voice, striking in. \u201cThat's the name for a thousand pound!\u201d cried Jerry. The speaker who struck in, was Sydney Carton. He had his hands behind him under the skirts of his riding-coat, and he stood at Mr. Cruncher's elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the Old Bailey itself. \u201cDon't be alarmed, my dear Miss Pross. I arrived at Mr. Lorry's, to his surprise, yesterday evening; we agreed that I would not present myself elsewhere until all was well, or unless I could be useful; I present myself here, to beg a little talk with your brother.", " They left her at the corner of the street, and Carton led the way to Mr. Lorry's, which was within a few minutes' walk. John Barsad, or Solomon Pross, walked at his side. Mr. Lorry had just finished his dinner, and was sitting before a cheery little log or two of fire--perhaps looking into their blaze for the picture of that younger elderly gentleman from Tellson's, who had looked into the red coals at the Royal George at Dover, now a good many years ago. He turned his head as they entered, and showed the surprise with which he saw a stranger. \u201cMiss Pross's brother, sir,\u201d said Sydney. \u201cMr. Barsad.\u201d \u201cBarsad?\u201d repeated the old gentleman, \u201cBarsad? I have an association with the name--and with the face.\u201d \u201cI told you you had a remarkable face, Mr. Barsad,\u201d observed Carton, coolly. \u201cPray sit down.\u201d As he took a chair himself, he supplied the link that Mr. Lorry wanted, by saying to him with a frown, \u201cWitness at that trial.\u201d Mr. Lorry immediately remembered, and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised look of abhorrence. \u201cMr. Barsad has been recognised by Miss Pross as the affectionate brother you have heard of,\u201d said Sydney, \u201cand has acknowledged the relationship. I pass to worse news. Darnay has been arrested again.\u201d Struck with consternation, the old gentleman exclaimed, \u201cWhat do you tell me! I left him safe and free within these two hours, and am about to return to him!\u201d \u201cArrested for all that.", " Monsieur Defarge alighted; knowing one or two of the soldiery there, and one of the police. The latter he was intimate with, and affectionately embraced. When Saint Antoine had again enfolded the Defarges in his dusky wings, and they, having finally alighted near the Saint's boundaries, were picking their way on foot through the black mud and offal of his streets, Madame Defarge spoke to her husband: \u201cSay then, my friend; what did Jacques of the police tell thee?\u201d \u201cVery little to-night, but all he knows. There is another spy commissioned for our quarter. There may be many more, for all that he can say, but he knows of one.\u201d \u201cEh well!\u201d said Madame Defarge, raising her eyebrows with a cool business air. \u201cIt is necessary to register him. How do they call that man?\u201d \u201cHe is English.\u201d \u201cSo much the better. His name?\u201d \u201cBarsad,\u201d said Defarge, making it French by pronunciation. But, he had been so careful to get it accurately, that he then spelt it with perfect correctness. \u201cBarsad,\u201d repeated madame. \u201cGood. Christian name?\u201d \u201cJohn.\u201d \u201cJohn Barsad,\u201d repeated madame, after murmuring it once to herself. \u201cGood. His appearance; is it known?\u201d \u201cAge, about forty years; height, about five feet nine; black hair; complexion dark; generally, rather handsome visage; eyes dark, face thin, long, and sallow; nose aquiline, but not straight, having a peculiar inclination towards the left cheek; expression, therefore, sinister.\u201d \u201cEh my faith.", " I wish you had a better employed brother than Mr. Barsad. I wish for your sake Mr. Barsad was not a Sheep of the Prisons.\u201d Sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy, under the gaolers. The spy, who was pale, turned paler, and asked him how he dared-- \u201cI'll tell you,\u201d said Sydney. \u201cI lighted on you, Mr. Barsad, coming out of the prison of the Conciergerie while I was contemplating the walls, an hour or more ago. You have a face to be remembered, and I remember faces well. Made curious by seeing you in that connection, and having a reason, to which you are no stranger, for associating you with the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate, I walked in your direction. I walked into the wine-shop here, close after you, and sat near you. I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved conversation, and the rumour openly going about among your admirers, the nature of your calling. And gradually, what I had done at random, seemed to shape itself into a purpose, Mr. Barsad.\u201d \u201cWhat purpose?\u201d the spy asked. \u201cIt would be troublesome, and might be dangerous, to explain in the street. Could you favour me, in confidence, with some minutes of your company--at the office of Tellson's Bank, for instance?\u201d \u201cUnder a threat?\u201d \u201cOh! Did I say that?\u201d \u201cThen, why should I go there?\u201d \u201cReally, Mr. Barsad, I can't say, if you can't.\u201d \u201cDo you mean that you won't say, sir?\u201d the spy irresolutely asked."], "Why was DoctorManette imprisoned?": [" No, gentlemen; he'll always show 'em a clean pair of heels very early in the scuffle, and sneak away.\u201d With those words, and a final snap of his fingers, Mr. Stryver shouldered himself into Fleet-street, amidst the general approbation of his hearers. Mr. Lorry and Charles Darnay were left alone at the desk, in the general departure from the Bank. \u201cWill you take charge of the letter?\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cYou know where to deliver it?\u201d \u201cI do.\u201d \u201cWill you undertake to explain, that we suppose it to have been addressed here, on the chance of our knowing where to forward it, and that it has been here some time?\u201d \u201cI will do so. Do you start for Paris from here?\u201d \u201cFrom here, at eight.\u201d \u201cI will come back, to see you off.\u201d Very ill at ease with himself, and with Stryver and most other men, Darnay made the best of his way into the quiet of the Temple, opened the letter, and read it. These were its contents: \u201cPrison of the Abbaye, Paris. \u201cJune 21, 1792. \u201cMONSIEUR HERETOFORE THE MARQUIS. \u201cAfter having long been in danger of my life at the hands of the village, I have been seized, with great violence and indignity, and brought a long journey on foot to Paris. On the road I have suffered a great deal. Nor is that all; my house has been destroyed--razed to the ground. \u201cThe crime for which I am imprisoned, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, and for which I shall be summoned before the tribunal, and shall lose my life (without your so generous help), is, they tell me, treason against the majesty of the people, in that I have acted against them for an emigrant.", " \u201cHow many more!\u201d The gaoler's wife, being provided with no answer to the question, merely replied, \u201cOne must have patience, my dear!\u201d Three turnkeys who entered responsive to a bell she rang, echoed the sentiment, and one added, \u201cFor the love of Liberty;\u201d which sounded in that place like an inappropriate conclusion. The prison of La Force was a gloomy prison, dark and filthy, and with a horrible smell of foul sleep in it. Extraordinary how soon the noisome flavour of imprisoned sleep, becomes manifest in all such places that are ill cared for! \u201cIn secret, too,\u201d grumbled the gaoler, looking at the written paper. \u201cAs if I was not already full to bursting!\u201d He stuck the paper on a file, in an ill-humour, and Charles Darnay awaited his further pleasure for half an hour: sometimes, pacing to and fro in the strong arched room: sometimes, resting on a stone seat: in either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his subordinates. \u201cCome!\u201d said the chief, at length taking up his keys, \u201ccome with me, emigrant.\u201d Through the dismal prison twilight, his new charge accompanied him by corridor and staircase, many doors clanging and locking behind them, until they came into a large, low, vaulted chamber, crowded with prisoners of both sexes. The women were seated at a long table, reading and writing, knitting, sewing, and embroidering; the men were for the most part standing behind their chairs, or lingering up and down the room.", " But, he had oppressed no man, he had imprisoned no man; he was so far from having harshly exacted payment of his dues, that he had relinquished them of his own will, thrown himself on a world with no favour in it, won his own private place there, and earned his own bread. Monsieur Gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate on written instructions, to spare the people, to give them what little there was to give--such fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have in the winter, and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in the summer--and no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof, for his own safety, so that it could not but appear now. This favoured the desperate resolution Charles Darnay had begun to make, that he would go to Paris. Yes. Like the mariner in the old story, the winds and streams had driven him within the influence of the Loadstone Rock, and it was drawing him to itself, and he must go. Everything that arose before his mind drifted him on, faster and faster, more and more steadily, to the terrible attraction. His latent uneasiness had been, that bad aims were being worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments, and that he who could not fail to know that he was better than they, was not there, trying to do something to stay bloodshed, and assert the claims of mercy and humanity. With this uneasiness half stifled, and half reproaching him, he had been brought to the pointed comparison of himself with the brave old gentleman in whom duty was so strong; upon that comparison (injurious to himself) had instantly followed the sneers of Monseigneur, which had stung him bitterly, and those of Stryver, which above all were coarse and galling, for old reasons.", " Though days and nights circled as regularly as when time was young, and the evening and morning were the first day, other count of time there was none. Hold of it was lost in the raging fever of a nation, as it is in the fever of one patient. Now, breaking the unnatural silence of a whole city, the executioner showed the people the head of the king--and now, it seemed almost in the same breath, the head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned widowhood and misery, to turn it grey. And yet, observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in all such cases, the time was long, while it flamed by so fast. A revolutionary tribunal in the capital, and forty or fifty thousand revolutionary committees all over the land; a law of the Suspected, which struck away all security for liberty or life, and delivered over any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one; prisons gorged with people who had committed no offence, and could obtain no hearing; these things became the established order and nature of appointed things, and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old. Above all, one hideous figure grew as familiar as if it had been before the general gaze from the foundations of the world--the figure of the sharp female called La Guillotine. It was the popular theme for jests; it was the best cure for headache, it infallibly prevented the hair from turning grey, it imparted a peculiar delicacy to the complexion, it was the National Razor which shaved close: who kissed La Guillotine, looked through the little window and sneezed into the sack."], "Who is Miss Pross\u2019s brother, whose real name is Solomon, and a British spy?": [" Do you want to be the death of me?\u201d asked the man, in a furtive, frightened way. \u201cBrother, brother!\u201d cried Miss Pross, bursting into tears. \u201cHave I ever been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question?\u201d \u201cThen hold your meddlesome tongue,\u201d said Solomon, \u201cand come out, if you want to speak to me. Pay for your wine, and come out. Who's this man?\u201d Miss Pross, shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means affectionate brother, said through her tears, \u201cMr. Cruncher.\u201d \u201cLet him come out too,\u201d said Solomon. \u201cDoes he think me a ghost?\u201d Apparently, Mr. Cruncher did, to judge from his looks. He said not a word, however, and Miss Pross, exploring the depths of her reticule through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine. As she did so, Solomon turned to the followers of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, and offered a few words of explanation in the French language, which caused them all to relapse into their former places and pursuits. \u201cNow,\u201d said Solomon, stopping at the dark street corner, \u201cwhat do you want?\u201d \u201cHow dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away from!\u201d cried Miss Pross, \u201cto give me such a greeting, and show me no affection.\u201d \u201cThere. Confound it! There,\u201d said Solomon, making a dab at Miss Pross's lips with his own. \u201cNow are you content?\u201d Miss Pross only shook her head and wept in silence. \u201cIf you expect me to be surprised,\u201d said her brother Solomon, \u201cI am not surprised; I knew you were here; I know of most people who are here.", " Might I ask the favour? As to whether your name is John Solomon, or Solomon John?\u201d The official turned towards him with sudden distrust. He had not previously uttered a word. \u201cCome!\u201d said Mr. Cruncher. \u201cSpeak out, you know.\u201d (Which, by the way, was more than he could do himself.) \u201cJohn Solomon, or Solomon John? She calls you Solomon, and she must know, being your sister. And _I_ know you're John, you know. Which of the two goes first? And regarding that name of Pross, likewise. That warn't your name over the water.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cWell, I don't know all I mean, for I can't call to mind what your name was, over the water.\u201d \u201cNo?\u201d \u201cNo. But I'll swear it was a name of two syllables.\u201d \u201cIndeed?\u201d \u201cYes.

He had his hands behind him under the skirts of his riding-coat, and he stood at Mr. Cruncher's elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the Old Bailey itself. \u201cDon't be alarmed, my dear Miss Pross. I arrived at Mr. Lorry's, to his surprise, yesterday evening; we agreed that I would not present myself elsewhere until all was well, or unless I could be useful; I present myself here, to beg a little talk with your brother.", " He knew enough of the world to know that there is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart; so rendered and so free from any mercenary taint, he had such an exalted respect for it, that in the retributive arrangements made by his own mind--we all make such arrangements, more or less--he stationed Miss Pross much nearer to the lower Angels than many ladies immeasurably better got up both by Nature and Art, who had balances at Tellson's. \u201cThere never was, nor will be, but one man worthy of Ladybird,\u201d said Miss Pross; \u201cand that was my brother Solomon, if he hadn't made a mistake in life.\u201d Here again: Mr. Lorry's inquiries into Miss Pross's personal history had established the fact that her brother Solomon was a heartless scoundrel who had stripped her of everything she possessed, as a stake to speculate with, and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore, with no touch of compunction. Miss Pross's fidelity of belief in Solomon (deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake) was quite a serious matter with Mr. Lorry, and had its weight in his good opinion of her. \u201cAs we happen to be alone for the moment, and are both people of business,\u201d he said, when they had got back to the drawing-room and had sat down there in friendly relations, \u201clet me ask you--does the Doctor, in talking with Lucie, never refer to the shoemaking time, yet?\u201d \u201cNever.\u201d \u201cAnd yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him?\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d returned Miss Pross, shaking her head.", " As their wine was measuring out, a man parted from another man in a corner, and rose to depart. In going, he had to face Miss Pross. No sooner did he face her, than Miss Pross uttered a scream, and clapped her hands. In a moment, the whole company were on their feet. That somebody was assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the likeliest occurrence. Everybody looked to see somebody fall, but only saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other; the man with all the outward aspect of a Frenchman and a thorough Republican; the woman, evidently English. What was said in this disappointing anti-climax, by the disciples of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, except that it was something very voluble and loud, would have been as so much Hebrew or Chaldean to Miss Pross and her protector, though they had been all ears. But, they had no ears for anything in their surprise. For, it must be recorded, that not only was Miss Pross lost in amazement and agitation, but, Mr. Cruncher--though it seemed on his own separate and individual account--was in a state of the greatest wonder. \u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d said the man who had caused Miss Pross to scream; speaking in a vexed, abrupt voice (though in a low tone), and in English. \u201cOh, Solomon, dear Solomon!\u201d cried Miss Pross, clapping her hands again. \u201cAfter not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time, do I find you here!\u201d \u201cDon't call me Solomon."], "What is Charles Darnay\u2019s real last name?": [" The real Banking-house by Temple Bar, the real business of the past day, the real strong rooms, the real express sent after him, and the real message returned, would all be there. Out of the midst of them, the ghostly face would rise, and he would accost it again. \u201cBuried how long?\u201d \u201cAlmost eighteen years.\u201d \u201cI hope you care to live?\u201d \u201cI can't say.\u201d Dig--dig--dig--until an impatient movement from one of the two passengers would admonish him to pull up the window, draw his arm securely through the leathern strap, and speculate upon the two slumbering forms, until his mind lost its hold of them, and they again slid away into the bank and the grave. \u201cBuried how long?\u201d \u201cAlmost eighteen years.\u201d \u201cYou had abandoned all hope of being dug out?\u201d \u201cLong ago.\u201d The words were still in his hearing as just spoken--distinctly in his hearing as ever spoken words had been in his life--when the weary passenger started to the consciousness of daylight, and found that the shadows of the night were gone. He lowered the window, and looked out at the rising sun. There was a ridge of ploughed land, with a plough upon it where it had been left last night when the horses were unyoked; beyond, a quiet coppice-wood, in which many leaves of burning red and golden yellow still remained upon the trees. Though the earth was cold and wet, the sky was clear, and the sun rose bright, placid, and beautiful. \u201cEighteen years!\u201d said the passenger, looking at the sun.", " And it was such vapouring all about his ears, like a troublesome confusion of blood in his own head, added to a latent uneasiness in his mind, which had already made Charles Darnay restless, and which still kept him so. Among the talkers, was Stryver, of the King's Bench Bar, far on his way to state promotion, and, therefore, loud on the theme: broaching to Monseigneur, his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating them from the face of the earth, and doing without them: and for accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race. Him, Darnay heard with a particular feeling of objection; and Darnay stood divided between going away that he might hear no more, and remaining to interpose his word, when the thing that was to be, went on to shape itself out. The House approached Mr. Lorry, and laying a soiled and unopened letter before him, asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to whom it was addressed? The House laid the letter down so close to Darnay that he saw the direction--the more quickly because it was his own right name. The address, turned into English, ran: \u201cVery pressing. To Monsieur heretofore the Marquis St. Evremonde, of France. Confided to the cares of Messrs. Tellson and Co., Bankers, London, England.\u201d On the marriage morning, Doctor Manette had made it his one urgent and express request to Charles Darnay, that the secret of this name should be--unless he, the Doctor, dissolved the obligation--kept inviolate between them.", " How does it feel? Is it worth being tried for one's life, to be the object of such sympathy and compassion, Mr. Darnay?\u201d Again Darnay answered not a word. \u201cShe was mightily pleased to have your message, when I gave it her. Not that she showed she was pleased, but I suppose she was.\u201d The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this disagreeable companion had, of his own free will, assisted him in the strait of the day. He turned the dialogue to that point, and thanked him for it. \u201cI neither want any thanks, nor merit any,\u201d was the careless rejoinder. \u201cIt was nothing to do, in the first place; and I don't know why I did it, in the second. Mr. Darnay, let me ask you a question.\u201d \u201cWillingly, and a small return for your good offices.\u201d \u201cDo you think I particularly like you?\u201d \u201cReally, Mr. Carton,\u201d returned the other, oddly disconcerted, \u201cI have not asked myself the question.\u201d \u201cBut ask yourself the question now.\u201d \u201cYou have acted as if you do; but I don't think you do.\u201d \u201c_I_ don't think I do,\u201d said Carton. \u201cI begin to have a very good opinion of your understanding.\u201d \u201cNevertheless,\u201d pursued Darnay, rising to ring the bell, \u201cthere is nothing in that, I hope, to prevent my calling the reckoning, and our parting without ill-blood on either side.\u201d Carton rejoining, \u201cNothing in life!\u201d Darnay rang. \u201cDo you call the whole reckoning?\u201d said Carton. On his answering in the affirmative, \u201cThen bring me another pint of this same wine, drawer, and come and wake me at ten.\u201d The bill being paid, Charles Darnay rose and wished him good night.", " I doubt if I should abuse the permission. It is a hundred to one if I should avail myself of it four times in a year. It would satisfy me, I dare say, to know that I had it.\u201d \u201cWill you try?\u201d \u201cThat is another way of saying that I am placed on the footing I have indicated. I thank you, Darnay. I may use that freedom with your name?\u201d \u201cI think so, Carton, by this time.\u201d They shook hands upon it, and Sydney turned away. Within a minute afterwards, he was, to all outward appearance, as unsubstantial as ever. When he was gone, and in the course of an evening passed with Miss Pross, the Doctor, and Mr. Lorry, Charles Darnay made some mention of this conversation in general terms, and spoke of Sydney Carton as a problem of carelessness and recklessness. He spoke of him, in short, not bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him, but as anybody might who saw him as he showed himself. He had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young wife; but, when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms, he found her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly marked. \u201cWe are thoughtful to-night!\u201d said Darnay, drawing his arm about her. \u201cYes, dearest Charles,\u201d with her hands on his breast, and the inquiring and attentive expression fixed upon him; \u201cwe are rather thoughtful to-night, for we have something on our mind to-night.\u201d \u201cWhat is it, my Lucie?\u201d \u201cWill you promise not to press one question on me, if I beg you not to ask it?\u201d \u201cWill I promise?"], "Whose side occupation is as a \u201cResurrection-Man\u201d?": [" Young Jerry, walking with the stool under his arm at his father's side along sunny and crowded Fleet-street, was a very different Young Jerry from him of the previous night, running home through darkness and solitude from his grim pursuer. His cunning was fresh with the day, and his qualms were gone with the night--in which particulars it is not improbable that he had compeers in Fleet-street and the City of London, that fine morning. \u201cFather,\u201d said Young Jerry, as they walked along: taking care to keep at arm's length and to have the stool well between them: \u201cwhat's a Resurrection-Man?\u201d Mr. Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered, \u201cHow should I know?\u201d \u201cI thought you knowed everything, father,\u201d said the artless boy. \u201cHem! Well,\u201d returned Mr. Cruncher, going on again, and lifting off his hat to give his spikes free play, \u201che's a tradesman.\u201d \u201cWhat's his goods, father?\u201d asked the brisk Young Jerry. \u201cHis goods,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, after turning it over in his mind, \u201cis a branch of Scientific goods.\u201d \u201cPersons' bodies, ain't it, father?\u201d asked the lively boy. \u201cI believe it is something of that sort,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher. \u201cOh, father, I should so like to be a Resurrection-Man when I'm quite growed up!\u201d Mr. Cruncher was soothed, but shook his head in a dubious and moral way. \u201cIt depends upon how you dewelop your talents. Be careful to dewelop your talents, and never to say no more than you can help to nobody, and there's no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit for.\u201d As Young Jerry, thus encouraged, went on a few yards in advance, to plant the stool in the shadow of the Bar, Mr. Cruncher added to himself: \u201cJerry, you honest tradesman, there's hopes wot that boy will yet be a blessing to you, and a recompense to you for his mother!\u201d XV.", " This had been so very noticeable, so very powerfully and naturally shown, that starers who had had no pity for him were touched by her; and the whisper went about, \u201cWho are they?\u201d Jerry, the messenger, who had made his own observations, in his own manner, and who had been sucking the rust off his fingers in his absorption, stretched his neck to hear who they were. The crowd about him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant, and from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back; at last it got to Jerry: \u201cWitnesses.\u201d \u201cFor which side?\u201d \u201cAgainst.\u201d \u201cAgainst what side?\u201d \u201cThe prisoner's.\u201d The Judge, whose eyes had gone in the general direction, recalled them, leaned back in his seat, and looked steadily at the man whose life was in his hand, as Mr. Attorney-General rose to spin the rope, grind the axe, and hammer the nails into the scaffold. III. A Disappointment Mr. Attorney-General had to inform the jury, that the prisoner before them, though young in years, was old in the treasonable practices which claimed the forfeit of his life. That this correspondence with the public enemy was not a correspondence of to-day, or of yesterday, or even of last year, or of the year before. That, it was certain the prisoner had, for longer than that, been in the habit of passing and repassing between France and England, on secret business of which he could give no honest account.", " Yet, a French Tellson's could get on with these things exceedingly well, and, as long as the times held together, no man had taken fright at them, and drawn out his money. What money would be drawn out of Tellson's henceforth, and what would lie there, lost and forgotten; what plate and jewels would tarnish in Tellson's hiding-places, while the depositors rusted in prisons, and when they should have violently perished; how many accounts with Tellson's never to be balanced in this world, must be carried over into the next; no man could have said, that night, any more than Mr. Jarvis Lorry could, though he thought heavily of these questions. He sat by a newly-lighted wood fire (the blighted and unfruitful year was prematurely cold), and on his honest and courageous face there was a deeper shade than the pendent lamp could throw, or any object in the room distortedly reflect--a shade of horror. He occupied rooms in the Bank, in his fidelity to the House of which he had grown to be a part, like strong root-ivy. It chanced that they derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main building, but the true-hearted old gentleman never calculated about that. All such circumstances were indifferent to him, so that he did his duty. On the opposite side of the courtyard, under a colonnade, was extensive standing--for carriages--where, indeed, some carriages of Monseigneur yet stood.", " Mr. Cruncher's temper was not at all improved when he came to his breakfast. He resented Mrs. Cruncher's saying grace with particular animosity. \u201cNow, Aggerawayter! What are you up to? At it again?\u201d His wife explained that she had merely \u201casked a blessing.\u201d \u201cDon't do it!\u201d said Mr. Crunches looking about, as if he rather expected to see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his wife's petitions. \u201cI ain't a going to be blest out of house and home. I won't have my wittles blest off my table. Keep still!\u201d Exceedingly red-eyed and grim, as if he had been up all night at a party which had taken anything but a convivial turn, Jerry Cruncher worried his breakfast rather than ate it, growling over it like any four-footed inmate of a menagerie. Towards nine o'clock he smoothed his ruffled aspect, and, presenting as respectable and business-like an exterior as he could overlay his natural self with, issued forth to the occupation of the day. It could scarcely be called a trade, in spite of his favourite description of himself as \u201ca honest tradesman.\u201d His stock consisted of a wooden stool, made out of a broken-backed chair cut down, which stool, young Jerry, walking at his father's side, carried every morning to beneath the banking-house window that was nearest Temple Bar: where, with the addition of the first handful of straw that could be gleaned from any passing vehicle to keep the cold and wet from the odd-job-man's feet, it formed the encampment for the day."], "What saves Sydney Carton from his self-proclaimed wasted life?": [" In your own heart, do you feel quite certain?\u201d Her father answered, with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could scarcely have assumed, \u201cQuite sure, my darling! More than that,\u201d he added, as he tenderly kissed her: \u201cmy future is far brighter, Lucie, seen through your marriage, than it could have been--nay, than it ever was--without it.\u201d \u201cIf I could hope _that_, my father!--\u201d \u201cBelieve it, love! Indeed it is so. Consider how natural and how plain it is, my dear, that it should be so. You, devoted and young, cannot fully appreciate the anxiety I have felt that your life should not be wasted--\u201d She moved her hand towards his lips, but he took it in his, and repeated the word. \u201c--wasted, my child--should not be wasted, struck aside from the natural order of things--for my sake. Your unselfishness cannot entirely comprehend how much my mind has gone on this; but, only ask yourself, how could my happiness be perfect, while yours was incomplete?\u201d \u201cIf I had never seen Charles, my father, I should have been quite happy with you.\u201d He smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy without Charles, having seen him; and replied: \u201cMy child, you did see him, and it is Charles. If it had not been Charles, it would have been another. Or, if it had been no other, I should have been the cause, and then the dark part of my life would have cast its shadow beyond myself, and would have fallen on you.\u201d It was the first time, except at the trial, of her ever hearing him refer to the period of his suffering.", " I mean I am a man of more--more--\u201d \u201cSay gallantry, while you are about it,\u201d suggested Carton. \u201cWell! I'll say gallantry. My meaning is that I am a man,\u201d said Stryver, inflating himself at his friend as he made the punch, \u201cwho cares more to be agreeable, who takes more pains to be agreeable, who knows better how to be agreeable, in a woman's society, than you do.\u201d \u201cGo on,\u201d said Sydney Carton. \u201cNo; but before I go on,\u201d said Stryver, shaking his head in his bullying way, \u201cI'll have this out with you. You've been at Doctor Manette's house as much as I have, or more than I have. Why, I have been ashamed of your moroseness there! Your manners have been of that silent and sullen and hangdog kind, that, upon my life and soul, I have been ashamed of you, Sydney!\u201d \u201cIt should be very beneficial to a man in your practice at the bar, to be ashamed of anything,\u201d returned Sydney; \u201cyou ought to be much obliged to me.\u201d \u201cYou shall not get off in that way,\u201d rejoined Stryver, shouldering the rejoinder at him; \u201cno, Sydney, it's my duty to tell you--and I tell you to your face to do you good--that you are a devilish ill-conditioned fellow in that sort of society. You are a disagreeable fellow.\u201d Sydney drank a bumper of the punch he had made, and laughed. \u201cLook at me!\u201d said Stryver, squaring himself; \u201cI have less need to make myself agreeable than you have, being more independent in circumstances. Why do I do it?\u201d \u201cI never saw you do it yet,\u201d muttered Carton.", " \u201cI do it because it's politic; I do it on principle. And look at me! I get on.\u201d \u201cYou don't get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions,\u201d answered Carton, with a careless air; \u201cI wish you would keep to that. As to me--will you never understand that I am incorrigible?\u201d He asked the question with some appearance of scorn. \u201cYou have no business to be incorrigible,\u201d was his friend's answer, delivered in no very soothing tone. \u201cI have no business to be, at all, that I know of,\u201d said Sydney Carton. \u201cWho is the lady?\u201d \u201cNow, don't let my announcement of the name make you uncomfortable, Sydney,\u201d said Mr. Stryver, preparing him with ostentatious friendliness for the disclosure he was about to make, \u201cbecause I know you don't mean half you say; and if you meant it all, it would be of no importance. I make this little preface, because you once mentioned the young lady to me in slighting terms.\u201d \u201cI did?\u201d \u201cCertainly; and in these chambers.\u201d Sydney Carton looked at his punch and looked at his complacent friend; drank his punch and looked at his complacent friend. \u201cYou made mention of the young lady as a golden-haired doll. The young lady is Miss Manette. If you had been a fellow of any sensitiveness or delicacy of feeling in that kind of way, Sydney, I might have been a little resentful of your employing such a designation; but you are not. You want that sense altogether; therefore I am no more annoyed when I think of the expression, than I should be annoyed by a man's opinion of a picture of mine, who had no eye for pictures: or of a piece of music of mine, who had no ear for music.\u201d Sydney Carton drank the punch at a great rate; drank it by bumpers, looking at his friend.", " \u201cDon't despond,\u201d said Carton, very gently; \u201cdon't grieve. I encouraged Doctor Manette in this idea, because I felt that it might one day be consolatory to her. Otherwise, she might think 'his life was wantonly thrown away or wasted,' and that might trouble her.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, yes,\u201d returned Mr. Lorry, drying his eyes, \u201cyou are right. But he will perish; there is no real hope.\u201d \u201cYes. He will perish: there is no real hope,\u201d echoed Carton. And walked with a settled step, down-stairs. XII. Darkness Sydney Carton paused in the street, not quite decided where to go. \u201cAt Tellson's banking-house at nine,\u201d he said, with a musing face. \u201cShall I do well, in the mean time, to show myself? I think so. It is best that these people should know there is such a man as I here; it is a sound precaution, and may be a necessary preparation. But care, care, care! Let me think it out!\u201d Checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object, he took a turn or two in the already darkening street, and traced the thought in his mind to its possible consequences. His first impression was confirmed. \u201cIt is best,\u201d he said, finally resolved, \u201cthat these people should know there is such a man as I here.\u201d And he turned his face towards Saint Antoine. Defarge had described himself, that day, as the keeper of a wine-shop in the Saint Antoine suburb. It was not difficult for one who knew the city well, to find his house without asking any question."], "What did Monsieur Defarge do before he was a wine shop owner and revolutionary?": [" Knitting There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. As early as six o'clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping through its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending over measures of wine. Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that he sold at this time. A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy. No vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur Defarge: but, a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay hidden in the dregs of it. This had been the third morning in succession, on which there had been early drinking at the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. It had begun on Monday, and here was Wednesday come. There had been more of early brooding than drinking; for, many men had listened and whispered and slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door, who could not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls. These were to the full as interested in the place, however, as if they could have commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided from seat to seat, and from corner to corner, swallowing talk in lieu of drink, with greedy looks. Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company, the master of the wine-shop was not visible. He was not missed; for, nobody who crossed the threshold looked for him, nobody asked for him, nobody wondered to see only Madame Defarge in her seat, presiding over the distribution of wine, with a bowl of battered small coins before her, as much defaced and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come.", " A suspended interest and a prevalent absence of mind, were perhaps observed by the spies who looked in at the wine-shop, as they looked in at every place, high and low, from the king's palace to the criminal's gaol. Games at cards languished, players at dominoes musingly built towers with them, drinkers drew figures on the tables with spilt drops of wine, Madame Defarge herself picked out the pattern on her sleeve with her toothpick, and saw and heard something inaudible and invisible a long way off. Thus, Saint Antoine in this vinous feature of his, until midday. It was high noontide, when two dusty men passed through his streets and under his swinging lamps: of whom, one was Monsieur Defarge: the other a mender of roads in a blue cap. All adust and athirst, the two entered the wine-shop. Their arrival had lighted a kind of fire in the breast of Saint Antoine, fast spreading as they came along, which stirred and flickered in flames of faces at most doors and windows. Yet, no one had followed them, and no man spoke when they entered the wine-shop, though the eyes of every man there were turned upon them. \u201cGood day, gentlemen!\u201d said Monsieur Defarge. It may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue. It elicited an answering chorus of \u201cGood day!\u201d \u201cIt is bad weather, gentlemen,\u201d said Defarge, shaking his head. Upon which, every man looked at his neighbour, and then all cast down their eyes and sat silent.", " The chamber, furnished bachelor-fashion, that you wished to see, and were inquiring for when I stepped out, is on the fifth floor. The doorway of the staircase gives on the little courtyard close to the left here,\u201d pointing with his hand, \u201cnear to the window of my establishment. But, now that I remember, one of you has already been there, and can show the way. Gentlemen, adieu!\u201d They paid for their wine, and left the place. The eyes of Monsieur Defarge were studying his wife at her knitting when the elderly gentleman advanced from his corner, and begged the favour of a word. \u201cWillingly, sir,\u201d said Monsieur Defarge, and quietly stepped with him to the door. Their conference was very short, but very decided. Almost at the first word, Monsieur Defarge started and became deeply attentive. It had not lasted a minute, when he nodded and went out. The gentleman then beckoned to the young lady, and they, too, went out. Madame Defarge knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows, and saw nothing. Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette, emerging from the wine-shop thus, joined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own company just before. It opened from a stinking little black courtyard, and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses, inhabited by a great number of people. In the gloomy tile-paved entry to the gloomy tile-paved staircase, Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee to the child of his old master, and put her hand to his lips.", " Ah! the poor Gaspard!\u201d With a sigh of great compassion. \u201cMy faith!\u201d returned madame, coolly and lightly, \u201cif people use knives for such purposes, they have to pay for it. He knew beforehand what the price of his luxury was; he has paid the price.\u201d \u201cI believe,\u201d said the spy, dropping his soft voice to a tone that invited confidence, and expressing an injured revolutionary susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face: \u201cI believe there is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood, touching the poor fellow? Between ourselves.\u201d \u201cIs there?\u201d asked madame, vacantly. \u201cIs there not?\u201d \u201c--Here is my husband!\u201d said Madame Defarge. As the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door, the spy saluted him by touching his hat, and saying, with an engaging smile, \u201cGood day, Jacques!\u201d Defarge stopped short, and stared at him. \u201cGood day, Jacques!\u201d the spy repeated; with not quite so much confidence, or quite so easy a smile under the stare. \u201cYou deceive yourself, monsieur,\u201d returned the keeper of the wine-shop. \u201cYou mistake me for another. That is not my name. I am Ernest Defarge.\u201d \u201cIt is all the same,\u201d said the spy, airily, but discomfited too: \u201cgood day!\u201d \u201cGood day!\u201d answered Defarge, drily. \u201cI was saying to madame, with whom I had the pleasure of chatting when you entered, that they tell me there is--and no wonder!--much sympathy and anger in Saint Antoine, touching the unhappy fate of poor Gaspard.\u201d \u201cNo one has told me so,\u201d said Defarge, shaking his head."], "Which characters go through profound transformations?": [" \u201cMonsieur Manette\u201d; Mr. Lorry laid his hand upon Defarge's arm; \u201cdo you remember nothing of this man? Look at him. Look at me. Is there no old banker, no old business, no old servant, no old time, rising in your mind, Monsieur Manette?\u201d As the captive of many years sat looking fixedly, by turns, at Mr. Lorry and at Defarge, some long obliterated marks of an actively intent intelligence in the middle of the forehead, gradually forced themselves through the black mist that had fallen on him. They were overclouded again, they were fainter, they were gone; but they had been there. And so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him, and where she now stood looking at him, with hands which at first had been only raised in frightened compassion, if not even to keep him off and shut out the sight of him, but which were now extending towards him, trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young breast, and love it back to life and hope--so exactly was the expression repeated (though in stronger characters) on her fair young face, that it looked as though it had passed like a moving light, from him to her. Darkness had fallen on him in its place. He looked at the two, less and less attentively, and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground and looked about him in the old way.", " XV. The Footsteps Die Out For Ever Along the Paris streets, the death-carts rumble, hollow and harsh. Six tumbrils carry the day's wine to La Guillotine. All the devouring and insatiate Monsters imagined since imagination could record itself, are fused in the one realisation, Guillotine. And yet there is not in France, with its rich variety of soil and climate, a blade, a leaf, a root, a sprig, a peppercorn, which will grow to maturity under conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror. Crush humanity out of shape once more, under similar hammers, and it will twist itself into the same tortured forms. Sow the same seed of rapacious license and oppression over again, and it will surely yield the same fruit according to its kind. Six tumbrils roll along the streets. Change these back again to what they were, thou powerful enchanter, Time, and they shall be seen to be the carriages of absolute monarchs, the equipages of feudal nobles, the toilettes of flaring Jezebels, the churches that are not my father's house but dens of thieves, the huts of millions of starving peasants! No; the great magician who majestically works out the appointed order of the Creator, never reverses his transformations. \u201cIf thou be changed into this shape by the will of God,\u201d say the seers to the enchanted, in the wise Arabian stories, \u201cthen remain so! But, if thou wear this form through mere passing conjuration, then resume thy former aspect!\u201d Changeless and hopeless, the tumbrils roll along.", " No man's life here is worth purchase. Any one carried home by the people to-day, may be condemned tomorrow. Now, the stake I have resolved to play for, in case of the worst, is a friend in the Conciergerie. And the friend I purpose to myself to win, is Mr. Barsad.\u201d \u201cYou need have good cards, sir,\u201d said the spy. \u201cI'll run them over. I'll see what I hold,--Mr. Lorry, you know what a brute I am; I wish you'd give me a little brandy.\u201d It was put before him, and he drank off a glassful--drank off another glassful--pushed the bottle thoughtfully away. \u201cMr. Barsad,\u201d he went on, in the tone of one who really was looking over a hand at cards: \u201cSheep of the prisons, emissary of Republican committees, now turnkey, now prisoner, always spy and secret informer, so much the more valuable here for being English that an Englishman is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a Frenchman, represents himself to his employers under a false name. That's a very good card. Mr. Barsad, now in the employ of the republican French government, was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic English government, the enemy of France and freedom. That's an excellent card. Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion, that Mr. Barsad, still in the pay of the aristocratic English government, is the spy of Pitt, the treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom, the English traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so difficult to find.", " I decided, that day, to write privately to the Minister, stating the nature of the two cases to which I had been summoned, and the place to which I had gone: in effect, stating all the circumstances. I knew what Court influence was, and what the immunities of the Nobles were, and I expected that the matter would never be heard of; but, I wished to relieve my own mind. I had kept the matter a profound secret, even from my wife; and this, too, I resolved to state in my letter. I had no apprehension whatever of my real danger; but I was conscious that there might be danger for others, if others were compromised by possessing the knowledge that I possessed. \u201cI was much engaged that day, and could not complete my letter that night. I rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it. It was the last day of the year. The letter was lying before me just completed, when I was told that a lady waited, who wished to see me. ***** \u201cI am growing more and more unequal to the task I have set myself. It is so cold, so dark, my senses are so benumbed, and the gloom upon me is so dreadful. \u201cThe lady was young, engaging, and handsome, but not marked for long life. She was in great agitation. She presented herself to me as the wife of the Marquis St. Evremonde. I connected the title by which the boy had addressed the elder brother, with the initial letter embroidered on the scarf, and had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that I had seen that nobleman very lately."], "What helps explain Madame Defarge\u2019s vengefulness and bloodlust?": [" \u201cIs that his child?\u201d said Madame Defarge, stopping in her work for the first time, and pointing her knitting-needle at little Lucie as if it were the finger of Fate. \u201cYes, madame,\u201d answered Mr. Lorry; \u201cthis is our poor prisoner's darling daughter, and only child.\u201d The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed to fall so threatening and dark on the child, that her mother instinctively kneeled on the ground beside her, and held her to her breast. The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to fall, threatening and dark, on both the mother and the child. \u201cIt is enough, my husband,\u201d said Madame Defarge. \u201cI have seen them. We may go.\u201d But, the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it--not visible and presented, but indistinct and withheld--to alarm Lucie into saying, as she laid her appealing hand on Madame Defarge's dress: \u201cYou will be good to my poor husband. You will do him no harm. You will help me to see him if you can?\u201d \u201cYour husband is not my business here,\u201d returned Madame Defarge, looking down at her with perfect composure. \u201cIt is the daughter of your father who is my business here.\u201d \u201cFor my sake, then, be merciful to my husband. For my child's sake! She will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful. We are more afraid of you than of these others.\u201d Madame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her husband. Defarge, who had been uneasily biting his thumb-nail and looking at her, collected his face into a sterner expression.", " She stopped in the act of putting the note in her bosom, and, with her hands yet at her neck, looked terrified at Madame Defarge. Madame Defarge met the lifted eyebrows and forehead with a cold, impassive stare. \u201cMy dear,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, striking in to explain; \u201cthere are frequent risings in the streets; and, although it is not likely they will ever trouble you, Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power to protect at such times, to the end that she may know them--that she may identify them. I believe,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, rather halting in his reassuring words, as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself upon him more and more, \u201cI state the case, Citizen Defarge?\u201d Defarge looked gloomily at his wife, and gave no other answer than a gruff sound of acquiescence. \u201cYou had better, Lucie,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, doing all he could to propitiate, by tone and manner, \u201chave the dear child here, and our good Pross. Our good Pross, Defarge, is an English lady, and knows no French.\u201d The lady in question, whose rooted conviction that she was more than a match for any foreigner, was not to be shaken by distress and, danger, appeared with folded arms, and observed in English to The Vengeance, whom her eyes first encountered, \u201cWell, I am sure, Boldface! I hope _you_ are pretty well!\u201d She also bestowed a British cough on Madame Defarge; but, neither of the two took much heed of her.", " This was a courage that Madame Defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness. \u201cHa, ha!\u201d she laughed, \u201cyou poor wretch! What are you worth! I address myself to that Doctor.\u201d Then she raised her voice and called out, \u201cCitizen Doctor! Wife of Evremonde! Child of Evremonde! Any person but this miserable fool, answer the Citizeness Defarge!\u201d Perhaps the following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in the expression of Miss Pross's face, perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from either suggestion, whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone. Three of the doors she opened swiftly, and looked in. \u201cThose rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing, there are odds and ends upon the ground. There is no one in that room behind you! Let me look.\u201d \u201cNever!\u201d said Miss Pross, who understood the request as perfectly as Madame Defarge understood the answer. \u201cIf they are not in that room, they are gone, and can be pursued and brought back,\u201d said Madame Defarge to herself. \u201cAs long as you don't know whether they are in that room or not, you are uncertain what to do,\u201d said Miss Pross to herself; \u201cand you shall not know that, if I can prevent your knowing it; and know that, or not know that, you shall not leave here while I can hold you.\u201d \u201cI have been in the streets from the first, nothing has stopped me, I will tear you to pieces, but I will have you from that door,\u201d said Madame Defarge.", " Good day, one and all!\u201d \u201cHave the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a mouthful of cool fresh water, madame.\u201d Madame complied with a polite air. \u201cMarvellous cognac this, madame!\u201d It was the first time it had ever been so complimented, and Madame Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better. She said, however, that the cognac was flattered, and took up her knitting. The visitor watched her fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity of observing the place in general. \u201cYou knit with great skill, madame.\u201d \u201cI am accustomed to it.\u201d \u201cA pretty pattern too!\u201d \u201c_You_ think so?\u201d said madame, looking at him with a smile. \u201cDecidedly. May one ask what it is for?\u201d \u201cPastime,\u201d said madame, still looking at him with a smile while her fingers moved nimbly. \u201cNot for use?\u201d \u201cThat depends. I may find a use for it one day. If I do--Well,\u201d said madame, drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of coquetry, \u201cI'll use it!\u201d It was remarkable; but, the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge. Two men had entered separately, and had been about to order drink, when, catching sight of that novelty, they faltered, made a pretence of looking about as if for some friend who was not there, and went away. Nor, of those who had been there when this visitor entered, was there one left. They had all dropped off."], "What characterizes Lucie?": [" Miss Lucie looks ill, Mr. Darnay has had a terrible day, we are worn out.\u201d \u201cSpeak for yourself, Mr. Lorry,\u201d said Stryver; \u201cI have a night's work to do yet. Speak for yourself.\u201d \u201cI speak for myself,\u201d answered Mr. Lorry, \u201cand for Mr. Darnay, and for Miss Lucie, and--Miss Lucie, do you not think I may speak for us all?\u201d He asked her the question pointedly, and with a glance at her father. His face had become frozen, as it were, in a very curious look at Darnay: an intent look, deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust, not even unmixed with fear. With this strange expression on him his thoughts had wandered away. \u201cMy father,\u201d said Lucie, softly laying her hand on his. He slowly shook the shadow off, and turned to her. \u201cShall we go home, my father?\u201d With a long breath, he answered \u201cYes.\u201d The friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the impression--which he himself had originated--that he would not be released that night. The lights were nearly all extinguished in the passages, the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle, and the dismal place was deserted until to-morrow morning's interest of gallows, pillory, whipping-post, and branding-iron, should repeople it. Walking between her father and Mr. Darnay, Lucie Manette passed into the open air. A hackney-coach was called, and the father and daughter departed in it. Mr. Stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back to the robing-room.", " Lucie and her father! Lucie with her arms stretched out to him, and with that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified, that it seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give force and power to it in this one passage of her life. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d cried Mr. Lorry, breathless and confused. \u201cWhat is the matter? Lucie! Manette! What has happened? What has brought you here? What is it?\u201d With the look fixed upon him, in her paleness and wildness, she panted out in his arms, imploringly, \u201cO my dear friend! My husband!\u201d \u201cYour husband, Lucie?\u201d \u201cCharles.\u201d \u201cWhat of Charles?\u201d \u201cHere. \u201cHere, in Paris?\u201d \u201cHas been here some days--three or four--I don't know how many--I can't collect my thoughts. An errand of generosity brought him here unknown to us; he was stopped at the barrier, and sent to prison.\u201d The old man uttered an irrepressible cry. Almost at the same moment, the bell of the great gate rang again, and a loud noise of feet and voices came pouring into the courtyard. \u201cWhat is that noise?\u201d said the Doctor, turning towards the window. \u201cDon't look!\u201d cried Mr. Lorry. \u201cDon't look out! Manette, for your life, don't touch the blind!\u201d The Doctor turned, with his hand upon the fastening of the window, and said, with a cool, bold smile: \u201cMy dear friend, I have a charmed life in this city. I have been a Bastille prisoner. There is no patriot in Paris--in Paris?", " He walked to and fro, with thoughts very busy, until it was time to return to Tellson's and take leave of Mr. Lorry. As soon as he arrived in Paris he would present himself to this old friend, but he must say nothing of his intention now. A carriage with post-horses was ready at the Bank door, and Jerry was booted and equipped. \u201cI have delivered that letter,\u201d said Charles Darnay to Mr. Lorry. \u201cI would not consent to your being charged with any written answer, but perhaps you will take a verbal one?\u201d \u201cThat I will, and readily,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, \u201cif it is not dangerous.\u201d \u201cNot at all. Though it is to a prisoner in the Abbaye.\u201d \u201cWhat is his name?\u201d said Mr. Lorry, with his open pocket-book in his hand. \u201cGabelle.\u201d \u201cGabelle. And what is the message to the unfortunate Gabelle in prison?\u201d \u201cSimply, 'that he has received the letter, and will come. '\u201d \u201cAny time mentioned?\u201d \u201cHe will start upon his journey to-morrow night.\u201d \u201cAny person mentioned?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d He helped Mr. Lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks, and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old Bank, into the misty air of Fleet-street. \u201cMy love to Lucie, and to little Lucie,\u201d said Mr. Lorry at parting, \u201cand take precious care of them till I come back.\u201d Charles Darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled, as the carriage rolled away. That night--it was the fourteenth of August--he sat up late, and wrote two fervent letters; one was to Lucie, explaining the strong obligation he was under to go to Paris, and showing her, at length, the reasons that he had, for feeling confident that he could become involved in no personal danger there; the other was to the Doctor, confiding Lucie and their dear child to his care, and dwelling on the same topics with the strongest assurances.", " In France--who, knowing me to have been a prisoner in the Bastille, would touch me, except to overwhelm me with embraces, or carry me in triumph. My old pain has given me a power that has brought us through the barrier, and gained us news of Charles there, and brought us here. I knew it would be so; I knew I could help Charles out of all danger; I told Lucie so.--What is that noise?\u201d His hand was again upon the window. \u201cDon't look!\u201d cried Mr. Lorry, absolutely desperate. \u201cNo, Lucie, my dear, nor you!\u201d He got his arm round her, and held her. \u201cDon't be so terrified, my love. I solemnly swear to you that I know of no harm having happened to Charles; that I had no suspicion even of his being in this fatal place. What prison is he in?\u201d \u201cLa Force!\u201d \u201cLa Force! Lucie, my child, if ever you were brave and serviceable in your life--and you were always both--you will compose yourself now, to do exactly as I bid you; for more depends upon it than you can think, or I can say. There is no help for you in any action on your part to-night; you cannot possibly stir out. I say this, because what I must bid you to do for Charles's sake, is the hardest thing to do of all. You must instantly be obedient, still, and quiet. You must let me put you in a room at the back here. You must leave your father and me alone for two minutes, and as there are Life and Death in the world you must not delay.\u201d \u201cI will be submissive to you."], "Which character can be interpreted as being redeemed by actions?": [" I have saved him.\u201d VII. A Knock at the Door \u201cI have saved him.\u201d It was not another of the dreams in which he had often come back; he was really here. And yet his wife trembled, and a vague but heavy fear was upon her. All the air round was so thick and dark, the people were so passionately revengeful and fitful, the innocent were so constantly put to death on vague suspicion and black malice, it was so impossible to forget that many as blameless as her husband and as dear to others as he was to her, every day shared the fate from which he had been clutched, that her heart could not be as lightened of its load as she felt it ought to be. The shadows of the wintry afternoon were beginning to fall, and even now the dreadful carts were rolling through the streets. Her mind pursued them, looking for him among the Condemned; and then she clung closer to his real presence and trembled more. Her father, cheering her, showed a compassionate superiority to this woman's weakness, which was wonderful to see. No garret, no shoemaking, no One Hundred and Five, North Tower, now! He had accomplished the task he had set himself, his promise was redeemed, he had saved Charles. Let them all lean upon him. Their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind: not only because that was the safest way of life, involving the least offence to the people, but because they were not rich, and Charles, throughout his imprisonment, had had to pay heavily for his bad food, and for his guard, and towards the living of the poorer prisoners.", " The resemblance between him and Lucie was very strong at such times, and as they sat side by side, she leaning on his shoulder, and he resting his arm on the back of her chair, it was very agreeable to trace the likeness. He had been talking all day, on many subjects, and with unusual vivacity. \u201cPray, Doctor Manette,\u201d said Mr. Darnay, as they sat under the plane-tree--and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand, which happened to be the old buildings of London--\u201chave you seen much of the Tower?\u201d \u201cLucie and I have been there; but only casually. We have seen enough of it, to know that it teems with interest; little more.\u201d \u201c_I_ have been there, as you remember,\u201d said Darnay, with a smile, though reddening a little angrily, \u201cin another character, and not in a character that gives facilities for seeing much of it. They told me a curious thing when I was there.\u201d \u201cWhat was that?\u201d Lucie asked. \u201cIn making some alterations, the workmen came upon an old dungeon, which had been, for many years, built up and forgotten. Every stone of its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by prisoners--dates, names, complaints, and prayers. Upon a corner stone in an angle of the wall, one prisoner, who seemed to have gone to execution, had cut as his last work, three letters. They were done with some very poor instrument, and hurriedly, with an unsteady hand. At first, they were read as D. I. C.; but, on being more carefully examined, the last letter was found to be G. There was no record or legend of any prisoner with those initials, and many fruitless guesses were made what the name could have been.", " It being all spent, he said, rising: \u201cSo far, we have spoken before these two, because it was as well that the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me. Come into the dark room here, and let us have one final word alone.\u201d IX. The Game Made While Sydney Carton and the Sheep of the prisons were in the adjoining dark room, speaking so low that not a sound was heard, Mr. Lorry looked at Jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust. That honest tradesman's manner of receiving the look, did not inspire confidence; he changed the leg on which he rested, as often as if he had fifty of those limbs, and were trying them all; he examined his finger-nails with a very questionable closeness of attention; and whenever Mr. Lorry's eye caught his, he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the hollow of a hand before it, which is seldom, if ever, known to be an infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character. \u201cJerry,\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cCome here.\u201d Mr. Cruncher came forward sideways, with one of his shoulders in advance of him. \u201cWhat have you been, besides a messenger?\u201d After some cogitation, accompanied with an intent look at his patron, Mr. Cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying, \u201cAgicultooral character.\u201d \u201cMy mind misgives me much,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, angrily shaking a forefinger at him, \u201cthat you have used the respectable and great house of Tellson's as a blind, and that you have had an unlawful occupation of an infamous description.", " I know, Doctor Manette--how can I fail to know--that, mingled with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman, there is, in her heart, towards you, all the love and reliance of infancy itself. I know that, as in her childhood she had no parent, so she is now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present years and character, united to the trustfulness and attachment of the early days in which you were lost to her. I know perfectly well that if you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life, you could hardly be invested, in her sight, with a more sacred character than that in which you are always with her. I know that when she is clinging to you, the hands of baby, girl, and woman, all in one, are round your neck. I know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her own age, sees and loves you at my age, loves her mother broken-hearted, loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration. I have known this, night and day, since I have known you in your home.\u201d Her father sat silent, with his face bent down. His breathing was a little quickened; but he repressed all other signs of agitation. \u201cDear Doctor Manette, always knowing this, always seeing her and you with this hallowed light about you, I have forborne, and forborne, as long as it was in the nature of man to do it. I have felt, and do even now feel, that to bring my love--even mine--between you, is to touch your history with something not quite so good as itself."], "Which characters have been singled out by critics as being too flat?": [" \u201cPardon, Monsieur the Marquis!\u201d said a ragged and submissive man, \u201cit is a child.\u201d \u201cWhy does he make that abominable noise? Is it his child?\u201d \u201cExcuse me, Monsieur the Marquis--it is a pity--yes.\u201d The fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it was, into a space some ten or twelve yards square. As the tall man suddenly got up from the ground, and came running at the carriage, Monsieur the Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-hilt. \u201cKilled!\u201d shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both arms at their length above his head, and staring at him. \u201cDead!\u201d The people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis. There was nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness and eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger. Neither did the people say anything; after the first cry, they had been silent, and they remained so. The voice of the submissive man who had spoken, was flat and tame in its extreme submission. Monsieur the Marquis ran his eyes over them all, as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes. He took out his purse. \u201cIt is extraordinary to me,\u201d said he, \u201cthat you people cannot take care of yourselves and your children. One or the other of you is for ever in the way. How do I know what injury you have done my horses. See! Give him that.\u201d He threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up, and all the heads craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell.", " \u201cMonsieur Manette\u201d; Mr. Lorry laid his hand upon Defarge's arm; \u201cdo you remember nothing of this man? Look at him. Look at me. Is there no old banker, no old business, no old servant, no old time, rising in your mind, Monsieur Manette?\u201d As the captive of many years sat looking fixedly, by turns, at Mr. Lorry and at Defarge, some long obliterated marks of an actively intent intelligence in the middle of the forehead, gradually forced themselves through the black mist that had fallen on him. They were overclouded again, they were fainter, they were gone; but they had been there. And so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him, and where she now stood looking at him, with hands which at first had been only raised in frightened compassion, if not even to keep him off and shut out the sight of him, but which were now extending towards him, trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young breast, and love it back to life and hope--so exactly was the expression repeated (though in stronger characters) on her fair young face, that it looked as though it had passed like a moving light, from him to her. Darkness had fallen on him in its place. He looked at the two, less and less attentively, and his eyes in gloomy abstraction sought the ground and looked about him in the old way.", " No man's life here is worth purchase. Any one carried home by the people to-day, may be condemned tomorrow. Now, the stake I have resolved to play for, in case of the worst, is a friend in the Conciergerie. And the friend I purpose to myself to win, is Mr. Barsad.\u201d \u201cYou need have good cards, sir,\u201d said the spy. \u201cI'll run them over. I'll see what I hold,--Mr. Lorry, you know what a brute I am; I wish you'd give me a little brandy.\u201d It was put before him, and he drank off a glassful--drank off another glassful--pushed the bottle thoughtfully away. \u201cMr. Barsad,\u201d he went on, in the tone of one who really was looking over a hand at cards: \u201cSheep of the prisons, emissary of Republican committees, now turnkey, now prisoner, always spy and secret informer, so much the more valuable here for being English that an Englishman is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a Frenchman, represents himself to his employers under a false name. That's a very good card. Mr. Barsad, now in the employ of the republican French government, was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic English government, the enemy of France and freedom. That's an excellent card. Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion, that Mr. Barsad, still in the pay of the aristocratic English government, is the spy of Pitt, the treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom, the English traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so difficult to find."], "What does Carton\u2019s sacrifice suggest about France\u2019s fate?": [" The President rang his bell, and with warmth resumed. \u201cIf the Republic should demand of you the sacrifice of your child herself, you would have no duty but to sacrifice her. Listen to what is to follow. In the meanwhile, be silent!\u201d Frantic acclamations were again raised. Doctor Manette sat down, with his eyes looking around, and his lips trembling; his daughter drew closer to him. The craving man on the jury rubbed his hands together, and restored the usual hand to his mouth. Defarge was produced, when the court was quiet enough to admit of his being heard, and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment, and of his having been a mere boy in the Doctor's service, and of the release, and of the state of the prisoner when released and delivered to him. This short examination followed, for the court was quick with its work. \u201cYou did good service at the taking of the Bastille, citizen?\u201d \u201cI believe so.\u201d Here, an excited woman screeched from the crowd: \u201cYou were one of the best patriots there. Why not say so? You were a cannonier that day there, and you were among the first to enter the accursed fortress when it fell. Patriots, I speak the truth!\u201d It was The Vengeance who, amidst the warm commendations of the audience, thus assisted the proceedings. The President rang his bell; but, The Vengeance, warming with encouragement, shrieked, \u201cI defy that bell!\u201d wherein she was likewise much commended.", " It is useless to say it, I know, but it rises out of my soul. For you, and for any dear to you, I would do anything. If my career were of that better kind that there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it, I would embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you. Try to hold me in your mind, at some quiet times, as ardent and sincere in this one thing. The time will come, the time will not be long in coming, when new ties will be formed about you--ties that will bind you yet more tenderly and strongly to the home you so adorn--the dearest ties that will ever grace and gladden you. O Miss Manette, when the little picture of a happy father's face looks up in yours, when you see your own bright beauty springing up anew at your feet, think now and then that there is a man who would give his life, to keep a life you love beside you!\u201d He said, \u201cFarewell!\u201d said a last \u201cGod bless you!\u201d and left her. XIV. The Honest Tradesman To the eyes of Mr. Jeremiah Cruncher, sitting on his stool in Fleet-street with his grisly urchin beside him, a vast number and variety of objects in movement were every day presented. Who could sit upon anything in Fleet-street during the busy hours of the day, and not be dazed and deafened by two immense processions, one ever tending westward with the sun, the other ever tending eastward from the sun, both ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where the sun goes down!", " The prisoner was like a young child in his hands. \u201cCarton! Dear Carton! It is madness. It cannot be accomplished, it never can be done, it has been attempted, and has always failed. I implore you not to add your death to the bitterness of mine.\u201d \u201cDo I ask you, my dear Darnay, to pass the door? When I ask that, refuse. There are pen and ink and paper on this table. Is your hand steady enough to write?\u201d \u201cIt was when you came in.\u201d \u201cSteady it again, and write what I shall dictate. Quick, friend, quick!\u201d Pressing his hand to his bewildered head, Darnay sat down at the table. Carton, with his right hand in his breast, stood close beside him. \u201cWrite exactly as I speak.\u201d \u201cTo whom do I address it?\u201d \u201cTo no one.\u201d Carton still had his hand in his breast. \u201cDo I date it?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d The prisoner looked up, at each question. Carton, standing over him with his hand in his breast, looked down. \u201c'If you remember,'\u201d said Carton, dictating, \u201c'the words that passed between us, long ago, you will readily comprehend this when you see it. You do remember them, I know. It is not in your nature to forget them. '\u201d He was drawing his hand from his breast; the prisoner chancing to look up in his hurried wonder as he wrote, the hand stopped, closing upon something. \u201cHave you written 'forget them'?\u201d Carton asked. \u201cI have. Is that a weapon in your hand?\u201d \u201cNo; I am not armed.\u201d \u201cWhat is it in your hand?\u201d \u201cYou shall know directly.", " Write on; there are but a few words more.\u201d He dictated again. \u201c'I am thankful that the time has come, when I can prove them. That I do so is no subject for regret or grief. '\u201d As he said these words with his eyes fixed on the writer, his hand slowly and softly moved down close to the writer's face. The pen dropped from Darnay's fingers on the table, and he looked about him vacantly. \u201cWhat vapour is that?\u201d he asked. \u201cVapour?\u201d \u201cSomething that crossed me?\u201d \u201cI am conscious of nothing; there can be nothing here. Take up the pen and finish. Hurry, hurry!\u201d As if his memory were impaired, or his faculties disordered, the prisoner made an effort to rally his attention. As he looked at Carton with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing, Carton--his hand again in his breast--looked steadily at him. \u201cHurry, hurry!\u201d The prisoner bent over the paper, once more. \u201c'If it had been otherwise;'\u201d Carton's hand was again watchfully and softly stealing down; \u201c'I never should have used the longer opportunity. If it had been otherwise;'\u201d the hand was at the prisoner's face; \u201c'I should but have had so much the more to answer for. If it had been otherwise--'\u201d Carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into unintelligible signs. Carton's hand moved back to his breast no more. The prisoner sprang up with a reproachful look, but Carton's hand was close and firm at his nostrils, and Carton's left arm caught him round the waist."], "What aspect of the revolution does the novel criticize?": [" When her husband was brought in, she turned a look upon him, so sustaining, so encouraging, so full of admiring love and pitying tenderness, yet so courageous for his sake, that it called the healthy blood into his face, brightened his glance, and animated his heart. If there had been any eyes to notice the influence of her look, on Sydney Carton, it would have been seen to be the same influence exactly. Before that unjust Tribunal, there was little or no order of procedure, ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing. There could have been no such Revolution, if all laws, forms, and ceremonies, had not first been so monstrously abused, that the suicidal vengeance of the Revolution was to scatter them all to the winds. Every eye was turned to the jury. The same determined patriots and good republicans as yesterday and the day before, and to-morrow and the day after. Eager and prominent among them, one man with a craving face, and his fingers perpetually hovering about his lips, whose appearance gave great satisfaction to the spectators. A life-thirsting, cannibal-looking, bloody-minded juryman, the Jacques Three of St. Antoine. The whole jury, as a jury of dogs empannelled to try the deer. Every eye then turned to the five judges and the public prosecutor. No favourable leaning in that quarter to-day. A fell, uncompromising, murderous business-meaning there. Every eye then sought some other eye in the crowd, and gleamed at it approvingly; and heads nodded at one another, before bending forward with a strained attention.", " Upon those, had followed Gabelle's letter: the appeal of an innocent prisoner, in danger of death, to his justice, honour, and good name. His resolution was made. He must go to Paris. Yes. The Loadstone Rock was drawing him, and he must sail on, until he struck. He knew of no rock; he saw hardly any danger. The intention with which he had done what he had done, even although he had left it incomplete, presented it before him in an aspect that would be gratefully acknowledged in France on his presenting himself to assert it. Then, that glorious vision of doing good, which is so often the sanguine mirage of so many good minds, arose before him, and he even saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging Revolution that was running so fearfully wild. As he walked to and fro with his resolution made, he considered that neither Lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone. Lucie should be spared the pain of separation; and her father, always reluctant to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old, should come to the knowledge of the step, as a step taken, and not in the balance of suspense and doubt. How much of the incompleteness of his situation was referable to her father, through the painful anxiety to avoid reviving old associations of France in his mind, he did not discuss with himself. But, that circumstance too, had had its influence in his course.", " My opinion is confirmed, and I reiterate my advice.\u201d \u201cI assure you,\u201d returned Mr. Stryver, in the friendliest way, \u201cthat I am sorry for it on your account, and sorry for it on the poor father's account. I know this must always be a sore subject with the family; let us say no more about it.\u201d \u201cI don't understand you,\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cI dare say not,\u201d rejoined Stryver, nodding his head in a smoothing and final way; \u201cno matter, no matter.\u201d \u201cBut it does matter,\u201d Mr. Lorry urged. \u201cNo it doesn't; I assure you it doesn't. Having supposed that there was sense where there is no sense, and a laudable ambition where there is not a laudable ambition, I am well out of my mistake, and no harm is done. Young women have committed similar follies often before, and have repented them in poverty and obscurity often before. In an unselfish aspect, I am sorry that the thing is dropped, because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view; in a selfish aspect, I am glad that the thing has dropped, because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view--it is hardly necessary to say I could have gained nothing by it. There is no harm at all done. I have not proposed to the young lady, and, between ourselves, I am by no means certain, on reflection, that I ever should have committed myself to that extent. Mr. Lorry, you cannot control the mincing vanities and giddinesses of empty-headed girls; you must not expect to do it, or you will always be disappointed.", " Jerry has been my bodyguard on Sunday nights for a long time past and I am used to him. Nobody will suspect Jerry of being anything but an English bull-dog, or of having any design in his head but to fly at anybody who touches his master.\u201d \u201cI must say again that I heartily admire your gallantry and youthfulness.\u201d \u201cI must say again, nonsense, nonsense! When I have executed this little commission, I shall, perhaps, accept Tellson's proposal to retire and live at my ease. Time enough, then, to think about growing old.\u201d This dialogue had taken place at Mr. Lorry's usual desk, with Monseigneur swarming within a yard or two of it, boastful of what he would do to avenge himself on the rascal-people before long. It was too much the way of Monseigneur under his reverses as a refugee, and it was much too much the way of native British orthodoxy, to talk of this terrible Revolution as if it were the only harvest ever known under the skies that had not been sown--as if nothing had ever been done, or omitted to be done, that had led to it--as if observers of the wretched millions in France, and of the misused and perverted resources that should have made them prosperous, had not seen it inevitably coming, years before, and had not in plain words recorded what they saw. Such vapouring, combined with the extravagant plots of Monseigneur for the restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself, and worn out Heaven and earth as well as itself, was hard to be endured without some remonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth."], "Which one of these is not \u201ca double\u201d in the narrative?": [" \u201c'Is she dead?' asked the Marquis, whom I will still describe as the elder brother, coming booted into the room from his horse. \u201c'Not dead,' said I; 'but like to die.' \u201c'What strength there is in these common bodies!' he said, looking down at her with some curiosity. \u201c'There is prodigious strength,' I answered him, 'in sorrow and despair.' \u201cHe first laughed at my words, and then frowned at them. He moved a chair with his foot near to mine, ordered the woman away, and said in a subdued voice, \u201c'Doctor, finding my brother in this difficulty with these hinds, I recommended that your aid should be invited. Your reputation is high, and, as a young man with your fortune to make, you are probably mindful of your interest. The things that you see here, are things to be seen, and not spoken of.' \u201cI listened to the patient's breathing, and avoided answering. \u201c'Do you honour me with your attention, Doctor?' \u201c'Monsieur,' said I, 'in my profession, the communications of patients are always received in confidence.' I was guarded in my answer, for I was troubled in my mind with what I had heard and seen. \u201cHer breathing was so difficult to trace, that I carefully tried the pulse and the heart. There was life, and no more. Looking round as I resumed my seat, I found both the brothers intent upon me. ***** \u201cI write with so much difficulty, the cold is so severe, I am so fearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total darkness, that I must abridge this narrative.", " It would not detain me, he had a coach in waiting. \u201cIt brought me here, it brought me to my grave. When I was clear of the house, a black muffler was drawn tightly over my mouth from behind, and my arms were pinioned. The two brothers crossed the road from a dark corner, and identified me with a single gesture. The Marquis took from his pocket the letter I had written, showed it me, burnt it in the light of a lantern that was held, and extinguished the ashes with his foot. Not a word was spoken. I was brought here, I was brought to my living grave. \u201cIf it had pleased _God_ to put it in the hard heart of either of the brothers, in all these frightful years, to grant me any tidings of my dearest wife--so much as to let me know by a word whether alive or dead--I might have thought that He had not quite abandoned them. But, now I believe that the mark of the red cross is fatal to them, and that they have no part in His mercies. And them and their descendants, to the last of their race, I, Alexandre Manette, unhappy prisoner, do this last night of the year 1767, in my unbearable agony, denounce to the times when all these things shall be answered for. I denounce them to Heaven and to earth.\u201d A terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done. A sound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but blood. The narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the time, and there was not a head in the nation but must have dropped before it.", " He entered the courtyard and remained there for a few moments alone, looking up at the light in the window of her room. Before he went away, he breathed a blessing towards it, and a Farewell. XIII. Fifty-two In the black prison of the Conciergerie, the doomed of the day awaited their fate. They were in number as the weeks of the year. Fifty-two were to roll that afternoon on the life-tide of the city to the boundless everlasting sea. Before their cells were quit of them, new occupants were appointed; before their blood ran into the blood spilled yesterday, the blood that was to mingle with theirs to-morrow was already set apart. Two score and twelve were told off. From the farmer-general of seventy, whose riches could not buy his life, to the seamstress of twenty, whose poverty and obscurity could not save her. Physical diseases, engendered in the vices and neglects of men, will seize on victims of all degrees; and the frightful moral disorder, born of unspeakable suffering, intolerable oppression, and heartless indifference, smote equally without distinction. Charles Darnay, alone in a cell, had sustained himself with no flattering delusion since he came to it from the Tribunal. In every line of the narrative he had heard, he had heard his condemnation. He had fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him, that he was virtually sentenced by the millions, and that units could avail him nothing.", " The led cows, hastily brought in and tethered to anything that would hold them, were looking stupidly on, or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their trouble, which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter. Some of the people of the chateau, and some of those of the posting-house, and all the taxing authorities, were armed more or less, and were crowded on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way, that was highly fraught with nothing. Already, the mender of roads had penetrated into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends, and was smiting himself in the breast with his blue cap. What did all this portend, and what portended the swift hoisting-up of Monsieur Gabelle behind a servant on horseback, and the conveying away of the said Gabelle (double-laden though the horse was), at a gallop, like a new version of the German ballad of Leonora? It portended that there was one stone face too many, up at the chateau. The Gorgon had surveyed the building again in the night, and had added the one stone face wanting; the stone face for which it had waited through about two hundred years. It lay back on the pillow of Monsieur the Marquis. It was like a fine mask, suddenly startled, made angry, and petrified. Driven home into the heart of the stone figure attached to it, was a knife. Round its hilt was a frill of paper, on which was scrawled: \u201cDrive him fast to his tomb."], "To whom is Carton often compared because of his sacrifice?": [" The President rang his bell, and with warmth resumed. \u201cIf the Republic should demand of you the sacrifice of your child herself, you would have no duty but to sacrifice her. Listen to what is to follow. In the meanwhile, be silent!\u201d Frantic acclamations were again raised. Doctor Manette sat down, with his eyes looking around, and his lips trembling; his daughter drew closer to him. The craving man on the jury rubbed his hands together, and restored the usual hand to his mouth. Defarge was produced, when the court was quiet enough to admit of his being heard, and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment, and of his having been a mere boy in the Doctor's service, and of the release, and of the state of the prisoner when released and delivered to him. This short examination followed, for the court was quick with its work. \u201cYou did good service at the taking of the Bastille, citizen?\u201d \u201cI believe so.\u201d Here, an excited woman screeched from the crowd: \u201cYou were one of the best patriots there. Why not say so? You were a cannonier that day there, and you were among the first to enter the accursed fortress when it fell. Patriots, I speak the truth!\u201d It was The Vengeance who, amidst the warm commendations of the audience, thus assisted the proceedings. The President rang his bell; but, The Vengeance, warming with encouragement, shrieked, \u201cI defy that bell!\u201d wherein she was likewise much commended.", " For a few seconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come to lay down his life for him; but, within a minute or so, he was stretched insensible on the ground. Quickly, but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was, Carton dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside, combed back his hair, and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn. Then, he softly called, \u201cEnter there! Come in!\u201d and the Spy presented himself. \u201cYou see?\u201d said Carton, looking up, as he kneeled on one knee beside the insensible figure, putting the paper in the breast: \u201cis your hazard very great?\u201d \u201cMr. Carton,\u201d the Spy answered, with a timid snap of his fingers, \u201cmy hazard is not _that_, in the thick of business here, if you are true to the whole of your bargain.\u201d \u201cDon't fear me. I will be true to the death.\u201d \u201cYou must be, Mr. Carton, if the tale of fifty-two is to be right. Being made right by you in that dress, I shall have no fear.\u201d \u201cHave no fear! I shall soon be out of the way of harming you, and the rest will soon be far from here, please God! Now, get assistance and take me to the coach.\u201d \u201cYou?\u201d said the Spy nervously. \u201cHim, man, with whom I have exchanged. You go out at the gate by which you brought me in?\u201d \u201cOf course.\u201d \u201cI was weak and faint when you brought me in, and I am fainter now you take me out. The parting interview has overpowered me. Such a thing has happened here, often, and too often.", " It is useless to say it, I know, but it rises out of my soul. For you, and for any dear to you, I would do anything. If my career were of that better kind that there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it, I would embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you. Try to hold me in your mind, at some quiet times, as ardent and sincere in this one thing. The time will come, the time will not be long in coming, when new ties will be formed about you--ties that will bind you yet more tenderly and strongly to the home you so adorn--the dearest ties that will ever grace and gladden you. O Miss Manette, when the little picture of a happy father's face looks up in yours, when you see your own bright beauty springing up anew at your feet, think now and then that there is a man who would give his life, to keep a life you love beside you!\u201d He said, \u201cFarewell!\u201d said a last \u201cGod bless you!\u201d and left her. XIV. The Honest Tradesman To the eyes of Mr. Jeremiah Cruncher, sitting on his stool in Fleet-street with his grisly urchin beside him, a vast number and variety of objects in movement were every day presented. Who could sit upon anything in Fleet-street during the busy hours of the day, and not be dazed and deafened by two immense processions, one ever tending westward with the sun, the other ever tending eastward from the sun, both ever tending to the plains beyond the range of red and purple where the sun goes down!", " The prisoner was like a young child in his hands. \u201cCarton! Dear Carton! It is madness. It cannot be accomplished, it never can be done, it has been attempted, and has always failed. I implore you not to add your death to the bitterness of mine.\u201d \u201cDo I ask you, my dear Darnay, to pass the door? When I ask that, refuse. There are pen and ink and paper on this table. Is your hand steady enough to write?\u201d \u201cIt was when you came in.\u201d \u201cSteady it again, and write what I shall dictate. Quick, friend, quick!\u201d Pressing his hand to his bewildered head, Darnay sat down at the table. Carton, with his right hand in his breast, stood close beside him. \u201cWrite exactly as I speak.\u201d \u201cTo whom do I address it?\u201d \u201cTo no one.\u201d Carton still had his hand in his breast. \u201cDo I date it?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d The prisoner looked up, at each question. Carton, standing over him with his hand in his breast, looked down. \u201c'If you remember,'\u201d said Carton, dictating, \u201c'the words that passed between us, long ago, you will readily comprehend this when you see it. You do remember them, I know. It is not in your nature to forget them. '\u201d He was drawing his hand from his breast; the prisoner chancing to look up in his hurried wonder as he wrote, the hand stopped, closing upon something. \u201cHave you written 'forget them'?\u201d Carton asked. \u201cI have. Is that a weapon in your hand?\u201d \u201cNo; I am not armed.\u201d \u201cWhat is it in your hand?\u201d \u201cYou shall know directly."], "What does the broken wine cask symbolize?": [" \u201cAnd you in brown!\u201d she said, indignantly turning to Mr. Lorry; \u201ccouldn't you tell her what you had to tell her, without frightening her to death? Look at her, with her pretty pale face and her cold hands. Do you call _that_ being a Banker?\u201d Mr. Lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to answer, that he could only look on, at a distance, with much feebler sympathy and humility, while the strong woman, having banished the inn servants under the mysterious penalty of \u201cletting them know\u201d something not mentioned if they stayed there, staring, recovered her charge by a regular series of gradations, and coaxed her to lay her drooping head upon her shoulder. \u201cI hope she will do well now,\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cNo thanks to you in brown, if she does. My darling pretty!\u201d \u201cI hope,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, after another pause of feeble sympathy and humility, \u201cthat you accompany Miss Manette to France?\u201d \u201cA likely thing, too!\u201d replied the strong woman. \u201cIf it was ever intended that I should go across salt water, do you suppose Providence would have cast my lot in an island?\u201d This being another question hard to answer, Mr. Jarvis Lorry withdrew to consider it. V. The Wine-shop A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street. The accident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled out with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just outside the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell.", " All the people within reach had suspended their business, or their idleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine. The rough, irregular stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them, had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own jostling group or crowd, according to its size. Some men kneeled down, made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all run out between their fingers. Others, men and women, dipped in the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with handkerchiefs from women's heads, which were squeezed dry into infants' mouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it ran; others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new directions; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed pieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted fragments with eager relish. There was no drainage to carry off the wine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up along with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street, if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous presence. A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices--voices of men, women, and children--resounded in the street while this wine game lasted.", " Knitting There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. As early as six o'clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping through its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending over measures of wine. Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that he sold at this time. A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy. No vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur Defarge: but, a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay hidden in the dregs of it. This had been the third morning in succession, on which there had been early drinking at the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. It had begun on Monday, and here was Wednesday come. There had been more of early brooding than drinking; for, many men had listened and whispered and slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door, who could not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls. These were to the full as interested in the place, however, as if they could have commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided from seat to seat, and from corner to corner, swallowing talk in lieu of drink, with greedy looks. Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company, the master of the wine-shop was not visible. He was not missed; for, nobody who crossed the threshold looked for him, nobody asked for him, nobody wondered to see only Madame Defarge in her seat, presiding over the distribution of wine, with a bowl of battered small coins before her, as much defaced and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come.", " Now, Heaven defeat the fancy of Lucie Darnay, and keep these feet far out of her life! For, they are headlong, mad, and dangerous; and in the years so long after the breaking of the cask at Defarge's wine-shop door, they are not easily purified when once stained red. XXII. The Sea Still Rises Haggard Saint Antoine had had only one exultant week, in which to soften his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could, with the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations, when Madame Defarge sat at her counter, as usual, presiding over the customers. Madame Defarge wore no rose in her head, for the great brotherhood of Spies had become, even in one short week, extremely chary of trusting themselves to the saint's mercies. The lamps across his streets had a portentously elastic swing with them. Madame Defarge, with her arms folded, sat in the morning light and heat, contemplating the wine-shop and the street. In both, there were several knots of loungers, squalid and miserable, but now with a manifest sense of power enthroned on their distress. The raggedest nightcap, awry on the wretchedest head, had this crooked significance in it: \u201cI know how hard it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to support life in myself; but do you know how easy it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to destroy life in you?\u201d Every lean bare arm, that had been without work before, had this work always ready for it now, that it could strike."], "Where does A Tale of Two Cities take place?": [" For a few seconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come to lay down his life for him; but, within a minute or so, he was stretched insensible on the ground. Quickly, but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was, Carton dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside, combed back his hair, and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn.

I will be true to the death.\u201d \u201cYou must be, Mr. Carton, if the tale of fifty-two is to be right. Being made right by you in that dress, I shall have no fear.\u201d \u201cHave no fear! I shall soon be out of the way of harming you, and the rest will soon be far from here, please God!

The parting interview has overpowered me. Such a thing has happened here, often, and too often.", " Suffer them and forbid them not. They see my Father's face. O Father, blessed words! Thus, the rustling of an Angel's wings got blended with the other echoes, and they were not wholly of earth, but had in them that breath of Heaven. Sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden-tomb were mingled with them also, and both were audible to Lucie, in a hushed murmur--like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore--as the little Lucie, comically studious at the task of the morning, or dressing a doll at her mother's footstool, chattered in the tongues of the Two Cities that were blended in her life. The Echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of Sydney Carton. Some half-dozen times a year, at most, he claimed his privilege of coming in uninvited, and would sit among them through the evening, as he had once done often. He never came there heated with wine. And one other thing regarding him was whispered in the echoes, which has been whispered by all true echoes for ages and ages. No man ever really loved a woman, lost her, and knew her with a blameless though an unchanged mind, when she was a wife and a mother, but her children had a strange sympathy with him--an instinctive delicacy of pity for him. What fine hidden sensibilities are touched in such a case, no echoes tell; but it is so, and it was so here. Carton was the first stranger to whom little Lucie held out her chubby arms, and he kept his place with her as she grew.", " Alas! Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away, and Madame Defarge was drawing very near indeed. \u201cBy the cathedral door,\u201d said Miss Pross. \u201cWould it be much out of the way, to take me in, near the great cathedral door between the two towers?\u201d \u201cNo, miss,\u201d answered Mr. Cruncher. \u201cThen, like the best of men,\u201d said Miss Pross, \u201cgo to the posting-house straight, and make that change.\u201d \u201cI am doubtful,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, hesitating and shaking his head, \u201cabout leaving of you, you see. We don't know what may happen.\u201d \u201cHeaven knows we don't,\u201d returned Miss Pross, \u201cbut have no fear for me. Take me in at the cathedral, at Three o'Clock, or as near it as you can, and I am sure it will be better than our going from here. I feel certain of it. There! Bless you, Mr. Cruncher! Think-not of me, but of the lives that may depend on both of us!\u201d This exordium, and Miss Pross's two hands in quite agonised entreaty clasping his, decided Mr. Cruncher. With an encouraging nod or two, he immediately went out to alter the arrangements, and left her by herself to follow as she had proposed. The having originated a precaution which was already in course of execution, was a great relief to Miss Pross. The necessity of composing her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the streets, was another relief. She looked at her watch, and it was twenty minutes past two. She had no time to lose, but must get ready at once.", " But no matter; don't stay to look; put it up carefully with mine and your own. Now, observe! I never doubted until within this hour or two, that he had, or could have such a paper. It is good, until recalled. But it may be soon recalled, and, I have reason to think, will be.\u201d \u201cThey are not in danger?\u201d \u201cThey are in great danger. They are in danger of denunciation by Madame Defarge. I know it from her own lips. I have overheard words of that woman's, to-night, which have presented their danger to me in strong colours. I have lost no time, and since then, I have seen the spy. He confirms me. He knows that a wood-sawyer, living by the prison wall, is under the control of the Defarges, and has been rehearsed by Madame Defarge as to his having seen Her\u201d--he never mentioned Lucie's name--\u201cmaking signs and signals to prisoners. It is easy to foresee that the pretence will be the common one, a prison plot, and that it will involve her life--and perhaps her child's--and perhaps her father's--for both have been seen with her at that place. Don't look so horrified. You will save them all.\u201d \u201cHeaven grant I may, Carton! But how?\u201d \u201cI am going to tell you how. It will depend on you, and it could depend on no better man. This new denunciation will certainly not take place until after to-morrow; probably not until two or three days afterwards; more probably a week afterwards. You know it is a capital crime, to mourn for, or sympathise with, a victim of the Guillotine."], "What is Mr. Lorry\u2019s occupation?": [" It being all spent, he said, rising: \u201cSo far, we have spoken before these two, because it was as well that the merits of the cards should not rest solely between you and me. Come into the dark room here, and let us have one final word alone.\u201d IX. The Game Made While Sydney Carton and the Sheep of the prisons were in the adjoining dark room, speaking so low that not a sound was heard, Mr. Lorry looked at Jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust. That honest tradesman's manner of receiving the look, did not inspire confidence; he changed the leg on which he rested, as often as if he had fifty of those limbs, and were trying them all; he examined his finger-nails with a very questionable closeness of attention; and whenever Mr. Lorry's eye caught his, he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the hollow of a hand before it, which is seldom, if ever, known to be an infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character. \u201cJerry,\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cCome here.\u201d Mr. Cruncher came forward sideways, with one of his shoulders in advance of him. \u201cWhat have you been, besides a messenger?\u201d After some cogitation, accompanied with an intent look at his patron, Mr. Cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying, \u201cAgicultooral character.\u201d \u201cMy mind misgives me much,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, angrily shaking a forefinger at him, \u201cthat you have used the respectable and great house of Tellson's as a blind, and that you have had an unlawful occupation of an infamous description.", " Another person, who had not joined the group, or interchanged a word with any one of them, but who had been leaning against the wall where its shadow was darkest, had silently strolled out after the rest, and had looked on until the coach drove away. He now stepped up to where Mr. Lorry and Mr. Darnay stood upon the pavement. \u201cSo, Mr. Lorry! Men of business may speak to Mr. Darnay now?\u201d Nobody had made any acknowledgment of Mr. Carton's part in the day's proceedings; nobody had known of it. He was unrobed, and was none the better for it in appearance. \u201cIf you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind, when the business mind is divided between good-natured impulse and business appearances, you would be amused, Mr. Darnay.\u201d Mr. Lorry reddened, and said, warmly, \u201cYou have mentioned that before, sir. We men of business, who serve a House, are not our own masters. We have to think of the House more than ourselves.\u201d \u201c_I_ know, _I_ know,\u201d rejoined Mr. Carton, carelessly. \u201cDon't be nettled, Mr. Lorry. You are as good as another, I have no doubt: better, I dare say.\u201d \u201cAnd indeed, sir,\u201d pursued Mr. Lorry, not minding him, \u201cI really don't know what you have to do with the matter. If you'll excuse me, as very much your elder, for saying so, I really don't know that it is your business.\u201d \u201cBusiness! Bless you, _I_ have no business,\u201d said Mr. Carton. \u201cIt is a pity you have not, sir.\u201d \u201cI think so, too.\u201d \u201cIf you had,\u201d pursued Mr. Lorry, \u201cperhaps you would attend to it.\u201d \u201cLord love you, no!--I shouldn't,\u201d said Mr. Carton.", " \u201cOh dear you, sir? What may your meaning be, Mr. Lorry?\u201d \u201cMy meaning,\u201d answered the man of business, \u201cis, of course, friendly and appreciative, and that it does you the greatest credit, and--in short, my meaning is everything you could desire. But--really, you know, Mr. Stryver--\u201d Mr. Lorry paused, and shook his head at him in the oddest manner, as if he were compelled against his will to add, internally, \u201cyou know there really is so much too much of you!\u201d \u201cWell!\u201d said Stryver, slapping the desk with his contentious hand, opening his eyes wider, and taking a long breath, \u201cif I understand you, Mr. Lorry, I'll be hanged!\u201d Mr. Lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that end, and bit the feather of a pen. \u201cD--n it all, sir!\u201d said Stryver, staring at him, \u201cam I not eligible?\u201d \u201cOh dear yes! Yes. Oh yes, you're eligible!\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cIf you say eligible, you are eligible.\u201d \u201cAm I not prosperous?\u201d asked Stryver. \u201cOh! if you come to prosperous, you are prosperous,\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cAnd advancing?\u201d \u201cIf you come to advancing you know,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, delighted to be able to make another admission, \u201cnobody can doubt that.\u201d \u201cThen what on earth is your meaning, Mr. Lorry?\u201d demanded Stryver, perceptibly crestfallen. \u201cWell! I--Were you going there now?\u201d asked Mr. Lorry. \u201cStraight!\u201d said Stryver, with a plump of his fist on the desk. \u201cThen I think I wouldn't, if I was you.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d said Stryver.", " He was so much too big for Tellson's, that old clerks in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance, as though he squeezed them against the wall. The House itself, magnificently reading the paper quite in the far-off perspective, lowered displeased, as if the Stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat. The discreet Mr. Lorry said, in a sample tone of the voice he would recommend under the circumstances, \u201cHow do you do, Mr. Stryver? How do you do, sir?\u201d and shook hands. There was a peculiarity in his manner of shaking hands, always to be seen in any clerk at Tellson's who shook hands with a customer when the House pervaded the air. He shook in a self-abnegating way, as one who shook for Tellson and Co. \u201cCan I do anything for you, Mr. Stryver?\u201d asked Mr. Lorry, in his business character. \u201cWhy, no, thank you; this is a private visit to yourself, Mr. Lorry; I have come for a private word.\u201d \u201cOh indeed!\u201d said Mr. Lorry, bending down his ear, while his eye strayed to the House afar off. \u201cI am going,\u201d said Mr. Stryver, leaning his arms confidentially on the desk: whereupon, although it was a large double one, there appeared to be not half desk enough for him: \u201cI am going to make an offer of myself in marriage to your agreeable little friend, Miss Manette, Mr. Lorry.\u201d \u201cOh dear me!\u201d cried Mr. Lorry, rubbing his chin, and looking at his visitor dubiously. \u201cOh dear me, sir?\u201d repeated Stryver, drawing back."], "Where does Lucy Manette think her father has been?": [" He had already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name he had relinquished, was the one condition--fully intelligible now--that her father had attached to their betrothal, and was the one promise he had still exacted on the morning of their marriage. He entreated her, for her father's sake, never to seek to know whether her father had become oblivious of the existence of the paper, or had had it recalled to him (for the moment, or for good), by the story of the Tower, on that old Sunday under the dear old plane-tree in the garden. If he had preserved any definite remembrance of it, there could be no doubt that he had supposed it destroyed with the Bastille, when he had found no mention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had discovered there, and which had been described to all the world. He besought her--though he added that he knew it was needless--to console her father, by impressing him through every tender means she could think of, with the truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly reproach himself, but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint sakes. Next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and blessing, and her overcoming of her sorrow, to devote herself to their dear child, he adjured her, as they would meet in Heaven, to comfort her father. To her father himself, he wrote in the same strain; but, he told her father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care.", " Charles Darnay, mysteries arise out of close love, as well as out of wide division; in the former case, they are subtle and delicate, and difficult to penetrate. My daughter Lucie is, in this one respect, such a mystery to me; I can make no guess at the state of her heart.\u201d \u201cMay I ask, sir, if you think she is--\u201d As he hesitated, her father supplied the rest. \u201cIs sought by any other suitor?\u201d \u201cIt is what I meant to say.\u201d Her father considered a little before he answered: \u201cYou have seen Mr. Carton here, yourself. Mr. Stryver is here too, occasionally. If it be at all, it can only be by one of these.\u201d \u201cOr both,\u201d said Darnay. \u201cI had not thought of both; I should not think either, likely. You want a promise from me. Tell me what it is.\u201d \u201cIt is, that if Miss Manette should bring to you at any time, on her own part, such a confidence as I have ventured to lay before you, you will bear testimony to what I have said, and to your belief in it. I hope you may be able to think so well of me, as to urge no influence against me. I say nothing more of my stake in this; this is what I ask. The condition on which I ask it, and which you have an undoubted right to require, I will observe immediately.\u201d \u201cI give the promise,\u201d said the Doctor, \u201cwithout any condition. I believe your object to be, purely and truthfully, as you have stated it. I believe your intention is to perpetuate, and not to weaken, the ties between me and my other and far dearer self.", " Miss Lucie looks ill, Mr. Darnay has had a terrible day, we are worn out.\u201d \u201cSpeak for yourself, Mr. Lorry,\u201d said Stryver; \u201cI have a night's work to do yet. Speak for yourself.\u201d \u201cI speak for myself,\u201d answered Mr. Lorry, \u201cand for Mr. Darnay, and for Miss Lucie, and--Miss Lucie, do you not think I may speak for us all?\u201d He asked her the question pointedly, and with a glance at her father. His face had become frozen, as it were, in a very curious look at Darnay: an intent look, deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust, not even unmixed with fear. With this strange expression on him his thoughts had wandered away. \u201cMy father,\u201d said Lucie, softly laying her hand on his. He slowly shook the shadow off, and turned to her. \u201cShall we go home, my father?\u201d With a long breath, he answered \u201cYes.\u201d The friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the impression--which he himself had originated--that he would not be released that night. The lights were nearly all extinguished in the passages, the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle, and the dismal place was deserted until to-morrow morning's interest of gallows, pillory, whipping-post, and branding-iron, should repeople it. Walking between her father and Mr. Darnay, Lucie Manette passed into the open air. A hackney-coach was called, and the father and daughter departed in it. Mr. Stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back to the robing-room.", " The spy had kept his eyes open, but had been able to detect no sign. They had lounged away in a poverty-stricken, purposeless, accidental manner, quite natural and unimpeachable. \u201c_John_,\u201d thought madame, checking off her work as her fingers knitted, and her eyes looked at the stranger. \u201cStay long enough, and I shall knit 'BARSAD' before you go.\u201d \u201cYou have a husband, madame?\u201d \u201cI have.\u201d \u201cChildren?\u201d \u201cNo children.\u201d \u201cBusiness seems bad?\u201d \u201cBusiness is very bad; the people are so poor.\u201d \u201cAh, the unfortunate, miserable people! So oppressed, too--as you say.\u201d \u201cAs _you_ say,\u201d madame retorted, correcting him, and deftly knitting an extra something into his name that boded him no good. \u201cPardon me; certainly it was I who said so, but you naturally think so. Of course.\u201d \u201c_I_ think?\u201d returned madame, in a high voice. \u201cI and my husband have enough to do to keep this wine-shop open, without thinking. All we think, here, is how to live. That is the subject _we_ think of, and it gives us, from morning to night, enough to think about, without embarrassing our heads concerning others. _I_ think for others? No, no.\u201d The spy, who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make, did not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face; but, stood with an air of gossiping gallantry, leaning his elbow on Madame Defarge's little counter, and occasionally sipping his cognac. \u201cA bad business this, madame, of Gaspard's execution."], "How long did Doctor Manette spend in prison?": [" \u201cO me, O me! All is lost!\u201d cried she, wringing her hands. \u201cWhat is to be told to Ladybird? He doesn't know me, and is making shoes!\u201d Mr. Lorry said what he could to calm her, and went himself into the Doctor's room. The bench was turned towards the light, as it had been when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before, and his head was bent down, and he was very busy. \u201cDoctor Manette. My dear friend, Doctor Manette!\u201d The Doctor looked at him for a moment--half inquiringly, half as if he were angry at being spoken to--and bent over his work again. He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at the throat, as it used to be when he did that work; and even the old haggard, faded surface of face had come back to him. He worked hard--impatiently--as if in some sense of having been interrupted. Mr. Lorry glanced at the work in his hand, and observed that it was a shoe of the old size and shape. He took up another that was lying by him, and asked what it was. \u201cA young lady's walking shoe,\u201d he muttered, without looking up. \u201cIt ought to have been finished long ago. Let it be.\u201d \u201cBut, Doctor Manette. Look at me!\u201d He obeyed, in the old mechanically submissive manner, without pausing in his work. \u201cYou know me, my dear friend? Think again. This is not your proper occupation. Think, dear friend!\u201d Nothing would induce him to speak more. He looked up, for an instant at a time, when he was requested to do so; but, no persuasion would extract a word from him.", " An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out, to the day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and counting, and evidently made him uneasy. In all other respects, however, he was so composedly himself, that Mr. Lorry determined to have the aid he sought. And that aid was his own. Therefore, when the breakfast was done and cleared away, and he and the Doctor were left together, Mr. Lorry said, feelingly: \u201cMy dear Manette, I am anxious to have your opinion, in confidence, on a very curious case in which I am deeply interested; that is to say, it is very curious to me; perhaps, to your better information it may be less so.\u201d Glancing at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work, the Doctor looked troubled, and listened attentively. He had already glanced at his hands more than once. \u201cDoctor Manette,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, touching him affectionately on the arm, \u201cthe case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine. Pray give your mind to it, and advise me well for his sake--and above all, for his daughter's--his daughter's, my dear Manette.\u201d \u201cIf I understand,\u201d said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, \u201csome mental shock--?\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d \u201cBe explicit,\u201d said the Doctor. \u201cSpare no detail.\u201d Mr. Lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded. \u201cMy dear Manette, it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock, of great acuteness and severity to the affections, the feelings, the--the--as you express it--the mind.", " \u201cYes?\u201d said the Doctor, with evident constraint. \u201cBring your chair here, and speak on.\u201d He complied as to the chair, but appeared to find the speaking on less easy. \u201cI have had the happiness, Doctor Manette, of being so intimate here,\u201d so he at length began, \u201cfor some year and a half, that I hope the topic on which I am about to touch may not--\u201d He was stayed by the Doctor's putting out his hand to stop him. When he had kept it so a little while, he said, drawing it back: \u201cIs Lucie the topic?\u201d \u201cShe is.\u201d \u201cIt is hard for me to speak of her at any time. It is very hard for me to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours, Charles Darnay.\u201d \u201cIt is a tone of fervent admiration, true homage, and deep love, Doctor Manette!\u201d he said deferentially. There was another blank silence before her father rejoined: \u201cI believe it. I do you justice; I believe it.\u201d His constraint was so manifest, and it was so manifest, too, that it originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject, that Charles Darnay hesitated. \u201cShall I go on, sir?\u201d Another blank. \u201cYes, go on.\u201d \u201cYou anticipate what I would say, though you cannot know how earnestly I say it, how earnestly I feel it, without knowing my secret heart, and the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been laden. Dear Doctor Manette, I love your daughter fondly, dearly, disinterestedly, devotedly. If ever there were love in the world, I love her.", " Among the lookers-on there was the same expression in all quarters of the court; insomuch, that a great majority of the foreheads there, might have been mirrors reflecting the witness, when the Judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous heresy about George Washington.

Who was called accordingly. \u201cDoctor Manette, look upon the prisoner. Have you ever seen him before?\u201d \u201cOnce. When he called at my lodgings in London.

He had been more than five hours gone: where could he be? Mr. Lorry waited until ten; but, Doctor Manette not returning, and he being unwilling to leave Lucie any longer, it was arranged that he should go back to her, and come to the banking-house again at midnight. In the meanwhile, Carton would wait alone by the fire for the Doctor. He waited and waited, and the clock struck twelve; but Doctor Manette did not come back. Mr. Lorry returned, and found no tidings of him, and brought none. Where could he be? They were discussing this question, and were almost building up some weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence, when they heard him on the stairs. The instant he entered the room, it was plain that all was lost. Whether he had really been to any one, or whether he had been all that time traversing the streets, was never known. As he stood staring at them, they asked him no question, for his face told them everything. \u201cI cannot find it,\u201d said he, \u201cand I must have it. Where is it?\u201d His head and throat were bare, and, as he spoke with a helpless look straying all around, he took his coat off, and let it drop on the floor. \u201cWhere is my bench? I have been looking everywhere for my bench, and I can't find it. What have they done with my work? Time presses: I must finish those shoes.\u201d They looked at one another, and their hearts died within them.", " Miss Pross and he divided the night into two watches, and observed him at intervals from the adjoining room. He paced up and down for a long time before he lay down; but, when he did finally lay himself down, he fell asleep. In the morning, he was up betimes, and went straight to his bench and to work. On this second day, Mr. Lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name, and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them. He returned no reply, but it was evident that he heard what was said, and that he thought about it, however confusedly. This encouraged Mr. Lorry to have Miss Pross in with her work, several times during the day; at those times, they quietly spoke of Lucie, and of her father then present, precisely in the usual manner, and as if there were nothing amiss. This was done without any demonstrative accompaniment, not long enough, or often enough to harass him; and it lightened Mr. Lorry's friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener, and that he appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding him. When it fell dark again, Mr. Lorry asked him as before: \u201cDear Doctor, will you go out?\u201d As before, he repeated, \u201cOut?\u201d \u201cYes; for a walk with me. Why not?\u201d This time, Mr. Lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer from him, and, after remaining absent for an hour, returned. In the meanwhile, the Doctor had removed to the seat in the window, and had sat there looking down at the plane-tree; but, on Mr. Lorry's return, he slipped away to his bench."], "What happens when a cask of wine spills along the street in Paris?": [" All the people within reach had suspended their business, or their idleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine. The rough, irregular stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them, had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own jostling group or crowd, according to its size. Some men kneeled down, made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all run out between their fingers. Others, men and women, dipped in the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with handkerchiefs from women's heads, which were squeezed dry into infants' mouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it ran; others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new directions; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed pieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted fragments with eager relish. There was no drainage to carry off the wine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up along with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street, if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous presence. A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices--voices of men, women, and children--resounded in the street while this wine game lasted.", " \u201cAnd you in brown!\u201d she said, indignantly turning to Mr. Lorry; \u201ccouldn't you tell her what you had to tell her, without frightening her to death? Look at her, with her pretty pale face and her cold hands. Do you call _that_ being a Banker?\u201d Mr. Lorry was so exceedingly disconcerted by a question so hard to answer, that he could only look on, at a distance, with much feebler sympathy and humility, while the strong woman, having banished the inn servants under the mysterious penalty of \u201cletting them know\u201d something not mentioned if they stayed there, staring, recovered her charge by a regular series of gradations, and coaxed her to lay her drooping head upon her shoulder. \u201cI hope she will do well now,\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cNo thanks to you in brown, if she does. My darling pretty!\u201d \u201cI hope,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, after another pause of feeble sympathy and humility, \u201cthat you accompany Miss Manette to France?\u201d \u201cA likely thing, too!\u201d replied the strong woman. \u201cIf it was ever intended that I should go across salt water, do you suppose Providence would have cast my lot in an island?\u201d This being another question hard to answer, Mr. Jarvis Lorry withdrew to consider it. V. The Wine-shop A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street. The accident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled out with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just outside the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell.", " Knitting There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. As early as six o'clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping through its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending over measures of wine. Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that he sold at this time. A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy. No vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur Defarge: but, a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay hidden in the dregs of it. This had been the third morning in succession, on which there had been early drinking at the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. It had begun on Monday, and here was Wednesday come. There had been more of early brooding than drinking; for, many men had listened and whispered and slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door, who could not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls. These were to the full as interested in the place, however, as if they could have commanded whole barrels of wine; and they glided from seat to seat, and from corner to corner, swallowing talk in lieu of drink, with greedy looks. Notwithstanding an unusual flow of company, the master of the wine-shop was not visible. He was not missed; for, nobody who crossed the threshold looked for him, nobody asked for him, nobody wondered to see only Madame Defarge in her seat, presiding over the distribution of wine, with a bowl of battered small coins before her, as much defaced and beaten out of their original impress as the small coinage of humanity from whose ragged pockets they had come.", " Now, Heaven defeat the fancy of Lucie Darnay, and keep these feet far out of her life! For, they are headlong, mad, and dangerous; and in the years so long after the breaking of the cask at Defarge's wine-shop door, they are not easily purified when once stained red. XXII. The Sea Still Rises Haggard Saint Antoine had had only one exultant week, in which to soften his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could, with the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations, when Madame Defarge sat at her counter, as usual, presiding over the customers. Madame Defarge wore no rose in her head, for the great brotherhood of Spies had become, even in one short week, extremely chary of trusting themselves to the saint's mercies. The lamps across his streets had a portentously elastic swing with them. Madame Defarge, with her arms folded, sat in the morning light and heat, contemplating the wine-shop and the street. In both, there were several knots of loungers, squalid and miserable, but now with a manifest sense of power enthroned on their distress. The raggedest nightcap, awry on the wretchedest head, had this crooked significance in it: \u201cI know how hard it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to support life in myself; but do you know how easy it has grown for me, the wearer of this, to destroy life in you?\u201d Every lean bare arm, that had been without work before, had this work always ready for it now, that it could strike."], "What is Jacques a codename for?": [" No white-haired man was there now; but, the three men were there who had gone out of the wine-shop singly. And between them and the white-haired man afar off, was the one small link, that they had once looked in at him through the chinks in the wall. Defarge closed the door carefully, and spoke in a subdued voice: \u201cJacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three! This is the witness encountered by appointment, by me, Jacques Four. He will tell you all. Speak, Jacques Five!\u201d The mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his swarthy forehead with it, and said, \u201cWhere shall I commence, monsieur?\u201d \u201cCommence,\u201d was Monsieur Defarge's not unreasonable reply, \u201cat the commencement.\u201d \u201cI saw him then, messieurs,\u201d began the mender of roads, \u201ca year ago this running summer, underneath the carriage of the Marquis, hanging by the chain. Behold the manner of it. I leaving my work on the road, the sun going to bed, the carriage of the Marquis slowly ascending the hill, he hanging by the chain--like this.\u201d Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in which he ought to have been perfect by that time, seeing that it had been the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village during a whole year. Jacques One struck in, and asked if he had ever seen the man before? \u201cNever,\u201d answered the mender of roads, recovering his perpendicular. Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then?", " \u201cIt is not often,\u201d said the second of the three, addressing Monsieur Defarge, \u201cthat many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine, or of anything but black bread and death. Is it not so, Jacques?\u201d \u201cIt is so, Jacques,\u201d Monsieur Defarge returned. At this second interchange of the Christian name, Madame Defarge, still using her toothpick with profound composure, coughed another grain of cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line. The last of the three now said his say, as he put down his empty drinking vessel and smacked his lips. \u201cAh! So much the worse! A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle always have in their mouths, and hard lives they live, Jacques. Am I right, Jacques?\u201d \u201cYou are right, Jacques,\u201d was the response of Monsieur Defarge. This third interchange of the Christian name was completed at the moment when Madame Defarge put her toothpick by, kept her eyebrows up, and slightly rustled in her seat. \u201cHold then! True!\u201d muttered her husband. \u201cGentlemen--my wife!\u201d The three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge, with three flourishes. She acknowledged their homage by bending her head, and giving them a quick look. Then she glanced in a casual manner round the wine-shop, took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose of spirit, and became absorbed in it. \u201cGentlemen,\u201d said her husband, who had kept his bright eye observantly upon her, \u201cgood day.", " Work, Jacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques One Thousand, Jacques Two Thousand, Jacques Five-and-Twenty Thousand; in the name of all the Angels or the Devils--which you prefer--work!\u201d Thus Defarge of the wine-shop, still at his gun, which had long grown hot. \u201cTo me, women!\u201d cried madame his wife. \u201cWhat! We can kill as well as the men when the place is taken!\u201d And to her, with a shrill thirsty cry, trooping women variously armed, but all armed alike in hunger and revenge. Cannon, muskets, fire and smoke; but, still the deep ditch, the single drawbridge, the massive stone walls, and the eight great towers. Slight displacements of the raging sea, made by the falling wounded. Flashing weapons, blazing torches, smoking waggonloads of wet straw, hard work at neighbouring barricades in all directions, shrieks, volleys, execrations, bravery without stint, boom smash and rattle, and the furious sounding of the living sea; but, still the deep ditch, and the single drawbridge, and the massive stone walls, and the eight great towers, and still Defarge of the wine-shop at his gun, grown doubly hot by the service of Four fierce hours. A white flag from within the fortress, and a parley--this dimly perceptible through the raging storm, nothing audible in it--suddenly the sea rose immeasurably wider and higher, and swept Defarge of the wine-shop over the lowered drawbridge, past the massive stone outer walls, in among the eight great towers surrendered!", " Eh?\u201d \u201cThere is no better,\u201d the voluble Vengeance protested in her shrill notes, \u201cin France.\u201d \u201cPeace, little Vengeance,\u201d said Madame Defarge, laying her hand with a slight frown on her lieutenant's lips, \u201chear me speak. My husband, fellow-citizen, is a good Republican and a bold man; he has deserved well of the Republic, and possesses its confidence. But my husband has his weaknesses, and he is so weak as to relent towards this Doctor.\u201d \u201cIt is a great pity,\u201d croaked Jacques Three, dubiously shaking his head, with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth; \u201cit is not quite like a good citizen; it is a thing to regret.\u201d \u201cSee you,\u201d said madame, \u201cI care nothing for this Doctor, I. He may wear his head or lose it, for any interest I have in him; it is all one to me. But, the Evremonde people are to be exterminated, and the wife and child must follow the husband and father.\u201d \u201cShe has a fine head for it,\u201d croaked Jacques Three. \u201cI have seen blue eyes and golden hair there, and they looked charming when Samson held them up.\u201d Ogre that he was, he spoke like an epicure. Madame Defarge cast down her eyes, and reflected a little. \u201cThe child also,\u201d observed Jacques Three, with a meditative enjoyment of his words, \u201chas golden hair and blue eyes. And we seldom have a child there. It is a pretty sight!\u201d \u201cIn a word,\u201d said Madame Defarge, coming out of her short abstraction, \u201cI cannot trust my husband in this matter."], "Whom do the three Jacques watch through a hole in the wall in the fifth floor?": [" No white-haired man was there now; but, the three men were there who had gone out of the wine-shop singly. And between them and the white-haired man afar off, was the one small link, that they had once looked in at him through the chinks in the wall. Defarge closed the door carefully, and spoke in a subdued voice: \u201cJacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three! This is the witness encountered by appointment, by me, Jacques Four.

Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then?", " Come, now. Business, business!\u201d They went up slowly and softly. The staircase was short, and they were soon at the top. There, as it had an abrupt turn in it, they came all at once in sight of three men, whose heads were bent down close together at the side of a door, and who were intently looking into the room to which the door belonged, through some chinks or holes in the wall. On hearing footsteps close at hand, these three turned, and rose, and showed themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the wine-shop. \u201cI forgot them in the surprise of your visit,\u201d explained Monsieur Defarge. \u201cLeave us, good boys; we have business here.\u201d The three glided by, and went silently down. There appearing to be no other door on that floor, and the keeper of the wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone, Mr. Lorry asked him in a whisper, with a little anger: \u201cDo you make a show of Monsieur Manette?\u201d \u201cI show him, in the way you have seen, to a chosen few.\u201d \u201cIs that well?\u201d \u201c_I_ think it is well.\u201d \u201cWho are the few? How do you choose them?\u201d \u201cI choose them as real men, of my name--Jacques is my name--to whom the sight is likely to do good. Enough; you are English; that is another thing. Stay there, if you please, a little moment.\u201d With an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he stooped, and looked in through the crevice in the wall. Soon raising his head again, he struck twice or thrice upon the door--evidently with no other object than to make a noise there.", " \u201cIt is not often,\u201d said the second of the three, addressing Monsieur Defarge, \u201cthat many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine, or of anything but black bread and death.

The disposition of everything in the rooms, from the largest object to the least; the arrangement of colours, the elegant variety and contrast obtained by thrift in trifles, by delicate hands, clear eyes, and good sense; were at once so pleasant in themselves, and so expressive of their originator, that, as Mr. Lorry stood looking about him, the very chairs and tables seemed to ask him, with something of that peculiar expression which he knew so well by this time, whether he approved? There were three rooms on a floor, and, the doors by which they communicated being put open that the air might pass freely through them all, Mr. Lorry, smilingly observant of that fanciful resemblance which he detected all around him, walked from one to another. The first was the best room, and in it were Lucie's birds, and flowers, and books, and desk, and work-table, and box of water-colours; the second was the Doctor's consulting-room, used also as the dining-room; the third, changingly speckled by the rustle of the plane-tree in the yard, was the Doctor's bedroom, and there, in a corner, stood the disused shoemaker's bench and tray of tools, much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the dismal house by the wine-shop, in the suburb of Saint Antoine in Paris."], "Whom does Doctor Manette think Lucy is at first?": [" \u201cO me, O me! All is lost!\u201d cried she, wringing her hands. \u201cWhat is to be told to Ladybird? He doesn't know me, and is making shoes!\u201d Mr. Lorry said what he could to calm her, and went himself into the Doctor's room. The bench was turned towards the light, as it had been when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before, and his head was bent down, and he was very busy. \u201cDoctor Manette. My dear friend, Doctor Manette!\u201d The Doctor looked at him for a moment--half inquiringly, half as if he were angry at being spoken to--and bent over his work again. He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at the throat, as it used to be when he did that work; and even the old haggard, faded surface of face had come back to him. He worked hard--impatiently--as if in some sense of having been interrupted. Mr. Lorry glanced at the work in his hand, and observed that it was a shoe of the old size and shape. He took up another that was lying by him, and asked what it was. \u201cA young lady's walking shoe,\u201d he muttered, without looking up. \u201cIt ought to have been finished long ago. Let it be.\u201d \u201cBut, Doctor Manette. Look at me!\u201d He obeyed, in the old mechanically submissive manner, without pausing in his work. \u201cYou know me, my dear friend? Think again. This is not your proper occupation. Think, dear friend!\u201d Nothing would induce him to speak more. He looked up, for an instant at a time, when he was requested to do so; but, no persuasion would extract a word from him.", " An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out, to the day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and counting, and evidently made him uneasy. In all other respects, however, he was so composedly himself, that Mr. Lorry determined to have the aid he sought. And that aid was his own. Therefore, when the breakfast was done and cleared away, and he and the Doctor were left together, Mr. Lorry said, feelingly: \u201cMy dear Manette, I am anxious to have your opinion, in confidence, on a very curious case in which I am deeply interested; that is to say, it is very curious to me; perhaps, to your better information it may be less so.\u201d Glancing at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work, the Doctor looked troubled, and listened attentively. He had already glanced at his hands more than once. \u201cDoctor Manette,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, touching him affectionately on the arm, \u201cthe case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine. Pray give your mind to it, and advise me well for his sake--and above all, for his daughter's--his daughter's, my dear Manette.\u201d \u201cIf I understand,\u201d said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, \u201csome mental shock--?\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d \u201cBe explicit,\u201d said the Doctor. \u201cSpare no detail.\u201d Mr. Lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded. \u201cMy dear Manette, it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock, of great acuteness and severity to the affections, the feelings, the--the--as you express it--the mind.", " Do you know me?\u201d \u201cYes, I know you, Citizen Doctor.\u201d \u201cWe all know you, Citizen Doctor,\u201d said the other three. He looked abstractedly from one to another, and said, in a lower voice, after a pause: \u201cWill you answer his question to me then? How does this happen?\u201d \u201cCitizen Doctor,\u201d said the first, reluctantly, \u201che has been denounced to the Section of Saint Antoine. This citizen,\u201d pointing out the second who had entered, \u201cis from Saint Antoine.\u201d The citizen here indicated nodded his head, and added: \u201cHe is accused by Saint Antoine.\u201d \u201cOf what?\u201d asked the Doctor. \u201cCitizen Doctor,\u201d said the first, with his former reluctance, \u201cask no more. If the Republic demands sacrifices from you, without doubt you as a good patriot will be happy to make them. The Republic goes before all. The People is supreme. Evremonde, we are pressed.\u201d \u201cOne word,\u201d the Doctor entreated. \u201cWill you tell me who denounced him?\u201d \u201cIt is against rule,\u201d answered the first; \u201cbut you can ask Him of Saint Antoine here.\u201d The Doctor turned his eyes upon that man. Who moved uneasily on his feet, rubbed his beard a little, and at length said: \u201cWell! Truly it is against rule. But he is denounced--and gravely--by the Citizen and Citizeness Defarge. And by one other.\u201d \u201cWhat other?\u201d \u201cDo _you_ ask, Citizen Doctor?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cThen,\u201d said he of Saint Antoine, with a strange look, \u201cyou will be answered to-morrow. Now, I am dumb!\u201d VIII. A Hand at Cards Happily unconscious of the new calamity at home, Miss Pross threaded her way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the Pont-Neuf, reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable purchases she had to make.", " \u201cInform the Tribunal of what you did that day within the Bastille, citizen.\u201d \u201cI knew,\u201d said Defarge, looking down at his wife, who stood at the bottom of the steps on which he was raised, looking steadily up at him; \u201cI knew that this prisoner, of whom I speak, had been confined in a cell known as One Hundred and Five, North Tower. I knew it from himself. He knew himself by no other name than One Hundred and Five, North Tower, when he made shoes under my care. As I serve my gun that day, I resolve, when the place shall fall, to examine that cell. It falls. I mount to the cell, with a fellow-citizen who is one of the Jury, directed by a gaoler. I examine it, very closely. In a hole in the chimney, where a stone has been worked out and replaced, I find a written paper. This is that written paper. I have made it my business to examine some specimens of the writing of Doctor Manette. This is the writing of Doctor Manette. I confide this paper, in the writing of Doctor Manette, to the hands of the President.\u201d \u201cLet it be read.\u201d In a dead silence and stillness--the prisoner under trial looking lovingly at his wife, his wife only looking from him to look with solicitude at her father, Doctor Manette keeping his eyes fixed on the reader, Madame Defarge never taking hers from the prisoner, Defarge never taking his from his feasting wife, and all the other eyes there intent upon the Doctor, who saw none of them--the paper was read, as follows."], "What does Lucy want to do now that she\u2019s found her father?": [" He had already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name he had relinquished, was the one condition--fully intelligible now--that her father had attached to their betrothal, and was the one promise he had still exacted on the morning of their marriage. He entreated her, for her father's sake, never to seek to know whether her father had become oblivious of the existence of the paper, or had had it recalled to him (for the moment, or for good), by the story of the Tower, on that old Sunday under the dear old plane-tree in the garden. If he had preserved any definite remembrance of it, there could be no doubt that he had supposed it destroyed with the Bastille, when he had found no mention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had discovered there, and which had been described to all the world. He besought her--though he added that he knew it was needless--to console her father, by impressing him through every tender means she could think of, with the truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly reproach himself, but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint sakes. Next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and blessing, and her overcoming of her sorrow, to devote herself to their dear child, he adjured her, as they would meet in Heaven, to comfort her father. To her father himself, he wrote in the same strain; but, he told her father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care.", " She turned her head as the carriage came up to her, rose quickly, and presented herself at the carriage-door. \u201cIt is you, Monseigneur! Monseigneur, a petition.\u201d With an exclamation of impatience, but with his unchangeable face, Monseigneur looked out. \u201cHow, then! What is it? Always petitions!\u201d \u201cMonseigneur. For the love of the great God! My husband, the forester.\u201d \u201cWhat of your husband, the forester? Always the same with you people. He cannot pay something?\u201d \u201cHe has paid all, Monseigneur. He is dead.\u201d \u201cWell! He is quiet. Can I restore him to you?\u201d \u201cAlas, no, Monseigneur!

Her manner was one of passionate grief; by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together with wild energy, and laid one of them on the carriage-door--tenderly, caressingly, as if it had been a human breast, and could be expected to feel the appealing touch. \u201cMonseigneur, hear me! Monseigneur, hear my petition! My husband died of want; so many die of want; so many more will die of want.\u201d \u201cAgain, well? Can I feed them?\u201d \u201cMonseigneur, the good God knows; but I don't ask it. My petition is, that a morsel of stone or wood, with my husband's name, may be placed over him to show where he lies. Otherwise, the place will be quickly forgotten, it will never be found when I am dead of the same malady, I shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass.", " Do you want to be the death of me?\u201d asked the man, in a furtive, frightened way. \u201cBrother, brother!\u201d cried Miss Pross, bursting into tears. \u201cHave I ever been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question?\u201d \u201cThen hold your meddlesome tongue,\u201d said Solomon, \u201cand come out, if you want to speak to me. Pay for your wine, and come out. Who's this man?\u201d Miss Pross, shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means affectionate brother, said through her tears, \u201cMr. Cruncher.\u201d \u201cLet him come out too,\u201d said Solomon. \u201cDoes he think me a ghost?\u201d Apparently, Mr. Cruncher did, to judge from his looks. He said not a word, however, and Miss Pross, exploring the depths of her reticule through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine. As she did so, Solomon turned to the followers of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, and offered a few words of explanation in the French language, which caused them all to relapse into their former places and pursuits. \u201cNow,\u201d said Solomon, stopping at the dark street corner, \u201cwhat do you want?\u201d \u201cHow dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away from!\u201d cried Miss Pross, \u201cto give me such a greeting, and show me no affection.\u201d \u201cThere. Confound it! There,\u201d said Solomon, making a dab at Miss Pross's lips with his own. \u201cNow are you content?\u201d Miss Pross only shook her head and wept in silence. \u201cIf you expect me to be surprised,\u201d said her brother Solomon, \u201cI am not surprised; I knew you were here; I know of most people who are here.", " \u201cThat's right, that's right. Courage! Business! You have business before you; useful business. Miss Manette, your mother took this course with you. And when she died--I believe broken-hearted--having never slackened her unavailing search for your father, she left you, at two years old, to grow to be blooming, beautiful, and happy, without the dark cloud upon you of living in uncertainty whether your father soon wore his heart out in prison, or wasted there through many lingering years.\u201d As he said the words he looked down, with an admiring pity, on the flowing golden hair; as if he pictured to himself that it might have been already tinged with grey. \u201cYou know that your parents had no great possession, and that what they had was secured to your mother and to you. There has been no new discovery, of money, or of any other property; but--\u201d He felt his wrist held closer, and he stopped. The expression in the forehead, which had so particularly attracted his notice, and which was now immovable, had deepened into one of pain and horror. \u201cBut he has been--been found. He is alive. Greatly changed, it is too probable; almost a wreck, it is possible; though we will hope the best. Still, alive. Your father has been taken to the house of an old servant in Paris, and we are going there: I, to identify him if I can: you, to restore him to life, love, duty, rest, comfort.\u201d A shiver ran through her frame, and from it through his."], "What does Jerry Cruncher do for a living?": [" Young Jerry, walking with the stool under his arm at his father's side along sunny and crowded Fleet-street, was a very different Young Jerry from him of the previous night, running home through darkness and solitude from his grim pursuer. His cunning was fresh with the day, and his qualms were gone with the night--in which particulars it is not improbable that he had compeers in Fleet-street and the City of London, that fine morning. \u201cFather,\u201d said Young Jerry, as they walked along: taking care to keep at arm's length and to have the stool well between them: \u201cwhat's a Resurrection-Man?\u201d Mr. Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered, \u201cHow should I know?\u201d \u201cI thought you knowed everything, father,\u201d said the artless boy. \u201cHem! Well,\u201d returned Mr. Cruncher, going on again, and lifting off his hat to give his spikes free play, \u201che's a tradesman.\u201d \u201cWhat's his goods, father?\u201d asked the brisk Young Jerry. \u201cHis goods,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, after turning it over in his mind, \u201cis a branch of Scientific goods.\u201d \u201cPersons' bodies, ain't it, father?\u201d asked the lively boy. \u201cI believe it is something of that sort,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher. \u201cOh, father, I should so like to be a Resurrection-Man when I'm quite growed up!\u201d Mr. Cruncher was soothed, but shook his head in a dubious and moral way. \u201cIt depends upon how you dewelop your talents. Be careful to dewelop your talents, and never to say no more than you can help to nobody, and there's no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit for.\u201d As Young Jerry, thus encouraged, went on a few yards in advance, to plant the stool in the shadow of the Bar, Mr. Cruncher added to himself: \u201cJerry, you honest tradesman, there's hopes wot that boy will yet be a blessing to you, and a recompense to you for his mother!\u201d XV.", " It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too, for, while it was making the whole night behind him dreadful, he darted out into the roadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful of its coming hopping out of them like a dropsical boy's kite without tail and wings. It hid in doorways too, rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors, and drawing them up to its ears, as if it were laughing. It got into shadows on the road, and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up. All this time it was incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him, so that when the boy got to his own door he had reason for being half dead. And even then it would not leave him, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every stair, scrambled into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on his breast when he fell asleep. From his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his closet was awakened after daybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his father in the family room. Something had gone wrong with him; at least, so Young Jerry inferred, from the circumstance of his holding Mrs. Cruncher by the ears, and knocking the back of her head against the head-board of the bed. \u201cI told you I would,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, \u201cand I did.\u201d \u201cJerry, Jerry, Jerry!\u201d his wife implored. \u201cYou oppose yourself to the profit of the business,\u201d said Jerry, \u201cand me and my partners suffer. You was to honour and obey; why the devil don't you?\u201d \u201cI try to be a good wife, Jerry,\u201d the poor woman protested, with tears.", " \u201cI am saying nothing.\u201d \u201cWell, then; don't meditate nothing. You might as well flop as meditate. You may as well go again me one way as another. Drop it altogether.\u201d \u201cYes, Jerry.\u201d \u201cYes, Jerry,\u201d repeated Mr. Cruncher sitting down to tea. \u201cAh! It _is_ yes, Jerry. That's about it. You may say yes, Jerry.\u201d Mr. Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations, but made use of them, as people not unfrequently do, to express general ironical dissatisfaction. \u201cYou and your yes, Jerry,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, taking a bite out of his bread-and-butter, and seeming to help it down with a large invisible oyster out of his saucer. \u201cAh! I think so. I believe you.\u201d \u201cYou are going out to-night?\u201d asked his decent wife, when he took another bite. \u201cYes, I am.\u201d \u201cMay I go with you, father?\u201d asked his son, briskly. \u201cNo, you mayn't.

Going a fishing.\u201d \u201cYour fishing-rod gets rayther rusty; don't it, father?\u201d \u201cNever you mind.\u201d \u201cShall you bring any fish home, father?\u201d \u201cIf I don't, you'll have short commons, to-morrow,\u201d returned that gentleman, shaking his head; \u201cthat's questions enough for you; I ain't a going out, till you've been long abed.\u201d He devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a most vigilant watch on Mrs. Cruncher, and sullenly holding her in conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions to his disadvantage.", " Are _you_ capable of forming any plan, my dear good Mr. Cruncher?\u201d \u201cRespectin' a future spear o' life, miss,\u201d returned Mr. Cruncher, \u201cI hope so. Respectin' any present use o' this here blessed old head o' mine, I think not. Would you do me the favour, miss, to take notice o' two promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here crisis?\u201d \u201cOh, for gracious sake!\u201d cried Miss Pross, still wildly crying, \u201crecord them at once, and get them out of the way, like an excellent man.\u201d \u201cFirst,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, who was all in a tremble, and who spoke with an ashy and solemn visage, \u201cthem poor things well out o' this, never no more will I do it, never no more!\u201d \u201cI am quite sure, Mr. Cruncher,\u201d returned Miss Pross, \u201cthat you never will do it again, whatever it is, and I beg you not to think it necessary to mention more particularly what it is.\u201d \u201cNo, miss,\u201d returned Jerry, \u201cit shall not be named to you. Second: them poor things well out o' this, and never no more will I interfere with Mrs. Cruncher's flopping, never no more!\u201d \u201cWhatever housekeeping arrangement that may be,\u201d said Miss Pross, striving to dry her eyes and compose herself, \u201cI have no doubt it is best that Mrs. Cruncher should have it entirely under her own superintendence.--O my poor darlings!\u201d \u201cI go so far as to say, miss, moreover,\u201d proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with a most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit--\u201cand let my words be took down and took to Mrs. Cruncher through yourself--that wot my opinions respectin' flopping has undergone a change, and that wot I only hope with all my heart as Mrs. Cruncher may be a flopping at the present time.\u201d \u201cThere, there, there!"], "In what year do these chapters take place?": [" X. The Substance of the Shadow \u201cI, Alexandre Manette, unfortunate physician, native of Beauvais, and afterwards resident in Paris, write this melancholy paper in my doleful cell in the Bastille, during the last month of the year, 1767. I write it at stolen intervals, under every difficulty. I design to secrete it in the wall of the chimney, where I have slowly and laboriously made a place of concealment for it. Some pitying hand may find it there, when I and my sorrows are dust. \u201cThese words are formed by the rusty iron point with which I write with difficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney, mixed with blood, in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity. Hope has quite departed from my breast. I know from terrible warnings I have noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired, but I solemnly declare that I am at this time in the possession of my right mind--that my memory is exact and circumstantial--and that I write the truth as I shall answer for these my last recorded words, whether they be ever read by men or not, at the Eternal Judgment-seat. \u201cOne cloudy moonlight night, in the third week of December (I think the twenty-second of the month) in the year 1757, I was walking on a retired part of the quay by the Seine for the refreshment of the frosty air, at an hour's distance from my place of residence in the Street of the School of Medicine, when a carriage came along behind me, driven very fast.", " Whether it was a son who would never know his father's story; who might even live to weigh the possibility of his father's having disappeared of his own will and act. Whether it was a daughter who would grow to be a woman.\u201d She drew closer to him, and kissed his cheek and his hand. \u201cI have pictured my daughter, to myself, as perfectly forgetful of me--rather, altogether ignorant of me, and unconscious of me. I have cast up the years of her age, year after year. I have seen her married to a man who knew nothing of my fate. I have altogether perished from the remembrance of the living, and in the next generation my place was a blank.\u201d \u201cMy father! Even to hear that you had such thoughts of a daughter who never existed, strikes to my heart as if I had been that child.\u201d \u201cYou, Lucie? It is out of the Consolation and restoration you have brought to me, that these remembrances arise, and pass between us and the moon on this last night.--What did I say just now?\u201d \u201cShe knew nothing of you. She cared nothing for you.\u201d \u201cSo! But on other moonlight nights, when the sadness and the silence have touched me in a different way--have affected me with something as like a sorrowful sense of peace, as any emotion that had pain for its foundations could--I have imagined her as coming to me in my cell, and leading me out into the freedom beyond the fortress. I have seen her image in the moonlight often, as I now see you; except that I never held her in my arms; it stood between the little grated window and the door.", " This had been so very noticeable, so very powerfully and naturally shown, that starers who had had no pity for him were touched by her; and the whisper went about, \u201cWho are they?\u201d Jerry, the messenger, who had made his own observations, in his own manner, and who had been sucking the rust off his fingers in his absorption, stretched his neck to hear who they were. The crowd about him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant, and from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back; at last it got to Jerry: \u201cWitnesses.\u201d \u201cFor which side?\u201d \u201cAgainst.\u201d \u201cAgainst what side?\u201d \u201cThe prisoner's.\u201d The Judge, whose eyes had gone in the general direction, recalled them, leaned back in his seat, and looked steadily at the man whose life was in his hand, as Mr. Attorney-General rose to spin the rope, grind the axe, and hammer the nails into the scaffold.

That this correspondence with the public enemy was not a correspondence of to-day, or of yesterday, or even of last year, or of the year before. That, it was certain the prisoner had, for longer than that, been in the habit of passing and repassing between France and England, on secret business of which he could give no honest account.", " \u201cSay on.\u201d The figure in the chair between them, was all the time monotonously rocking itself to and fro, and moaning. They spoke in such a tone as they would have used if they had been watching by a sick-bed in the night. Carton stooped to pick up the coat, which lay almost entangling his feet. As he did so, a small case in which the Doctor was accustomed to carry the lists of his day's duties, fell lightly on the floor. Carton took it up, and there was a folded paper in it. \u201cWe should look at this!\u201d he said. Mr. Lorry nodded his consent. He opened it, and exclaimed, \u201cThank _God!_\u201d \u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Mr. Lorry, eagerly. \u201cA moment! Let me speak of it in its place. First,\u201d he put his hand in his coat, and took another paper from it, \u201cthat is the certificate which enables me to pass out of this city. Look at it.

Not that she showed she was pleased, but I suppose she was.\u201d The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this disagreeable companion had, of his own free will, assisted him in the strait of the day.

Your unselfishness cannot entirely comprehend how much my mind has gone on this; but, only ask yourself, how could my happiness be perfect, while yours was incomplete?\u201d \u201cIf I had never seen Charles, my father, I should have been quite happy with you.\u201d He smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy without Charles, having seen him; and replied: \u201cMy child, you did see him, and it is Charles. If it had not been Charles, it would have been another. Or, if it had been no other, I should have been the cause, and then the dark part of my life would have cast its shadow beyond myself, and would have fallen on you.\u201d It was the first time, except at the trial, of her ever hearing him refer to the period of his suffering.", " And it was such vapouring all about his ears, like a troublesome confusion of blood in his own head, added to a latent uneasiness in his mind, which had already made Charles Darnay restless, and which still kept him so.

The House approached Mr. Lorry, and laying a soiled and unopened letter before him, asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to whom it was addressed? The House laid the letter down so close to Darnay that he saw the direction--the more quickly because it was his own right name. The address, turned into English, ran: \u201cVery pressing.

It is safe enough for me; nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better worth interfering with. As to its being a disorganised city, if it were not a disorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from our House here to our House there, who knows the city and the business, of old, and is in Tellson's confidence.

With this strange expression on him his thoughts had wandered away. \u201cMy father,\u201d said Lucie, softly laying her hand on his. He slowly shook the shadow off, and turned to her. \u201cShall we go home, my father?\u201d With a long breath, he answered \u201cYes.\u201d The friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the impression--which he himself had originated--that he would not be released that night.

I implore you not to add your death to the bitterness of mine.\u201d \u201cDo I ask you, my dear Darnay, to pass the door? When I ask that, refuse. There are pen and ink and paper on this table. Is your hand steady enough to write?\u201d \u201cIt was when you came in.\u201d \u201cSteady it again, and write what I shall dictate. Quick, friend, quick!\u201d Pressing his hand to his bewildered head, Darnay sat down at the table. Carton, with his right hand in his breast, stood close beside him. \u201cWrite exactly as I speak.\u201d \u201cTo whom do I address it?\u201d \u201cTo no one.\u201d Carton still had his hand in his breast. \u201cDo I date it?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d The prisoner looked up, at each question. Carton, standing over him with his hand in his breast, looked down. \u201c'If you remember,'\u201d said Carton, dictating, \u201c'the words that passed between us, long ago, you will readily comprehend this when you see it. You do remember them, I know. It is not in your nature to forget them. '\u201d He was drawing his hand from his breast; the prisoner chancing to look up in his hurried wonder as he wrote, the hand stopped, closing upon something. \u201cHave you written 'forget them'?\u201d Carton asked. \u201cI have. Is that a weapon in your hand?\u201d \u201cNo; I am not armed.\u201d \u201cWhat is it in your hand?\u201d \u201cYou shall know directly.", " They were armed. I was not. \u201c'Gentlemen,' said I, 'pardon me; but I usually inquire who does me the honour to seek my assistance, and what is the nature of the case to which I am summoned.' \u201cThe reply to this was made by him who had spoken second. 'Doctor, your clients are people of condition. As to the nature of the case, our confidence in your skill assures us that you will ascertain it for yourself better than we can describe it. Enough. Will you please to enter the carriage?' \u201cI could do nothing but comply, and I entered it in silence. They both entered after me--the last springing in, after putting up the steps. The carriage turned about, and drove on at its former speed. \u201cI repeat this conversation exactly as it occurred. I have no doubt that it is, word for word, the same. I describe everything exactly as it took place, constraining my mind not to wander from the task. Where I make the broken marks that follow here, I leave off for the time, and put my paper in its hiding-place. ***** \u201cThe carriage left the streets behind, passed the North Barrier, and emerged upon the country road. At two-thirds of a league from the Barrier--I did not estimate the distance at that time, but afterwards when I traversed it--it struck out of the main avenue, and presently stopped at a solitary house, We all three alighted, and walked, by a damp soft footpath in a garden where a neglected fountain had overflowed, to the door of the house.", " Write on; there are but a few words more.\u201d He dictated again. \u201c'I am thankful that the time has come, when I can prove them. That I do so is no subject for regret or grief. '\u201d As he said these words with his eyes fixed on the writer, his hand slowly and softly moved down close to the writer's face. The pen dropped from Darnay's fingers on the table, and he looked about him vacantly. \u201cWhat vapour is that?\u201d he asked. \u201cVapour?\u201d \u201cSomething that crossed me?\u201d \u201cI am conscious of nothing; there can be nothing here. Take up the pen and finish. Hurry, hurry!\u201d As if his memory were impaired, or his faculties disordered, the prisoner made an effort to rally his attention. As he looked at Carton with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing, Carton--his hand again in his breast--looked steadily at him. \u201cHurry, hurry!\u201d The prisoner bent over the paper, once more. \u201c'If it had been otherwise;'\u201d Carton's hand was again watchfully and softly stealing down; \u201c'I never should have used the longer opportunity. If it had been otherwise;'\u201d the hand was at the prisoner's face; \u201c'I should but have had so much the more to answer for. If it had been otherwise--'\u201d Carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into unintelligible signs. Carton's hand moved back to his breast no more. The prisoner sprang up with a reproachful look, but Carton's hand was close and firm at his nostrils, and Carton's left arm caught him round the waist."], "How do Stryver and Carton know each other?": [" \u201cOh dear you, sir?

You'd have thought!\u201d said Miss Pross; and Mr. Lorry left off. \u201cHow do you do?\u201d inquired that lady then--sharply, and yet as if to express that she bore him no malice. \u201cI am pretty well, I thank you,\u201d answered Mr. Lorry, with meekness; \u201chow are you?\u201d \u201cNothing to boast of,\u201d said Miss Pross. \u201cIndeed?\u201d \u201cAh! indeed!\u201d said Miss Pross. \u201cI am very much put out about my Ladybird.\u201d \u201cIndeed?\u201d \u201cFor gracious sake say something else besides 'indeed,' or you'll fidget me to death,\u201d said Miss Pross: whose character (dissociated from stature) was shortness. \u201cReally, then?\u201d said Mr. Lorry, as an amendment. \u201cReally, is bad enough,\u201d returned Miss Pross, \u201cbut better.

I am an Englishwoman.\u201d Madame Defarge looked at her scornfully, but still with something of Miss Pross's own perception that they two were at bay. She saw a tight, hard, wiry woman before her, as Mr. Lorry had seen in the same figure a woman with a strong hand, in the years gone by. She knew full well that Miss Pross was the family's devoted friend; Miss Pross knew full well that Madame Defarge was the family's malevolent enemy. \u201cOn my way yonder,\u201d said Madame Defarge, with a slight movement of her hand towards the fatal spot, \u201cwhere they reserve my chair and my knitting for me, I am come to make my compliments to her in passing. I wish to see her.\u201d \u201cI know that your intentions are evil,\u201d said Miss Pross, \u201cand you may depend upon it, I'll hold my own against them.\u201d Each spoke in her own language; neither understood the other's words; both were very watchful, and intent to deduce from look and manner, what the unintelligible words meant. \u201cIt will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this moment,\u201d said Madame Defarge. \u201cGood patriots will know what that means. Let me see her. Go tell her that I wish to see her. Do you hear?\u201d \u201cIf those eyes of yours were bed-winches,\u201d returned Miss Pross, \u201cand I was an English four-poster, they shouldn't loose a splinter of me.", " Mr. Cruncher, with some diffidence, explained himself as meaning \u201cOld Nick's.\u201d \u201cHa!\u201d said Miss Pross, \u201cit doesn't need an interpreter to explain the meaning of these creatures. They have but one, and it's Midnight Murder, and Mischief.\u201d \u201cHush, dear! Pray, pray, be cautious!\u201d cried Lucie. \u201cYes, yes, yes, I'll be cautious,\u201d said Miss Pross; \u201cbut I may say among ourselves, that I do hope there will be no oniony and tobaccoey smotherings in the form of embracings all round, going on in the streets. Now, Ladybird, never you stir from that fire till I come back! Take care of the dear husband you have recovered, and don't move your pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now, till you see me again!

In going, he had to face Miss Pross. No sooner did he face her, than Miss Pross uttered a scream, and clapped her hands. In a moment, the whole company were on their feet. That somebody was assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the likeliest occurrence. Everybody looked to see somebody fall, but only saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other; the man with all the outward aspect of a Frenchman and a thorough Republican; the woman, evidently English. What was said in this disappointing anti-climax, by the disciples of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, except that it was something very voluble and loud, would have been as so much Hebrew or Chaldean to Miss Pross and her protector, though they had been all ears. But, they had no ears for anything in their surprise. For, it must be recorded, that not only was Miss Pross lost in amazement and agitation, but, Mr. Cruncher--though it seemed on his own separate and individual account--was in a state of the greatest wonder. \u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d said the man who had caused Miss Pross to scream; speaking in a vexed, abrupt voice (though in a low tone), and in English. \u201cOh, Solomon, dear Solomon!\u201d cried Miss Pross, clapping her hands again. \u201cAfter not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time, do I find you here!\u201d \u201cDon't call me Solomon."], "What is Doctor Manette\u2019s occupation in London?": [" \u201cO me, O me!

He doesn't know me, and is making shoes!\u201d Mr. Lorry said what he could to calm her, and went himself into the Doctor's room. The bench was turned towards the light, as it had been when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before, and his head was bent down, and he was very busy. \u201cDoctor Manette. My dear friend, Doctor Manette!\u201d The Doctor looked at him for a moment--half inquiringly, half as if he were angry at being spoken to--and bent over his work again. He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at the throat, as it used to be when he did that work; and even the old haggard, faded surface of face had come back to him. He worked hard--impatiently--as if in some sense of having been interrupted. Mr. Lorry glanced at the work in his hand, and observed that it was a shoe of the old size and shape. He took up another that was lying by him, and asked what it was. \u201cA young lady's walking shoe,\u201d he muttered, without looking up. \u201cIt ought to have been finished long ago. Let it be.\u201d \u201cBut, Doctor Manette. Look at me!\u201d He obeyed, in the old mechanically submissive manner, without pausing in his work. \u201cYou know me, my dear friend? Think again. This is not your proper occupation. Think, dear friend!\u201d Nothing would induce him to speak more. He looked up, for an instant at a time, when he was requested to do so; but, no persuasion would extract a word from him.", " In this, his prosperity consisted. A certain portion of his time was passed at Cambridge, where he read with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a contraband trade in European languages, instead of conveying Greek and Latin through the Custom-house. The rest of his time he passed in London. Now, from the days when it was always summer in Eden, to these days when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes, the world of a man has invariably gone one way--Charles Darnay's way--the way of the love of a woman. He had loved Lucie Manette from the hour of his danger. He had never heard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her compassionate voice; he had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful, as hers when it was confronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been dug for him. But, he had not yet spoken to her on the subject; the assassination at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and the long, long, dusty roads--the solid stone chateau which had itself become the mere mist of a dream--had been done a year, and he had never yet, by so much as a single spoken word, disclosed to her the state of his heart. That he had his reasons for this, he knew full well. It was again a summer day when, lately arrived in London from his college occupation, he turned into the quiet corner in Soho, bent on seeking an opportunity of opening his mind to Doctor Manette.", " Among the lookers-on there was the same expression in all quarters of the court; insomuch, that a great majority of the foreheads there, might have been mirrors reflecting the witness, when the Judge looked up from his notes to glare at that tremendous heresy about George Washington. Mr. Attorney-General now signified to my Lord, that he deemed it necessary, as a matter of precaution and form, to call the young lady's father, Doctor Manette. Who was called accordingly. \u201cDoctor Manette, look upon the prisoner. Have you ever seen him before?\u201d \u201cOnce. When he called at my lodgings in London. Some three years, or three years and a half ago.\u201d \u201cCan you identify him as your fellow-passenger on board the packet, or speak to his conversation with your daughter?\u201d \u201cSir, I can do neither.\u201d \u201cIs there any particular and special reason for your being unable to do either?\u201d He answered, in a low voice, \u201cThere is.\u201d \u201cHas it been your misfortune to undergo a long imprisonment, without trial, or even accusation, in your native country, Doctor Manette?\u201d He answered, in a tone that went to every heart, \u201cA long imprisonment.\u201d \u201cWere you newly released on the occasion in question?\u201d \u201cThey tell me so.\u201d \u201cHave you no remembrance of the occasion?\u201d \u201cNone. My mind is a blank, from some time--I cannot even say what time--when I employed myself, in my captivity, in making shoes, to the time when I found myself living in London with my dear daughter here.", " An incidental allusion, purposely thrown out, to the day of the week, and the day of the month, set him thinking and counting, and evidently made him uneasy. In all other respects, however, he was so composedly himself, that Mr. Lorry determined to have the aid he sought. And that aid was his own. Therefore, when the breakfast was done and cleared away, and he and the Doctor were left together, Mr. Lorry said, feelingly: \u201cMy dear Manette, I am anxious to have your opinion, in confidence, on a very curious case in which I am deeply interested; that is to say, it is very curious to me; perhaps, to your better information it may be less so.\u201d Glancing at his hands, which were discoloured by his late work, the Doctor looked troubled, and listened attentively. He had already glanced at his hands more than once. \u201cDoctor Manette,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, touching him affectionately on the arm, \u201cthe case is the case of a particularly dear friend of mine. Pray give your mind to it, and advise me well for his sake--and above all, for his daughter's--his daughter's, my dear Manette.\u201d \u201cIf I understand,\u201d said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, \u201csome mental shock--?\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d \u201cBe explicit,\u201d said the Doctor. \u201cSpare no detail.\u201d Mr. Lorry saw that they understood one another, and proceeded. \u201cMy dear Manette, it is the case of an old and a prolonged shock, of great acuteness and severity to the affections, the feelings, the--the--as you express it--the mind."], "What story does Darnay tell that makes Doctor Manette startle and look ill?": [" If she should ever tell me that you are essential to her perfect happiness, I will give her to you. If there were--Charles Darnay, if there were--\u201d The young man had taken his hand gratefully; their hands were joined as the Doctor spoke: \u201c--any fancies, any reasons, any apprehensions, anything whatsoever, new or old, against the man she really loved--the direct responsibility thereof not lying on his head--they should all be obliterated for her sake. She is everything to me; more to me than suffering, more to me than wrong, more to me--Well! This is idle talk.\u201d So strange was the way in which he faded into silence, and so strange his fixed look when he had ceased to speak, that Darnay felt his own hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it. \u201cYou said something to me,\u201d said Doctor Manette, breaking into a smile. \u201cWhat was it you said to me?\u201d He was at a loss how to answer, until he remembered having spoken of a condition. Relieved as his mind reverted to that, he answered: \u201cYour confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my part. My present name, though but slightly changed from my mother's, is not, as you will remember, my own. I wish to tell you what that is, and why I am in England.\u201d \u201cStop!\u201d said the Doctor of Beauvais. \u201cI wish it, that I may the better deserve your confidence, and have no secret from you.\u201d \u201cStop!\u201d For an instant, the Doctor even had his two hands at his ears; for another instant, even had his two hands laid on Darnay's lips.", " How does it feel? Is it worth being tried for one's life, to be the object of such sympathy and compassion, Mr. Darnay?\u201d Again Darnay answered not a word. \u201cShe was mightily pleased to have your message, when I gave it her. Not that she showed she was pleased, but I suppose she was.\u201d The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this disagreeable companion had, of his own free will, assisted him in the strait of the day. He turned the dialogue to that point, and thanked him for it. \u201cI neither want any thanks, nor merit any,\u201d was the careless rejoinder. \u201cIt was nothing to do, in the first place; and I don't know why I did it, in the second. Mr. Darnay, let me ask you a question.\u201d \u201cWillingly, and a small return for your good offices.\u201d \u201cDo you think I particularly like you?\u201d \u201cReally, Mr. Carton,\u201d returned the other, oddly disconcerted, \u201cI have not asked myself the question.\u201d \u201cBut ask yourself the question now.\u201d \u201cYou have acted as if you do; but I don't think you do.\u201d \u201c_I_ don't think I do,\u201d said Carton. \u201cI begin to have a very good opinion of your understanding.\u201d \u201cNevertheless,\u201d pursued Darnay, rising to ring the bell, \u201cthere is nothing in that, I hope, to prevent my calling the reckoning, and our parting without ill-blood on either side.\u201d Carton rejoining, \u201cNothing in life!\u201d Darnay rang. \u201cDo you call the whole reckoning?\u201d said Carton. On his answering in the affirmative, \u201cThen bring me another pint of this same wine, drawer, and come and wake me at ten.\u201d The bill being paid, Charles Darnay rose and wished him good night.", " Miss Lucie looks ill, Mr. Darnay has had a terrible day, we are worn out.\u201d \u201cSpeak for yourself, Mr. Lorry,\u201d said Stryver; \u201cI have a night's work to do yet. Speak for yourself.\u201d \u201cI speak for myself,\u201d answered Mr. Lorry, \u201cand for Mr. Darnay, and for Miss Lucie, and--Miss Lucie, do you not think I may speak for us all?\u201d He asked her the question pointedly, and with a glance at her father. His face had become frozen, as it were, in a very curious look at Darnay: an intent look, deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust, not even unmixed with fear. With this strange expression on him his thoughts had wandered away. \u201cMy father,\u201d said Lucie, softly laying her hand on his. He slowly shook the shadow off, and turned to her. \u201cShall we go home, my father?\u201d With a long breath, he answered \u201cYes.\u201d The friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the impression--which he himself had originated--that he would not be released that night. The lights were nearly all extinguished in the passages, the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle, and the dismal place was deserted until to-morrow morning's interest of gallows, pillory, whipping-post, and branding-iron, should repeople it. Walking between her father and Mr. Darnay, Lucie Manette passed into the open air. A hackney-coach was called, and the father and daughter departed in it. Mr. Stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back to the robing-room.", " You have loved yourself; let your old love speak for me!\u201d The Doctor sat with his face turned away, and his eyes bent on the ground. At the last words, he stretched out his hand again, hurriedly, and cried: \u201cNot that, sir! Let that be! I adjure you, do not recall that!\u201d His cry was so like a cry of actual pain, that it rang in Charles Darnay's ears long after he had ceased. He motioned with the hand he had extended, and it seemed to be an appeal to Darnay to pause. The latter so received it, and remained silent. \u201cI ask your pardon,\u201d said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, after some moments. \u201cI do not doubt your loving Lucie; you may be satisfied of it.\u201d He turned towards him in his chair, but did not look at him, or raise his eyes. His chin dropped upon his hand, and his white hair overshadowed his face: \u201cHave you spoken to Lucie?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cNor written?\u201d \u201cNever.\u201d \u201cIt would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self-denial is to be referred to your consideration for her father. Her father thanks you.\u201d He offered his hand; but his eyes did not go with it. \u201cI know,\u201d said Darnay, respectfully, \u201chow can I fail to know, Doctor Manette, I who have seen you together from day to day, that between you and Miss Manette there is an affection so unusual, so touching, so belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured, that it can have few parallels, even in the tenderness between a father and child."], "What does Marquis Evremonde\u2019s carriage run over?": [" As I stood aside to let that carriage pass, apprehensive that it might otherwise run me down, a head was put out at the window, and a voice called to the driver to stop. \u201cThe carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses, and the same voice called to me by my name. I answered. The carriage was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the door and alight before I came up with it. \u201cI observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks, and appeared to conceal themselves. As they stood side by side near the carriage door, I also observed that they both looked of about my own age, or rather younger, and that they were greatly alike, in stature, manner, voice, and (as far as I could see) face too. \u201c'You are Doctor Manette?' said one. \u201cI am.\u201d \u201c'Doctor Manette, formerly of Beauvais,' said the other; 'the young physician, originally an expert surgeon, who within the last year or two has made a rising reputation in Paris?' \u201c'Gentlemen,' I returned, 'I am that Doctor Manette of whom you speak so graciously.' \u201c'We have been to your residence,' said the first, 'and not being so fortunate as to find you there, and being informed that you were probably walking in this direction, we followed, in the hope of overtaking you. Will you please to enter the carriage?' \u201cThe manner of both was imperious, and they both moved, as these words were spoken, so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door.", " \u201cPardon, Monsieur the Marquis!\u201d said a ragged and submissive man, \u201cit is a child.\u201d \u201cWhy does he make that abominable noise? Is it his child?\u201d \u201cExcuse me, Monsieur the Marquis--it is a pity--yes.\u201d The fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it was, into a space some ten or twelve yards square. As the tall man suddenly got up from the ground, and came running at the carriage, Monsieur the Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-hilt. \u201cKilled!\u201d shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both arms at their length above his head, and staring at him. \u201cDead!\u201d The people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis. There was nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness and eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger. Neither did the people say anything; after the first cry, they had been silent, and they remained so. The voice of the submissive man who had spoken, was flat and tame in its extreme submission. Monsieur the Marquis ran his eyes over them all, as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes. He took out his purse. \u201cIt is extraordinary to me,\u201d said he, \u201cthat you people cannot take care of yourselves and your children. One or the other of you is for ever in the way. How do I know what injury you have done my horses. See! Give him that.\u201d He threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up, and all the heads craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell.", " How do you call the man? You know all the men of this part of the country. Who was he?\u201d \u201cYour clemency, Monseigneur! He was not of this part of the country. Of all the days of my life, I never saw him.\u201d \u201cSwinging by the chain? To be suffocated?\u201d \u201cWith your gracious permission, that was the wonder of it, Monseigneur. His head hanging over--like this!\u201d He turned himself sideways to the carriage, and leaned back, with his face thrown up to the sky, and his head hanging down; then recovered himself, fumbled with his cap, and made a bow. \u201cWhat was he like?\u201d \u201cMonseigneur, he was whiter than the miller. All covered with dust, white as a spectre, tall as a spectre!\u201d The picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd; but all eyes, without comparing notes with other eyes, looked at Monsieur the Marquis. Perhaps, to observe whether he had any spectre on his conscience. \u201cTruly, you did well,\u201d said the Marquis, felicitously sensible that such vermin were not to ruffle him, \u201cto see a thief accompanying my carriage, and not open that great mouth of yours. Bah! Put him aside, Monsieur Gabelle!\u201d Monsieur Gabelle was the Postmaster, and some other taxing functionary united; he had come out with great obsequiousness to assist at this examination, and had held the examined by the drapery of his arm in an official manner. \u201cBah! Go aside!\u201d said Monsieur Gabelle. \u201cLay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village to-night, and be sure that his business is honest, Gabelle.\u201d \u201cMonseigneur, I am flattered to devote myself to your orders.\u201d \u201cDid he run away, fellow?--where is that Accursed?\u201d The accursed was already under the carriage with some half-dozen particular friends, pointing out the chain with his blue cap.", " The water of the fountain ran, the swift river ran, the day ran into evening, so much life in the city ran into death according to rule, time and tide waited for no man, the rats were sleeping close together in their dark holes again, the Fancy Ball was lighted up at supper, all things ran their course. VIII. Monseigneur in the Country A beautiful landscape, with the corn bright in it, but not abundant.

On seeing him, the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder, sobbing and crying, and pointing to the fountain, where some women were stooping over the motionless bundle, and moving gently about it. They were as silent, however, as the men. \u201cI know all, I know all,\u201d said the last comer. \u201cBe a brave man, my Gaspard! It is better for the poor little plaything to die so, than to live. It has died in a moment without pain.

Who threw that?\u201d He looked to the spot where Defarge the vendor of wine had stood, a moment before; but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on the pavement in that spot, and the figure that stood beside him was the figure of a dark stout woman, knitting."], "What does the road-mender tell the Marquis?": [" No white-haired man was there now; but, the three men were there who had gone out of the wine-shop singly. And between them and the white-haired man afar off, was the one small link, that they had once looked in at him through the chinks in the wall. Defarge closed the door carefully, and spoke in a subdued voice: \u201cJacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three! This is the witness encountered by appointment, by me, Jacques Four. He will tell you all. Speak, Jacques Five!\u201d The mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his swarthy forehead with it, and said, \u201cWhere shall I commence, monsieur?\u201d \u201cCommence,\u201d was Monsieur Defarge's not unreasonable reply, \u201cat the commencement.\u201d \u201cI saw him then, messieurs,\u201d began the mender of roads, \u201ca year ago this running summer, underneath the carriage of the Marquis, hanging by the chain. Behold the manner of it. I leaving my work on the road, the sun going to bed, the carriage of the Marquis slowly ascending the hill, he hanging by the chain--like this.\u201d Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in which he ought to have been perfect by that time, seeing that it had been the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village during a whole year. Jacques One struck in, and asked if he had ever seen the man before? \u201cNever,\u201d answered the mender of roads, recovering his perpendicular. Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then?", " \u201cNo dinner?\u201d \u201cNothing but supper now,\u201d said the mender of roads, with a hungry face. \u201cIt is the fashion,\u201d growled the man. \u201cI meet no dinner anywhere.\u201d He took out a blackened pipe, filled it, lighted it with flint and steel, pulled at it until it was in a bright glow: then, suddenly held it from him and dropped something into it from between his finger and thumb, that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke. \u201cTouch then.\u201d It was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this time, after observing these operations. They again joined hands. \u201cTo-night?\u201d said the mender of roads. \u201cTo-night,\u201d said the man, putting the pipe in his mouth. \u201cWhere?\u201d \u201cHere.\u201d He and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at one another, with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge of bayonets, until the sky began to clear over the village. \u201cShow me!\u201d said the traveller then, moving to the brow of the hill. \u201cSee!\u201d returned the mender of roads, with extended finger. \u201cYou go down here, and straight through the street, and past the fountain--\u201d \u201cTo the Devil with all that!\u201d interrupted the other, rolling his eye over the landscape. \u201c_I_ go through no streets and past no fountains. Well?\u201d \u201cWell! About two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the village.\u201d \u201cGood. When do you cease to work?\u201d \u201cAt sunset.\u201d \u201cWill you wake me, before departing? I have walked two nights without resting.", " \u201cPardon, Monsieur the Marquis!\u201d said a ragged and submissive man, \u201cit is a child.\u201d \u201cWhy does he make that abominable noise? Is it his child?\u201d \u201cExcuse me, Monsieur the Marquis--it is a pity--yes.\u201d The fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it was, into a space some ten or twelve yards square.

Will you wake me?\u201d \u201cSurely.\u201d The wayfarer smoked his pipe out, put it in his breast, slipped off his great wooden shoes, and lay down on his back on the heap of stones. He was fast asleep directly. As the road-mender plied his dusty labour, and the hail-clouds, rolling away, revealed bright bars and streaks of sky which were responded to by silver gleams upon the landscape, the little man (who wore a red cap now, in place of his blue one) seemed fascinated by the figure on the heap of stones. His eyes were so often turned towards it, that he used his tools mechanically, and, one would have said, to very poor account. The bronze face, the shaggy black hair and beard, the coarse woollen red cap, the rough medley dress of home-spun stuff and hairy skins of beasts, the powerful frame attenuated by spare living, and the sullen and desperate compression of the lips in sleep, inspired the mender of roads with awe. The traveller had travelled far, and his feet were footsore, and his ankles chafed and bleeding; his great shoes, stuffed with leaves and grass, had been heavy to drag over the many long leagues, and his clothes were chafed into holes, as he himself was into sores. Stooping down beside him, the road-mender tried to get a peep at secret weapons in his breast or where not; but, in vain, for he slept with his arms crossed upon him, and set as resolutely as his lips."], "What does Darnay tell the Marquis that their family legacy is?": [" It is in vain I represent that I have acted for them, and not against, according to your commands. It is in vain I represent that, before the sequestration of emigrant property, I had remitted the imposts they had ceased to pay; that I had collected no rent; that I had had recourse to no process. The only response is, that I have acted for an emigrant, and where is that emigrant? \u201cAh! most gracious Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, where is that emigrant? I cry in my sleep where is he? I demand of Heaven, will he not come to deliver me? No answer. Ah Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, I send my desolate cry across the sea, hoping it may perhaps reach your ears through the great bank of Tilson known at Paris! \u201cFor the love of Heaven, of justice, of generosity, of the honour of your noble name, I supplicate you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, to succour and release me. My fault is, that I have been true to you. Oh Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, I pray you be you true to me! \u201cFrom this prison here of horror, whence I every hour tend nearer and nearer to destruction, I send you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, the assurance of my dolorous and unhappy service. \u201cYour afflicted, \u201cGabelle.\u201d The latent uneasiness in Darnay's mind was roused to vigourous life by this letter. The peril of an old servant and a good one, whose only crime was fidelity to himself and his family, stared him so reproachfully in the face, that, as he walked to and fro in the Temple considering what to do, he almost hid his face from the passersby.", " Let us look at his infamous name. D--n the fellow!\u201d Darnay, unable to restrain himself any longer, touched Mr. Stryver on the shoulder, and said: \u201cI know the fellow.\u201d \u201cDo you, by Jupiter?\u201d said Stryver. \u201cI am sorry for it.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cWhy, Mr. Darnay? D'ye hear what he did? Don't ask, why, in these times.\u201d \u201cBut I do ask why?\u201d \u201cThen I tell you again, Mr. Darnay, I am sorry for it. I am sorry to hear you putting any such extraordinary questions. Here is a fellow, who, infected by the most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry that ever was known, abandoned his property to the vilest scum of the earth that ever did murder by wholesale, and you ask me why I am sorry that a man who instructs youth knows him? Well, but I'll answer you. I am sorry because I believe there is contamination in such a scoundrel. That's why.\u201d Mindful of the secret, Darnay with great difficulty checked himself, and said: \u201cYou may not understand the gentleman.\u201d \u201cI understand how to put _you_ in a corner, Mr. Darnay,\u201d said Bully Stryver, \u201cand I'll do it. If this fellow is a gentleman, I _don't_ understand him. You may tell him so, with my compliments. You may also tell him, from me, that after abandoning his worldly goods and position to this butcherly mob, I wonder he is not at the head of them. But, no, gentlemen,\u201d said Stryver, looking all round, and snapping his fingers, \u201cI know something of human nature, and I tell you that you'll never find a fellow like this fellow, trusting himself to the mercies of such precious _prot\u00e9g\u00e9s_.", " \u201cPardon, Monsieur the Marquis!\u201d said a ragged and submissive man, \u201cit is a child.\u201d \u201cWhy does he make that abominable noise? Is it his child?\u201d \u201cExcuse me, Monsieur the Marquis--it is a pity--yes.\u201d The fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it was, into a space some ten or twelve yards square. As the tall man suddenly got up from the ground, and came running at the carriage, Monsieur the Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-hilt. \u201cKilled!\u201d shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both arms at their length above his head, and staring at him. \u201cDead!\u201d The people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis. There was nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness and eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger. Neither did the people say anything; after the first cry, they had been silent, and they remained so. The voice of the submissive man who had spoken, was flat and tame in its extreme submission. Monsieur the Marquis ran his eyes over them all, as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes. He took out his purse. \u201cIt is extraordinary to me,\u201d said he, \u201cthat you people cannot take care of yourselves and your children. One or the other of you is for ever in the way. How do I know what injury you have done my horses. See! Give him that.\u201d He threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up, and all the heads craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell.", " Hah!\u201d And he took another gentle little pinch of snuff, and lightly crossed his legs. But, when his nephew, leaning an elbow on the table, covered his eyes thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand, the fine mask looked at him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness, closeness, and dislike, than was comportable with its wearer's assumption of indifference. \u201cRepression is the only lasting philosophy. The dark deference of fear and slavery, my friend,\u201d observed the Marquis, \u201cwill keep the dogs obedient to the whip, as long as this roof,\u201d looking up to it, \u201cshuts out the sky.\u201d That might not be so long as the Marquis supposed. If a picture of the chateau as it was to be a very few years hence, and of fifty like it as they too were to be a very few years hence, could have been shown to him that night, he might have been at a loss to claim his own from the ghastly, fire-charred, plunder-wrecked rains. As for the roof he vaunted, he might have found _that_ shutting out the sky in a new way--to wit, for ever, from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead was fired, out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets. \u201cMeanwhile,\u201d said the Marquis, \u201cI will preserve the honour and repose of the family, if you will not. But you must be fatigued. Shall we terminate our conference for the night?\u201d \u201cA moment more.\u201d \u201cAn hour, if you please.\u201d \u201cSir,\u201d said the nephew, \u201cwe have done wrong, and are reaping the fruits of wrong.\u201d \u201c_We_ have done wrong?\u201d repeated the Marquis, with an inquiring smile, and delicately pointing, first to his nephew, then to himself."], "What happens to the Marquis the next morning?": [" \u201cPardon, Monsieur the Marquis!\u201d said a ragged and submissive man, \u201cit is a child.\u201d \u201cWhy does he make that abominable noise?

On seeing him, the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder, sobbing and crying, and pointing to the fountain, where some women were stooping over the motionless bundle, and moving gently about it. They were as silent, however, as the men. \u201cI know all, I know all,\u201d said the last comer. \u201cBe a brave man, my Gaspard! It is better for the poor little plaything to die so, than to live. It has died in a moment without pain. Could it have lived an hour as happily?\u201d \u201cYou are a philosopher, you there,\u201d said the Marquis, smiling. \u201cHow do they call you?\u201d \u201cThey call me Defarge.\u201d \u201cOf what trade?\u201d \u201cMonsieur the Marquis, vendor of wine.\u201d \u201cPick up that, philosopher and vendor of wine,\u201d said the Marquis, throwing him another gold coin, \u201cand spend it as you will. The horses there; are they right?\u201d Without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time, Monsieur the Marquis leaned back in his seat, and was just being driven away with the air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing, and had paid for it, and could afford to pay for it; when his ease was suddenly disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage, and ringing on its floor. \u201cHold!\u201d said Monsieur the Marquis. \u201cHold the horses! Who threw that?\u201d He looked to the spot where Defarge the vendor of wine had stood, a moment before; but the wretched father was grovelling on his face on the pavement in that spot, and the figure that stood beside him was the figure of a dark stout woman, knitting.", " It is in vain I represent that I have acted for them, and not against, according to your commands.

Yes. So commences the new philosophy! You are fatigued. Good night!\u201d It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his. The nephew looked at him, in vain, in passing on to the door. \u201cGood night!\u201d said the uncle. \u201cI look to the pleasure of seeing you again in the morning. Good repose! Light Monsieur my nephew to his chamber there!--And burn Monsieur my nephew in his bed, if you will,\u201d he added to himself, before he rang his little bell again, and summoned his valet to his own bedroom. The valet come and gone, Monsieur the Marquis walked to and fro in his loose chamber-robe, to prepare himself gently for sleep, that hot still night. Rustling about the room, his softly-slippered feet making no noise on the floor, he moved like a refined tiger:--looked like some enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort, in story, whose periodical change into tiger form was either just going off, or just coming on. He moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom, looking again at the scraps of the day's journey that came unbidden into his mind; the slow toil up the hill at sunset, the setting sun, the descent, the mill, the prison on the crag, the little village in the hollow, the peasants at the fountain, and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the chain under the carriage."], "Who tells Doctor Manette of his love for Lucie?": [" \u201cYes?\u201d said the Doctor, with evident constraint. \u201cBring your chair here, and speak on.\u201d He complied as to the chair, but appeared to find the speaking on less easy. \u201cI have had the happiness, Doctor Manette, of being so intimate here,\u201d so he at length began, \u201cfor some year and a half, that I hope the topic on which I am about to touch may not--\u201d He was stayed by the Doctor's putting out his hand to stop him. When he had kept it so a little while, he said, drawing it back: \u201cIs Lucie the topic?\u201d \u201cShe is.\u201d \u201cIt is hard for me to speak of her at any time. It is very hard for me to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours, Charles Darnay.\u201d \u201cIt is a tone of fervent admiration, true homage, and deep love, Doctor Manette!\u201d he said deferentially. There was another blank silence before her father rejoined: \u201cI believe it. I do you justice; I believe it.\u201d His constraint was so manifest, and it was so manifest, too, that it originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject, that Charles Darnay hesitated. \u201cShall I go on, sir?\u201d Another blank. \u201cYes, go on.\u201d \u201cYou anticipate what I would say, though you cannot know how earnestly I say it, how earnestly I feel it, without knowing my secret heart, and the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been laden. Dear Doctor Manette, I love your daughter fondly, dearly, disinterestedly, devotedly. If ever there were love in the world, I love her.", " You have loved yourself; let your old love speak for me!\u201d The Doctor sat with his face turned away, and his eyes bent on the ground. At the last words, he stretched out his hand again, hurriedly, and cried: \u201cNot that, sir! Let that be! I adjure you, do not recall that!\u201d His cry was so like a cry of actual pain, that it rang in Charles Darnay's ears long after he had ceased. He motioned with the hand he had extended, and it seemed to be an appeal to Darnay to pause. The latter so received it, and remained silent. \u201cI ask your pardon,\u201d said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, after some moments. \u201cI do not doubt your loving Lucie; you may be satisfied of it.\u201d He turned towards him in his chair, but did not look at him, or raise his eyes. His chin dropped upon his hand, and his white hair overshadowed his face: \u201cHave you spoken to Lucie?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cNor written?\u201d \u201cNever.\u201d \u201cIt would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self-denial is to be referred to your consideration for her father. Her father thanks you.\u201d He offered his hand; but his eyes did not go with it. \u201cI know,\u201d said Darnay, respectfully, \u201chow can I fail to know, Doctor Manette, I who have seen you together from day to day, that between you and Miss Manette there is an affection so unusual, so touching, so belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured, that it can have few parallels, even in the tenderness between a father and child.", " Lucie and her father! Lucie with her arms stretched out to him, and with that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified, that it seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give force and power to it in this one passage of her life. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d cried Mr. Lorry, breathless and confused. \u201cWhat is the matter? Lucie! Manette! What has happened? What has brought you here? What is it?\u201d With the look fixed upon him, in her paleness and wildness, she panted out in his arms, imploringly, \u201cO my dear friend! My husband!\u201d \u201cYour husband, Lucie?\u201d \u201cCharles.\u201d \u201cWhat of Charles?\u201d \u201cHere. \u201cHere, in Paris?\u201d \u201cHas been here some days--three or four--I don't know how many--I can't collect my thoughts. An errand of generosity brought him here unknown to us; he was stopped at the barrier, and sent to prison.\u201d The old man uttered an irrepressible cry. Almost at the same moment, the bell of the great gate rang again, and a loud noise of feet and voices came pouring into the courtyard. \u201cWhat is that noise?\u201d said the Doctor, turning towards the window. \u201cDon't look!\u201d cried Mr. Lorry. \u201cDon't look out! Manette, for your life, don't touch the blind!\u201d The Doctor turned, with his hand upon the fastening of the window, and said, with a cool, bold smile: \u201cMy dear friend, I have a charmed life in this city. I have been a Bastille prisoner. There is no patriot in Paris--in Paris?", " \u201cBut I don't say he don't refer to it within himself.\u201d \u201cDo you believe that he thinks of it much?\u201d \u201cI do,\u201d said Miss Pross. \u201cDo you imagine--\u201d Mr. Lorry had begun, when Miss Pross took him up short with: \u201cNever imagine anything. Have no imagination at all.\u201d \u201cI stand corrected; do you suppose--you go so far as to suppose, sometimes?\u201d \u201cNow and then,\u201d said Miss Pross. \u201cDo you suppose,\u201d Mr. Lorry went on, with a laughing twinkle in his bright eye, as it looked kindly at her, \u201cthat Doctor Manette has any theory of his own, preserved through all those years, relative to the cause of his being so oppressed; perhaps, even to the name of his oppressor?\u201d \u201cI don't suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me.\u201d \u201cAnd that is--?\u201d \u201cThat she thinks he has.\u201d \u201cNow don't be angry at my asking all these questions; because I am a mere dull man of business, and you are a woman of business.\u201d \u201cDull?\u201d Miss Pross inquired, with placidity. Rather wishing his modest adjective away, Mr. Lorry replied, \u201cNo, no, no. Surely not. To return to business:--Is it not remarkable that Doctor Manette, unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured he is, should never touch upon that question? I will not say with me, though he had business relations with me many years ago, and we are now intimate; I will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly attached, and who is so devotedly attached to him?"], "Who goes to the bank to tell Mr. Lorry of his intention to propose to Lucie?": [" He walked to and fro, with thoughts very busy, until it was time to return to Tellson's and take leave of Mr. Lorry. As soon as he arrived in Paris he would present himself to this old friend, but he must say nothing of his intention now. A carriage with post-horses was ready at the Bank door, and Jerry was booted and equipped. \u201cI have delivered that letter,\u201d said Charles Darnay to Mr. Lorry. \u201cI would not consent to your being charged with any written answer, but perhaps you will take a verbal one?\u201d \u201cThat I will, and readily,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, \u201cif it is not dangerous.\u201d \u201cNot at all. Though it is to a prisoner in the Abbaye.\u201d \u201cWhat is his name?\u201d said Mr. Lorry, with his open pocket-book in his hand. \u201cGabelle.\u201d \u201cGabelle. And what is the message to the unfortunate Gabelle in prison?\u201d \u201cSimply, 'that he has received the letter, and will come. '\u201d \u201cAny time mentioned?\u201d \u201cHe will start upon his journey to-morrow night.\u201d \u201cAny person mentioned?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d He helped Mr. Lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks, and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old Bank, into the misty air of Fleet-street. \u201cMy love to Lucie, and to little Lucie,\u201d said Mr. Lorry at parting, \u201cand take precious care of them till I come back.\u201d Charles Darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled, as the carriage rolled away. That night--it was the fourteenth of August--he sat up late, and wrote two fervent letters; one was to Lucie, explaining the strong obligation he was under to go to Paris, and showing her, at length, the reasons that he had, for feeling confident that he could become involved in no personal danger there; the other was to the Doctor, confiding Lucie and their dear child to his care, and dwelling on the same topics with the strongest assurances.", " A man don't see all this here a goin' on dreadful round him, in the way of Subjects without heads, dear me, plentiful enough fur to bring the price down to porterage and hardly that, without havin' his serious thoughts of things. And these here would be mine, if it wos so, entreatin' of you fur to bear in mind that wot I said just now, I up and said in the good cause when I might have kep' it back.\u201d \u201cThat at least is true,\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cSay no more now. It may be that I shall yet stand your friend, if you deserve it, and repent in action--not in words. I want no more words.\u201d Mr. Cruncher knuckled his forehead, as Sydney Carton and the spy returned from the dark room. \u201cAdieu, Mr. Barsad,\u201d said the former; \u201cour arrangement thus made, you have nothing to fear from me.\u201d He sat down in a chair on the hearth, over against Mr. Lorry. When they were alone, Mr. Lorry asked him what he had done? \u201cNot much. If it should go ill with the prisoner, I have ensured access to him, once.\u201d Mr. Lorry's countenance fell. \u201cIt is all I could do,\u201d said Carton. \u201cTo propose too much, would be to put this man's head under the axe, and, as he himself said, nothing worse could happen to him if he were denounced. It was obviously the weakness of the position. There is no help for it.\u201d \u201cBut access to him,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, \u201cif it should go ill before the Tribunal, will not save him.\u201d \u201cI never said it would.\u201d Mr. Lorry's eyes gradually sought the fire; his sympathy with his darling, and the heavy disappointment of his second arrest, gradually weakened them; he was an old man now, overborne with anxiety of late, and his tears fell.", " Mr. Lorry, who had gone out when the young lady and her father went out, now reappeared, and beckoned to Jerry: who, in the slackened interest, could easily get near him. \u201cJerry, if you wish to take something to eat, you can. But, keep in the way. You will be sure to hear when the jury come in. Don't be a moment behind them, for I want you to take the verdict back to the bank. You are the quickest messenger I know, and will get to Temple Bar long before I can.\u201d Jerry had just enough forehead to knuckle, and he knuckled it in acknowledgment of this communication and a shilling. Mr. Carton came up at the moment, and touched Mr. Lorry on the arm. \u201cHow is the young lady?\u201d \u201cShe is greatly distressed; but her father is comforting her, and she feels the better for being out of court.\u201d \u201cI'll tell the prisoner so. It won't do for a respectable bank gentleman like you, to be seen speaking to him publicly, you know.\u201d Mr. Lorry reddened as if he were conscious of having debated the point in his mind, and Mr. Carton made his way to the outside of the bar. The way out of court lay in that direction, and Jerry followed him, all eyes, ears, and spikes. \u201cMr. Darnay!\u201d The prisoner came forward directly. \u201cYou will naturally be anxious to hear of the witness, Miss Manette. She will do very well. You have seen the worst of her agitation.\u201d \u201cI am deeply sorry to have been the cause of it. Could you tell her so for me, with my fervent acknowledgments?\u201d \u201cYes, I could.", " \u201cAnd so,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, who could not sufficiently admire the bride, and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet, pretty dress; \u201cand so it was for this, my sweet Lucie, that I brought you across the Channel, such a baby! Lord bless me! How little I thought what I was doing! How lightly I valued the obligation I was conferring on my friend Mr. Charles!\u201d \u201cYou didn't mean it,\u201d remarked the matter-of-fact Miss Pross, \u201cand therefore how could you know it? Nonsense!\u201d \u201cReally? Well; but don't cry,\u201d said the gentle Mr. Lorry. \u201cI am not crying,\u201d said Miss Pross; \u201c_you_ are.\u201d \u201cI, my Pross?\u201d (By this time, Mr. Lorry dared to be pleasant with her, on occasion.) \u201cYou were, just now; I saw you do it, and I don't wonder at it. Such a present of plate as you have made 'em, is enough to bring tears into anybody's eyes. There's not a fork or a spoon in the collection,\u201d said Miss Pross, \u201cthat I didn't cry over, last night after the box came, till I couldn't see it.\u201d \u201cI am highly gratified,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, \u201cthough, upon my honour, I had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance invisible to any one. Dear me! This is an occasion that makes a man speculate on all he has lost. Dear, dear, dear! To think that there might have been a Mrs. Lorry, any time these fifty years almost!\u201d \u201cNot at all!\u201d From Miss Pross. \u201cYou think there never might have been a Mrs. Lorry?\u201d asked the gentleman of that name."], "What does Mr. Lorry find out about Stryver from Doctor Manette?": [" \u201cThat is what I mean to tell you, sir,\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cPray let there be no mistake about it.\u201d Mr. Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while, and then stood hitting a tune out of his teeth with it, which probably gave him the toothache. He broke the awkward silence by saying: \u201cThis is something new to me, Mr. Lorry. You deliberately advise me not to go up to Soho and offer myself--_my_self, Stryver of the King's Bench bar?\u201d \u201cDo you ask me for my advice, Mr. Stryver?\u201d \u201cYes, I do.\u201d \u201cVery good. Then I give it, and you have repeated it correctly.\u201d \u201cAnd all I can say of it is,\u201d laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh, \u201cthat this--ha, ha!--beats everything past, present, and to come.\u201d \u201cNow understand me,\u201d pursued Mr. Lorry. \u201cAs a man of business, I am not justified in saying anything about this matter, for, as a man of business, I know nothing of it. But, as an old fellow, who has carried Miss Manette in his arms, who is the trusted friend of Miss Manette and of her father too, and who has a great affection for them both, I have spoken. The confidence is not of my seeking, recollect. Now, you think I may not be right?\u201d \u201cNot I!\u201d said Stryver, whistling. \u201cI can't undertake to find third parties in common sense; I can only find it for myself. I suppose sense in certain quarters; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense. It's new to me, but you are right, I dare say.\u201d \u201cWhat I suppose, Mr. Stryver, I claim to characterise for myself--And understand me, sir,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, quickly flushing again, \u201cI will not--not even at Tellson's--have it characterised for me by any gentleman breathing.\u201d \u201cThere!", " \u201cOh dear you, sir? What may your meaning be, Mr. Lorry?\u201d \u201cMy meaning,\u201d answered the man of business, \u201cis, of course, friendly and appreciative, and that it does you the greatest credit, and--in short, my meaning is everything you could desire. But--really, you know, Mr. Stryver--\u201d Mr. Lorry paused, and shook his head at him in the oddest manner, as if he were compelled against his will to add, internally, \u201cyou know there really is so much too much of you!\u201d \u201cWell!\u201d said Stryver, slapping the desk with his contentious hand, opening his eyes wider, and taking a long breath, \u201cif I understand you, Mr. Lorry, I'll be hanged!\u201d Mr. Lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that end, and bit the feather of a pen. \u201cD--n it all, sir!\u201d said Stryver, staring at him, \u201cam I not eligible?\u201d \u201cOh dear yes! Yes. Oh yes, you're eligible!\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cIf you say eligible, you are eligible.\u201d \u201cAm I not prosperous?\u201d asked Stryver. \u201cOh! if you come to prosperous, you are prosperous,\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cAnd advancing?\u201d \u201cIf you come to advancing you know,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, delighted to be able to make another admission, \u201cnobody can doubt that.\u201d \u201cThen what on earth is your meaning, Mr. Lorry?\u201d demanded Stryver, perceptibly crestfallen. \u201cWell! I--Were you going there now?\u201d asked Mr. Lorry. \u201cStraight!\u201d said Stryver, with a plump of his fist on the desk. \u201cThen I think I wouldn't, if I was you.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d said Stryver.", " He was so much too big for Tellson's, that old clerks in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance, as though he squeezed them against the wall. The House itself, magnificently reading the paper quite in the far-off perspective, lowered displeased, as if the Stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat. The discreet Mr. Lorry said, in a sample tone of the voice he would recommend under the circumstances, \u201cHow do you do, Mr. Stryver? How do you do, sir?\u201d and shook hands. There was a peculiarity in his manner of shaking hands, always to be seen in any clerk at Tellson's who shook hands with a customer when the House pervaded the air. He shook in a self-abnegating way, as one who shook for Tellson and Co. \u201cCan I do anything for you, Mr. Stryver?\u201d asked Mr. Lorry, in his business character. \u201cWhy, no, thank you; this is a private visit to yourself, Mr. Lorry; I have come for a private word.\u201d \u201cOh indeed!\u201d said Mr. Lorry, bending down his ear, while his eye strayed to the House afar off. \u201cI am going,\u201d said Mr. Stryver, leaning his arms confidentially on the desk: whereupon, although it was a large double one, there appeared to be not half desk enough for him: \u201cI am going to make an offer of myself in marriage to your agreeable little friend, Miss Manette, Mr. Lorry.\u201d \u201cOh dear me!\u201d cried Mr. Lorry, rubbing his chin, and looking at his visitor dubiously. \u201cOh dear me, sir?\u201d repeated Stryver, drawing back.", " \u201cNow, I'll put you in a corner,\u201d forensically shaking a forefinger at him. \u201cYou are a man of business and bound to have a reason. State your reason. Why wouldn't you go?\u201d \u201cBecause,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, \u201cI wouldn't go on such an object without having some cause to believe that I should succeed.\u201d \u201cD--n _me_!\u201d cried Stryver, \u201cbut this beats everything.\u201d Mr. Lorry glanced at the distant House, and glanced at the angry Stryver. \u201cHere's a man of business--a man of years--a man of experience--_in_ a Bank,\u201d said Stryver; \u201cand having summed up three leading reasons for complete success, he says there's no reason at all! Says it with his head on!\u201d Mr. Stryver remarked upon the peculiarity as if it would have been infinitely less remarkable if he had said it with his head off. \u201cWhen I speak of success, I speak of success with the young lady; and when I speak of causes and reasons to make success probable, I speak of causes and reasons that will tell as such with the young lady. The young lady, my good sir,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, mildly tapping the Stryver arm, \u201cthe young lady. The young lady goes before all.\u201d \u201cThen you mean to tell me, Mr. Lorry,\u201d said Stryver, squaring his elbows, \u201cthat it is your deliberate opinion that the young lady at present in question is a mincing Fool?\u201d \u201cNot exactly so. I mean to tell you, Mr. Stryver,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, reddening, \u201cthat I will hear no disrespectful word of that young lady from any lips; and that if I knew any man--which I hope I do not--whose taste was so coarse, and whose temper was so overbearing, that he could not restrain himself from speaking disrespectfully of that young lady at this desk, not even Tellson's should prevent my giving him a piece of my mind.\u201d The necessity of being angry in a suppressed tone had put Mr. Stryver's blood-vessels into a dangerous state when it was his turn to be angry; Mr. Lorry's veins, methodical as their courses could usually be, were in no better state now it was his turn."], "Who tells Lucie he loves her and would die for her?": [" I know, Doctor Manette--how can I fail to know--that, mingled with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman, there is, in her heart, towards you, all the love and reliance of infancy itself. I know that, as in her childhood she had no parent, so she is now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present years and character, united to the trustfulness and attachment of the early days in which you were lost to her. I know perfectly well that if you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life, you could hardly be invested, in her sight, with a more sacred character than that in which you are always with her. I know that when she is clinging to you, the hands of baby, girl, and woman, all in one, are round your neck. I know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her own age, sees and loves you at my age, loves her mother broken-hearted, loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration. I have known this, night and day, since I have known you in your home.\u201d Her father sat silent, with his face bent down. His breathing was a little quickened; but he repressed all other signs of agitation. \u201cDear Doctor Manette, always knowing this, always seeing her and you with this hallowed light about you, I have forborne, and forborne, as long as it was in the nature of man to do it. I have felt, and do even now feel, that to bring my love--even mine--between you, is to touch your history with something not quite so good as itself.", " A struggle was evidently in his face; a struggle with that occasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread. \u201cYou speak so feelingly and so manfully, Charles Darnay, that I thank you with all my heart, and will open all my heart--or nearly so. Have you any reason to believe that Lucie loves you?\u201d \u201cNone. As yet, none.\u201d \u201cIs it the immediate object of this confidence, that you may at once ascertain that, with my knowledge?\u201d \u201cNot even so. I might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks; I might (mistaken or not mistaken) have that hopefulness to-morrow.\u201d \u201cDo you seek any guidance from me?\u201d \u201cI ask none, sir. But I have thought it possible that you might have it in your power, if you should deem it right, to give me some.\u201d \u201cDo you seek any promise from me?\u201d \u201cI do seek that.\u201d \u201cWhat is it?\u201d \u201cI well understand that, without you, I could have no hope. I well understand that, even if Miss Manette held me at this moment in her innocent heart--do not think I have the presumption to assume so much--I could retain no place in it against her love for her father.\u201d \u201cIf that be so, do you see what, on the other hand, is involved in it?\u201d \u201cI understand equally well, that a word from her father in any suitor's favour, would outweigh herself and all the world. For which reason, Doctor Manette,\u201d said Darnay, modestly but firmly, \u201cI would not ask that word, to save my life.\u201d \u201cI am sure of it.", " until he absolutely wept with sentiment. During the whole of this scene, which lasted some three hours, he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company, and throughout Defarge held him by the collar, as if to restrain him from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to pieces. \u201cBravo!\u201d said Defarge, clapping him on the back when it was over, like a patron; \u201cyou are a good boy!\u201d The mender of roads was now coming to himself, and was mistrustful of having made a mistake in his late demonstrations; but no. \u201cYou are the fellow we want,\u201d said Defarge, in his ear; \u201cyou make these fools believe that it will last for ever. Then, they are the more insolent, and it is the nearer ended.\u201d \u201cHey!\u201d cried the mender of roads, reflectively; \u201cthat's true.\u201d \u201cThese fools know nothing. While they despise your breath, and would stop it for ever and ever, in you or in a hundred like you rather than in one of their own horses or dogs, they only know what your breath tells them. Let it deceive them, then, a little longer; it cannot deceive them too much.\u201d Madame Defarge looked superciliously at the client, and nodded in confirmation. \u201cAs to you,\u201d said she, \u201cyou would shout and shed tears for anything, if it made a show and a noise. Say! Would you not?\u201d \u201cTruly, madame, I think so. For the moment.\u201d \u201cIf you were shown a great heap of dolls, and were set upon them to pluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage, you would pick out the richest and gayest.", " Miss Lucie looks ill, Mr. Darnay has had a terrible day, we are worn out.\u201d \u201cSpeak for yourself, Mr. Lorry,\u201d said Stryver; \u201cI have a night's work to do yet. Speak for yourself.\u201d \u201cI speak for myself,\u201d answered Mr. Lorry, \u201cand for Mr. Darnay, and for Miss Lucie, and--Miss Lucie, do you not think I may speak for us all?\u201d He asked her the question pointedly, and with a glance at her father. His face had become frozen, as it were, in a very curious look at Darnay: an intent look, deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust, not even unmixed with fear. With this strange expression on him his thoughts had wandered away. \u201cMy father,\u201d said Lucie, softly laying her hand on his. He slowly shook the shadow off, and turned to her. \u201cShall we go home, my father?\u201d With a long breath, he answered \u201cYes.\u201d The friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the impression--which he himself had originated--that he would not be released that night. The lights were nearly all extinguished in the passages, the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle, and the dismal place was deserted until to-morrow morning's interest of gallows, pillory, whipping-post, and branding-iron, should repeople it. Walking between her father and Mr. Darnay, Lucie Manette passed into the open air. A hackney-coach was called, and the father and daughter departed in it. Mr. Stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back to the robing-room."], "What does Carton say about his life?": [" The prisoner was like a young child in his hands. \u201cCarton! Dear Carton! It is madness. It cannot be accomplished, it never can be done, it has been attempted, and has always failed. I implore you not to add your death to the bitterness of mine.\u201d \u201cDo I ask you, my dear Darnay, to pass the door? When I ask that, refuse. There are pen and ink and paper on this table. Is your hand steady enough to write?\u201d \u201cIt was when you came in.\u201d \u201cSteady it again, and write what I shall dictate. Quick, friend, quick!\u201d Pressing his hand to his bewildered head, Darnay sat down at the table. Carton, with his right hand in his breast, stood close beside him. \u201cWrite exactly as I speak.\u201d \u201cTo whom do I address it?\u201d \u201cTo no one.\u201d Carton still had his hand in his breast. \u201cDo I date it?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d The prisoner looked up, at each question. Carton, standing over him with his hand in his breast, looked down. \u201c'If you remember,'\u201d said Carton, dictating, \u201c'the words that passed between us, long ago, you will readily comprehend this when you see it. You do remember them, I know. It is not in your nature to forget them. '\u201d He was drawing his hand from his breast; the prisoner chancing to look up in his hurried wonder as he wrote, the hand stopped, closing upon something. \u201cHave you written 'forget them'?\u201d Carton asked. \u201cI have. Is that a weapon in your hand?\u201d \u201cNo; I am not armed.\u201d \u201cWhat is it in your hand?\u201d \u201cYou shall know directly.", " I have my Leave to Pass. I was ready to go.\u201d They were both silent. \u201cYours is a long life to look back upon, sir?\u201d said Carton, wistfully. \u201cI am in my seventy-eighth year.\u201d \u201cYou have been useful all your life; steadily and constantly occupied; trusted, respected, and looked up to?\u201d \u201cI have been a man of business, ever since I have been a man. Indeed, I may say that I was a man of business when a boy.\u201d \u201cSee what a place you fill at seventy-eight. How many people will miss you when you leave it empty!\u201d \u201cA solitary old bachelor,\u201d answered Mr. Lorry, shaking his head. \u201cThere is nobody to weep for me.\u201d \u201cHow can you say that? Wouldn't She weep for you? Wouldn't her child?\u201d \u201cYes, yes, thank God. I didn't quite mean what I said.\u201d \u201cIt _is_ a thing to thank God for; is it not?\u201d \u201cSurely, surely.\u201d \u201cIf you could say, with truth, to your own solitary heart, to-night, 'I have secured to myself the love and attachment, the gratitude or respect, of no human creature; I have won myself a tender place in no regard; I have done nothing good or serviceable to be remembered by!' your seventy-eight years would be seventy-eight heavy curses; would they not?\u201d \u201cYou say truly, Mr. Carton; I think they would be.\u201d Sydney turned his eyes again upon the fire, and, after a silence of a few moments, said: \u201cI should like to ask you:--Does your childhood seem far off? Do the days when you sat at your mother's knee, seem days of very long ago?\u201d Responding to his softened manner, Mr. Lorry answered: \u201cTwenty years back, yes; at this time of my life, no.", " Write on; there are but a few words more.\u201d He dictated again. \u201c'I am thankful that the time has come, when I can prove them. That I do so is no subject for regret or grief. '\u201d As he said these words with his eyes fixed on the writer, his hand slowly and softly moved down close to the writer's face. The pen dropped from Darnay's fingers on the table, and he looked about him vacantly. \u201cWhat vapour is that?\u201d he asked. \u201cVapour?\u201d \u201cSomething that crossed me?\u201d \u201cI am conscious of nothing; there can be nothing here. Take up the pen and finish. Hurry, hurry!\u201d As if his memory were impaired, or his faculties disordered, the prisoner made an effort to rally his attention. As he looked at Carton with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing, Carton--his hand again in his breast--looked steadily at him. \u201cHurry, hurry!\u201d The prisoner bent over the paper, once more. \u201c'If it had been otherwise;'\u201d Carton's hand was again watchfully and softly stealing down; \u201c'I never should have used the longer opportunity. If it had been otherwise;'\u201d the hand was at the prisoner's face; \u201c'I should but have had so much the more to answer for. If it had been otherwise--'\u201d Carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into unintelligible signs. Carton's hand moved back to his breast no more. The prisoner sprang up with a reproachful look, but Carton's hand was close and firm at his nostrils, and Carton's left arm caught him round the waist.", " Don't revive her to consciousness, while she only faints.\u201d \u201cOh, Carton, Carton, dear Carton!\u201d cried little Lucie, springing up and throwing her arms passionately round him, in a burst of grief. \u201cNow that you have come, I think you will do something to help mamma, something to save papa! O, look at her, dear Carton! Can you, of all the people who love her, bear to see her so?\u201d He bent over the child, and laid her blooming cheek against his face. He put her gently from him, and looked at her unconscious mother. \u201cBefore I go,\u201d he said, and paused--\u201cI may kiss her?\u201d It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face with his lips, he murmured some words. The child, who was nearest to him, told them afterwards, and told her grandchildren when she was a handsome old lady, that she heard him say, \u201cA life you love.\u201d When he had gone out into the next room, he turned suddenly on Mr. Lorry and her father, who were following, and said to the latter: \u201cYou had great influence but yesterday, Doctor Manette; let it at least be tried. These judges, and all the men in power, are very friendly to you, and very recognisant of your services; are they not?\u201d \u201cNothing connected with Charles was concealed from me. I had the strongest assurances that I should save him; and I did.\u201d He returned the answer in great trouble, and very slowly. \u201cTry them again. The hours between this and to-morrow afternoon are few and short, but try.\u201d \u201cI intend to try."], "Who is the dead man, Roger Cly?": [" \u201cLet us be reasonable,\u201d said the spy, \u201cand let us be fair. To show you how mistaken you are, and what an unfounded assumption yours is, I will lay before you a certificate of Cly's burial, which I happened to have carried in my pocket-book,\u201d with a hurried hand he produced and opened it, \u201cever since. There it is. Oh, look at it, look at it! You may take it in your hand; it's no forgery.\u201d Here, Mr. Lorry perceived the reflection on the wall to elongate, and Mr. Cruncher rose and stepped forward. His hair could not have been more violently on end, if it had been that moment dressed by the Cow with the crumpled horn in the house that Jack built. Unseen by the spy, Mr. Cruncher stood at his side, and touched him on the shoulder like a ghostly bailiff. \u201cThat there Roger Cly, master,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, with a taciturn and iron-bound visage. \u201cSo _you_ put him in his coffin?\u201d \u201cI did.\u201d \u201cWho took him out of it?\u201d Barsad leaned back in his chair, and stammered, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cI mean,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, \u201cthat he warn't never in it. No! Not he! I'll have my head took off, if he was ever in it.\u201d The spy looked round at the two gentlemen; they both looked in unspeakable astonishment at Jerry. \u201cI tell you,\u201d said Jerry, \u201cthat you buried paving-stones and earth in that there coffin. Don't go and tell me that you buried Cly. It was a take in. Me and two more knows it.\u201d \u201cHow do you know it?\u201d \u201cWhat's that to you?", " Naturally, therefore, a funeral with this uncommon attendance excited him greatly, and he asked of the first man who ran against him: \u201cWhat is it, brother? What's it about?\u201d \u201c_I_ don't know,\u201d said the man. \u201cSpies! Yaha! Tst! Spies!\u201d He asked another man. \u201cWho is it?\u201d \u201c_I_ don't know,\u201d returned the man, clapping his hands to his mouth nevertheless, and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the greatest ardour, \u201cSpies! Yaha! Tst, tst! Spi--ies!\u201d At length, a person better informed on the merits of the case, tumbled against him, and from this person he learned that the funeral was the funeral of one Roger Cly. \u201cWas he a spy?\u201d asked Mr. Cruncher. \u201cOld Bailey spy,\u201d returned his informant. \u201cYaha! Tst! Yah! Old Bailey Spi--i--ies!\u201d \u201cWhy, to be sure!\u201d exclaimed Jerry, recalling the Trial at which he had assisted. \u201cI've seen him. Dead, is he?\u201d \u201cDead as mutton,\u201d returned the other, \u201cand can't be too dead. Have 'em out, there! Spies! Pull 'em out, there! Spies!\u201d The idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea, that the crowd caught it up with eagerness, and loudly repeating the suggestion to have 'em out, and to pull 'em out, mobbed the two vehicles so closely that they came to a stop. On the crowd's opening the coach doors, the one mourner scuffled out by himself and was in their hands for a moment; but he was so alert, and made such good use of his time, that in another moment he was scouring away up a bye-street, after shedding his cloak, hat, long hatband, white pocket-handkerchief, and other symbolical tears.", " \u201cWell; he may be.\u201d \u201cIs, I assure you,\u201d said the spy; \u201cthough it's not important.\u201d \u201cThough it's not important,\u201d repeated Carton, in the same mechanical way--\u201cthough it's not important--No, it's not important. No. Yet I know the face.\u201d \u201cI think not. I am sure not. It can't be,\u201d said the spy. \u201cIt-can't-be,\u201d muttered Sydney Carton, retrospectively, and idling his glass (which fortunately was a small one) again. \u201cCan't-be. Spoke good French. Yet like a foreigner, I thought?\u201d \u201cProvincial,\u201d said the spy. \u201cNo. Foreign!\u201d cried Carton, striking his open hand on the table, as a light broke clearly on his mind. \u201cCly! Disguised, but the same man. We had that man before us at the Old Bailey.\u201d \u201cNow, there you are hasty, sir,\u201d said Barsad, with a smile that gave his aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side; \u201cthere you really give me an advantage over you. Cly (who I will unreservedly admit, at this distance of time, was a partner of mine) has been dead several years. I attended him in his last illness. He was buried in London, at the church of Saint Pancras-in-the-Fields. His unpopularity with the blackguard multitude at the moment prevented my following his remains, but I helped to lay him in his coffin.\u201d Here, Mr. Lorry became aware, from where he sat, of a most remarkable goblin shadow on the wall. Tracing it to its source, he discovered it to be caused by a sudden extraordinary rising and stiffening of all the risen and stiff hair on Mr. Cruncher's head.", " Thus, with beer-drinking, pipe-smoking, song-roaring, and infinite caricaturing of woe, the disorderly procession went its way, recruiting at every step, and all the shops shutting up before it. Its destination was the old church of Saint Pancras, far off in the fields. It got there in course of time; insisted on pouring into the burial-ground; finally, accomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way, and highly to its own satisfaction. The dead man disposed of, and the crowd being under the necessity of providing some other entertainment for itself, another brighter genius (or perhaps the same) conceived the humour of impeaching casual passers-by, as Old Bailey spies, and wreaking vengeance on them. Chase was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near the Old Bailey in their lives, in the realisation of this fancy, and they were roughly hustled and maltreated. The transition to the sport of window-breaking, and thence to the plundering of public-houses, was easy and natural. At last, after several hours, when sundry summer-houses had been pulled down, and some area-railings had been torn up, to arm the more belligerent spirits, a rumour got about that the Guards were coming. Before this rumour, the crowd gradually melted away, and perhaps the Guards came, and perhaps they never came, and this was the usual progress of a mob. Mr. Cruncher did not assist at the closing sports, but had remained behind in the churchyard, to confer and condole with the undertakers."], "What does Jerry Cruncher\u2019s son see his father do?": [" Young Jerry, walking with the stool under his arm at his father's side along sunny and crowded Fleet-street, was a very different Young Jerry from him of the previous night, running home through darkness and solitude from his grim pursuer. His cunning was fresh with the day, and his qualms were gone with the night--in which particulars it is not improbable that he had compeers in Fleet-street and the City of London, that fine morning. \u201cFather,\u201d said Young Jerry, as they walked along: taking care to keep at arm's length and to have the stool well between them: \u201cwhat's a Resurrection-Man?\u201d Mr. Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered, \u201cHow should I know?\u201d \u201cI thought you knowed everything, father,\u201d said the artless boy. \u201cHem! Well,\u201d returned Mr. Cruncher, going on again, and lifting off his hat to give his spikes free play, \u201che's a tradesman.\u201d \u201cWhat's his goods, father?\u201d asked the brisk Young Jerry. \u201cHis goods,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, after turning it over in his mind, \u201cis a branch of Scientific goods.\u201d \u201cPersons' bodies, ain't it, father?\u201d asked the lively boy. \u201cI believe it is something of that sort,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher. \u201cOh, father, I should so like to be a Resurrection-Man when I'm quite growed up!\u201d Mr. Cruncher was soothed, but shook his head in a dubious and moral way. \u201cIt depends upon how you dewelop your talents. Be careful to dewelop your talents, and never to say no more than you can help to nobody, and there's no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit for.\u201d As Young Jerry, thus encouraged, went on a few yards in advance, to plant the stool in the shadow of the Bar, Mr. Cruncher added to himself: \u201cJerry, you honest tradesman, there's hopes wot that boy will yet be a blessing to you, and a recompense to you for his mother!\u201d XV.", " \u201cI am saying nothing.\u201d \u201cWell, then; don't meditate nothing. You might as well flop as meditate. You may as well go again me one way as another. Drop it altogether.\u201d \u201cYes, Jerry.\u201d \u201cYes, Jerry,\u201d repeated Mr. Cruncher sitting down to tea. \u201cAh! It _is_ yes, Jerry. That's about it. You may say yes, Jerry.\u201d Mr. Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations, but made use of them, as people not unfrequently do, to express general ironical dissatisfaction. \u201cYou and your yes, Jerry,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, taking a bite out of his bread-and-butter, and seeming to help it down with a large invisible oyster out of his saucer. \u201cAh! I think so. I believe you.\u201d \u201cYou are going out to-night?\u201d asked his decent wife, when he took another bite. \u201cYes, I am.\u201d \u201cMay I go with you, father?\u201d asked his son, briskly. \u201cNo, you mayn't. I'm a going--as your mother knows--a fishing. That's where I'm going to. Going a fishing.\u201d \u201cYour fishing-rod gets rayther rusty; don't it, father?\u201d \u201cNever you mind.\u201d \u201cShall you bring any fish home, father?\u201d \u201cIf I don't, you'll have short commons, to-morrow,\u201d returned that gentleman, shaking his head; \u201cthat's questions enough for you; I ain't a going out, till you've been long abed.\u201d He devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a most vigilant watch on Mrs. Cruncher, and sullenly holding her in conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions to his disadvantage.", " The place had a soothing influence on him. He procured a pipe from a neighbouring public-house, and smoked it, looking in at the railings and maturely considering the spot. \u201cJerry,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, apostrophising himself in his usual way, \u201cyou see that there Cly that day, and you see with your own eyes that he was a young 'un and a straight made 'un.\u201d Having smoked his pipe out, and ruminated a little longer, he turned himself about, that he might appear, before the hour of closing, on his station at Tellson's. Whether his meditations on mortality had touched his liver, or whether his general health had been previously at all amiss, or whether he desired to show a little attention to an eminent man, is not so much to the purpose, as that he made a short call upon his medical adviser--a distinguished surgeon--on his way back. Young Jerry relieved his father with dutiful interest, and reported No job in his absence. The bank closed, the ancient clerks came out, the usual watch was set, and Mr. Cruncher and his son went home to tea. \u201cNow, I tell you where it is!\u201d said Mr. Cruncher to his wife, on entering. \u201cIf, as a honest tradesman, my wenturs goes wrong to-night, I shall make sure that you've been praying again me, and I shall work you for it just the same as if I seen you do it.\u201d The dejected Mrs. Cruncher shook her head. \u201cWhy, you're at it afore my face!\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, with signs of angry apprehension.", " It was an inconsistent and ubiquitous fiend too, for, while it was making the whole night behind him dreadful, he darted out into the roadway to avoid dark alleys, fearful of its coming hopping out of them like a dropsical boy's kite without tail and wings. It hid in doorways too, rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors, and drawing them up to its ears, as if it were laughing. It got into shadows on the road, and lay cunningly on its back to trip him up. All this time it was incessantly hopping on behind and gaining on him, so that when the boy got to his own door he had reason for being half dead. And even then it would not leave him, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every stair, scrambled into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on his breast when he fell asleep. From his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his closet was awakened after daybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his father in the family room. Something had gone wrong with him; at least, so Young Jerry inferred, from the circumstance of his holding Mrs. Cruncher by the ears, and knocking the back of her head against the head-board of the bed. \u201cI told you I would,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, \u201cand I did.\u201d \u201cJerry, Jerry, Jerry!\u201d his wife implored. \u201cYou oppose yourself to the profit of the business,\u201d said Jerry, \u201cand me and my partners suffer. You was to honour and obey; why the devil don't you?\u201d \u201cI try to be a good wife, Jerry,\u201d the poor woman protested, with tears."], "What does the mender of roads tell the Jacques about?": [" No white-haired man was there now; but, the three men were there who had gone out of the wine-shop singly. And between them and the white-haired man afar off, was the one small link, that they had once looked in at him through the chinks in the wall. Defarge closed the door carefully, and spoke in a subdued voice: \u201cJacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three! This is the witness encountered by appointment, by me, Jacques Four. He will tell you all. Speak, Jacques Five!\u201d The mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his swarthy forehead with it, and said, \u201cWhere shall I commence, monsieur?\u201d \u201cCommence,\u201d was Monsieur Defarge's not unreasonable reply, \u201cat the commencement.\u201d \u201cI saw him then, messieurs,\u201d began the mender of roads, \u201ca year ago this running summer, underneath the carriage of the Marquis, hanging by the chain. Behold the manner of it. I leaving my work on the road, the sun going to bed, the carriage of the Marquis slowly ascending the hill, he hanging by the chain--like this.\u201d Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in which he ought to have been perfect by that time, seeing that it had been the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village during a whole year. Jacques One struck in, and asked if he had ever seen the man before? \u201cNever,\u201d answered the mender of roads, recovering his perpendicular. Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then?", " \u201cNo dinner?\u201d \u201cNothing but supper now,\u201d said the mender of roads, with a hungry face. \u201cIt is the fashion,\u201d growled the man. \u201cI meet no dinner anywhere.\u201d He took out a blackened pipe, filled it, lighted it with flint and steel, pulled at it until it was in a bright glow: then, suddenly held it from him and dropped something into it from between his finger and thumb, that blazed and went out in a puff of smoke. \u201cTouch then.\u201d It was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this time, after observing these operations. They again joined hands. \u201cTo-night?\u201d said the mender of roads. \u201cTo-night,\u201d said the man, putting the pipe in his mouth. \u201cWhere?\u201d \u201cHere.\u201d He and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at one another, with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge of bayonets, until the sky began to clear over the village. \u201cShow me!\u201d said the traveller then, moving to the brow of the hill. \u201cSee!\u201d returned the mender of roads, with extended finger. \u201cYou go down here, and straight through the street, and past the fountain--\u201d \u201cTo the Devil with all that!\u201d interrupted the other, rolling his eye over the landscape. \u201c_I_ go through no streets and past no fountains. Well?\u201d \u201cWell! About two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the village.\u201d \u201cGood. When do you cease to work?\u201d \u201cAt sunset.\u201d \u201cWill you wake me, before departing? I have walked two nights without resting.", " Except one man, who got up and went out. \u201cMy wife,\u201d said Defarge aloud, addressing Madame Defarge: \u201cI have travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads, called Jacques. I met him--by accident--a day and half's journey out of Paris. He is a good child, this mender of roads, called Jacques. Give him to drink, my wife!\u201d A second man got up and went out. Madame Defarge set wine before the mender of roads called Jacques, who doffed his blue cap to the company, and drank. In the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark bread; he ate of this between whiles, and sat munching and drinking near Madame Defarge's counter. A third man got up and went out. Defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine--but, he took less than was given to the stranger, as being himself a man to whom it was no rarity--and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast. He looked at no one present, and no one now looked at him; not even Madame Defarge, who had taken up her knitting, and was at work. \u201cHave you finished your repast, friend?\u201d he asked, in due season. \u201cYes, thank you.\u201d \u201cCome, then! You shall see the apartment that I told you you could occupy. It will suit you to a marvel.\u201d Out of the wine-shop into the street, out of the street into a courtyard, out of the courtyard up a steep staircase, out of the staircase into a garret--formerly the garret where a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes.", " No. The change consisted in the appearance of strange faces of low caste, rather than in the disappearance of the high caste, chiselled, and otherwise beautified and beautifying features of Monseigneur. For, in these times, as the mender of roads worked, solitary, in the dust, not often troubling himself to reflect that dust he was and to dust he must return, being for the most part too much occupied in thinking how little he had for supper and how much more he would eat if he had it--in these times, as he raised his eyes from his lonely labour, and viewed the prospect, he would see some rough figure approaching on foot, the like of which was once a rarity in those parts, but was now a frequent presence. As it advanced, the mender of roads would discern without surprise, that it was a shaggy-haired man, of almost barbarian aspect, tall, in wooden shoes that were clumsy even to the eyes of a mender of roads, grim, rough, swart, steeped in the mud and dust of many highways, dank with the marshy moisture of many low grounds, sprinkled with the thorns and leaves and moss of many byways through woods. Such a man came upon him, like a ghost, at noon in the July weather, as he sat on his heap of stones under a bank, taking such shelter as he could get from a shower of hail. The man looked at him, looked at the village in the hollow, at the mill, and at the prison on the crag. When he had identified these objects in what benighted mind he had, he said, in a dialect that was just intelligible: \u201cHow goes it, Jacques?\u201d \u201cAll well, Jacques.\u201d \u201cTouch then!\u201d They joined hands, and the man sat down on the heap of stones."], "What is Madame Defarge knitting?": [" \u201cIs that his child?\u201d said Madame Defarge, stopping in her work for the first time, and pointing her knitting-needle at little Lucie as if it were the finger of Fate. \u201cYes, madame,\u201d answered Mr. Lorry; \u201cthis is our poor prisoner's darling daughter, and only child.\u201d The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed to fall so threatening and dark on the child, that her mother instinctively kneeled on the ground beside her, and held her to her breast. The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to fall, threatening and dark, on both the mother and the child. \u201cIt is enough, my husband,\u201d said Madame Defarge. \u201cI have seen them. We may go.\u201d But, the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it--not visible and presented, but indistinct and withheld--to alarm Lucie into saying, as she laid her appealing hand on Madame Defarge's dress: \u201cYou will be good to my poor husband. You will do him no harm. You will help me to see him if you can?\u201d \u201cYour husband is not my business here,\u201d returned Madame Defarge, looking down at her with perfect composure. \u201cIt is the daughter of your father who is my business here.\u201d \u201cFor my sake, then, be merciful to my husband. For my child's sake! She will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful. We are more afraid of you than of these others.\u201d Madame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her husband. Defarge, who had been uneasily biting his thumb-nail and looking at her, collected his face into a sterner expression.", " Good day, one and all!\u201d \u201cHave the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a mouthful of cool fresh water, madame.\u201d Madame complied with a polite air. \u201cMarvellous cognac this, madame!\u201d It was the first time it had ever been so complimented, and Madame Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better. She said, however, that the cognac was flattered, and took up her knitting. The visitor watched her fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity of observing the place in general. \u201cYou knit with great skill, madame.\u201d \u201cI am accustomed to it.\u201d \u201cA pretty pattern too!\u201d \u201c_You_ think so?\u201d said madame, looking at him with a smile. \u201cDecidedly. May one ask what it is for?\u201d \u201cPastime,\u201d said madame, still looking at him with a smile while her fingers moved nimbly. \u201cNot for use?\u201d \u201cThat depends. I may find a use for it one day. If I do--Well,\u201d said madame, drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of coquetry, \u201cI'll use it!\u201d It was remarkable; but, the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge. Two men had entered separately, and had been about to order drink, when, catching sight of that novelty, they faltered, made a pretence of looking about as if for some friend who was not there, and went away. Nor, of those who had been there when this visitor entered, was there one left. They had all dropped off.", " This was a courage that Madame Defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness. \u201cHa, ha!\u201d she laughed, \u201cyou poor wretch! What are you worth! I address myself to that Doctor.\u201d Then she raised her voice and called out, \u201cCitizen Doctor! Wife of Evremonde! Child of Evremonde! Any person but this miserable fool, answer the Citizeness Defarge!\u201d Perhaps the following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in the expression of Miss Pross's face, perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from either suggestion, whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone. Three of the doors she opened swiftly, and looked in. \u201cThose rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing, there are odds and ends upon the ground. There is no one in that room behind you! Let me look.\u201d \u201cNever!\u201d said Miss Pross, who understood the request as perfectly as Madame Defarge understood the answer. \u201cIf they are not in that room, they are gone, and can be pursued and brought back,\u201d said Madame Defarge to herself. \u201cAs long as you don't know whether they are in that room or not, you are uncertain what to do,\u201d said Miss Pross to herself; \u201cand you shall not know that, if I can prevent your knowing it; and know that, or not know that, you shall not leave here while I can hold you.\u201d \u201cI have been in the streets from the first, nothing has stopped me, I will tear you to pieces, but I will have you from that door,\u201d said Madame Defarge.", " She stopped in the act of putting the note in her bosom, and, with her hands yet at her neck, looked terrified at Madame Defarge. Madame Defarge met the lifted eyebrows and forehead with a cold, impassive stare. \u201cMy dear,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, striking in to explain; \u201cthere are frequent risings in the streets; and, although it is not likely they will ever trouble you, Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power to protect at such times, to the end that she may know them--that she may identify them. I believe,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, rather halting in his reassuring words, as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself upon him more and more, \u201cI state the case, Citizen Defarge?\u201d Defarge looked gloomily at his wife, and gave no other answer than a gruff sound of acquiescence. \u201cYou had better, Lucie,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, doing all he could to propitiate, by tone and manner, \u201chave the dear child here, and our good Pross. Our good Pross, Defarge, is an English lady, and knows no French.\u201d The lady in question, whose rooted conviction that she was more than a match for any foreigner, was not to be shaken by distress and, danger, appeared with folded arms, and observed in English to The Vengeance, whom her eyes first encountered, \u201cWell, I am sure, Boldface! I hope _you_ are pretty well!\u201d She also bestowed a British cough on Madame Defarge; but, neither of the two took much heed of her."], "Whose name is added to the registry after the spy Barsad\u2019s visit to the wine shop?": [" I wish you had a better employed brother than Mr. Barsad. I wish for your sake Mr. Barsad was not a Sheep of the Prisons.\u201d Sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy, under the gaolers. The spy, who was pale, turned paler, and asked him how he dared-- \u201cI'll tell you,\u201d said Sydney. \u201cI lighted on you, Mr. Barsad, coming out of the prison of the Conciergerie while I was contemplating the walls, an hour or more ago. You have a face to be remembered, and I remember faces well. Made curious by seeing you in that connection, and having a reason, to which you are no stranger, for associating you with the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate, I walked in your direction. I walked into the wine-shop here, close after you, and sat near you. I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved conversation, and the rumour openly going about among your admirers, the nature of your calling. And gradually, what I had done at random, seemed to shape itself into a purpose, Mr. Barsad.\u201d \u201cWhat purpose?\u201d the spy asked. \u201cIt would be troublesome, and might be dangerous, to explain in the street. Could you favour me, in confidence, with some minutes of your company--at the office of Tellson's Bank, for instance?\u201d \u201cUnder a threat?\u201d \u201cOh! Did I say that?\u201d \u201cThen, why should I go there?\u201d \u201cReally, Mr. Barsad, I can't say, if you can't.\u201d \u201cDo you mean that you won't say, sir?\u201d the spy irresolutely asked.", " That's a card not to be beaten. Have you followed my hand, Mr. Barsad?\u201d \u201cNot to understand your play,\u201d returned the spy, somewhat uneasily. \u201cI play my Ace, Denunciation of Mr. Barsad to the nearest Section Committee. Look over your hand, Mr. Barsad, and see what you have. Don't hurry.\u201d He drew the bottle near, poured out another glassful of brandy, and drank it off. He saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him. Seeing it, he poured out and drank another glassful. \u201cLook over your hand carefully, Mr. Barsad. Take time.\u201d It was a poorer hand than he suspected. Mr. Barsad saw losing cards in it that Sydney Carton knew nothing of. Thrown out of his honourable employment in England, through too much unsuccessful hard swearing there--not because he was not wanted there; our English reasons for vaunting our superiority to secrecy and spies are of very modern date--he knew that he had crossed the Channel, and accepted service in France: first, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among his own countrymen there: gradually, as a tempter and an eavesdropper among the natives. He knew that under the overthrown government he had been a spy upon Saint Antoine and Defarge's wine-shop; had received from the watchful police such heads of information concerning Doctor Manette's imprisonment, release, and history, as should serve him for an introduction to familiar conversation with the Defarges; and tried them on Madame Defarge, and had broken down with them signally.", " Come, now. Business, business!\u201d They went up slowly and softly. The staircase was short, and they were soon at the top. There, as it had an abrupt turn in it, they came all at once in sight of three men, whose heads were bent down close together at the side of a door, and who were intently looking into the room to which the door belonged, through some chinks or holes in the wall. On hearing footsteps close at hand, these three turned, and rose, and showed themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the wine-shop. \u201cI forgot them in the surprise of your visit,\u201d explained Monsieur Defarge. \u201cLeave us, good boys; we have business here.\u201d The three glided by, and went silently down. There appearing to be no other door on that floor, and the keeper of the wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone, Mr. Lorry asked him in a whisper, with a little anger: \u201cDo you make a show of Monsieur Manette?\u201d \u201cI show him, in the way you have seen, to a chosen few.\u201d \u201cIs that well?\u201d \u201c_I_ think it is well.\u201d \u201cWho are the few? How do you choose them?\u201d \u201cI choose them as real men, of my name--Jacques is my name--to whom the sight is likely to do good. Enough; you are English; that is another thing. Stay there, if you please, a little moment.\u201d With an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he stooped, and looked in through the crevice in the wall. Soon raising his head again, he struck twice or thrice upon the door--evidently with no other object than to make a noise there.", " They left her at the corner of the street, and Carton led the way to Mr. Lorry's, which was within a few minutes' walk. John Barsad, or Solomon Pross, walked at his side. Mr. Lorry had just finished his dinner, and was sitting before a cheery little log or two of fire--perhaps looking into their blaze for the picture of that younger elderly gentleman from Tellson's, who had looked into the red coals at the Royal George at Dover, now a good many years ago. He turned his head as they entered, and showed the surprise with which he saw a stranger. \u201cMiss Pross's brother, sir,\u201d said Sydney. \u201cMr. Barsad.\u201d \u201cBarsad?\u201d repeated the old gentleman, \u201cBarsad? I have an association with the name--and with the face.\u201d \u201cI told you you had a remarkable face, Mr. Barsad,\u201d observed Carton, coolly. \u201cPray sit down.\u201d As he took a chair himself, he supplied the link that Mr. Lorry wanted, by saying to him with a frown, \u201cWitness at that trial.\u201d Mr. Lorry immediately remembered, and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised look of abhorrence. \u201cMr. Barsad has been recognised by Miss Pross as the affectionate brother you have heard of,\u201d said Sydney, \u201cand has acknowledged the relationship. I pass to worse news. Darnay has been arrested again.\u201d Struck with consternation, the old gentleman exclaimed, \u201cWhat do you tell me! I left him safe and free within these two hours, and am about to return to him!\u201d \u201cArrested for all that."], "What do Lucie and Darnay do?": [" Miss Lucie looks ill, Mr. Darnay has had a terrible day, we are worn out.\u201d \u201cSpeak for yourself, Mr. Lorry,\u201d said Stryver; \u201cI have a night's work to do yet. Speak for yourself.\u201d \u201cI speak for myself,\u201d answered Mr. Lorry, \u201cand for Mr. Darnay, and for Miss Lucie, and--Miss Lucie, do you not think I may speak for us all?\u201d He asked her the question pointedly, and with a glance at her father. His face had become frozen, as it were, in a very curious look at Darnay: an intent look, deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust, not even unmixed with fear. With this strange expression on him his thoughts had wandered away. \u201cMy father,\u201d said Lucie, softly laying her hand on his. He slowly shook the shadow off, and turned to her. \u201cShall we go home, my father?\u201d With a long breath, he answered \u201cYes.\u201d The friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the impression--which he himself had originated--that he would not be released that night. The lights were nearly all extinguished in the passages, the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle, and the dismal place was deserted until to-morrow morning's interest of gallows, pillory, whipping-post, and branding-iron, should repeople it. Walking between her father and Mr. Darnay, Lucie Manette passed into the open air. A hackney-coach was called, and the father and daughter departed in it. Mr. Stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back to the robing-room.", " How does it feel? Is it worth being tried for one's life, to be the object of such sympathy and compassion, Mr. Darnay?\u201d Again Darnay answered not a word. \u201cShe was mightily pleased to have your message, when I gave it her. Not that she showed she was pleased, but I suppose she was.\u201d The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this disagreeable companion had, of his own free will, assisted him in the strait of the day. He turned the dialogue to that point, and thanked him for it. \u201cI neither want any thanks, nor merit any,\u201d was the careless rejoinder. \u201cIt was nothing to do, in the first place; and I don't know why I did it, in the second. Mr. Darnay, let me ask you a question.\u201d \u201cWillingly, and a small return for your good offices.\u201d \u201cDo you think I particularly like you?\u201d \u201cReally, Mr. Carton,\u201d returned the other, oddly disconcerted, \u201cI have not asked myself the question.\u201d \u201cBut ask yourself the question now.\u201d \u201cYou have acted as if you do; but I don't think you do.\u201d \u201c_I_ don't think I do,\u201d said Carton. \u201cI begin to have a very good opinion of your understanding.\u201d \u201cNevertheless,\u201d pursued Darnay, rising to ring the bell, \u201cthere is nothing in that, I hope, to prevent my calling the reckoning, and our parting without ill-blood on either side.\u201d Carton rejoining, \u201cNothing in life!\u201d Darnay rang. \u201cDo you call the whole reckoning?\u201d said Carton. On his answering in the affirmative, \u201cThen bring me another pint of this same wine, drawer, and come and wake me at ten.\u201d The bill being paid, Charles Darnay rose and wished him good night.", " You have loved yourself; let your old love speak for me!\u201d The Doctor sat with his face turned away, and his eyes bent on the ground. At the last words, he stretched out his hand again, hurriedly, and cried: \u201cNot that, sir! Let that be! I adjure you, do not recall that!\u201d His cry was so like a cry of actual pain, that it rang in Charles Darnay's ears long after he had ceased. He motioned with the hand he had extended, and it seemed to be an appeal to Darnay to pause. The latter so received it, and remained silent. \u201cI ask your pardon,\u201d said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, after some moments. \u201cI do not doubt your loving Lucie; you may be satisfied of it.\u201d He turned towards him in his chair, but did not look at him, or raise his eyes. His chin dropped upon his hand, and his white hair overshadowed his face: \u201cHave you spoken to Lucie?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cNor written?\u201d \u201cNever.\u201d \u201cIt would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self-denial is to be referred to your consideration for her father. Her father thanks you.\u201d He offered his hand; but his eyes did not go with it. \u201cI know,\u201d said Darnay, respectfully, \u201chow can I fail to know, Doctor Manette, I who have seen you together from day to day, that between you and Miss Manette there is an affection so unusual, so touching, so belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured, that it can have few parallels, even in the tenderness between a father and child.", " He walked to and fro, with thoughts very busy, until it was time to return to Tellson's and take leave of Mr. Lorry. As soon as he arrived in Paris he would present himself to this old friend, but he must say nothing of his intention now. A carriage with post-horses was ready at the Bank door, and Jerry was booted and equipped. \u201cI have delivered that letter,\u201d said Charles Darnay to Mr. Lorry. \u201cI would not consent to your being charged with any written answer, but perhaps you will take a verbal one?\u201d \u201cThat I will, and readily,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, \u201cif it is not dangerous.\u201d \u201cNot at all. Though it is to a prisoner in the Abbaye.\u201d \u201cWhat is his name?\u201d said Mr. Lorry, with his open pocket-book in his hand. \u201cGabelle.\u201d \u201cGabelle. And what is the message to the unfortunate Gabelle in prison?\u201d \u201cSimply, 'that he has received the letter, and will come. '\u201d \u201cAny time mentioned?\u201d \u201cHe will start upon his journey to-morrow night.\u201d \u201cAny person mentioned?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d He helped Mr. Lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks, and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old Bank, into the misty air of Fleet-street. \u201cMy love to Lucie, and to little Lucie,\u201d said Mr. Lorry at parting, \u201cand take precious care of them till I come back.\u201d Charles Darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled, as the carriage rolled away. That night--it was the fourteenth of August--he sat up late, and wrote two fervent letters; one was to Lucie, explaining the strong obligation he was under to go to Paris, and showing her, at length, the reasons that he had, for feeling confident that he could become involved in no personal danger there; the other was to the Doctor, confiding Lucie and their dear child to his care, and dwelling on the same topics with the strongest assurances."], "What happens to Doctor Manette because of his talk with Darnay?": [" If she should ever tell me that you are essential to her perfect happiness, I will give her to you. If there were--Charles Darnay, if there were--\u201d The young man had taken his hand gratefully; their hands were joined as the Doctor spoke: \u201c--any fancies, any reasons, any apprehensions, anything whatsoever, new or old, against the man she really loved--the direct responsibility thereof not lying on his head--they should all be obliterated for her sake. She is everything to me; more to me than suffering, more to me than wrong, more to me--Well! This is idle talk.\u201d So strange was the way in which he faded into silence, and so strange his fixed look when he had ceased to speak, that Darnay felt his own hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it. \u201cYou said something to me,\u201d said Doctor Manette, breaking into a smile. \u201cWhat was it you said to me?\u201d He was at a loss how to answer, until he remembered having spoken of a condition. Relieved as his mind reverted to that, he answered: \u201cYour confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my part. My present name, though but slightly changed from my mother's, is not, as you will remember, my own. I wish to tell you what that is, and why I am in England.\u201d \u201cStop!\u201d said the Doctor of Beauvais. \u201cI wish it, that I may the better deserve your confidence, and have no secret from you.\u201d \u201cStop!\u201d For an instant, the Doctor even had his two hands at his ears; for another instant, even had his two hands laid on Darnay's lips.", " \u201cYes?\u201d said the Doctor, with evident constraint. \u201cBring your chair here, and speak on.\u201d He complied as to the chair, but appeared to find the speaking on less easy. \u201cI have had the happiness, Doctor Manette, of being so intimate here,\u201d so he at length began, \u201cfor some year and a half, that I hope the topic on which I am about to touch may not--\u201d He was stayed by the Doctor's putting out his hand to stop him. When he had kept it so a little while, he said, drawing it back: \u201cIs Lucie the topic?\u201d \u201cShe is.\u201d \u201cIt is hard for me to speak of her at any time. It is very hard for me to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours, Charles Darnay.\u201d \u201cIt is a tone of fervent admiration, true homage, and deep love, Doctor Manette!\u201d he said deferentially. There was another blank silence before her father rejoined: \u201cI believe it. I do you justice; I believe it.\u201d His constraint was so manifest, and it was so manifest, too, that it originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject, that Charles Darnay hesitated. \u201cShall I go on, sir?\u201d Another blank. \u201cYes, go on.\u201d \u201cYou anticipate what I would say, though you cannot know how earnestly I say it, how earnestly I feel it, without knowing my secret heart, and the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been laden. Dear Doctor Manette, I love your daughter fondly, dearly, disinterestedly, devotedly. If ever there were love in the world, I love her.", " You have loved yourself; let your old love speak for me!\u201d The Doctor sat with his face turned away, and his eyes bent on the ground. At the last words, he stretched out his hand again, hurriedly, and cried: \u201cNot that, sir! Let that be! I adjure you, do not recall that!\u201d His cry was so like a cry of actual pain, that it rang in Charles Darnay's ears long after he had ceased.

Among the talkers, was Stryver, of the King's Bench Bar, far on his way to state promotion, and, therefore, loud on the theme: broaching to Monseigneur, his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating them from the face of the earth, and doing without them: and for accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race. Him, Darnay heard with a particular feeling of objection; and Darnay stood divided between going away that he might hear no more, and remaining to interpose his word, when the thing that was to be, went on to shape itself out. The House approached Mr. Lorry, and laying a soiled and unopened letter before him, asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to whom it was addressed? The House laid the letter down so close to Darnay that he saw the direction--the more quickly because it was his own right name. The address, turned into English, ran: \u201cVery pressing. To Monsieur heretofore the Marquis St. Evremonde, of France. Confided to the cares of Messrs. Tellson and Co., Bankers, London, England.\u201d On the marriage morning, Doctor Manette had made it his one urgent and express request to Charles Darnay, that the secret of this name should be--unless he, the Doctor, dissolved the obligation--kept inviolate between them."], "What do Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross get Doctor Manette to agree to when he recovers?": [" \u201cI wonder,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, pausing in his looking about, \u201cthat he keeps that reminder of his sufferings about him!\u201d \u201cAnd why wonder at that?\u201d was the abrupt inquiry that made him start. It proceeded from Miss Pross, the wild red woman, strong of hand, whose acquaintance he had first made at the Royal George Hotel at Dover, and had since improved. \u201cI should have thought--\u201d Mr. Lorry began. \u201cPooh! You'd have thought!\u201d said Miss Pross; and Mr. Lorry left off. \u201cHow do you do?\u201d inquired that lady then--sharply, and yet as if to express that she bore him no malice. \u201cI am pretty well, I thank you,\u201d answered Mr. Lorry, with meekness; \u201chow are you?\u201d \u201cNothing to boast of,\u201d said Miss Pross. \u201cIndeed?\u201d \u201cAh! indeed!\u201d said Miss Pross. \u201cI am very much put out about my Ladybird.\u201d \u201cIndeed?\u201d \u201cFor gracious sake say something else besides 'indeed,' or you'll fidget me to death,\u201d said Miss Pross: whose character (dissociated from stature) was shortness. \u201cReally, then?\u201d said Mr. Lorry, as an amendment. \u201cReally, is bad enough,\u201d returned Miss Pross, \u201cbut better. Yes, I am very much put out.\u201d \u201cMay I ask the cause?\u201d \u201cI don't want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of Ladybird, to come here looking after her,\u201d said Miss Pross. \u201c_Do_ dozens come for that purpose?\u201d \u201cHundreds,\u201d said Miss Pross. It was characteristic of this lady (as of some other people before her time and since) that whenever her original proposition was questioned, she exaggerated it.", " \u201cAnd so,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, who could not sufficiently admire the bride, and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet, pretty dress; \u201cand so it was for this, my sweet Lucie, that I brought you across the Channel, such a baby! Lord bless me! How little I thought what I was doing! How lightly I valued the obligation I was conferring on my friend Mr. Charles!\u201d \u201cYou didn't mean it,\u201d remarked the matter-of-fact Miss Pross, \u201cand therefore how could you know it? Nonsense!\u201d \u201cReally? Well; but don't cry,\u201d said the gentle Mr. Lorry. \u201cI am not crying,\u201d said Miss Pross; \u201c_you_ are.\u201d \u201cI, my Pross?\u201d (By this time, Mr. Lorry dared to be pleasant with her, on occasion.) \u201cYou were, just now; I saw you do it, and I don't wonder at it. Such a present of plate as you have made 'em, is enough to bring tears into anybody's eyes. There's not a fork or a spoon in the collection,\u201d said Miss Pross, \u201cthat I didn't cry over, last night after the box came, till I couldn't see it.\u201d \u201cI am highly gratified,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, \u201cthough, upon my honour, I had no intention of rendering those trifling articles of remembrance invisible to any one. Dear me! This is an occasion that makes a man speculate on all he has lost. Dear, dear, dear! To think that there might have been a Mrs. Lorry, any time these fifty years almost!\u201d \u201cNot at all!\u201d From Miss Pross. \u201cYou think there never might have been a Mrs. Lorry?\u201d asked the gentleman of that name.", " \u201cYou might, from your appearance, be the wife of Lucifer,\u201d said Miss Pross, in her breathing. \u201cNevertheless, you shall not get the better of me. I am an Englishwoman.\u201d Madame Defarge looked at her scornfully, but still with something of Miss Pross's own perception that they two were at bay. She saw a tight, hard, wiry woman before her, as Mr. Lorry had seen in the same figure a woman with a strong hand, in the years gone by. She knew full well that Miss Pross was the family's devoted friend; Miss Pross knew full well that Madame Defarge was the family's malevolent enemy. \u201cOn my way yonder,\u201d said Madame Defarge, with a slight movement of her hand towards the fatal spot, \u201cwhere they reserve my chair and my knitting for me, I am come to make my compliments to her in passing.

Let me see her. Go tell her that I wish to see her. Do you hear?\u201d \u201cIf those eyes of yours were bed-winches,\u201d returned Miss Pross, \u201cand I was an English four-poster, they shouldn't loose a splinter of me.", " Mr. Cruncher, with some diffidence, explained himself as meaning \u201cOld Nick's.\u201d \u201cHa!\u201d said Miss Pross, \u201cit doesn't need an interpreter to explain the meaning of these creatures. They have but one, and it's Midnight Murder, and Mischief.\u201d \u201cHush, dear! Pray, pray, be cautious!\u201d cried Lucie. \u201cYes, yes, yes, I'll be cautious,\u201d said Miss Pross; \u201cbut I may say among ourselves, that I do hope there will be no oniony and tobaccoey smotherings in the form of embracings all round, going on in the streets. Now, Ladybird, never you stir from that fire till I come back! Take care of the dear husband you have recovered, and don't move your pretty head from his shoulder as you have it now, till you see me again! May I ask a question, Doctor Manette, before I go?\u201d \u201cI think you may take that liberty,\u201d the Doctor answered, smiling. \u201cFor gracious sake, don't talk about Liberty; we have quite enough of that,\u201d said Miss Pross. \u201cHush, dear! Again?\u201d Lucie remonstrated. \u201cWell, my sweet,\u201d said Miss Pross, nodding her head emphatically, \u201cthe short and the long of it is, that I am a subject of His Most Gracious Majesty King George the Third;\u201d Miss Pross curtseyed at the name; \u201cand as such, my maxim is, Confound their politics, Frustrate their knavish tricks, On him our hopes we fix, God save the King!\u201d Mr. Cruncher, in an access of loyalty, growlingly repeated the words after Miss Pross, like somebody at church."], "What do Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross tell Lucy about her father\u2019s relapse?": [" \u201cI wonder,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, pausing in his looking about, \u201cthat he keeps that reminder of his sufferings about him!\u201d \u201cAnd why wonder at that?\u201d was the abrupt inquiry that made him start.

Is your hand steady enough to write?\u201d \u201cIt was when you came in.\u201d \u201cSteady it again, and write what I shall dictate. Quick, friend, quick!\u201d Pressing his hand to his bewildered head, Darnay sat down at the table. Carton, with his right hand in his breast, stood close beside him. \u201cWrite exactly as I speak.\u201d \u201cTo whom do I address it?\u201d \u201cTo no one.\u201d Carton still had his hand in his breast. \u201cDo I date it?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d The prisoner looked up, at each question. Carton, standing over him with his hand in his breast, looked down. \u201c'If you remember,'\u201d said Carton, dictating, \u201c'the words that passed between us, long ago, you will readily comprehend this when you see it. You do remember them, I know. It is not in your nature to forget them. '\u201d He was drawing his hand from his breast; the prisoner chancing to look up in his hurried wonder as he wrote, the hand stopped, closing upon something. \u201cHave you written 'forget them'?\u201d Carton asked. \u201cI have. Is that a weapon in your hand?\u201d \u201cNo; I am not armed.\u201d \u201cWhat is it in your hand?\u201d \u201cYou shall know directly.", " Write on; there are but a few words more.\u201d He dictated again. \u201c'I am thankful that the time has come, when I can prove them. That I do so is no subject for regret or grief. '\u201d As he said these words with his eyes fixed on the writer, his hand slowly and softly moved down close to the writer's face. The pen dropped from Darnay's fingers on the table, and he looked about him vacantly. \u201cWhat vapour is that?\u201d he asked. \u201cVapour?\u201d \u201cSomething that crossed me?\u201d \u201cI am conscious of nothing; there can be nothing here. Take up the pen and finish. Hurry, hurry!\u201d As if his memory were impaired, or his faculties disordered, the prisoner made an effort to rally his attention. As he looked at Carton with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing, Carton--his hand again in his breast--looked steadily at him. \u201cHurry, hurry!\u201d The prisoner bent over the paper, once more. \u201c'If it had been otherwise;'\u201d Carton's hand was again watchfully and softly stealing down; \u201c'I never should have used the longer opportunity. If it had been otherwise;'\u201d the hand was at the prisoner's face; \u201c'I should but have had so much the more to answer for. If it had been otherwise--'\u201d Carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into unintelligible signs. Carton's hand moved back to his breast no more. The prisoner sprang up with a reproachful look, but Carton's hand was close and firm at his nostrils, and Carton's left arm caught him round the waist.", " \u201cYou are a good man and a true friend,\u201d said Carton, in an altered voice. \u201cForgive me if I notice that you are affected. I could not see my father weep, and sit by, careless. And I could not respect your sorrow more, if you were my father. You are free from that misfortune, however.\u201d Though he said the last words, with a slip into his usual manner, there was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch, that Mr. Lorry, who had never seen the better side of him, was wholly unprepared for. He gave him his hand, and Carton gently pressed it. \u201cTo return to poor Darnay,\u201d said Carton. \u201cDon't tell Her of this interview, or this arrangement. It would not enable Her to go to see him. She might think it was contrived, in case of the worse, to convey to him the means of anticipating the sentence.\u201d Mr. Lorry had not thought of that, and he looked quickly at Carton to see if it were in his mind. It seemed to be; he returned the look, and evidently understood it. \u201cShe might think a thousand things,\u201d Carton said, \u201cand any of them would only add to her trouble. Don't speak of me to her. As I said to you when I first came, I had better not see her. I can put my hand out, to do any little helpful work for her that my hand can find to do, without that. You are going to her, I hope? She must be very desolate to-night.\u201d \u201cI am going now, directly.\u201d \u201cI am glad of that. She has such a strong attachment to you and reliance on you."], "Whom do the villagers hang?": [" Now, a judicious selection from these with the least possible delay, and the burying of them, or otherwise getting of them out of harm's way, is within the power (without loss of precious time) of scarcely any one but myself, if any one. And shall I hang back, when Tellson's knows this and says this--Tellson's, whose bread I have eaten these sixty years--because I am a little stiff about the joints? Why, I am a boy, sir, to half a dozen old codgers here!\u201d \u201cHow I admire the gallantry of your youthful spirit, Mr. Lorry.\u201d \u201cTut! Nonsense, sir!--And, my dear Charles,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, glancing at the House again, \u201cyou are to remember, that getting things out of Paris at this present time, no matter what things, is next to an impossibility. Papers and precious matters were this very day brought to us here (I speak in strict confidence; it is not business-like to whisper it, even to you), by the strangest bearers you can imagine, every one of whom had his head hanging on by a single hair as he passed the Barriers. At another time, our parcels would come and go, as easily as in business-like Old England; but now, everything is stopped.\u201d \u201cAnd do you really go to-night?\u201d \u201cI really go to-night, for the case has become too pressing to admit of delay.\u201d \u201cAnd do you take no one with you?\u201d \u201cAll sorts of people have been proposed to me, but I will have nothing to say to any of them. I intend to take Jerry.", " A trying suspense, to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of the black ocean, ready to take that plunge into it upon which Monsieur Gabelle had resolved! But, the friendly dawn appearing at last, and the rush-candles of the village guttering out, the people happily dispersed, and Monsieur Gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that while. Within a hundred miles, and in the light of other fires, there were other functionaries less fortunate, that night and other nights, whom the rising sun found hanging across once-peaceful streets, where they had been born and bred; also, there were other villagers and townspeople less fortunate than the mender of roads and his fellows, upon whom the functionaries and soldiery turned with success, and whom they strung up in their turn. But, the fierce figures were steadily wending East, West, North, and South, be that as it would; and whosoever hung, fire burned. The altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it, no functionary, by any stretch of mathematics, was able to calculate successfully. XXIV. Drawn to the Loadstone Rock In such risings of fire and risings of sea--the firm earth shaken by the rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb, but was always on the flow, higher and higher, to the terror and wonder of the beholders on the shore--three years of tempest were consumed. Three more birthdays of little Lucie had been woven by the golden thread into the peaceful tissue of the life of her home."], "Whose castle do the revolutionaries burn down?": [" \u201cYes,\u201d repeated the Marquis. \u201cA Doctor with a daughter. Yes. So commences the new philosophy! You are fatigued. Good night!\u201d It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his. The nephew looked at him, in vain, in passing on to the door. \u201cGood night!\u201d said the uncle. \u201cI look to the pleasure of seeing you again in the morning. Good repose! Light Monsieur my nephew to his chamber there!--And burn Monsieur my nephew in his bed, if you will,\u201d he added to himself, before he rang his little bell again, and summoned his valet to his own bedroom. The valet come and gone, Monsieur the Marquis walked to and fro in his loose chamber-robe, to prepare himself gently for sleep, that hot still night. Rustling about the room, his softly-slippered feet making no noise on the floor, he moved like a refined tiger:--looked like some enchanted marquis of the impenitently wicked sort, in story, whose periodical change into tiger form was either just going off, or just coming on. He moved from end to end of his voluptuous bedroom, looking again at the scraps of the day's journey that came unbidden into his mind; the slow toil up the hill at sunset, the setting sun, the descent, the mill, the prison on the crag, the little village in the hollow, the peasants at the fountain, and the mender of roads with his blue cap pointing out the chain under the carriage.", " This had been so very noticeable, so very powerfully and naturally shown, that starers who had had no pity for him were touched by her; and the whisper went about, \u201cWho are they?\u201d Jerry, the messenger, who had made his own observations, in his own manner, and who had been sucking the rust off his fingers in his absorption, stretched his neck to hear who they were. The crowd about him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant, and from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back; at last it got to Jerry: \u201cWitnesses.\u201d \u201cFor which side?\u201d \u201cAgainst.\u201d \u201cAgainst what side?\u201d \u201cThe prisoner's.\u201d The Judge, whose eyes had gone in the general direction, recalled them, leaned back in his seat, and looked steadily at the man whose life was in his hand, as Mr. Attorney-General rose to spin the rope, grind the axe, and hammer the nails into the scaffold. III. A Disappointment Mr. Attorney-General had to inform the jury, that the prisoner before them, though young in years, was old in the treasonable practices which claimed the forfeit of his life. That this correspondence with the public enemy was not a correspondence of to-day, or of yesterday, or even of last year, or of the year before. That, it was certain the prisoner had, for longer than that, been in the habit of passing and repassing between France and England, on secret business of which he could give no honest account.", " Say! Would you not?\u201d \u201cTruly yes, madame.\u201d \u201cYes. And if you were shown a flock of birds, unable to fly, and were set upon them to strip them of their feathers for your own advantage, you would set upon the birds of the finest feathers; would you not?\u201d \u201cIt is true, madame.\u201d \u201cYou have seen both dolls and birds to-day,\u201d said Madame Defarge, with a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent; \u201cnow, go home!\u201d XVI. Still Knitting Madame Defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the bosom of Saint Antoine, while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the darkness, and through the dust, and down the weary miles of avenue by the wayside, slowly tending towards that point of the compass where the chateau of Monsieur the Marquis, now in his grave, listened to the whispering trees. Such ample leisure had the stone faces, now, for listening to the trees and to the fountain, that the few village scarecrows who, in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead stick to burn, strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and terrace staircase, had it borne in upon their starved fancy that the expression of the faces was altered. A rumour just lived in the village--had a faint and bare existence there, as its people had--that when the knife struck home, the faces changed, from faces of pride to faces of anger and pain; also, that when that dangling figure was hauled up forty feet above the fountain, they changed again, and bore a cruel look of being avenged, which they would henceforth bear for ever.", " The mender of roads, and the two hundred and fifty particular friends, inspired as one man and woman by the idea of lighting up, had darted into their houses, and were putting candles in every dull little pane of glass. The general scarcity of everything, occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of Monsieur Gabelle; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on that functionary's part, the mender of roads, once so submissive to authority, had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with, and that post-horses would roast. The chateau was left to itself to flame and burn. In the roaring and raging of the conflagration, a red-hot wind, driving straight from the infernal regions, seemed to be blowing the edifice away. With the rising and falling of the blaze, the stone faces showed as if they were in torment. When great masses of stone and timber fell, the face with the two dints in the nose became obscured: anon struggled out of the smoke again, as if it were the face of the cruel Marquis, burning at the stake and contending with the fire. The chateau burned; the nearest trees, laid hold of by the fire, scorched and shrivelled; trees at a distance, fired by the four fierce figures, begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke. Molten lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain; the water ran dry; the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the heat, and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame."], "Who barely escapes from the fire?": [" Then it soared higher, and grew broader and brighter. Soon, from a score of the great windows, flames burst forth, and the stone faces awakened, stared out of fire. A faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left there, and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away. There was spurring and splashing through the darkness, and bridle was drawn in the space by the village fountain, and the horse in a foam stood at Monsieur Gabelle's door. \u201cHelp, Gabelle! Help, every one!\u201d The tocsin rang impatiently, but other help (if that were any) there was none. The mender of roads, and two hundred and fifty particular friends, stood with folded arms at the fountain, looking at the pillar of fire in the sky. \u201cIt must be forty feet high,\u201d said they, grimly; and never moved. The rider from the chateau, and the horse in a foam, clattered away through the village, and galloped up the stony steep, to the prison on the crag. At the gate, a group of officers were looking at the fire; removed from them, a group of soldiers. \u201cHelp, gentlemen--officers! The chateau is on fire; valuable objects may be saved from the flames by timely aid! Help, help!\u201d The officers looked towards the soldiers who looked at the fire; gave no orders; and answered, with shrugs and biting of lips, \u201cIt must burn.\u201d As the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street, the village was illuminating.", " He was a man of about sixty, handsomely dressed, haughty in manner, and with a face like a fine mask. A face of a transparent paleness; every feature in it clearly defined; one set expression on it. The nose, beautifully formed otherwise, was very slightly pinched at the top of each nostril. In those two compressions, or dints, the only little change that the face ever showed, resided. They persisted in changing colour sometimes, and they would be occasionally dilated and contracted by something like a faint pulsation; then, they gave a look of treachery, and cruelty, to the whole countenance. Examined with attention, its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the line of the mouth, and the lines of the orbits of the eyes, being much too horizontal and thin; still, in the effect of the face made, it was a handsome face, and a remarkable one. Its owner went downstairs into the courtyard, got into his carriage, and drove away. Not many people had talked with him at the reception; he had stood in a little space apart, and Monseigneur might have been warmer in his manner. It appeared, under the circumstances, rather agreeable to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses, and often barely escaping from being run down. His man drove as if he were charging an enemy, and the furious recklessness of the man brought no check into the face, or to the lips, of the master.", " \u201cI am glad you have so much of the Englishman in you, though I wish you had never taken that cold in your voice,\u201d said Miss Pross, approvingly. \u201cBut the question, Doctor Manette. Is there\u201d--it was the good creature's way to affect to make light of anything that was a great anxiety with them all, and to come at it in this chance manner--\u201cis there any prospect yet, of our getting out of this place?\u201d \u201cI fear not yet. It would be dangerous for Charles yet.\u201d \u201cHeigh-ho-hum!\u201d said Miss Pross, cheerfully repressing a sigh as she glanced at her darling's golden hair in the light of the fire, \u201cthen we must have patience and wait: that's all. We must hold up our heads and fight low, as my brother Solomon used to say. Now, Mr. Cruncher!--Don't you move, Ladybird!\u201d They went out, leaving Lucie, and her husband, her father, and the child, by a bright fire. Mr. Lorry was expected back presently from the Banking House. Miss Pross had lighted the lamp, but had put it aside in a corner, that they might enjoy the fire-light undisturbed. Little Lucie sat by her grandfather with her hands clasped through his arm: and he, in a tone not rising much above a whisper, began to tell her a story of a great and powerful Fairy who had opened a prison-wall and let out a captive who had once done the Fairy a service. All was subdued and quiet, and Lucie was more at ease than she had been. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d she cried, all at once.", " \u201cKeep near to me, Jacques Three,\u201d cried Defarge; \u201cand do you, Jacques One and Two, separate and put yourselves at the head of as many of these patriots as you can. Where is my wife?\u201d \u201cEh, well! Here you see me!\u201d said madame, composed as ever, but not knitting to-day. Madame's resolute right hand was occupied with an axe, in place of the usual softer implements, and in her girdle were a pistol and a cruel knife. \u201cWhere do you go, my wife?\u201d \u201cI go,\u201d said madame, \u201cwith you at present. You shall see me at the head of women, by-and-bye.\u201d \u201cCome, then!\u201d cried Defarge, in a resounding voice. \u201cPatriots and friends, we are ready! The Bastille!\u201d With a roar that sounded as if all the breath in France had been shaped into the detested word, the living sea rose, wave on wave, depth on depth, and overflowed the city to that point. Alarm-bells ringing, drums beating, the sea raging and thundering on its new beach, the attack began. Deep ditches, double drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. Through the fire and through the smoke--in the fire and in the smoke, for the sea cast him up against a cannon, and on the instant he became a cannonier--Defarge of the wine-shop worked like a manful soldier, Two fierce hours. Deep ditch, single drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. One drawbridge down! \u201cWork, comrades all, work!"], "Why does Tellson\u2019s send Mr. Lorry to France?": [" He was so much too big for Tellson's, that old clerks in distant corners looked up with looks of remonstrance, as though he squeezed them against the wall. The House itself, magnificently reading the paper quite in the far-off perspective, lowered displeased, as if the Stryver head had been butted into its responsible waistcoat. The discreet Mr. Lorry said, in a sample tone of the voice he would recommend under the circumstances, \u201cHow do you do, Mr. Stryver? How do you do, sir?\u201d and shook hands. There was a peculiarity in his manner of shaking hands, always to be seen in any clerk at Tellson's who shook hands with a customer when the House pervaded the air. He shook in a self-abnegating way, as one who shook for Tellson and Co. \u201cCan I do anything for you, Mr. Stryver?\u201d asked Mr. Lorry, in his business character. \u201cWhy, no, thank you; this is a private visit to yourself, Mr. Lorry; I have come for a private word.\u201d \u201cOh indeed!\u201d said Mr. Lorry, bending down his ear, while his eye strayed to the House afar off. \u201cI am going,\u201d said Mr. Stryver, leaning his arms confidentially on the desk: whereupon, although it was a large double one, there appeared to be not half desk enough for him: \u201cI am going to make an offer of myself in marriage to your agreeable little friend, Miss Manette, Mr. Lorry.\u201d \u201cOh dear me!\u201d cried Mr. Lorry, rubbing his chin, and looking at his visitor dubiously. \u201cOh dear me, sir?\u201d repeated Stryver, drawing back.", " The corner being out of the way of the idle and curious, and the preparations having been very simple and few, the Doctor, Mr. Lorry, and Miss Pross, were left quite alone. It was when they turned into the welcome shade of the cool old hall, that Mr. Lorry observed a great change to have come over the Doctor; as if the golden arm uplifted there, had struck him a poisoned blow. He had naturally repressed much, and some revulsion might have been expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone. But, it was the old scared lost look that troubled Mr. Lorry; and through his absent manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own room when they got up-stairs, Mr. Lorry was reminded of Defarge the wine-shop keeper, and the starlight ride. \u201cI think,\u201d he whispered to Miss Pross, after anxious consideration, \u201cI think we had best not speak to him just now, or at all disturb him. I must look in at Tellson's; so I will go there at once and come back presently. Then, we will take him a ride into the country, and dine there, and all will be well.\u201d It was easier for Mr. Lorry to look in at Tellson's, than to look out of Tellson's. He was detained two hours. When he came back, he ascended the old staircase alone, having asked no question of the servant; going thus into the Doctor's rooms, he was stopped by a low sound of knocking. \u201cGood God!\u201d he said, with a start. \u201cWhat's that?\u201d Miss Pross, with a terrified face, was at his ear.", " Royalty was gone; had been besieged in its Palace and \u201csuspended,\u201d when the last tidings came over. The August of the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two was come, and Monseigneur was by this time scattered far and wide. As was natural, the head-quarters and great gathering-place of Monseigneur, in London, was Tellson's Bank. Spirits are supposed to haunt the places where their bodies most resorted, and Monseigneur without a guinea haunted the spot where his guineas used to be. Moreover, it was the spot to which such French intelligence as was most to be relied upon, came quickest. Again: Tellson's was a munificent house, and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen from their high estate. Again: those nobles who had seen the coming storm in time, and anticipating plunder or confiscation, had made provident remittances to Tellson's, were always to be heard of there by their needy brethren. To which it must be added that every new-comer from France reported himself and his tidings at Tellson's, almost as a matter of course. For such variety of reasons, Tellson's was at that time, as to French intelligence, a kind of High Exchange; and this was so well known to the public, and the inquiries made there were in consequence so numerous, that Tellson's sometimes wrote the latest news out in a line or so and posted it in the Bank windows, for all who ran through Temple Bar to read.", " And it was now, about little Lucie's sixth birthday, that they began to have an awful sound, as of a great storm in France with a dreadful sea rising. On a night in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine, Mr. Lorry came in late, from Tellson's, and sat himself down by Lucie and her husband in the dark window. It was a hot, wild night, and they were all three reminded of the old Sunday night when they had looked at the lightning from the same place. \u201cI began to think,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, pushing his brown wig back, \u201cthat I should have to pass the night at Tellson's. We have been so full of business all day, that we have not known what to do first, or which way to turn. There is such an uneasiness in Paris, that we have actually a run of confidence upon us! Our customers over there, seem not to be able to confide their property to us fast enough. There is positively a mania among some of them for sending it to England.\u201d \u201cThat has a bad look,\u201d said Darnay-- \u201cA bad look, you say, my dear Darnay? Yes, but we don't know what reason there is in it. People are so unreasonable! Some of us at Tellson's are getting old, and we really can't be troubled out of the ordinary course without due occasion.\u201d \u201cStill,\u201d said Darnay, \u201cyou know how gloomy and threatening the sky is.\u201d \u201cI know that, to be sure,\u201d assented Mr. Lorry, trying to persuade himself that his sweet temper was soured, and that he grumbled, \u201cbut I am determined to be peevish after my long day's botheration."], "What does Gabelle\u2019s letter to Darnay say?": [" He walked to and fro, with thoughts very busy, until it was time to return to Tellson's and take leave of Mr. Lorry. As soon as he arrived in Paris he would present himself to this old friend, but he must say nothing of his intention now. A carriage with post-horses was ready at the Bank door, and Jerry was booted and equipped. \u201cI have delivered that letter,\u201d said Charles Darnay to Mr. Lorry. \u201cI would not consent to your being charged with any written answer, but perhaps you will take a verbal one?\u201d \u201cThat I will, and readily,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, \u201cif it is not dangerous.\u201d \u201cNot at all. Though it is to a prisoner in the Abbaye.\u201d \u201cWhat is his name?\u201d said Mr. Lorry, with his open pocket-book in his hand. \u201cGabelle.\u201d \u201cGabelle. And what is the message to the unfortunate Gabelle in prison?\u201d \u201cSimply, 'that he has received the letter, and will come. '\u201d \u201cAny time mentioned?\u201d \u201cHe will start upon his journey to-morrow night.\u201d \u201cAny person mentioned?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d He helped Mr. Lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks, and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old Bank, into the misty air of Fleet-street. \u201cMy love to Lucie, and to little Lucie,\u201d said Mr. Lorry at parting, \u201cand take precious care of them till I come back.\u201d Charles Darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled, as the carriage rolled away. That night--it was the fourteenth of August--he sat up late, and wrote two fervent letters; one was to Lucie, explaining the strong obligation he was under to go to Paris, and showing her, at length, the reasons that he had, for feeling confident that he could become involved in no personal danger there; the other was to the Doctor, confiding Lucie and their dear child to his care, and dwelling on the same topics with the strongest assurances.", " Great rents and splits branched out in the solid walls, like crystallisation; stupefied birds wheeled about and dropped into the furnace; four fierce figures trudged away, East, West, North, and South, along the night-enshrouded roads, guided by the beacon they had lighted, towards their next destination. The illuminated village had seized hold of the tocsin, and, abolishing the lawful ringer, rang for joy. Not only that; but the village, light-headed with famine, fire, and bell-ringing, and bethinking itself that Monsieur Gabelle had to do with the collection of rent and taxes--though it was but a small instalment of taxes, and no rent at all, that Gabelle had got in those latter days--became impatient for an interview with him, and, surrounding his house, summoned him to come forth for personal conference. Whereupon, Monsieur Gabelle did heavily bar his door, and retire to hold counsel with himself. The result of that conference was, that Gabelle again withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys; this time resolved, if his door were broken in (he was a small Southern man of retaliative temperament), to pitch himself head foremost over the parapet, and crush a man or two below. Probably, Monsieur Gabelle passed a long night up there, with the distant chateau for fire and candle, and the beating at his door, combined with the joy-ringing, for music; not to mention his having an ill-omened lamp slung across the road before his posting-house gate, which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour.", " And it was such vapouring all about his ears, like a troublesome confusion of blood in his own head, added to a latent uneasiness in his mind, which had already made Charles Darnay restless, and which still kept him so. Among the talkers, was Stryver, of the King's Bench Bar, far on his way to state promotion, and, therefore, loud on the theme: broaching to Monseigneur, his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating them from the face of the earth, and doing without them: and for accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race. Him, Darnay heard with a particular feeling of objection; and Darnay stood divided between going away that he might hear no more, and remaining to interpose his word, when the thing that was to be, went on to shape itself out. The House approached Mr. Lorry, and laying a soiled and unopened letter before him, asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to whom it was addressed? The House laid the letter down so close to Darnay that he saw the direction--the more quickly because it was his own right name. The address, turned into English, ran: \u201cVery pressing. To Monsieur heretofore the Marquis St. Evremonde, of France. Confided to the cares of Messrs. Tellson and Co., Bankers, London, England.\u201d On the marriage morning, Doctor Manette had made it his one urgent and express request to Charles Darnay, that the secret of this name should be--unless he, the Doctor, dissolved the obligation--kept inviolate between them.", " How do you call the man? You know all the men of this part of the country. Who was he?\u201d \u201cYour clemency, Monseigneur! He was not of this part of the country. Of all the days of my life, I never saw him.\u201d \u201cSwinging by the chain? To be suffocated?\u201d \u201cWith your gracious permission, that was the wonder of it, Monseigneur. His head hanging over--like this!\u201d He turned himself sideways to the carriage, and leaned back, with his face thrown up to the sky, and his head hanging down; then recovered himself, fumbled with his cap, and made a bow. \u201cWhat was he like?\u201d \u201cMonseigneur, he was whiter than the miller. All covered with dust, white as a spectre, tall as a spectre!\u201d The picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd; but all eyes, without comparing notes with other eyes, looked at Monsieur the Marquis. Perhaps, to observe whether he had any spectre on his conscience. \u201cTruly, you did well,\u201d said the Marquis, felicitously sensible that such vermin were not to ruffle him, \u201cto see a thief accompanying my carriage, and not open that great mouth of yours. Bah! Put him aside, Monsieur Gabelle!\u201d Monsieur Gabelle was the Postmaster, and some other taxing functionary united; he had come out with great obsequiousness to assist at this examination, and had held the examined by the drapery of his arm in an official manner. \u201cBah! Go aside!\u201d said Monsieur Gabelle. \u201cLay hands on this stranger if he seeks to lodge in your village to-night, and be sure that his business is honest, Gabelle.\u201d \u201cMonseigneur, I am flattered to devote myself to your orders.\u201d \u201cDid he run away, fellow?--where is that Accursed?\u201d The accursed was already under the carriage with some half-dozen particular friends, pointing out the chain with his blue cap."], "What happens to Darnay as soon as he gets to France?": [" How does it feel? Is it worth being tried for one's life, to be the object of such sympathy and compassion, Mr. Darnay?\u201d Again Darnay answered not a word. \u201cShe was mightily pleased to have your message, when I gave it her. Not that she showed she was pleased, but I suppose she was.\u201d The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this disagreeable companion had, of his own free will, assisted him in the strait of the day. He turned the dialogue to that point, and thanked him for it. \u201cI neither want any thanks, nor merit any,\u201d was the careless rejoinder. \u201cIt was nothing to do, in the first place; and I don't know why I did it, in the second. Mr. Darnay, let me ask you a question.\u201d \u201cWillingly, and a small return for your good offices.\u201d \u201cDo you think I particularly like you?\u201d \u201cReally, Mr. Carton,\u201d returned the other, oddly disconcerted, \u201cI have not asked myself the question.\u201d \u201cBut ask yourself the question now.\u201d \u201cYou have acted as if you do; but I don't think you do.\u201d \u201c_I_ don't think I do,\u201d said Carton. \u201cI begin to have a very good opinion of your understanding.\u201d \u201cNevertheless,\u201d pursued Darnay, rising to ring the bell, \u201cthere is nothing in that, I hope, to prevent my calling the reckoning, and our parting without ill-blood on either side.\u201d Carton rejoining, \u201cNothing in life!\u201d Darnay rang. \u201cDo you call the whole reckoning?\u201d said Carton. On his answering in the affirmative, \u201cThen bring me another pint of this same wine, drawer, and come and wake me at ten.\u201d The bill being paid, Charles Darnay rose and wished him good night.", " And it was such vapouring all about his ears, like a troublesome confusion of blood in his own head, added to a latent uneasiness in his mind, which had already made Charles Darnay restless, and which still kept him so. Among the talkers, was Stryver, of the King's Bench Bar, far on his way to state promotion, and, therefore, loud on the theme: broaching to Monseigneur, his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating them from the face of the earth, and doing without them: and for accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race. Him, Darnay heard with a particular feeling of objection; and Darnay stood divided between going away that he might hear no more, and remaining to interpose his word, when the thing that was to be, went on to shape itself out. The House approached Mr. Lorry, and laying a soiled and unopened letter before him, asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to whom it was addressed? The House laid the letter down so close to Darnay that he saw the direction--the more quickly because it was his own right name. The address, turned into English, ran: \u201cVery pressing. To Monsieur heretofore the Marquis St. Evremonde, of France. Confided to the cares of Messrs. Tellson and Co., Bankers, London, England.\u201d On the marriage morning, Doctor Manette had made it his one urgent and express request to Charles Darnay, that the secret of this name should be--unless he, the Doctor, dissolved the obligation--kept inviolate between them.", " \u201cWell, sir!\u201d cried Mr. Lorry, thoroughly heated by his indifference, \u201cbusiness is a very good thing, and a very respectable thing. And, sir, if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments, Mr. Darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make allowance for that circumstance. Mr. Darnay, good night, God bless you, sir! I hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy life.--Chair there!\u201d Perhaps a little angry with himself, as well as with the barrister, Mr. Lorry bustled into the chair, and was carried off to Tellson's. Carton, who smelt of port wine, and did not appear to be quite sober, laughed then, and turned to Darnay: \u201cThis is a strange chance that throws you and me together. This must be a strange night to you, standing alone here with your counterpart on these street stones?\u201d \u201cI hardly seem yet,\u201d returned Charles Darnay, \u201cto belong to this world again.\u201d \u201cI don't wonder at it; it's not so long since you were pretty far advanced on your way to another. You speak faintly.\u201d \u201cI begin to think I _am_ faint.\u201d \u201cThen why the devil don't you dine? I dined, myself, while those numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong to--this, or some other. Let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at.\u201d Drawing his arm through his own, he took him down Ludgate-hill to Fleet-street, and so, up a covered way, into a tavern. Here, they were shown into a little room, where Charles Darnay was soon recruiting his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine: while Carton sat opposite to him at the same table, with his separate bottle of port before him, and his fully half-insolent manner upon him.", " And it was now, about little Lucie's sixth birthday, that they began to have an awful sound, as of a great storm in France with a dreadful sea rising. On a night in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine, Mr. Lorry came in late, from Tellson's, and sat himself down by Lucie and her husband in the dark window. It was a hot, wild night, and they were all three reminded of the old Sunday night when they had looked at the lightning from the same place. \u201cI began to think,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, pushing his brown wig back, \u201cthat I should have to pass the night at Tellson's. We have been so full of business all day, that we have not known what to do first, or which way to turn. There is such an uneasiness in Paris, that we have actually a run of confidence upon us! Our customers over there, seem not to be able to confide their property to us fast enough. There is positively a mania among some of them for sending it to England.\u201d \u201cThat has a bad look,\u201d said Darnay-- \u201cA bad look, you say, my dear Darnay? Yes, but we don't know what reason there is in it. People are so unreasonable! Some of us at Tellson's are getting old, and we really can't be troubled out of the ordinary course without due occasion.\u201d \u201cStill,\u201d said Darnay, \u201cyou know how gloomy and threatening the sky is.\u201d \u201cI know that, to be sure,\u201d assented Mr. Lorry, trying to persuade himself that his sweet temper was soured, and that he grumbled, \u201cbut I am determined to be peevish after my long day's botheration."], "What form of execution has just been invented?": [" The resemblance between him and Lucie was very strong at such times, and as they sat side by side, she leaning on his shoulder, and he resting his arm on the back of her chair, it was very agreeable to trace the likeness. He had been talking all day, on many subjects, and with unusual vivacity. \u201cPray, Doctor Manette,\u201d said Mr. Darnay, as they sat under the plane-tree--and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand, which happened to be the old buildings of London--\u201chave you seen much of the Tower?\u201d \u201cLucie and I have been there; but only casually. We have seen enough of it, to know that it teems with interest; little more.\u201d \u201c_I_ have been there, as you remember,\u201d said Darnay, with a smile, though reddening a little angrily, \u201cin another character, and not in a character that gives facilities for seeing much of it. They told me a curious thing when I was there.\u201d \u201cWhat was that?\u201d Lucie asked. \u201cIn making some alterations, the workmen came upon an old dungeon, which had been, for many years, built up and forgotten. Every stone of its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by prisoners--dates, names, complaints, and prayers. Upon a corner stone in an angle of the wall, one prisoner, who seemed to have gone to execution, had cut as his last work, three letters. They were done with some very poor instrument, and hurriedly, with an unsteady hand. At first, they were read as D. I. C.; but, on being more carefully examined, the last letter was found to be G. There was no record or legend of any prisoner with those initials, and many fruitless guesses were made what the name could have been.", " Alas! Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away, and Madame Defarge was drawing very near indeed. \u201cBy the cathedral door,\u201d said Miss Pross. \u201cWould it be much out of the way, to take me in, near the great cathedral door between the two towers?\u201d \u201cNo, miss,\u201d answered Mr. Cruncher. \u201cThen, like the best of men,\u201d said Miss Pross, \u201cgo to the posting-house straight, and make that change.\u201d \u201cI am doubtful,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, hesitating and shaking his head, \u201cabout leaving of you, you see. We don't know what may happen.\u201d \u201cHeaven knows we don't,\u201d returned Miss Pross, \u201cbut have no fear for me. Take me in at the cathedral, at Three o'Clock, or as near it as you can, and I am sure it will be better than our going from here. I feel certain of it. There! Bless you, Mr. Cruncher! Think-not of me, but of the lives that may depend on both of us!\u201d This exordium, and Miss Pross's two hands in quite agonised entreaty clasping his, decided Mr. Cruncher. With an encouraging nod or two, he immediately went out to alter the arrangements, and left her by herself to follow as she had proposed. The having originated a precaution which was already in course of execution, was a great relief to Miss Pross. The necessity of composing her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the streets, was another relief. She looked at her watch, and it was twenty minutes past two. She had no time to lose, but must get ready at once.", " The spy had kept his eyes open, but had been able to detect no sign. They had lounged away in a poverty-stricken, purposeless, accidental manner, quite natural and unimpeachable. \u201c_John_,\u201d thought madame, checking off her work as her fingers knitted, and her eyes looked at the stranger. \u201cStay long enough, and I shall knit 'BARSAD' before you go.\u201d \u201cYou have a husband, madame?\u201d \u201cI have.\u201d \u201cChildren?\u201d \u201cNo children.\u201d \u201cBusiness seems bad?\u201d \u201cBusiness is very bad; the people are so poor.\u201d \u201cAh, the unfortunate, miserable people! So oppressed, too--as you say.\u201d \u201cAs _you_ say,\u201d madame retorted, correcting him, and deftly knitting an extra something into his name that boded him no good. \u201cPardon me; certainly it was I who said so, but you naturally think so. Of course.\u201d \u201c_I_ think?\u201d returned madame, in a high voice. \u201cI and my husband have enough to do to keep this wine-shop open, without thinking. All we think, here, is how to live. That is the subject _we_ think of, and it gives us, from morning to night, enough to think about, without embarrassing our heads concerning others. _I_ think for others? No, no.\u201d The spy, who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make, did not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face; but, stood with an air of gossiping gallantry, leaning his elbow on Madame Defarge's little counter, and occasionally sipping his cognac. \u201cA bad business this, madame, of Gaspard's execution.", " With his straw in his mouth, Mr. Cruncher sat watching the two streams, like the heathen rustic who has for several centuries been on duty watching one stream--saving that Jerry had no expectation of their ever running dry. Nor would it have been an expectation of a hopeful kind, since a small part of his income was derived from the pilotage of timid women (mostly of a full habit and past the middle term of life) from Tellson's side of the tides to the opposite shore. Brief as such companionship was in every separate instance, Mr. Cruncher never failed to become so interested in the lady as to express a strong desire to have the honour of drinking her very good health. And it was from the gifts bestowed upon him towards the execution of this benevolent purpose, that he recruited his finances, as just now observed. Time was, when a poet sat upon a stool in a public place, and mused in the sight of men. Mr. Cruncher, sitting on a stool in a public place, but not being a poet, mused as little as possible, and looked about him. It fell out that he was thus engaged in a season when crowds were few, and belated women few, and when his affairs in general were so unprosperous as to awaken a strong suspicion in his breast that Mrs. Cruncher must have been \u201cflopping\u201d in some pointed manner, when an unusual concourse pouring down Fleet-street westward, attracted his attention. Looking that way, Mr. Cruncher made out that some kind of funeral was coming along, and that there was popular objection to this funeral, which engendered uproar."], "How does Doctor Manette help Darnay?": [" Then it soared higher, and grew broader and brighter. Soon, from a score of the great windows, flames burst forth, and the stone faces awakened, stared out of fire. A faint murmur arose about the house from the few people who were left there, and there was a saddling of a horse and riding away. There was spurring and splashing through the darkness, and bridle was drawn in the space by the village fountain, and the horse in a foam stood at Monsieur Gabelle's door. \u201cHelp, Gabelle! Help, every one!\u201d The tocsin rang impatiently, but other help (if that were any) there was none. The mender of roads, and two hundred and fifty particular friends, stood with folded arms at the fountain, looking at the pillar of fire in the sky. \u201cIt must be forty feet high,\u201d said they, grimly; and never moved. The rider from the chateau, and the horse in a foam, clattered away through the village, and galloped up the stony steep, to the prison on the crag. At the gate, a group of officers were looking at the fire; removed from them, a group of soldiers. \u201cHelp, gentlemen--officers! The chateau is on fire; valuable objects may be saved from the flames by timely aid! Help, help!\u201d The officers looked towards the soldiers who looked at the fire; gave no orders; and answered, with shrugs and biting of lips, \u201cIt must burn.\u201d As the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street, the village was illuminating.", " \u201cYes?\u201d said the Doctor, with evident constraint. \u201cBring your chair here, and speak on.\u201d He complied as to the chair, but appeared to find the speaking on less easy. \u201cI have had the happiness, Doctor Manette, of being so intimate here,\u201d so he at length began, \u201cfor some year and a half, that I hope the topic on which I am about to touch may not--\u201d He was stayed by the Doctor's putting out his hand to stop him. When he had kept it so a little while, he said, drawing it back: \u201cIs Lucie the topic?\u201d \u201cShe is.\u201d \u201cIt is hard for me to speak of her at any time. It is very hard for me to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours, Charles Darnay.\u201d \u201cIt is a tone of fervent admiration, true homage, and deep love, Doctor Manette!\u201d he said deferentially. There was another blank silence before her father rejoined: \u201cI believe it. I do you justice; I believe it.\u201d His constraint was so manifest, and it was so manifest, too, that it originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject, that Charles Darnay hesitated. \u201cShall I go on, sir?\u201d Another blank. \u201cYes, go on.\u201d \u201cYou anticipate what I would say, though you cannot know how earnestly I say it, how earnestly I feel it, without knowing my secret heart, and the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been laden. Dear Doctor Manette, I love your daughter fondly, dearly, disinterestedly, devotedly. If ever there were love in the world, I love her.", " You have loved yourself; let your old love speak for me!\u201d The Doctor sat with his face turned away, and his eyes bent on the ground. At the last words, he stretched out his hand again, hurriedly, and cried: \u201cNot that, sir! Let that be! I adjure you, do not recall that!\u201d His cry was so like a cry of actual pain, that it rang in Charles Darnay's ears long after he had ceased. He motioned with the hand he had extended, and it seemed to be an appeal to Darnay to pause. The latter so received it, and remained silent. \u201cI ask your pardon,\u201d said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, after some moments. \u201cI do not doubt your loving Lucie; you may be satisfied of it.\u201d He turned towards him in his chair, but did not look at him, or raise his eyes. His chin dropped upon his hand, and his white hair overshadowed his face: \u201cHave you spoken to Lucie?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cNor written?\u201d \u201cNever.\u201d \u201cIt would be ungenerous to affect not to know that your self-denial is to be referred to your consideration for her father. Her father thanks you.\u201d He offered his hand; but his eyes did not go with it. \u201cI know,\u201d said Darnay, respectfully, \u201chow can I fail to know, Doctor Manette, I who have seen you together from day to day, that between you and Miss Manette there is an affection so unusual, so touching, so belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured, that it can have few parallels, even in the tenderness between a father and child.", " If she should ever tell me that you are essential to her perfect happiness, I will give her to you. If there were--Charles Darnay, if there were--\u201d The young man had taken his hand gratefully; their hands were joined as the Doctor spoke: \u201c--any fancies, any reasons, any apprehensions, anything whatsoever, new or old, against the man she really loved--the direct responsibility thereof not lying on his head--they should all be obliterated for her sake. She is everything to me; more to me than suffering, more to me than wrong, more to me--Well! This is idle talk.\u201d So strange was the way in which he faded into silence, and so strange his fixed look when he had ceased to speak, that Darnay felt his own hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it. \u201cYou said something to me,\u201d said Doctor Manette, breaking into a smile. \u201cWhat was it you said to me?\u201d He was at a loss how to answer, until he remembered having spoken of a condition. Relieved as his mind reverted to that, he answered: \u201cYour confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my part. My present name, though but slightly changed from my mother's, is not, as you will remember, my own. I wish to tell you what that is, and why I am in England.\u201d \u201cStop!\u201d said the Doctor of Beauvais. \u201cI wish it, that I may the better deserve your confidence, and have no secret from you.\u201d \u201cStop!\u201d For an instant, the Doctor even had his two hands at his ears; for another instant, even had his two hands laid on Darnay's lips."], "Why does Lucy stand in the same spot outside the prison every day for two hours?": [" He always resolutely answered: \u201cNothing can happen to him without my knowledge, and I know that I can save him, Lucie.\u201d They had not made the round of their changed life many weeks, when her father said to her, on coming home one evening: \u201cMy dear, there is an upper window in the prison, to which Charles can sometimes gain access at three in the afternoon. When he can get to it--which depends on many uncertainties and incidents--he might see you in the street, he thinks, if you stood in a certain place that I can show you. But you will not be able to see him, my poor child, and even if you could, it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition.\u201d \u201cO show me the place, my father, and I will go there every day.\u201d From that time, in all weathers, she waited there two hours. As the clock struck two, she was there, and at four she turned resignedly away. When it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with her, they went together; at other times she was alone; but, she never missed a single day. It was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street. The hovel of a cutter of wood into lengths for burning, was the only house at that end; all else was wall. On the third day of her being there, he noticed her. \u201cGood day, citizeness.\u201d \u201cGood day, citizen.\u201d This mode of address was now prescribed by decree. It had been established voluntarily some time ago, among the more thorough patriots; but, was now law for everybody.", " I beg your pardon!\u201d said Stryver. \u201cGranted. Thank you. Well, Mr. Stryver, I was about to say:--it might be painful to you to find yourself mistaken, it might be painful to Doctor Manette to have the task of being explicit with you, it might be very painful to Miss Manette to have the task of being explicit with you. You know the terms upon which I have the honour and happiness to stand with the family. If you please, committing you in no way, representing you in no way, I will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon it. If you should then be dissatisfied with it, you can but test its soundness for yourself; if, on the other hand, you should be satisfied with it, and it should be what it now is, it may spare all sides what is best spared. What do you say?\u201d \u201cHow long would you keep me in town?\u201d \u201cOh! It is only a question of a few hours. I could go to Soho in the evening, and come to your chambers afterwards.\u201d \u201cThen I say yes,\u201d said Stryver: \u201cI won't go up there now, I am not so hot upon it as that comes to; I say yes, and I shall expect you to look in to-night. Good morning.\u201d Then Mr. Stryver turned and burst out of the Bank, causing such a concussion of air on his passage through, that to stand up against it bowing behind the two counters, required the utmost remaining strength of the two ancient clerks.", " \u201cBut it's not my business!\u201d he would generally say at those times, and would briskly fall to his sawing again. In all weathers, in the snow and frost of winter, in the bitter winds of spring, in the hot sunshine of summer, in the rains of autumn, and again in the snow and frost of winter, Lucie passed two hours of every day at this place; and every day on leaving it, she kissed the prison wall. Her husband saw her (so she learned from her father) it might be once in five or six times: it might be twice or thrice running: it might be, not for a week or a fortnight together. It was enough that he could and did see her when the chances served, and on that possibility she would have waited out the day, seven days a week. These occupations brought her round to the December month, wherein her father walked among the terrors with a steady head. On a lightly-snowing afternoon she arrived at the usual corner. It was a day of some wild rejoicing, and a festival. She had seen the houses, as she came along, decorated with little pikes, and with little red caps stuck upon them; also, with tricoloured ribbons; also, with the standard inscription (tricoloured letters were the favourite), Republic One and Indivisible. Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death! The miserable shop of the wood-sawyer was so small, that its whole surface furnished very indifferent space for this legend. He had got somebody to scrawl it up for him, however, who had squeezed Death in with most inappropriate difficulty.", " He had heard of her going to the prison every day. \u201cShe came out here,\u201d he said, looking about him, \u201cturned this way, must have trod on these stones often. Let me follow in her steps.\u201d It was ten o'clock at night when he stood before the prison of La Force, where she had stood hundreds of times. A little wood-sawyer, having closed his shop, was smoking his pipe at his shop-door. \u201cGood night, citizen,\u201d said Sydney Carton, pausing in going by; for, the man eyed him inquisitively. \u201cGood night, citizen.\u201d \u201cHow goes the Republic?\u201d \u201cYou mean the Guillotine. Not ill. Sixty-three to-day. We shall mount to a hundred soon. Samson and his men complain sometimes, of being exhausted. Ha, ha, ha! He is so droll, that Samson. Such a Barber!\u201d \u201cDo you often go to see him--\u201d \u201cShave? Always. Every day. What a barber! You have seen him at work?\u201d \u201cNever.\u201d \u201cGo and see him when he has a good batch. Figure this to yourself, citizen; he shaved the sixty-three to-day, in less than two pipes! Less than two pipes. Word of honour!\u201d As the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking, to explain how he timed the executioner, Carton was so sensible of a rising desire to strike the life out of him, that he turned away. \u201cBut you are not English,\u201d said the wood-sawyer, \u201cthough you wear English dress?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Carton, pausing again, and answering over his shoulder. \u201cYou speak like a Frenchman.\u201d \u201cI am an old student here.\u201d \u201cAha, a perfect Frenchman!"], "Who often talks to Lucie while she waits outside the prison?": [" \u201cWhat is it that your husband says in that little letter?\u201d asked Madame Defarge, with a lowering smile. \u201cInfluence; he says something touching influence?\u201d \u201cThat my father,\u201d said Lucie, hurriedly taking the paper from her breast, but with her alarmed eyes on her questioner and not on it, \u201chas much influence around him.\u201d \u201cSurely it will release him!\u201d said Madame Defarge. \u201cLet it do so.\u201d \u201cAs a wife and mother,\u201d cried Lucie, most earnestly, \u201cI implore you to have pity on me and not to exercise any power that you possess, against my innocent husband, but to use it in his behalf. O sister-woman, think of me. As a wife and mother!\u201d Madame Defarge looked, coldly as ever, at the suppliant, and said, turning to her friend The Vengeance: \u201cThe wives and mothers we have been used to see, since we were as little as this child, and much less, have not been greatly considered? We have known _their_ husbands and fathers laid in prison and kept from them, often enough? All our lives, we have seen our sister-women suffer, in themselves and in their children, poverty, nakedness, hunger, thirst, sickness, misery, oppression and neglect of all kinds?\u201d \u201cWe have seen nothing else,\u201d returned The Vengeance. \u201cWe have borne this a long time,\u201d said Madame Defarge, turning her eyes again upon Lucie. \u201cJudge you! Is it likely that the trouble of one wife and mother would be much to us now?\u201d She resumed her knitting and went out.", " Lucie and her father! Lucie with her arms stretched out to him, and with that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified, that it seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give force and power to it in this one passage of her life. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d cried Mr. Lorry, breathless and confused. \u201cWhat is the matter? Lucie! Manette! What has happened? What has brought you here? What is it?\u201d With the look fixed upon him, in her paleness and wildness, she panted out in his arms, imploringly, \u201cO my dear friend! My husband!\u201d \u201cYour husband, Lucie?\u201d \u201cCharles.\u201d \u201cWhat of Charles?\u201d \u201cHere. \u201cHere, in Paris?\u201d \u201cHas been here some days--three or four--I don't know how many--I can't collect my thoughts. An errand of generosity brought him here unknown to us; he was stopped at the barrier, and sent to prison.\u201d The old man uttered an irrepressible cry. Almost at the same moment, the bell of the great gate rang again, and a loud noise of feet and voices came pouring into the courtyard. \u201cWhat is that noise?\u201d said the Doctor, turning towards the window. \u201cDon't look!\u201d cried Mr. Lorry. \u201cDon't look out! Manette, for your life, don't touch the blind!\u201d The Doctor turned, with his hand upon the fastening of the window, and said, with a cool, bold smile: \u201cMy dear friend, I have a charmed life in this city. I have been a Bastille prisoner. There is no patriot in Paris--in Paris?", " He had heard of her going to the prison every day. \u201cShe came out here,\u201d he said, looking about him, \u201cturned this way, must have trod on these stones often. Let me follow in her steps.\u201d It was ten o'clock at night when he stood before the prison of La Force, where she had stood hundreds of times. A little wood-sawyer, having closed his shop, was smoking his pipe at his shop-door. \u201cGood night, citizen,\u201d said Sydney Carton, pausing in going by; for, the man eyed him inquisitively. \u201cGood night, citizen.\u201d \u201cHow goes the Republic?\u201d \u201cYou mean the Guillotine. Not ill. Sixty-three to-day. We shall mount to a hundred soon. Samson and his men complain sometimes, of being exhausted. Ha, ha, ha! He is so droll, that Samson. Such a Barber!\u201d \u201cDo you often go to see him--\u201d \u201cShave? Always. Every day. What a barber! You have seen him at work?\u201d \u201cNever.\u201d \u201cGo and see him when he has a good batch. Figure this to yourself, citizen; he shaved the sixty-three to-day, in less than two pipes! Less than two pipes. Word of honour!\u201d As the grinning little man held out the pipe he was smoking, to explain how he timed the executioner, Carton was so sensible of a rising desire to strike the life out of him, that he turned away. \u201cBut you are not English,\u201d said the wood-sawyer, \u201cthough you wear English dress?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Carton, pausing again, and answering over his shoulder. \u201cYou speak like a Frenchman.\u201d \u201cI am an old student here.\u201d \u201cAha, a perfect Frenchman!", " That, immediately, on a signal, the prisoner was removed to the interior of the prison again; but, that he, the Doctor, had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and assure himself that his son-in-law was, through no malice or mischance, delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had often drowned the proceedings, that he had obtained the permission, and had remained in that Hall of Blood until the danger was over. The sights he had seen there, with brief snatches of food and sleep by intervals, shall remain untold. The mad joy over the prisoners who were saved, had astounded him scarcely less than the mad ferocity against those who were cut to pieces. One prisoner there was, he said, who had been discharged into the street free, but at whom a mistaken savage had thrust a pike as he passed out. Being besought to go to him and dress the wound, the Doctor had passed out at the same gate, and had found him in the arms of a company of Samaritans, who were seated on the bodies of their victims. With an inconsistency as monstrous as anything in this awful nightmare, they had helped the healer, and tended the wounded man with the gentlest solicitude--had made a litter for him and escorted him carefully from the spot--had then caught up their weapons and plunged anew into a butchery so dreadful, that the Doctor had covered his eyes with his hands, and swooned away in the midst of it."], "What happens at Darnay\u2019s first rowdy trial in France?": [" How does it feel? Is it worth being tried for one's life, to be the object of such sympathy and compassion, Mr. Darnay?\u201d Again Darnay answered not a word. \u201cShe was mightily pleased to have your message, when I gave it her. Not that she showed she was pleased, but I suppose she was.\u201d The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this disagreeable companion had, of his own free will, assisted him in the strait of the day. He turned the dialogue to that point, and thanked him for it. \u201cI neither want any thanks, nor merit any,\u201d was the careless rejoinder. \u201cIt was nothing to do, in the first place; and I don't know why I did it, in the second. Mr. Darnay, let me ask you a question.\u201d \u201cWillingly, and a small return for your good offices.\u201d \u201cDo you think I particularly like you?\u201d \u201cReally, Mr. Carton,\u201d returned the other, oddly disconcerted, \u201cI have not asked myself the question.\u201d \u201cBut ask yourself the question now.\u201d \u201cYou have acted as if you do; but I don't think you do.\u201d \u201c_I_ don't think I do,\u201d said Carton. \u201cI begin to have a very good opinion of your understanding.\u201d \u201cNevertheless,\u201d pursued Darnay, rising to ring the bell, \u201cthere is nothing in that, I hope, to prevent my calling the reckoning, and our parting without ill-blood on either side.\u201d Carton rejoining, \u201cNothing in life!\u201d Darnay rang. \u201cDo you call the whole reckoning?\u201d said Carton. On his answering in the affirmative, \u201cThen bring me another pint of this same wine, drawer, and come and wake me at ten.\u201d The bill being paid, Charles Darnay rose and wished him good night.", " And it was such vapouring all about his ears, like a troublesome confusion of blood in his own head, added to a latent uneasiness in his mind, which had already made Charles Darnay restless, and which still kept him so. Among the talkers, was Stryver, of the King's Bench Bar, far on his way to state promotion, and, therefore, loud on the theme: broaching to Monseigneur, his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating them from the face of the earth, and doing without them: and for accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race. Him, Darnay heard with a particular feeling of objection; and Darnay stood divided between going away that he might hear no more, and remaining to interpose his word, when the thing that was to be, went on to shape itself out. The House approached Mr. Lorry, and laying a soiled and unopened letter before him, asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to whom it was addressed? The House laid the letter down so close to Darnay that he saw the direction--the more quickly because it was his own right name. The address, turned into English, ran: \u201cVery pressing. To Monsieur heretofore the Marquis St. Evremonde, of France. Confided to the cares of Messrs. Tellson and Co., Bankers, London, England.\u201d On the marriage morning, Doctor Manette had made it his one urgent and express request to Charles Darnay, that the secret of this name should be--unless he, the Doctor, dissolved the obligation--kept inviolate between them.", " And it was now, about little Lucie's sixth birthday, that they began to have an awful sound, as of a great storm in France with a dreadful sea rising. On a night in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine, Mr. Lorry came in late, from Tellson's, and sat himself down by Lucie and her husband in the dark window. It was a hot, wild night, and they were all three reminded of the old Sunday night when they had looked at the lightning from the same place. \u201cI began to think,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, pushing his brown wig back, \u201cthat I should have to pass the night at Tellson's. We have been so full of business all day, that we have not known what to do first, or which way to turn. There is such an uneasiness in Paris, that we have actually a run of confidence upon us! Our customers over there, seem not to be able to confide their property to us fast enough. There is positively a mania among some of them for sending it to England.\u201d \u201cThat has a bad look,\u201d said Darnay-- \u201cA bad look, you say, my dear Darnay? Yes, but we don't know what reason there is in it. People are so unreasonable! Some of us at Tellson's are getting old, and we really can't be troubled out of the ordinary course without due occasion.\u201d \u201cStill,\u201d said Darnay, \u201cyou know how gloomy and threatening the sky is.\u201d \u201cI know that, to be sure,\u201d assented Mr. Lorry, trying to persuade himself that his sweet temper was soured, and that he grumbled, \u201cbut I am determined to be peevish after my long day's botheration.", " \u201cAll curious to see,\u201d thought Mr. Lorry, in his amiably shrewd way, \u201cbut all natural and right; so, take the lead, my dear friend, and keep it; it couldn't be in better hands.\u201d But, though the Doctor tried hard, and never ceased trying, to get Charles Darnay set at liberty, or at least to get him brought to trial, the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him. The new era began; the king was tried, doomed, and beheaded; the Republic of Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, or Death, declared for victory or death against the world in arms; the black flag waved night and day from the great towers of Notre Dame; three hundred thousand men, summoned to rise against the tyrants of the earth, rose from all the varying soils of France, as if the dragon's teeth had been sown broadcast, and had yielded fruit equally on hill and plain, on rock, in gravel, and alluvial mud, under the bright sky of the South and under the clouds of the North, in fell and forest, in the vineyards and the olive-grounds and among the cropped grass and the stubble of the corn, along the fruitful banks of the broad rivers, and in the sand of the sea-shore. What private solicitude could rear itself against the deluge of the Year One of Liberty--the deluge rising from below, not falling from above, and with the windows of Heaven shut, not opened! There was no pause, no pity, no peace, no interval of relenting rest, no measurement of time."], "Who engineers Darnay\u2019s re-arrest the next day?": [" When was it done, Mr. Barsad?\u201d \u201cJust now, if at all.\u201d \u201cMr. Barsad is the best authority possible, sir,\u201d said Sydney, \u201cand I have it from Mr. Barsad's communication to a friend and brother Sheep over a bottle of wine, that the arrest has taken place. He left the messengers at the gate, and saw them admitted by the porter. There is no earthly doubt that he is retaken.\u201d Mr. Lorry's business eye read in the speaker's face that it was loss of time to dwell upon the point. Confused, but sensible that something might depend on his presence of mind, he commanded himself, and was silently attentive. \u201cNow, I trust,\u201d said Sydney to him, \u201cthat the name and influence of Doctor Manette may stand him in as good stead to-morrow--you said he would be before the Tribunal again to-morrow, Mr. Barsad?--\u201d \u201cYes; I believe so.\u201d \u201c--In as good stead to-morrow as to-day. But it may not be so. I own to you, I am shaken, Mr. Lorry, by Doctor Manette's not having had the power to prevent this arrest.\u201d \u201cHe may not have known of it beforehand,\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cBut that very circumstance would be alarming, when we remember how identified he is with his son-in-law.\u201d \u201cThat's true,\u201d Mr. Lorry acknowledged, with his troubled hand at his chin, and his troubled eyes on Carton. \u201cIn short,\u201d said Sydney, \u201cthis is a desperate time, when desperate games are played for desperate stakes. Let the Doctor play the winning game; I will play the losing one.", " How does it feel? Is it worth being tried for one's life, to be the object of such sympathy and compassion, Mr. Darnay?\u201d Again Darnay answered not a word. \u201cShe was mightily pleased to have your message, when I gave it her.

And, sir, if business imposes its restraints and its silences and impediments, Mr. Darnay as a young gentleman of generosity knows how to make allowance for that circumstance. Mr. Darnay, good night, God bless you, sir! I hope you have been this day preserved for a prosperous and happy life.--Chair there!\u201d Perhaps a little angry with himself, as well as with the barrister, Mr. Lorry bustled into the chair, and was carried off to Tellson's. Carton, who smelt of port wine, and did not appear to be quite sober, laughed then, and turned to Darnay: \u201cThis is a strange chance that throws you and me together. This must be a strange night to you, standing alone here with your counterpart on these street stones?\u201d \u201cI hardly seem yet,\u201d returned Charles Darnay, \u201cto belong to this world again.\u201d \u201cI don't wonder at it; it's not so long since you were pretty far advanced on your way to another. You speak faintly.\u201d \u201cI begin to think I _am_ faint.\u201d \u201cThen why the devil don't you dine? I dined, myself, while those numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong to--this, or some other. Let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at.\u201d Drawing his arm through his own, he took him down Ludgate-hill to Fleet-street, and so, up a covered way, into a tavern. Here, they were shown into a little room, where Charles Darnay was soon recruiting his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine: while Carton sat opposite to him at the same table, with his separate bottle of port before him, and his fully half-insolent manner upon him.", " And it was such vapouring all about his ears, like a troublesome confusion of blood in his own head, added to a latent uneasiness in his mind, which had already made Charles Darnay restless, and which still kept him so.

John Barsad, or Solomon Pross, walked at his side. Mr. Lorry had just finished his dinner, and was sitting before a cheery little log or two of fire--perhaps looking into their blaze for the picture of that younger elderly gentleman from Tellson's, who had looked into the red coals at the Royal George at Dover, now a good many years ago. He turned his head as they entered, and showed the surprise with which he saw a stranger. \u201cMiss Pross's brother, sir,\u201d said Sydney. \u201cMr. Barsad.\u201d \u201cBarsad?\u201d repeated the old gentleman, \u201cBarsad?

I pass to worse news. Darnay has been arrested again.\u201d Struck with consternation, the old gentleman exclaimed, \u201cWhat do you tell me!

O, look at her, dear Carton! Can you, of all the people who love her, bear to see her so?\u201d He bent over the child, and laid her blooming cheek against his face. He put her gently from him, and looked at her unconscious mother. \u201cBefore I go,\u201d he said, and paused--\u201cI may kiss her?\u201d It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face with his lips, he murmured some words. The child, who was nearest to him, told them afterwards, and told her grandchildren when she was a handsome old lady, that she heard him say, \u201cA life you love.\u201d When he had gone out into the next room, he turned suddenly on Mr. Lorry and her father, who were following, and said to the latter: \u201cYou had great influence but yesterday, Doctor Manette; let it at least be tried. These judges, and all the men in power, are very friendly to you, and very recognisant of your services; are they not?\u201d \u201cNothing connected with Charles was concealed from me. I had the strongest assurances that I should save him; and I did.\u201d He returned the answer in great trouble, and very slowly. \u201cTry them again.

I wish for your sake Mr. Barsad was not a Sheep of the Prisons.\u201d Sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy, under the gaolers. The spy, who was pale, turned paler, and asked him how he dared-- \u201cI'll tell you,\u201d said Sydney. \u201cI lighted on you, Mr. Barsad, coming out of the prison of the Conciergerie while I was contemplating the walls, an hour or more ago. You have a face to be remembered, and I remember faces well. Made curious by seeing you in that connection, and having a reason, to which you are no stranger, for associating you with the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate, I walked in your direction. I walked into the wine-shop here, close after you, and sat near you. I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved conversation, and the rumour openly going about among your admirers, the nature of your calling. And gradually, what I had done at random, seemed to shape itself into a purpose, Mr. Barsad.\u201d \u201cWhat purpose?\u201d the spy asked. \u201cIt would be troublesome, and might be dangerous, to explain in the street.

So long as a servant was present, no other words passed between them. When coffee had been served and they were alone together, the nephew, looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a fine mask, opened a conversation. \u201cI have come back, sir, as you anticipate, pursuing the object that took me away. It carried me into great and unexpected peril; but it is a sacred object, and if it had carried me to death I hope it would have sustained me.\u201d \u201cNot to death,\u201d said the uncle; \u201cit is not necessary to say, to death.\u201d \u201cI doubt, sir,\u201d returned the nephew, \u201cwhether, if it had carried me to the utmost brink of death, you would have cared to stop me there.\u201d The deepened marks in the nose, and the lengthening of the fine straight lines in the cruel face, looked ominous as to that; the uncle made a graceful gesture of protest, which was so clearly a slight form of good breeding that it was not reassuring. \u201cIndeed, sir,\u201d pursued the nephew, \u201cfor anything I know, you may have expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious circumstances that surrounded me.\u201d \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d said the uncle, pleasantly.", " \u201cBut, however that may be,\u201d resumed the nephew, glancing at him with deep distrust, \u201cI know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means, and would know no scruple as to means.\u201d \u201cMy friend, I told you so,\u201d said the uncle, with a fine pulsation in the two marks. \u201cDo me the favour to recall that I told you so, long ago.\u201d \u201cI recall it.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d said the Marquis--very sweetly indeed. His tone lingered in the air, almost like the tone of a musical instrument. \u201cIn effect, sir,\u201d pursued the nephew, \u201cI believe it to be at once your bad fortune, and my good fortune, that has kept me out of a prison in France here.\u201d \u201cI do not quite understand,\u201d returned the uncle, sipping his coffee. \u201cDare I ask you to explain?\u201d \u201cI believe that if you were not in disgrace with the Court, and had not been overshadowed by that cloud for years past, a letter de cachet would have sent me to some fortress indefinitely.\u201d \u201cIt is possible,\u201d said the uncle, with great calmness. \u201cFor the honour of the family, I could even resolve to incommode you to that extent. Pray excuse me!\u201d \u201cI perceive that, happily for me, the Reception of the day before yesterday was, as usual, a cold one,\u201d observed the nephew. \u201cI would not say happily, my friend,\u201d returned the uncle, with refined politeness; \u201cI would not be sure of that. A good opportunity for consideration, surrounded by the advantages of solitude, might influence your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for yourself.", " And it was such vapouring all about his ears, like a troublesome confusion of blood in his own head, added to a latent uneasiness in his mind, which had already made Charles Darnay restless, and which still kept him so. Among the talkers, was Stryver, of the King's Bench Bar, far on his way to state promotion, and, therefore, loud on the theme: broaching to Monseigneur, his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating them from the face of the earth, and doing without them: and for accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race. Him, Darnay heard with a particular feeling of objection; and Darnay stood divided between going away that he might hear no more, and remaining to interpose his word, when the thing that was to be, went on to shape itself out. The House approached Mr. Lorry, and laying a soiled and unopened letter before him, asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to whom it was addressed? The House laid the letter down so close to Darnay that he saw the direction--the more quickly because it was his own right name. The address, turned into English, ran: \u201cVery pressing. To Monsieur heretofore the Marquis St. Evremonde, of France. Confided to the cares of Messrs. Tellson and Co., Bankers, London, England.\u201d On the marriage morning, Doctor Manette had made it his one urgent and express request to Charles Darnay, that the secret of this name should be--unless he, the Doctor, dissolved the obligation--kept inviolate between them.", " I decided, that day, to write privately to the Minister, stating the nature of the two cases to which I had been summoned, and the place to which I had gone: in effect, stating all the circumstances. I knew what Court influence was, and what the immunities of the Nobles were, and I expected that the matter would never be heard of; but, I wished to relieve my own mind. I had kept the matter a profound secret, even from my wife; and this, too, I resolved to state in my letter. I had no apprehension whatever of my real danger; but I was conscious that there might be danger for others, if others were compromised by possessing the knowledge that I possessed. \u201cI was much engaged that day, and could not complete my letter that night. I rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it. It was the last day of the year. The letter was lying before me just completed, when I was told that a lady waited, who wished to see me. ***** \u201cI am growing more and more unequal to the task I have set myself. It is so cold, so dark, my senses are so benumbed, and the gloom upon me is so dreadful. \u201cThe lady was young, engaging, and handsome, but not marked for long life. She was in great agitation. She presented herself to me as the wife of the Marquis St. Evremonde. I connected the title by which the boy had addressed the elder brother, with the initial letter embroidered on the scarf, and had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that I had seen that nobleman very lately."], "Why is Charles Darnay going to be executed?": [" You hear?\u201d \u201cI hear, messieurs.\u201d \u201cGo on then,\u201d said Defarge. \u201cAgain; on the other hand, they whisper at the fountain,\u201d resumed the countryman, \u201cthat he is brought down into our country to be executed on the spot, and that he will very certainly be executed. They even whisper that because he has slain Monseigneur, and because Monseigneur was the father of his tenants--serfs--what you will--he will be executed as a parricide. One old man says at the fountain, that his right hand, armed with the knife, will be burnt off before his face; that, into wounds which will be made in his arms, his breast, and his legs, there will be poured boiling oil, melted lead, hot resin, wax, and sulphur; finally, that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses. That old man says, all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on the life of the late King, Louis Fifteen. But how do I know if he lies? I am not a scholar.\u201d \u201cListen once again then, Jacques!\u201d said the man with the restless hand and the craving air. \u201cThe name of that prisoner was Damiens, and it was all done in open day, in the open streets of this city of Paris; and nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done, than the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion, who were full of eager attention to the last--to the last, Jacques, prolonged until nightfall, when he had lost two legs and an arm, and still breathed!", " On a steaming, misty afternoon, Mr. Lorry sat at his desk, and Charles Darnay stood leaning on it, talking with him in a low voice. The penitential den once set apart for interviews with the House, was now the news-Exchange, and was filled to overflowing. It was within half an hour or so of the time of closing. \u201cBut, although you are the youngest man that ever lived,\u201d said Charles Darnay, rather hesitating, \u201cI must still suggest to you--\u201d \u201cI understand. That I am too old?\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cUnsettled weather, a long journey, uncertain means of travelling, a disorganised country, a city that may not be even safe for you.\u201d \u201cMy dear Charles,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, with cheerful confidence, \u201cyou touch some of the reasons for my going: not for my staying away. It is safe enough for me; nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better worth interfering with. As to its being a disorganised city, if it were not a disorganised city there would be no occasion to send somebody from our House here to our House there, who knows the city and the business, of old, and is in Tellson's confidence. As to the uncertain travelling, the long journey, and the winter weather, if I were not prepared to submit myself to a few inconveniences for the sake of Tellson's, after all these years, who ought to be?\u201d \u201cI wish I were going myself,\u201d said Charles Darnay, somewhat restlessly, and like one thinking aloud.", " And it was such vapouring all about his ears, like a troublesome confusion of blood in his own head, added to a latent uneasiness in his mind, which had already made Charles Darnay restless, and which still kept him so. Among the talkers, was Stryver, of the King's Bench Bar, far on his way to state promotion, and, therefore, loud on the theme: broaching to Monseigneur, his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating them from the face of the earth, and doing without them: and for accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race.

Is it worth being tried for one's life, to be the object of such sympathy and compassion, Mr. Darnay?\u201d Again Darnay answered not a word. \u201cShe was mightily pleased to have your message, when I gave it her. Not that she showed she was pleased, but I suppose she was.\u201d The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this disagreeable companion had, of his own free will, assisted him in the strait of the day. He turned the dialogue to that point, and thanked him for it. \u201cI neither want any thanks, nor merit any,\u201d was the careless rejoinder. \u201cIt was nothing to do, in the first place; and I don't know why I did it, in the second. Mr. Darnay, let me ask you a question.\u201d \u201cWillingly, and a small return for your good offices.\u201d \u201cDo you think I particularly like you?\u201d \u201cReally, Mr. Carton,\u201d returned the other, oddly disconcerted, \u201cI have not asked myself the question.\u201d \u201cBut ask yourself the question now.\u201d \u201cYou have acted as if you do; but I don't think you do.\u201d \u201c_I_ don't think I do,\u201d said Carton. \u201cI begin to have a very good opinion of your understanding.\u201d \u201cNevertheless,\u201d pursued Darnay, rising to ring the bell, \u201cthere is nothing in that, I hope, to prevent my calling the reckoning, and our parting without ill-blood on either side.\u201d Carton rejoining, \u201cNothing in life!\u201d Darnay rang. \u201cDo you call the whole reckoning?\u201d said Carton. On his answering in the affirmative, \u201cThen bring me another pint of this same wine, drawer, and come and wake me at ten.\u201d The bill being paid, Charles Darnay rose and wished him good night."], "What is revealed about Madame Defarge?": [" \u201cIs that his child?\u201d said Madame Defarge, stopping in her work for the first time, and pointing her knitting-needle at little Lucie as if it were the finger of Fate. \u201cYes, madame,\u201d answered Mr. Lorry; \u201cthis is our poor prisoner's darling daughter, and only child.\u201d The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed to fall so threatening and dark on the child, that her mother instinctively kneeled on the ground beside her, and held her to her breast. The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to fall, threatening and dark, on both the mother and the child. \u201cIt is enough, my husband,\u201d said Madame Defarge. \u201cI have seen them. We may go.\u201d But, the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it--not visible and presented, but indistinct and withheld--to alarm Lucie into saying, as she laid her appealing hand on Madame Defarge's dress: \u201cYou will be good to my poor husband. You will do him no harm. You will help me to see him if you can?\u201d \u201cYour husband is not my business here,\u201d returned Madame Defarge, looking down at her with perfect composure. \u201cIt is the daughter of your father who is my business here.\u201d \u201cFor my sake, then, be merciful to my husband. For my child's sake! She will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful. We are more afraid of you than of these others.\u201d Madame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her husband. Defarge, who had been uneasily biting his thumb-nail and looking at her, collected his face into a sterner expression.", " This was a courage that Madame Defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness. \u201cHa, ha!\u201d she laughed, \u201cyou poor wretch! What are you worth! I address myself to that Doctor.\u201d Then she raised her voice and called out, \u201cCitizen Doctor! Wife of Evremonde! Child of Evremonde! Any person but this miserable fool, answer the Citizeness Defarge!\u201d Perhaps the following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in the expression of Miss Pross's face, perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from either suggestion, whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone. Three of the doors she opened swiftly, and looked in. \u201cThose rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing, there are odds and ends upon the ground. There is no one in that room behind you! Let me look.\u201d \u201cNever!\u201d said Miss Pross, who understood the request as perfectly as Madame Defarge understood the answer. \u201cIf they are not in that room, they are gone, and can be pursued and brought back,\u201d said Madame Defarge to herself. \u201cAs long as you don't know whether they are in that room or not, you are uncertain what to do,\u201d said Miss Pross to herself; \u201cand you shall not know that, if I can prevent your knowing it; and know that, or not know that, you shall not leave here while I can hold you.\u201d \u201cI have been in the streets from the first, nothing has stopped me, I will tear you to pieces, but I will have you from that door,\u201d said Madame Defarge.", " Good day, one and all!\u201d \u201cHave the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a mouthful of cool fresh water, madame.\u201d Madame complied with a polite air. \u201cMarvellous cognac this, madame!\u201d It was the first time it had ever been so complimented, and Madame Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better. She said, however, that the cognac was flattered, and took up her knitting. The visitor watched her fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity of observing the place in general. \u201cYou knit with great skill, madame.\u201d \u201cI am accustomed to it.\u201d \u201cA pretty pattern too!\u201d \u201c_You_ think so?\u201d said madame, looking at him with a smile. \u201cDecidedly. May one ask what it is for?\u201d \u201cPastime,\u201d said madame, still looking at him with a smile while her fingers moved nimbly. \u201cNot for use?\u201d \u201cThat depends. I may find a use for it one day. If I do--Well,\u201d said madame, drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of coquetry, \u201cI'll use it!\u201d It was remarkable; but, the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge. Two men had entered separately, and had been about to order drink, when, catching sight of that novelty, they faltered, made a pretence of looking about as if for some friend who was not there, and went away. Nor, of those who had been there when this visitor entered, was there one left. They had all dropped off.", " She stopped in the act of putting the note in her bosom, and, with her hands yet at her neck, looked terrified at Madame Defarge. Madame Defarge met the lifted eyebrows and forehead with a cold, impassive stare. \u201cMy dear,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, striking in to explain; \u201cthere are frequent risings in the streets; and, although it is not likely they will ever trouble you, Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power to protect at such times, to the end that she may know them--that she may identify them. I believe,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, rather halting in his reassuring words, as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself upon him more and more, \u201cI state the case, Citizen Defarge?\u201d Defarge looked gloomily at his wife, and gave no other answer than a gruff sound of acquiescence. \u201cYou had better, Lucie,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, doing all he could to propitiate, by tone and manner, \u201chave the dear child here, and our good Pross. Our good Pross, Defarge, is an English lady, and knows no French.\u201d The lady in question, whose rooted conviction that she was more than a match for any foreigner, was not to be shaken by distress and, danger, appeared with folded arms, and observed in English to The Vengeance, whom her eyes first encountered, \u201cWell, I am sure, Boldface! I hope _you_ are pretty well!\u201d She also bestowed a British cough on Madame Defarge; but, neither of the two took much heed of her."], "What does Carton do at the Manettes\u2019?": [" The prisoner was like a young child in his hands. \u201cCarton! Dear Carton! It is madness. It cannot be accomplished, it never can be done, it has been attempted, and has always failed. I implore you not to add your death to the bitterness of mine.\u201d \u201cDo I ask you, my dear Darnay, to pass the door? When I ask that, refuse. There are pen and ink and paper on this table. Is your hand steady enough to write?\u201d \u201cIt was when you came in.\u201d \u201cSteady it again, and write what I shall dictate. Quick, friend, quick!\u201d Pressing his hand to his bewildered head, Darnay sat down at the table. Carton, with his right hand in his breast, stood close beside him. \u201cWrite exactly as I speak.\u201d \u201cTo whom do I address it?\u201d \u201cTo no one.\u201d Carton still had his hand in his breast. \u201cDo I date it?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d The prisoner looked up, at each question. Carton, standing over him with his hand in his breast, looked down. \u201c'If you remember,'\u201d said Carton, dictating, \u201c'the words that passed between us, long ago, you will readily comprehend this when you see it. You do remember them, I know. It is not in your nature to forget them. '\u201d He was drawing his hand from his breast; the prisoner chancing to look up in his hurried wonder as he wrote, the hand stopped, closing upon something. \u201cHave you written 'forget them'?\u201d Carton asked. \u201cI have. Is that a weapon in your hand?\u201d \u201cNo; I am not armed.\u201d \u201cWhat is it in your hand?\u201d \u201cYou shall know directly.", " Write on; there are but a few words more.\u201d He dictated again. \u201c'I am thankful that the time has come, when I can prove them. That I do so is no subject for regret or grief. '\u201d As he said these words with his eyes fixed on the writer, his hand slowly and softly moved down close to the writer's face. The pen dropped from Darnay's fingers on the table, and he looked about him vacantly. \u201cWhat vapour is that?\u201d he asked. \u201cVapour?\u201d \u201cSomething that crossed me?\u201d \u201cI am conscious of nothing; there can be nothing here. Take up the pen and finish. Hurry, hurry!\u201d As if his memory were impaired, or his faculties disordered, the prisoner made an effort to rally his attention. As he looked at Carton with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing, Carton--his hand again in his breast--looked steadily at him. \u201cHurry, hurry!\u201d The prisoner bent over the paper, once more. \u201c'If it had been otherwise;'\u201d Carton's hand was again watchfully and softly stealing down; \u201c'I never should have used the longer opportunity. If it had been otherwise;'\u201d the hand was at the prisoner's face; \u201c'I should but have had so much the more to answer for. If it had been otherwise--'\u201d Carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into unintelligible signs. Carton's hand moved back to his breast no more. The prisoner sprang up with a reproachful look, but Carton's hand was close and firm at his nostrils, and Carton's left arm caught him round the waist.", " \u201cYou are a good man and a true friend,\u201d said Carton, in an altered voice. \u201cForgive me if I notice that you are affected. I could not see my father weep, and sit by, careless. And I could not respect your sorrow more, if you were my father. You are free from that misfortune, however.\u201d Though he said the last words, with a slip into his usual manner, there was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch, that Mr. Lorry, who had never seen the better side of him, was wholly unprepared for. He gave him his hand, and Carton gently pressed it. \u201cTo return to poor Darnay,\u201d said Carton. \u201cDon't tell Her of this interview, or this arrangement. It would not enable Her to go to see him. She might think it was contrived, in case of the worse, to convey to him the means of anticipating the sentence.\u201d Mr. Lorry had not thought of that, and he looked quickly at Carton to see if it were in his mind. It seemed to be; he returned the look, and evidently understood it. \u201cShe might think a thousand things,\u201d Carton said, \u201cand any of them would only add to her trouble. Don't speak of me to her. As I said to you when I first came, I had better not see her. I can put my hand out, to do any little helpful work for her that my hand can find to do, without that. You are going to her, I hope? She must be very desolate to-night.\u201d \u201cI am going now, directly.\u201d \u201cI am glad of that.

While he was at a loss, Carton said, resuming his former air of contemplating cards: \u201cAnd indeed, now I think again, I have a strong impression that I have another good card here, not yet enumerated.

It would not enable Her to go to see him. She might think it was contrived, in case of the worse, to convey to him the means of anticipating the sentence.\u201d Mr. Lorry had not thought of that, and he looked quickly at Carton to see if it were in his mind. It seemed to be; he returned the look, and evidently understood it. \u201cShe might think a thousand things,\u201d Carton said, \u201cand any of them would only add to her trouble. Don't speak of me to her. As I said to you when I first came, I had better not see her. I can put my hand out, to do any little helpful work for her that my hand can find to do, without that. You are going to her, I hope? She must be very desolate to-night.\u201d \u201cI am going now, directly.\u201d \u201cI am glad of that. She has such a strong attachment to you and reliance on you."], "What happens when Madame Defarge arrives at the Manette apartment?": [" \u201cIs that his child?\u201d said Madame Defarge, stopping in her work for the first time, and pointing her knitting-needle at little Lucie as if it were the finger of Fate. \u201cYes, madame,\u201d answered Mr. Lorry; \u201cthis is our poor prisoner's darling daughter, and only child.\u201d The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed to fall so threatening and dark on the child, that her mother instinctively kneeled on the ground beside her, and held her to her breast. The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to fall, threatening and dark, on both the mother and the child. \u201cIt is enough, my husband,\u201d said Madame Defarge. \u201cI have seen them. We may go.\u201d But, the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it--not visible and presented, but indistinct and withheld--to alarm Lucie into saying, as she laid her appealing hand on Madame Defarge's dress: \u201cYou will be good to my poor husband. You will do him no harm. You will help me to see him if you can?\u201d \u201cYour husband is not my business here,\u201d returned Madame Defarge, looking down at her with perfect composure. \u201cIt is the daughter of your father who is my business here.\u201d \u201cFor my sake, then, be merciful to my husband. For my child's sake! She will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful. We are more afraid of you than of these others.\u201d Madame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her husband. Defarge, who had been uneasily biting his thumb-nail and looking at her, collected his face into a sterner expression.", " Except one man, who got up and went out. \u201cMy wife,\u201d said Defarge aloud, addressing Madame Defarge: \u201cI have travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads, called Jacques. I met him--by accident--a day and half's journey out of Paris. He is a good child, this mender of roads, called Jacques. Give him to drink, my wife!\u201d A second man got up and went out. Madame Defarge set wine before the mender of roads called Jacques, who doffed his blue cap to the company, and drank. In the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark bread; he ate of this between whiles, and sat munching and drinking near Madame Defarge's counter. A third man got up and went out. Defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine--but, he took less than was given to the stranger, as being himself a man to whom it was no rarity--and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast. He looked at no one present, and no one now looked at him; not even Madame Defarge, who had taken up her knitting, and was at work. \u201cHave you finished your repast, friend?\u201d he asked, in due season. \u201cYes, thank you.\u201d \u201cCome, then! You shall see the apartment that I told you you could occupy. It will suit you to a marvel.\u201d Out of the wine-shop into the street, out of the street into a courtyard, out of the courtyard up a steep staircase, out of the staircase into a garret--formerly the garret where a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes.", " This was a courage that Madame Defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness. \u201cHa, ha!\u201d she laughed, \u201cyou poor wretch! What are you worth! I address myself to that Doctor.\u201d Then she raised her voice and called out, \u201cCitizen Doctor! Wife of Evremonde! Child of Evremonde! Any person but this miserable fool, answer the Citizeness Defarge!\u201d Perhaps the following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in the expression of Miss Pross's face, perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from either suggestion, whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone. Three of the doors she opened swiftly, and looked in. \u201cThose rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing, there are odds and ends upon the ground. There is no one in that room behind you! Let me look.\u201d \u201cNever!\u201d said Miss Pross, who understood the request as perfectly as Madame Defarge understood the answer. \u201cIf they are not in that room, they are gone, and can be pursued and brought back,\u201d said Madame Defarge to herself. \u201cAs long as you don't know whether they are in that room or not, you are uncertain what to do,\u201d said Miss Pross to herself; \u201cand you shall not know that, if I can prevent your knowing it; and know that, or not know that, you shall not leave here while I can hold you.\u201d \u201cI have been in the streets from the first, nothing has stopped me, I will tear you to pieces, but I will have you from that door,\u201d said Madame Defarge.", " Good day, one and all!\u201d \u201cHave the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a mouthful of cool fresh water, madame.\u201d Madame complied with a polite air. \u201cMarvellous cognac this, madame!\u201d It was the first time it had ever been so complimented, and Madame Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better. She said, however, that the cognac was flattered, and took up her knitting. The visitor watched her fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity of observing the place in general. \u201cYou knit with great skill, madame.\u201d \u201cI am accustomed to it.\u201d \u201cA pretty pattern too!\u201d \u201c_You_ think so?\u201d said madame, looking at him with a smile. \u201cDecidedly. May one ask what it is for?\u201d \u201cPastime,\u201d said madame, still looking at him with a smile while her fingers moved nimbly. \u201cNot for use?\u201d \u201cThat depends. I may find a use for it one day. If I do--Well,\u201d said madame, drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of coquetry, \u201cI'll use it!\u201d It was remarkable; but, the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge. Two men had entered separately, and had been about to order drink, when, catching sight of that novelty, they faltered, made a pretence of looking about as if for some friend who was not there, and went away. Nor, of those who had been there when this visitor entered, was there one left. They had all dropped off."], "How does Carton feel before he is executed?": [" You hear?\u201d \u201cI hear, messieurs.\u201d \u201cGo on then,\u201d said Defarge. \u201cAgain; on the other hand, they whisper at the fountain,\u201d resumed the countryman, \u201cthat he is brought down into our country to be executed on the spot, and that he will very certainly be executed. They even whisper that because he has slain Monseigneur, and because Monseigneur was the father of his tenants--serfs--what you will--he will be executed as a parricide. One old man says at the fountain, that his right hand, armed with the knife, will be burnt off before his face; that, into wounds which will be made in his arms, his breast, and his legs, there will be poured boiling oil, melted lead, hot resin, wax, and sulphur; finally, that he will be torn limb from limb by four strong horses. That old man says, all this was actually done to a prisoner who made an attempt on the life of the late King, Louis Fifteen. But how do I know if he lies? I am not a scholar.\u201d \u201cListen once again then, Jacques!\u201d said the man with the restless hand and the craving air. \u201cThe name of that prisoner was Damiens, and it was all done in open day, in the open streets of this city of Paris; and nothing was more noticed in the vast concourse that saw it done, than the crowd of ladies of quality and fashion, who were full of eager attention to the last--to the last, Jacques, prolonged until nightfall, when he had lost two legs and an arm, and still breathed!", " The prisoner was like a young child in his hands. \u201cCarton! Dear Carton! It is madness. It cannot be accomplished, it never can be done, it has been attempted, and has always failed. I implore you not to add your death to the bitterness of mine.\u201d \u201cDo I ask you, my dear Darnay, to pass the door? When I ask that, refuse. There are pen and ink and paper on this table. Is your hand steady enough to write?\u201d \u201cIt was when you came in.\u201d \u201cSteady it again, and write what I shall dictate. Quick, friend, quick!\u201d Pressing his hand to his bewildered head, Darnay sat down at the table. Carton, with his right hand in his breast, stood close beside him. \u201cWrite exactly as I speak.\u201d \u201cTo whom do I address it?\u201d \u201cTo no one.\u201d Carton still had his hand in his breast. \u201cDo I date it?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d The prisoner looked up, at each question. Carton, standing over him with his hand in his breast, looked down. \u201c'If you remember,'\u201d said Carton, dictating, \u201c'the words that passed between us, long ago, you will readily comprehend this when you see it. You do remember them, I know. It is not in your nature to forget them. '\u201d He was drawing his hand from his breast; the prisoner chancing to look up in his hurried wonder as he wrote, the hand stopped, closing upon something. \u201cHave you written 'forget them'?\u201d Carton asked. \u201cI have. Is that a weapon in your hand?\u201d \u201cNo; I am not armed.\u201d \u201cWhat is it in your hand?\u201d \u201cYou shall know directly.", " Write on; there are but a few words more.\u201d He dictated again. \u201c'I am thankful that the time has come, when I can prove them. That I do so is no subject for regret or grief. '\u201d As he said these words with his eyes fixed on the writer, his hand slowly and softly moved down close to the writer's face. The pen dropped from Darnay's fingers on the table, and he looked about him vacantly. \u201cWhat vapour is that?\u201d he asked. \u201cVapour?\u201d \u201cSomething that crossed me?\u201d \u201cI am conscious of nothing; there can be nothing here. Take up the pen and finish. Hurry, hurry!\u201d As if his memory were impaired, or his faculties disordered, the prisoner made an effort to rally his attention. As he looked at Carton with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing, Carton--his hand again in his breast--looked steadily at him. \u201cHurry, hurry!\u201d The prisoner bent over the paper, once more. \u201c'If it had been otherwise;'\u201d Carton's hand was again watchfully and softly stealing down; \u201c'I never should have used the longer opportunity. If it had been otherwise;'\u201d the hand was at the prisoner's face; \u201c'I should but have had so much the more to answer for. If it had been otherwise--'\u201d Carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into unintelligible signs. Carton's hand moved back to his breast no more. The prisoner sprang up with a reproachful look, but Carton's hand was close and firm at his nostrils, and Carton's left arm caught him round the waist.", " \u201cDo you feel, yet, that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again, Mr. Darnay?\u201d \u201cI am frightfully confused regarding time and place; but I am so far mended as to feel that.\u201d \u201cIt must be an immense satisfaction!\u201d He said it bitterly, and filled up his glass again: which was a large one. \u201cAs to me, the greatest desire I have, is to forget that I belong to it. It has no good in it for me--except wine like this--nor I for it. So we are not much alike in that particular. Indeed, I begin to think we are not much alike in any particular, you and I.\u201d Confused by the emotion of the day, and feeling his being there with this Double of coarse deportment, to be like a dream, Charles Darnay was at a loss how to answer; finally, answered not at all. \u201cNow your dinner is done,\u201d Carton presently said, \u201cwhy don't you call a health, Mr. Darnay; why don't you give your toast?\u201d \u201cWhat health? What toast?\u201d \u201cWhy, it's on the tip of your tongue. It ought to be, it must be, I'll swear it's there.\u201d \u201cMiss Manette, then!\u201d \u201cMiss Manette, then!\u201d Looking his companion full in the face while he drank the toast, Carton flung his glass over his shoulder against the wall, where it shivered to pieces; then, rang the bell, and ordered in another. \u201cThat's a fair young lady to hand to a coach in the dark, Mr. Darnay!\u201d he said, filling his new goblet. A slight frown and a laconic \u201cYes,\u201d were the answer. \u201cThat's a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by!"]}
