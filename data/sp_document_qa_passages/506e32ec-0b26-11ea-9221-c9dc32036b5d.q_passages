{"A Taleof Two Cities opens in Which of the following does not characterize this period?": [" The Period It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way-- in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only. There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general were settled for ever.", " Suffer them and forbid them not. They see my Father's face. O Father, blessed words! Thus, the rustling of an Angel's wings got blended with the other echoes, and they were not wholly of earth, but had in them that breath of Heaven. Sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden-tomb were mingled with them also, and both were audible to Lucie, in a hushed murmur--like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore--as the little Lucie, comically studious at the task of the morning, or dressing a doll at her mother's footstool, chattered in the tongues of the Two Cities that were blended in her life. The Echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of Sydney Carton. Some half-dozen times a year, at most, he claimed his privilege of coming in uninvited, and would sit among them through the evening, as he had once done often. He never came there heated with wine. And one other thing regarding him was whispered in the echoes, which has been whispered by all true echoes for ages and ages.", " If it had not been Charles, it would have been another. Or, if it had been no other, I should have been the cause, and then the dark part of my life would have cast its shadow beyond myself, and would have fallen on you.\u201d It was the first time, except at the trial, of her ever hearing him refer to the period of his suffering. It gave her a strange and new sensation while his words were in her ears; and she remembered it long afterwards. \u201cSee!\u201d said the Doctor of Beauvais, raising his hand towards the moon. \u201cI have looked at her from my prison-window, when I could not bear her light. I have looked at her when it has been such torture to me to think of her shining upon what I had lost, that I have beaten my head against my prison-walls. I have looked at her, in a state so dull and lethargic, that I have thought of nothing but the number of horizontal lines I could draw across her at the full, and the number of perpendicular lines with which I could intersect them.\u201d He added in his inward and pondering manner, as he looked at the moon, \u201cIt was twenty either way, I remember, and the twentieth was difficult to squeeze in.\u201d The strange thrill with which she heard him go back to that time, deepened as he dwelt upon it; but, there was nothing to shock her in the manner of his reference.", " There were the four blackened walls, and a rusted iron ring in one of them. \u201cPass that torch slowly along these walls, that I may see them,\u201d said Defarge to the turnkey.

And it was he, without doubt, who scratched a calendar on this stone. What is that in your hand? A crowbar? Give it me!\u201d He had still the linstock of his gun in his own hand. He made a sudden exchange of the two instruments, and turning on the worm-eaten stool and table, beat them to pieces in a few blows. \u201cHold the light higher!\u201d he said, wrathfully, to the turnkey. \u201cLook among those fragments with care, Jacques."], "Why are the driversof the Dover mail coach hesitant to stop for Jerry Cruncher\u2019s message?": [" II. The Mail It was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November, before the first of the persons with whom this history has business. The Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up Shooter's Hill. He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail, as the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish for walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill, and the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the horses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the coach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back to Blackheath. Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in combination, had read that article of war which forbade a purpose otherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that some brute animals are endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to their duty.", " \u201cTom!\u201d softly over the coach roof. \u201cHallo, Joe.\u201d \u201cDid you hear the message?\u201d \u201cI did, Joe.\u201d \u201cWhat did you make of it, Tom?\u201d \u201cNothing at all, Joe.\u201d \u201cThat's a coincidence, too,\u201d the guard mused, \u201cfor I made the same of it myself.\u201d Jerry, left alone in the mist and darkness, dismounted meanwhile, not only to ease his spent horse, but to wipe the mud from his face, and shake the wet out of his hat-brim, which might be capable of holding about half a gallon. After standing with the bridle over his heavily-splashed arm, until the wheels of the mail were no longer within hearing and the night was quite still again, he turned to walk down the hill. \u201cAfter that there gallop from Temple Bar, old lady, I won't trust your fore-legs till I get you on the level,\u201d said this hoarse messenger, glancing at his mare. \u201c'Recalled to life.' That's a Blazing strange message. Much of that wouldn't do for you, Jerry!", " And even then it would not leave him, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every stair, scrambled into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on his breast when he fell asleep. From his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his closet was awakened after daybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his father in the family room. Something had gone wrong with him; at least, so Young Jerry inferred, from the circumstance of his holding Mrs. Cruncher by the ears, and knocking the back of her head against the head-board of the bed. \u201cI told you I would,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, \u201cand I did.\u201d \u201cJerry, Jerry, Jerry!\u201d his wife implored. \u201cYou oppose yourself to the profit of the business,\u201d said Jerry, \u201cand me and my partners suffer. You was to honour and obey; why the devil don't you?\u201d \u201cI try to be a good wife, Jerry,\u201d the poor woman protested, with tears. \u201cIs it being a good wife to oppose your husband's business?", " They seemed to be numerous, for she shied at every shadow on the road. What time, the mail-coach lumbered, jolted, rattled, and bumped upon its tedious way, with its three fellow-inscrutables inside. To whom, likewise, the shadows of the night revealed themselves, in the forms their dozing eyes and wandering thoughts suggested. Tellson's Bank had a run upon it in the mail. As the bank passenger--with an arm drawn through the leathern strap, which did what lay in it to keep him from pounding against the next passenger, and driving him into his corner, whenever the coach got a special jolt--nodded in his place, with half-shut eyes, the little coach-windows, and the coach-lamp dimly gleaming through them, and the bulky bundle of opposite passenger, became the bank, and did a great stroke of business. The rattle of the harness was the chink of money, and more drafts were honoured in five minutes than even Tellson's, with all its foreign and home connection, ever paid in thrice the time."], "What object doesDoctor Manette keep during his imprisonment in order to escape \u201cinspirit\u201d?": [" Who was called accordingly. \u201cDoctor Manette, look upon the prisoner.

You are a man of business, too.\u201d \u201cAnd as such,\u201d quoth Mr. Lorry, whom the counsel learned in the law had now shouldered back into the group, just as he had previously shouldered him out of it--\u201cas such I will appeal to Doctor Manette, to break up this conference and order us all to our homes. Miss Lucie looks ill, Mr. Darnay has had a terrible day, we are worn out.\u201d \u201cSpeak for yourself, Mr. Lorry,\u201d said Stryver; \u201cI have a night's work to do yet.", " \u201cThe child also,\u201d observed Jacques Three, with a meditative enjoyment of his words, \u201chas golden hair and blue eyes.

Not only do I feel, since last night, that I dare not confide to him the details of my projects; but also I feel that if I delay, there is danger of his giving warning, and then they might escape.\u201d \u201cThat must never be,\u201d croaked Jacques Three; \u201cno one must escape. We have not half enough as it is. We ought to have six score a day.\u201d \u201cIn a word,\u201d Madame Defarge went on, \u201cmy husband has not my reason for pursuing this family to annihilation, and I have not his reason for regarding this Doctor with any sensibility. I must act for myself, therefore. Come hither, little citizen.\u201d The wood-sawyer, who held her in the respect, and himself in the submission, of mortal fear, advanced with his hand to his red cap.", " \u201cLeave us, good boys; we have business here.\u201d The three glided by, and went silently down. There appearing to be no other door on that floor, and the keeper of the wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone, Mr. Lorry asked him in a whisper, with a little anger: \u201cDo you make a show of Monsieur Manette?\u201d \u201cI show him, in the way you have seen, to a chosen few.\u201d \u201cIs that well?\u201d \u201c_I_ think it is well.\u201d \u201cWho are the few?

Stay there, if you please, a little moment.\u201d With an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he stooped, and looked in through the crevice in the wall. Soon raising his head again, he struck twice or thrice upon the door--evidently with no other object than to make a noise there. With the same intention, he drew the key across it, three or four times, before he put it clumsily into the lock, and turned it as heavily as he could."], "By what name dothe men in Defarge\u2019s wine shop call their fellow revolutionaries?": [" Knitting There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. As early as six o'clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping through its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending over measures of wine. Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that he sold at this time. A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy. No vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur Defarge: but, a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay hidden in the dregs of it. This had been the third morning in succession, on which there had been early drinking at the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. It had begun on Monday, and here was Wednesday come. There had been more of early brooding than drinking; for, many men had listened and whispered and slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door, who could not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls.", " But, the time was not come yet; and every wind that blew over France shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain, for the birds, fine of song and feather, took no warning. The wine-shop was a corner shop, better than most others in its appearance and degree, and the master of the wine-shop had stood outside it, in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches, looking on at the struggle for the lost wine. \u201cIt's not my affair,\u201d said he, with a final shrug of the shoulders. \u201cThe people from the market did it. Let them bring another.\u201d There, his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke, he called to him across the way: \u201cSay, then, my Gaspard, what do you do there?\u201d The fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance, as is often the way with his tribe. It missed its mark, and completely failed, as is often the way with his tribe too. \u201cWhat now? Are you a subject for the mad hospital?\u201d said the wine-shop keeper, crossing the road, and obliterating the jest with a handful of mud, picked up for the purpose, and smeared over it.", " He knew beforehand what the price of his luxury was; he has paid the price.\u201d \u201cI believe,\u201d said the spy, dropping his soft voice to a tone that invited confidence, and expressing an injured revolutionary susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face: \u201cI believe there is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood, touching the poor fellow? Between ourselves.\u201d \u201cIs there?\u201d asked madame, vacantly. \u201cIs there not?\u201d \u201c--Here is my husband!\u201d said Madame Defarge. As the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door, the spy saluted him by touching his hat, and saying, with an engaging smile, \u201cGood day, Jacques!\u201d Defarge stopped short, and stared at him. \u201cGood day, Jacques!\u201d the spy repeated; with not quite so much confidence, or quite so easy a smile under the stare. \u201cYou deceive yourself, monsieur,\u201d returned the keeper of the wine-shop. \u201cYou mistake me for another. That is not my name. I am Ernest Defarge.\u201d \u201cIt is all the same,\u201d said the spy, airily, but discomfited too: \u201cgood day!\u201d \u201cGood day!\u201d answered Defarge, drily.", " A third man got up and went out. Defarge refreshed himself with a draught of wine--but, he took less than was given to the stranger, as being himself a man to whom it was no rarity--and stood waiting until the countryman had made his breakfast. He looked at no one present, and no one now looked at him; not even Madame Defarge, who had taken up her knitting, and was at work. \u201cHave you finished your repast, friend?\u201d he asked, in due season. \u201cYes, thank you.\u201d \u201cCome, then! You shall see the apartment that I told you you could occupy. It will suit you to a marvel.\u201d Out of the wine-shop into the street, out of the street into a courtyard, out of the courtyard up a steep staircase, out of the staircase into a garret--formerly the garret where a white-haired man sat on a low bench, stooping forward and very busy, making shoes. No white-haired man was there now; but, the three men were there who had gone out of the wine-shop singly."], "What skill didDoctor Manette develop in order to pass the time during his incarceration?": [" \u201cA moment!

I shall see him to-morrow, you remember, and I had better not take it into the prison.\u201d \u201cWhy not?\u201d \u201cI don't know; I prefer not to do so. Now, take this paper that Doctor Manette has carried about him. It is a similar certificate, enabling him and his daughter and her child, at any time, to pass the barrier and the frontier! You see?\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d \u201cPerhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against evil, yesterday. When is it dated?

Will you please to enter the carriage?' \u201cThe manner of both was imperious, and they both moved, as these words were spoken, so as to place me between themselves and the carriage door. They were armed. I was not. \u201c'Gentlemen,' said I, 'pardon me; but I usually inquire who does me the honour to seek my assistance, and what is the nature of the case to which I am summoned.' \u201cThe reply to this was made by him who had spoken second.

For, the rooms, though a beautiful scene to look at, and adorned with every device of decoration that the taste and skill of the time could achieve, were, in truth, not a sound business; considered with any reference to the scarecrows in the rags and nightcaps elsewhere (and not so far off, either, but that the watching towers of Notre Dame, almost equidistant from the two extremes, could see them both), they would have been an exceedingly uncomfortable business--if that could have been anybody's business, at the house of Monseigneur. Military officers destitute of military knowledge; naval officers with no idea of a ship; civil officers without a notion of affairs; brazen ecclesiastics, of the worst world worldly, with sensual eyes, loose tongues, and looser lives; all totally unfit for their several callings, all lying horribly in pretending to belong to them, but all nearly or remotely of the order of Monseigneur, and therefore foisted on all public employments from which anything was to be got; these were to be told off by the score and the score.", " As I stood aside to let that carriage pass, apprehensive that it might otherwise run me down, a head was put out at the window, and a voice called to the driver to stop. \u201cThe carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses, and the same voice called to me by my name. I answered. The carriage was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the door and alight before I came up with it. \u201cI observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks, and appeared to conceal themselves. As they stood side by side near the carriage door, I also observed that they both looked of about my own age, or rather younger, and that they were greatly alike, in stature, manner, voice, and (as far as I could see) face too. \u201c'You are Doctor Manette?' said one. \u201cI am.\u201d \u201c'Doctor Manette, formerly of Beauvais,' said the other; 'the young physician, originally an expert surgeon, who within the last year or two has made a rising reputation in Paris?'"], "What symbol doesDickens use to portend the bloodshed of the French Revolution?": [" He was a French gentleman; a scientific gentleman; a man of great acquirements--a Doctor.\u201d \u201cNot of Beauvais?\u201d \u201cWhy, yes, of Beauvais.

There could have been no such Revolution, if all laws, forms, and ceremonies, had not first been so monstrously abused, that the suicidal vengeance of the Revolution was to scatter them all to the winds. Every eye was turned to the jury. The same determined patriots and good republicans as yesterday and the day before, and to-morrow and the day after.

Hurry, hurry!\u201d As if his memory were impaired, or his faculties disordered, the prisoner made an effort to rally his attention. As he looked at Carton with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing, Carton--his hand again in his breast--looked steadily at him. \u201cHurry, hurry!\u201d The prisoner bent over the paper, once more. \u201c'If it had been otherwise;'\u201d Carton's hand was again watchfully and softly stealing down; \u201c'I never should have used the longer opportunity.

The prisoner sprang up with a reproachful look, but Carton's hand was close and firm at his nostrils, and Carton's left arm caught him round the waist.", " It had once been noted at the Bar, that while Mr. Stryver was a glib man, and an unscrupulous, and a ready, and a bold, he had not that faculty of extracting the essence from a heap of statements, which is among the most striking and necessary of the advocate's accomplishments. But, a remarkable improvement came upon him as to this. The more business he got, the greater his power seemed to grow of getting at its pith and marrow; and however late at night he sat carousing with Sydney Carton, he always had his points at his fingers' ends in the morning. Sydney Carton, idlest and most unpromising of men, was Stryver's great ally. What the two drank together, between Hilary Term and Michaelmas, might have floated a king's ship. Stryver never had a case in hand, anywhere, but Carton was there, with his hands in his pockets, staring at the ceiling of the court; they went the same Circuit, and even there they prolonged their usual orgies late into the night, and Carton was rumoured to be seen at broad day, going home stealthily and unsteadily to his lodgings, like a dissipated cat."], "A Taleof Two Cities was published in weekly installments fromApril to November of what year?": [" Suffer them and forbid them not. They see my Father's face. O Father, blessed words! Thus, the rustling of an Angel's wings got blended with the other echoes, and they were not wholly of earth, but had in them that breath of Heaven. Sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden-tomb were mingled with them also, and both were audible to Lucie, in a hushed murmur--like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore--as the little Lucie, comically studious at the task of the morning, or dressing a doll at her mother's footstool, chattered in the tongues of the Two Cities that were blended in her life. The Echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of Sydney Carton. Some half-dozen times a year, at most, he claimed his privilege of coming in uninvited, and would sit among them through the evening, as he had once done often. He never came there heated with wine. And one other thing regarding him was whispered in the echoes, which has been whispered by all true echoes for ages and ages.", " Greater things than the Doctor had at that time to contend with, would have yielded before his persevering purpose. While he kept himself in his place, as a physician, whose business was with all degrees of mankind, bond and free, rich and poor, bad and good, he used his personal influence so wisely, that he was soon the inspecting physician of three prisons, and among them of La Force. He could now assure Lucie that her husband was no longer confined alone, but was mixed with the general body of prisoners; he saw her husband weekly, and brought sweet messages to her, straight from his lips; sometimes her husband himself sent a letter to her (though never by the Doctor's hand), but she was not permitted to write to him: for, among the many wild suspicions of plots in the prisons, the wildest of all pointed at emigrants who were known to have made friends or permanent connections abroad. This new life of the Doctor's was an anxious life, no doubt; still, the sagacious Mr. Lorry saw that there was a new sustaining pride in it.", " Two other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the side of the mail. All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the ears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said, from anything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was hidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from the eyes of the body, of his two companions. In those days, travellers were very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on the road might be a robber or in league with robbers. As to the latter, when every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in \u201cthe Captain's\u201d pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable non-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. So the guard of the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter's Hill, as he stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet, and keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a loaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols, deposited on a substratum of cutlass.", " In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer, and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer's boy of sixpence. All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close upon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Environed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded, those two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the fair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights with a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small creatures--the creatures of this chronicle among the rest--along the roads that lay before them."], "What image doesDickens frequently use to describe Lucie Manette?": [" I have had unformed ideas of striving afresh, beginning anew, shaking off sloth and sensuality, and fighting out the abandoned fight. A dream, all a dream, that ends in nothing, and leaves the sleeper where he lay down, but I wish you to know that you inspired it.\u201d \u201cWill nothing of it remain? O Mr. Carton, think again! Try again!\u201d \u201cNo, Miss Manette; all through it, I have known myself to be quite undeserving. And yet I have had the weakness, and have still the weakness, to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me, heap of ashes that I am, into fire--a fire, however, inseparable in its nature from myself, quickening nothing, lighting nothing, doing no service, idly burning away.\u201d \u201cSince it is my misfortune, Mr. Carton, to have made you more unhappy than you were before you knew me--\u201d \u201cDon't say that, Miss Manette, for you would have reclaimed me, if anything could. You will not be the cause of my becoming worse.\u201d \u201cSince the state of your mind that you describe, is, at all events, attributable to some influence of mine--this is what I mean, if I can make it plain--can I use no influence to serve you?", " Good day, one and all!\u201d \u201cHave the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a mouthful of cool fresh water, madame.\u201d Madame complied with a polite air. \u201cMarvellous cognac this, madame!\u201d It was the first time it had ever been so complimented, and Madame Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better. She said, however, that the cognac was flattered, and took up her knitting. The visitor watched her fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity of observing the place in general. \u201cYou knit with great skill, madame.\u201d \u201cI am accustomed to it.\u201d \u201cA pretty pattern too!\u201d \u201c_You_ think so?\u201d said madame, looking at him with a smile. \u201cDecidedly.

I may find a use for it one day. If I do--Well,\u201d said madame, drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of coquetry, \u201cI'll use it!\u201d It was remarkable; but, the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge.", " That he had his reasons for this, he knew full well. It was again a summer day when, lately arrived in London from his college occupation, he turned into the quiet corner in Soho, bent on seeking an opportunity of opening his mind to Doctor Manette. It was the close of the summer day, and he knew Lucie to be out with Miss Pross. He found the Doctor reading in his arm-chair at a window. The energy which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated their sharpness, had been gradually restored to him. He was now a very energetic man indeed, with great firmness of purpose, strength of resolution, and vigour of action. In his recovered energy he was sometimes a little fitful and sudden, as he had at first been in the exercise of his other recovered faculties; but, this had never been frequently observable, and had grown more and more rare. He studied much, slept little, sustained a great deal of fatigue with ease, and was equably cheerful.", " It was well guarded, and he got up to go among the trusty people who were watching it, when his door suddenly opened, and two figures rushed in, at sight of which he fell back in amazement.

His scientific knowledge, and his vigilance and skill in conducting ingenious experiments, brought him otherwise into moderate request, and he earned as much as he wanted. These things were within Mr. Jarvis Lorry's knowledge, thoughts, and notice, when he rang the door-bell of the tranquil house in the corner, on the fine Sunday afternoon. \u201cDoctor Manette at home?\u201d Expected home. \u201cMiss Lucie at home?\u201d Expected home. \u201cMiss Pross at home?\u201d Possibly at home, but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to anticipate intentions of Miss Pross, as to admission or denial of the fact. \u201cAs I am at home myself,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, \u201cI'll go upstairs.\u201d Although the Doctor's daughter had known nothing of the country of her birth, she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability to make much of little means, which is one of its most useful and most agreeable characteristics.", " I will remember it as long as I live.\u201d He bent over the golden head, and put the rosy lips to his, and folded her in his arms. If one forlorn wanderer then pacing the dark streets, could have heard her innocent disclosure, and could have seen the drops of pity kissed away by her husband from the soft blue eyes so loving of that husband, he might have cried to the night--and the words would not have parted from his lips for the first time-- \u201cGod bless her for her sweet compassion!\u201d XXI. Echoing Footsteps A wonderful corner for echoes, it has been remarked, that corner where the Doctor lived. Ever busily winding the golden thread which bound her husband, and her father, and herself, and her old directress and companion, in a life of quiet bliss, Lucie sat in the still house in the tranquilly resounding corner, listening to the echoing footsteps of years. At first, there were times, though she was a perfectly happy young wife, when her work would slowly fall from her hands, and her eyes would be dimmed.", " \u201cWot can she have been a takin', to keep her courage up? Hark! There's the roll of them dreadful carts! You can hear that, miss?\u201d \u201cI can hear,\u201d said Miss Pross, seeing that he spoke to her, \u201cnothing.

Again Mr. Cruncher nodded his head. \u201cI don't hear it.\u201d \u201cGone deaf in an hour?\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, ruminating, with his mind much disturbed; \u201cwot's come to her?\u201d \u201cI feel,\u201d said Miss Pross, \u201cas if there had been a flash and a crash, and that crash was the last thing I should ever hear in this life.\u201d \u201cBlest if she ain't in a queer condition!\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, more and more disturbed."], "Which of thefollowing characters is related to the Marquis, whose carriage runsdown a small child?": [" \u201cWhat has gone wrong?\u201d said Monsieur, calmly looking out.

Is it his child?\u201d \u201cExcuse me, Monsieur the Marquis--it is a pity--yes.\u201d The fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it was, into a space some ten or twelve yards square. As the tall man suddenly got up from the ground, and came running at the carriage, Monsieur the Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-hilt. \u201cKilled!\u201d shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both arms at their length above his head, and staring at him. \u201cDead!\u201d The people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis.", " On seeing him, the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder, sobbing and crying, and pointing to the fountain, where some women were stooping over the motionless bundle, and moving gently about it. They were as silent, however, as the men. \u201cI know all, I know all,\u201d said the last comer. \u201cBe a brave man, my Gaspard! It is better for the poor little plaything to die so, than to live. It has died in a moment without pain. Could it have lived an hour as happily?\u201d \u201cYou are a philosopher, you there,\u201d said the Marquis, smiling. \u201cHow do they call you?\u201d \u201cThey call me Defarge.\u201d \u201cOf what trade?\u201d \u201cMonsieur the Marquis, vendor of wine.\u201d \u201cPick up that, philosopher and vendor of wine,\u201d said the Marquis, throwing him another gold coin, \u201cand spend it as you will. The horses there; are they right?\u201d Without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time, Monsieur the Marquis leaned back in his seat, and was just being driven away with the air of a gentleman who had accidentally broke some common thing, and had paid for it, and could afford to pay for it; when his ease was suddenly disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage, and ringing on its floor.", " And between them and the white-haired man afar off, was the one small link, that they had once looked in at him through the chinks in the wall. Defarge closed the door carefully, and spoke in a subdued voice: \u201cJacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three! This is the witness encountered by appointment, by me, Jacques Four. He will tell you all. Speak, Jacques Five!\u201d The mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his swarthy forehead with it, and said, \u201cWhere shall I commence, monsieur?\u201d \u201cCommence,\u201d was Monsieur Defarge's not unreasonable reply, \u201cat the commencement.\u201d \u201cI saw him then, messieurs,\u201d began the mender of roads, \u201ca year ago this running summer, underneath the carriage of the Marquis, hanging by the chain. Behold the manner of it. I leaving my work on the road, the sun going to bed, the carriage of the Marquis slowly ascending the hill, he hanging by the chain--like this.\u201d Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in which he ought to have been perfect by that time, seeing that it had been the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village during a whole year.", " As I stood aside to let that carriage pass, apprehensive that it might otherwise run me down, a head was put out at the window, and a voice called to the driver to stop. \u201cThe carriage stopped as soon as the driver could rein in his horses, and the same voice called to me by my name. I answered. The carriage was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the door and alight before I came up with it. \u201cI observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks, and appeared to conceal themselves. As they stood side by side near the carriage door, I also observed that they both looked of about my own age, or rather younger, and that they were greatly alike, in stature, manner, voice, and (as far as I could see) face too. \u201c'You are Doctor Manette?' said one. \u201cI am.\u201d \u201c'Doctor Manette, formerly of Beauvais,' said the other; 'the young physician, originally an expert surgeon, who within the last year or two has made a rising reputation in Paris?'"], "Who does MissPross believe is the ideal suitor for Lucie Manette?": [" My daughter Lucie is, in this one respect, such a mystery to me; I can make no guess at the state of her heart.\u201d \u201cMay I ask, sir, if you think she is--\u201d As he hesitated, her father supplied the rest. \u201cIs sought by any other suitor?\u201d \u201cIt is what I meant to say.\u201d Her father considered a little before he answered: \u201cYou have seen Mr. Carton here, yourself.

Tell me what it is.\u201d \u201cIt is, that if Miss Manette should bring to you at any time, on her own part, such a confidence as I have ventured to lay before you, you will bear testimony to what I have said, and to your belief in it. I hope you may be able to think so well of me, as to urge no influence against me. I say nothing more of my stake in this; this is what I ask.", " Have I no power for good, with you, at all?\u201d \u201cThe utmost good that I am capable of now, Miss Manette, I have come here to realise. Let me carry through the rest of my misdirected life, the remembrance that I opened my heart to you, last of all the world; and that there was something left in me at this time which you could deplore and pity.\u201d \u201cWhich I entreated you to believe, again and again, most fervently, with all my heart, was capable of better things, Mr. Carton!\u201d \u201cEntreat me to believe it no more, Miss Manette. I have proved myself, and I know better. I distress you; I draw fast to an end. Will you let me believe, when I recall this day, that the last confidence of my life was reposed in your pure and innocent breast, and that it lies there alone, and will be shared by no one?\u201d \u201cIf that will be a consolation to you, yes.\u201d \u201cNot even by the dearest one ever to be known to you?\u201d \u201cMr. Carton,\u201d she answered, after an agitated pause, \u201cthe secret is yours, not mine; and I promise to respect it.\u201d \u201cThank you.", " But I have thought it possible that you might have it in your power, if you should deem it right, to give me some.\u201d \u201cDo you seek any promise from me?\u201d \u201cI do seek that.\u201d \u201cWhat is it?\u201d \u201cI well understand that, without you, I could have no hope. I well understand that, even if Miss Manette held me at this moment in her innocent heart--do not think I have the presumption to assume so much--I could retain no place in it against her love for her father.\u201d \u201cIf that be so, do you see what, on the other hand, is involved in it?\u201d \u201cI understand equally well, that a word from her father in any suitor's favour, would outweigh herself and all the world. For which reason, Doctor Manette,\u201d said Darnay, modestly but firmly, \u201cI would not ask that word, to save my life.\u201d \u201cI am sure of it. Charles Darnay, mysteries arise out of close love, as well as out of wide division; in the former case, they are subtle and delicate, and difficult to penetrate.", " \u201cI have had the happiness, Doctor Manette, of being so intimate here,\u201d so he at length began, \u201cfor some year and a half, that I hope the topic on which I am about to touch may not--\u201d He was stayed by the Doctor's putting out his hand to stop him. When he had kept it so a little while, he said, drawing it back: \u201cIs Lucie the topic?\u201d \u201cShe is.\u201d \u201cIt is hard for me to speak of her at any time. It is very hard for me to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours, Charles Darnay.\u201d \u201cIt is a tone of fervent admiration, true homage, and deep love, Doctor Manette!\u201d he said deferentially. There was another blank silence before her father rejoined: \u201cI believe it. I do you justice; I believe it.\u201d His constraint was so manifest, and it was so manifest, too, that it originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject, that Charles Darnay hesitated. \u201cShall I go on, sir?\u201d Another blank. \u201cYes, go on.\u201d \u201cYou anticipate what I would say, though you cannot know how earnestly I say it, how earnestly I feel it, without knowing my secret heart, and the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been laden."], "What does Mr.Lorry try to persuade Mr. Stryver not to do?": [" \u201cD--n it all, sir!\u201d said Stryver, staring at him, \u201cam I not eligible?\u201d \u201cOh dear yes! Yes. Oh yes, you're eligible!\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cIf you say eligible, you are eligible.\u201d \u201cAm I not prosperous?\u201d asked Stryver. \u201cOh! if you come to prosperous, you are prosperous,\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cAnd advancing?\u201d \u201cIf you come to advancing you know,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, delighted to be able to make another admission, \u201cnobody can doubt that.\u201d \u201cThen what on earth is your meaning, Mr. Lorry?\u201d demanded Stryver, perceptibly crestfallen. \u201cWell! I--Were you going there now?\u201d asked Mr. Lorry. \u201cStraight!\u201d said Stryver, with a plump of his fist on the desk. \u201cThen I think I wouldn't, if I was you.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d said Stryver. \u201cNow, I'll put you in a corner,\u201d forensically shaking a forefinger at him. \u201cYou are a man of business and bound to have a reason. State your reason. Why wouldn't you go?\u201d \u201cBecause,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, \u201cI wouldn't go on such an object without having some cause to believe that I should succeed.\u201d \u201cD--n _me_!\u201d cried Stryver, \u201cbut this beats everything.\u201d Mr. Lorry glanced at the distant House, and glanced at the angry Stryver.", " \u201cWhy, no, thank you; this is a private visit to yourself, Mr. Lorry; I have come for a private word.\u201d \u201cOh indeed!\u201d said Mr. Lorry, bending down his ear, while his eye strayed to the House afar off. \u201cI am going,\u201d said Mr. Stryver, leaning his arms confidentially on the desk: whereupon, although it was a large double one, there appeared to be not half desk enough for him: \u201cI am going to make an offer of myself in marriage to your agreeable little friend, Miss Manette, Mr. Lorry.\u201d \u201cOh dear me!\u201d cried Mr. Lorry, rubbing his chin, and looking at his visitor dubiously. \u201cOh dear me, sir?\u201d repeated Stryver, drawing back. \u201cOh dear you, sir? What may your meaning be, Mr. Lorry?\u201d \u201cMy meaning,\u201d answered the man of business, \u201cis, of course, friendly and appreciative, and that it does you the greatest credit, and--in short, my meaning is everything you could desire. But--really, you know, Mr. Stryver--\u201d Mr. Lorry paused, and shook his head at him in the oddest manner, as if he were compelled against his will to add, internally, \u201cyou know there really is so much too much of you!\u201d \u201cWell!\u201d said Stryver, slapping the desk with his contentious hand, opening his eyes wider, and taking a long breath, \u201cif I understand you, Mr. Lorry, I'll be hanged!\u201d Mr. Lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that end, and bit the feather of a pen.", " These judges, and all the men in power, are very friendly to you, and very recognisant of your services; are they not?\u201d \u201cNothing connected with Charles was concealed from me. I had the strongest assurances that I should save him; and I did.\u201d He returned the answer in great trouble, and very slowly. \u201cTry them again. The hours between this and to-morrow afternoon are few and short, but try.\u201d \u201cI intend to try. I will not rest a moment.\u201d \u201cThat's well. I have known such energy as yours do great things before now--though never,\u201d he added, with a smile and a sigh together, \u201csuch great things as this. But try! Of little worth as life is when we misuse it, it is worth that effort. It would cost nothing to lay down if it were not.\u201d \u201cI will go,\u201d said Doctor Manette, \u201cto the Prosecutor and the President straight, and I will go to others whom it is better not to name. I will write too, and--But stay!", " \u201cThat is what I mean to tell you, sir,\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cPray let there be no mistake about it.\u201d Mr. Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while, and then stood hitting a tune out of his teeth with it, which probably gave him the toothache. He broke the awkward silence by saying: \u201cThis is something new to me, Mr. Lorry. You deliberately advise me not to go up to Soho and offer myself--_my_self, Stryver of the King's Bench bar?\u201d \u201cDo you ask me for my advice, Mr. Stryver?\u201d \u201cYes, I do.\u201d \u201cVery good. Then I give it, and you have repeated it correctly.\u201d \u201cAnd all I can say of it is,\u201d laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh, \u201cthat this--ha, ha!--beats everything past, present, and to come.\u201d \u201cNow understand me,\u201d pursued Mr. Lorry. \u201cAs a man of business, I am not justified in saying anything about this matter, for, as a man of business, I know nothing of it.

Yes,\u201d was the grim reply of Monsieur Defarge. \u201cYou think it necessary to keep the unfortunate gentleman so retired?\u201d \u201cI think it necessary to turn the key.\u201d Monsieur Defarge whispered it closer in his ear, and frowned heavily. \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cWhy! Because he has lived so long, locked up, that he would be frightened--rave--tear himself to pieces--die--come to I know not what harm--if his door was left open.\u201d \u201cIs it possible!\u201d exclaimed Mr. Lorry. \u201cIs it possible!\u201d repeated Defarge, bitterly. \u201cYes. And a beautiful world we live in, when it _is_ possible, and when many other such things are possible, and not only possible, but done--done, see you!--under that sky there, every day. Long live the Devil. Let us go on.\u201d This dialogue had been held in so very low a whisper, that not a word of it had reached the young lady's ears. But, by this time she trembled under such strong emotion, and her face expressed such deep anxiety, and, above all, such dread and terror, that Mr. Lorry felt it incumbent on him to speak a word or two of reassurance.", " As if _they_ had any help for anybody in their absurd baskets! \u201c--rendered it necessary that I should go to Paris, there to communicate with a gentleman of the Bank, so good as to be despatched to Paris for the purpose.\u201d \u201cMyself.\u201d \u201cAs I was prepared to hear, sir.\u201d She curtseyed to him (young ladies made curtseys in those days), with a pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he was than she. He made her another bow. \u201cI replied to the Bank, sir, that as it was considered necessary, by those who know, and who are so kind as to advise me, that I should go to France, and that as I am an orphan and have no friend who could go with me, I should esteem it highly if I might be permitted to place myself, during the journey, under that worthy gentleman's protection. The gentleman had left London, but I think a messenger was sent after him to beg the favour of his waiting for me here.\u201d \u201cI was happy,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, \u201cto be entrusted with the charge.", " The corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes; it had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet, that it seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had set it going. \u201cHere they are!\u201d said Miss Pross, rising to break up the conference; \u201cand now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon!\u201d It was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties, such a peculiar Ear of a place, that as Mr. Lorry stood at the open window, looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard, he fancied they would never approach. Not only would the echoes die away, as though the steps had gone; but, echoes of other steps that never came would be heard in their stead, and would die away for good when they seemed close at hand. However, father and daughter did at last appear, and Miss Pross was ready at the street door to receive them. Miss Pross was a pleasant sight, albeit wild, and red, and grim, taking off her darling's bonnet when she came up-stairs, and touching it up with the ends of her handkerchief, and blowing the dust off it, and folding her mantle ready for laying by, and smoothing her rich hair with as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she had been the vainest and handsomest of women.", " It thrilled him with a great dread of discovery; but the man went on. A very few moments after that, a young woman, with a slight girlish form, a sweet spare face in which there was no vestige of colour, and large widely opened patient eyes, rose from the seat where he had observed her sitting, and came to speak to him. \u201cCitizen Evremonde,\u201d she said, touching him with her cold hand. \u201cI am a poor little seamstress, who was with you in La Force.\u201d He murmured for answer: \u201cTrue. I forget what you were accused of?\u201d \u201cPlots. Though the just Heaven knows that I am innocent of any. Is it likely? Who would think of plotting with a poor little weak creature like me?\u201d The forlorn smile with which she said it, so touched him, that tears started from his eyes. \u201cI am not afraid to die, Citizen Evremonde, but I have done nothing. I am not unwilling to die, if the Republic which is to do so much good to us poor, will profit by my death; but I do not know how that can be, Citizen Evremonde."], "What does JerryCruncher frequently go out to do at night?": [" That he had his reasons for this, he knew full well. It was again a summer day when, lately arrived in London from his college occupation, he turned into the quiet corner in Soho, bent on seeking an opportunity of opening his mind to Doctor Manette. It was the close of the summer day, and he knew Lucie to be out with Miss Pross. He found the Doctor reading in his arm-chair at a window. The energy which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated their sharpness, had been gradually restored to him. He was now a very energetic man indeed, with great firmness of purpose, strength of resolution, and vigour of action. In his recovered energy he was sometimes a little fitful and sudden, as he had at first been in the exercise of his other recovered faculties; but, this had never been frequently observable, and had grown more and more rare. He studied much, slept little, sustained a great deal of fatigue with ease, and was equably cheerful.", " The horsemen abreast of that cart, frequently point out one man in it with their swords. The leading curiosity is, to know which is he; he stands at the back of the tumbril with his head bent down, to converse with a mere girl who sits on the side of the cart, and holds his hand. He has no curiosity or care for the scene about him, and always speaks to the girl. Here and there in the long street of St. Honore, cries are raised against him. If they move him at all, it is only to a quiet smile, as he shakes his hair a little more loosely about his face. He cannot easily touch his face, his arms being bound. On the steps of a church, awaiting the coming-up of the tumbrils, stands the Spy and prison-sheep. He looks into the first of them: not there. He looks into the second: not there. He already asks himself, \u201cHas he sacrificed me?\u201d when his face clears, as he looks into the third. \u201cWhich is Evremonde?\u201d says a man behind him.", " And shall I hang back, when Tellson's knows this and says this--Tellson's, whose bread I have eaten these sixty years--because I am a little stiff about the joints?

Monseigneur in Town Monseigneur, one of the great lords in power at the Court, held his fortnightly reception in his grand hotel in Paris. Monseigneur was in his inner room, his sanctuary of sanctuaries, the Holiest of Holiests to the crowd of worshippers in the suite of rooms without. Monseigneur was about to take his chocolate. Monseigneur could swallow a great many things with ease, and was by some few sullen minds supposed to be rather rapidly swallowing France; but, his morning's chocolate could not so much as get into the throat of Monseigneur, without the aid of four strong men besides the Cook."], "Who informs theDefarges that Lucie Manette has married Charles Darnay?": [" What proof had he of this?

Defarge was produced, when the court was quiet enough to admit of his being heard, and rapidly expounded the story of the imprisonment, and of his having been a mere boy in the Doctor's service, and of the release, and of the state of the prisoner when released and delivered to him. This short examination followed, for the court was quick with its work. \u201cYou did good service at the taking of the Bastille, citizen?\u201d \u201cI believe so.\u201d Here, an excited woman screeched from the crowd: \u201cYou were one of the best patriots there. Why not say so? You were a cannonier that day there, and you were among the first to enter the accursed fortress when it fell.", " Is it Jerry?\u201d (\u201cI don't like Jerry's voice, if it is Jerry,\u201d growled the guard to himself. \u201cHe's hoarser than suits me, is Jerry.\u201d) \u201cYes, Mr. Lorry.\u201d \u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d \u201cA despatch sent after you from over yonder. T. and Co.\u201d \u201cI know this messenger, guard,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, getting down into the road--assisted from behind more swiftly than politely by the other two passengers, who immediately scrambled into the coach, shut the door, and pulled up the window. \u201cHe may come close; there's nothing wrong.\u201d \u201cI hope there ain't, but I can't make so 'Nation sure of that,\u201d said the guard, in gruff soliloquy. \u201cHallo you!\u201d \u201cWell! And hallo you!\u201d said Jerry, more hoarsely than before. \u201cCome on at a footpace! d'ye mind me? And if you've got holsters to that saddle o' yourn, don't let me see your hand go nigh 'em. For I'm a devil at a quick mistake, and when I make one it takes the form of Lead. So now let's look at you.\u201d The figures of a horse and rider came slowly through the eddying mist, and came to the side of the mail, where the passenger stood."], "Why does theParis mob kill Foulon?": [" O mother of God, this Foulon! O Heaven our suffering! Hear me, my dead baby and my withered father: I swear on my knees, on these stones, to avenge you on Foulon! Husbands, and brothers, and young men, Give us the blood of Foulon, Give us the head of Foulon, Give us the heart of Foulon, Give us the body and soul of Foulon, Rend Foulon to pieces, and dig him into the ground, that grass may grow from him! With these cries, numbers of the women, lashed into blind frenzy, whirled about, striking and tearing at their own friends until they dropped into a passionate swoon, and were only saved by the men belonging to them from being trampled under foot. Nevertheless, not a moment was lost; not a moment! This Foulon was at the Hotel de Ville, and might be loosed. Never, if Saint Antoine knew his own sufferings, insults, and wrongs! Armed men and women flocked out of the Quarter so fast, and drew even these last dregs after them with such a force of suction, that within a quarter of an hour there was not a human creature in Saint Antoine's bosom but a few old crones and the wailing children.", " The men were terrible, in the bloody-minded anger with which they looked from windows, caught up what arms they had, and came pouring down into the streets; but, the women were a sight to chill the boldest. From such household occupations as their bare poverty yielded, from their children, from their aged and their sick crouching on the bare ground famished and naked, they ran out with streaming hair, urging one another, and themselves, to madness with the wildest cries and actions. Villain Foulon taken, my sister! Old Foulon taken, my mother! Miscreant Foulon taken, my daughter! Then, a score of others ran into the midst of these, beating their breasts, tearing their hair, and screaming, Foulon alive! Foulon who told the starving people they might eat grass! Foulon who told my old father that he might eat grass, when I had no bread to give him! Foulon who told my baby it might suck grass, when these breasts were dry with want!", " But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous. In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night; families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their furniture to upholsterers' warehouses for security; the highwayman in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of \u201cthe Captain,\u201d gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and then got shot dead himself by the other four, \u201cin consequence of the failure of his ammunition:\u201d after which the mail was robbed in peace; that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball; thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles's, to search for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences much out of the common way.", " \u201cI throw up. I confess that we were so unpopular with the outrageous mob, that I only got away from England at the risk of being ducked to death, and that Cly was so ferreted up and down, that he never would have got away at all but for that sham. Though how this man knows it was a sham, is a wonder of wonders to me.\u201d \u201cNever you trouble your head about this man,\u201d retorted the contentious Mr. Cruncher; \u201cyou'll have trouble enough with giving your attention to that gentleman. And look here!

Now, it is of no use asking too much of me."], "What is the durationof Manette\u2019s psychological relapse after Lucie leaves for her honeymoon?": [" It is the case of a shock from which he has recovered, so completely, as to be a highly intelligent man, capable of close application of mind, and great exertion of body, and of constantly making fresh additions to his stock of knowledge, which was already very large. But, unfortunately, there has been,\u201d he paused and took a deep breath--\u201ca slight relapse.\u201d The Doctor, in a low voice, asked, \u201cOf how long duration?\u201d \u201cNine days and nights.\u201d \u201cHow did it show itself? I infer,\u201d glancing at his hands again, \u201cin the resumption of some old pursuit connected with the shock?\u201d \u201cThat is the fact.\u201d \u201cNow, did you ever see him,\u201d asked the Doctor, distinctly and collectedly, though in the same low voice, \u201cengaged in that pursuit originally?\u201d \u201cOnce.\u201d \u201cAnd when the relapse fell on him, was he in most respects--or in all respects--as he was then?\u201d \u201cI think in all respects.\u201d \u201cYou spoke of his daughter. Does his daughter know of the relapse?\u201d \u201cNo.", " It was well guarded, and he got up to go among the trusty people who were watching it, when his door suddenly opened, and two figures rushed in, at sight of which he fell back in amazement. Lucie and her father! Lucie with her arms stretched out to him, and with that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified, that it seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give force and power to it in this one passage of her life. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d cried Mr. Lorry, breathless and confused. \u201cWhat is the matter? Lucie! Manette! What has happened? What has brought you here? What is it?\u201d With the look fixed upon him, in her paleness and wildness, she panted out in his arms, imploringly, \u201cO my dear friend! My husband!\u201d \u201cYour husband, Lucie?\u201d \u201cCharles.\u201d \u201cWhat of Charles?\u201d \u201cHere. \u201cHere, in Paris?\u201d \u201cHas been here some days--three or four--I don't know how many--I can't collect my thoughts.", " Doctor Manette received him kindly, and so did Lucie. But, Miss Pross suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body, and retired into the house. She was not unfrequently the victim of this disorder, and she called it, in familiar conversation, \u201ca fit of the jerks.\u201d The Doctor was in his best condition, and looked specially young. The resemblance between him and Lucie was very strong at such times, and as they sat side by side, she leaning on his shoulder, and he resting his arm on the back of her chair, it was very agreeable to trace the likeness. He had been talking all day, on many subjects, and with unusual vivacity. \u201cPray, Doctor Manette,\u201d said Mr. Darnay, as they sat under the plane-tree--and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand, which happened to be the old buildings of London--\u201chave you seen much of the Tower?\u201d \u201cLucie and I have been there; but only casually.", " It has been kept from her, and I hope will always be kept from her. It is known only to myself, and to one other who may be trusted.\u201d The Doctor grasped his hand, and murmured, \u201cThat was very kind. That was very thoughtful!\u201d Mr. Lorry grasped his hand in return, and neither of the two spoke for a little while. \u201cNow, my dear Manette,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, at length, in his most considerate and most affectionate way, \u201cI am a mere man of business, and unfit to cope with such intricate and difficult matters. I do not possess the kind of information necessary; I do not possess the kind of intelligence; I want guiding. There is no man in this world on whom I could so rely for right guidance, as on you. Tell me, how does this relapse come about? Is there danger of another? Could a repetition of it be prevented? How should a repetition of it be treated? How does it come about at all? What can I do for my friend?"], "Who developsa habit of watching and speaking to Lucie as she waits on a Parisstreet corner each day, hoping that Darnay will be able to see herfrom his prison window?": [" After several relapses into business-absorption, Mr. Lorry had become the Doctor's friend, and the quiet street-corner was the sunny part of his life. On this certain fine Sunday, Mr. Lorry walked towards Soho, early in the afternoon, for three reasons of habit. Firstly, because, on fine Sundays, he often walked out, before dinner, with the Doctor and Lucie; secondly, because, on unfavourable Sundays, he was accustomed to be with them as the family friend, talking, reading, looking out of window, and generally getting through the day; thirdly, because he happened to have his own little shrewd doubts to solve, and knew how the ways of the Doctor's household pointed to that time as a likely time for solving them. A quainter corner than the corner where the Doctor lived, was not to be found in London. There was no way through it, and the front windows of the Doctor's lodgings commanded a pleasant little vista of street that had a congenial air of retirement on it.", " \u201cThe rain-drops are still falling, large, heavy, and few,\u201d said Doctor Manette. \u201cIt comes slowly.\u201d \u201cIt comes surely,\u201d said Carton. They spoke low, as people watching and waiting mostly do; as people in a dark room, watching and waiting for Lightning, always do. There was a great hurry in the streets of people speeding away to get shelter before the storm broke; the wonderful corner for echoes resounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going, yet not a footstep was there. \u201cA multitude of people, and yet a solitude!\u201d said Darnay, when they had listened for a while. \u201cIs it not impressive, Mr. Darnay?\u201d asked Lucie. \u201cSometimes, I have sat here of an evening, until I have fancied--but even the shade of a foolish fancy makes me shudder to-night, when all is so black and solemn--\u201d \u201cLet us shudder too. We may know what it is.\u201d \u201cIt will seem nothing to you. Such whims are only impressive as we originate them, I think; they are not to be communicated.", " And it was now, about little Lucie's sixth birthday, that they began to have an awful sound, as of a great storm in France with a dreadful sea rising. On a night in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine, Mr. Lorry came in late, from Tellson's, and sat himself down by Lucie and her husband in the dark window. It was a hot, wild night, and they were all three reminded of the old Sunday night when they had looked at the lightning from the same place. \u201cI began to think,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, pushing his brown wig back, \u201cthat I should have to pass the night at Tellson's. We have been so full of business all day, that we have not known what to do first, or which way to turn. There is such an uneasiness in Paris, that we have actually a run of confidence upon us! Our customers over there, seem not to be able to confide their property to us fast enough. There is positively a mania among some of them for sending it to England.\u201d \u201cThat has a bad look,\u201d said Darnay-- \u201cA bad look, you say, my dear Darnay?", " But you will not be able to see him, my poor child, and even if you could, it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition.\u201d \u201cO show me the place, my father, and I will go there every day.\u201d From that time, in all weathers, she waited there two hours. As the clock struck two, she was there, and at four she turned resignedly away. When it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with her, they went together; at other times she was alone; but, she never missed a single day. It was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street. The hovel of a cutter of wood into lengths for burning, was the only house at that end; all else was wall. On the third day of her being there, he noticed her. \u201cGood day, citizeness.\u201d \u201cGood day, citizen.\u201d This mode of address was now prescribed by decree. It had been established voluntarily some time ago, among the more thorough patriots; but, was now law for everybody."], "Who does thespy John Barsad turn out to be?": [" They left her at the corner of the street, and Carton led the way to Mr. Lorry's, which was within a few minutes' walk. John Barsad, or Solomon Pross, walked at his side. Mr. Lorry had just finished his dinner, and was sitting before a cheery little log or two of fire--perhaps looking into their blaze for the picture of that younger elderly gentleman from Tellson's, who had looked into the red coals at the Royal George at Dover, now a good many years ago. He turned his head as they entered, and showed the surprise with which he saw a stranger. \u201cMiss Pross's brother, sir,\u201d said Sydney. \u201cMr. Barsad.\u201d \u201cBarsad?\u201d repeated the old gentleman, \u201cBarsad? I have an association with the name--and with the face.\u201d \u201cI told you you had a remarkable face, Mr. Barsad,\u201d observed Carton, coolly. \u201cPray sit down.\u201d As he took a chair himself, he supplied the link that Mr. Lorry wanted, by saying to him with a frown, \u201cWitness at that trial.\u201d Mr. Lorry immediately remembered, and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised look of abhorrence.", " As if the estrangement between them had come of any culpability of hers. As if Mr. Lorry had not known it for a fact, years ago, in the quiet corner in Soho, that this precious brother had spent her money and left her! He was saying the affectionate word, however, with a far more grudging condescension and patronage than he could have shown if their relative merits and positions had been reversed (which is invariably the case, all the world over), when Mr. Cruncher, touching him on the shoulder, hoarsely and unexpectedly interposed with the following singular question: \u201cI say! Might I ask the favour? As to whether your name is John Solomon, or Solomon John?\u201d The official turned towards him with sudden distrust. He had not previously uttered a word. \u201cCome!\u201d said Mr. Cruncher. \u201cSpeak out, you know.\u201d (Which, by the way, was more than he could do himself.) \u201cJohn Solomon, or Solomon John? She calls you Solomon, and she must know, being your sister.", " \u201cIt is necessary to register him. How do they call that man?\u201d \u201cHe is English.\u201d \u201cSo much the better. His name?\u201d \u201cBarsad,\u201d said Defarge, making it French by pronunciation. But, he had been so careful to get it accurately, that he then spelt it with perfect correctness. \u201cBarsad,\u201d repeated madame. \u201cGood. Christian name?\u201d \u201cJohn.\u201d \u201cJohn Barsad,\u201d repeated madame, after murmuring it once to herself. \u201cGood. His appearance; is it known?\u201d \u201cAge, about forty years; height, about five feet nine; black hair; complexion dark; generally, rather handsome visage; eyes dark, face thin, long, and sallow; nose aquiline, but not straight, having a peculiar inclination towards the left cheek; expression, therefore, sinister.\u201d \u201cEh my faith. It is a portrait!\u201d said madame, laughing. \u201cHe shall be registered to-morrow.\u201d They turned into the wine-shop, which was closed (for it was midnight), and where Madame Defarge immediately took her post at her desk, counted the small moneys that had been taken during her absence, examined the stock, went through the entries in the book, made other entries of her own, checked the serving man in every possible way, and finally dismissed him to bed.", " That's an excellent card. Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion, that Mr. Barsad, still in the pay of the aristocratic English government, is the spy of Pitt, the treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom, the English traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so difficult to find. That's a card not to be beaten. Have you followed my hand, Mr. Barsad?\u201d \u201cNot to understand your play,\u201d returned the spy, somewhat uneasily. \u201cI play my Ace, Denunciation of Mr. Barsad to the nearest Section Committee. Look over your hand, Mr. Barsad, and see what you have. Don't hurry.\u201d He drew the bottle near, poured out another glassful of brandy, and drank it off. He saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him. Seeing it, he poured out and drank another glassful. \u201cLook over your hand carefully, Mr. Barsad. Take time.\u201d It was a poorer hand than he suspected."], "Why was DoctorManette imprisoned?": [" Do you start for Paris from here?\u201d \u201cFrom here, at eight.\u201d \u201cI will come back, to see you off.\u201d Very ill at ease with himself, and with Stryver and most other men, Darnay made the best of his way into the quiet of the Temple, opened the letter, and read it. These were its contents: \u201cPrison of the Abbaye, Paris. \u201cJune 21, 1792. \u201cMONSIEUR HERETOFORE THE MARQUIS. \u201cAfter having long been in danger of my life at the hands of the village, I have been seized, with great violence and indignity, and brought a long journey on foot to Paris. On the road I have suffered a great deal. Nor is that all; my house has been destroyed--razed to the ground. \u201cThe crime for which I am imprisoned, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, and for which I shall be summoned before the tribunal, and shall lose my life (without your so generous help), is, they tell me, treason against the majesty of the people, in that I have acted against them for an emigrant.", " But, he had oppressed no man, he had imprisoned no man; he was so far from having harshly exacted payment of his dues, that he had relinquished them of his own will, thrown himself on a world with no favour in it, won his own private place there, and earned his own bread. Monsieur Gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate on written instructions, to spare the people, to give them what little there was to give--such fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have in the winter, and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in the summer--and no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof, for his own safety, so that it could not but appear now. This favoured the desperate resolution Charles Darnay had begun to make, that he would go to Paris. Yes. Like the mariner in the old story, the winds and streams had driven him within the influence of the Loadstone Rock, and it was drawing him to itself, and he must go.", " A man with a bloated face opened the strong wicket, to whom Defarge presented \u201cThe Emigrant Evremonde.\u201d \u201cWhat the Devil! How many more of them!\u201d exclaimed the man with the bloated face. Defarge took his receipt without noticing the exclamation, and withdrew, with his two fellow-patriots. \u201cWhat the Devil, I say again!\u201d exclaimed the gaoler, left with his wife. \u201cHow many more!\u201d The gaoler's wife, being provided with no answer to the question, merely replied, \u201cOne must have patience, my dear!\u201d Three turnkeys who entered responsive to a bell she rang, echoed the sentiment, and one added, \u201cFor the love of Liberty;\u201d which sounded in that place like an inappropriate conclusion. The prison of La Force was a gloomy prison, dark and filthy, and with a horrible smell of foul sleep in it. Extraordinary how soon the noisome flavour of imprisoned sleep, becomes manifest in all such places that are ill cared for!", " There was no pause, no pity, no peace, no interval of relenting rest, no measurement of time. Though days and nights circled as regularly as when time was young, and the evening and morning were the first day, other count of time there was none. Hold of it was lost in the raging fever of a nation, as it is in the fever of one patient. Now, breaking the unnatural silence of a whole city, the executioner showed the people the head of the king--and now, it seemed almost in the same breath, the head of his fair wife which had had eight weary months of imprisoned widowhood and misery, to turn it grey. And yet, observing the strange law of contradiction which obtains in all such cases, the time was long, while it flamed by so fast. A revolutionary tribunal in the capital, and forty or fifty thousand revolutionary committees all over the land; a law of the Suspected, which struck away all security for liberty or life, and delivered over any good and innocent person to any bad and guilty one; prisons gorged with people who had committed no offence, and could obtain no hearing; these things became the established order and nature of appointed things, and seemed to be ancient usage before they were many weeks old."], "Who is Miss Pross\u2019s brother, whose real name is Solomon, and a British spy?": [" For, it must be recorded, that not only was Miss Pross lost in amazement and agitation, but, Mr. Cruncher--though it seemed on his own separate and individual account--was in a state of the greatest wonder. \u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d said the man who had caused Miss Pross to scream; speaking in a vexed, abrupt voice (though in a low tone), and in English. \u201cOh, Solomon, dear Solomon!\u201d cried Miss Pross, clapping her hands again. \u201cAfter not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time, do I find you here!\u201d \u201cDon't call me Solomon. Do you want to be the death of me?\u201d asked the man, in a furtive, frightened way. \u201cBrother, brother!\u201d cried Miss Pross, bursting into tears. \u201cHave I ever been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question?\u201d \u201cThen hold your meddlesome tongue,\u201d said Solomon, \u201cand come out, if you want to speak to me. Pay for your wine, and come out. Who's this man?\u201d Miss Pross, shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means affectionate brother, said through her tears, \u201cMr.", " Cruncher.\u201d \u201cLet him come out too,\u201d said Solomon. \u201cDoes he think me a ghost?\u201d Apparently, Mr. Cruncher did, to judge from his looks. He said not a word, however, and Miss Pross, exploring the depths of her reticule through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine. As she did so, Solomon turned to the followers of the Good Republican Brutus of Antiquity, and offered a few words of explanation in the French language, which caused them all to relapse into their former places and pursuits. \u201cNow,\u201d said Solomon, stopping at the dark street corner, \u201cwhat do you want?\u201d \u201cHow dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away from!\u201d cried Miss Pross, \u201cto give me such a greeting, and show me no affection.\u201d \u201cThere. Confound it! There,\u201d said Solomon, making a dab at Miss Pross's lips with his own. \u201cNow are you content?\u201d Miss Pross only shook her head and wept in silence. \u201cIf you expect me to be surprised,\u201d said her brother Solomon, \u201cI am not surprised; I knew you were here; I know of most people who are here.", " He knew enough of the world to know that there is nothing in it better than the faithful service of the heart; so rendered and so free from any mercenary taint, he had such an exalted respect for it, that in the retributive arrangements made by his own mind--we all make such arrangements, more or less--he stationed Miss Pross much nearer to the lower Angels than many ladies immeasurably better got up both by Nature and Art, who had balances at Tellson's. \u201cThere never was, nor will be, but one man worthy of Ladybird,\u201d said Miss Pross; \u201cand that was my brother Solomon, if he hadn't made a mistake in life.\u201d Here again: Mr. Lorry's inquiries into Miss Pross's personal history had established the fact that her brother Solomon was a heartless scoundrel who had stripped her of everything she possessed, as a stake to speculate with, and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore, with no touch of compunction.", " As if the estrangement between them had come of any culpability of hers.

Got out at last, with earth hanging about his face and hair, he would suddenly fan away to dust. The passenger would then start to himself, and lower the window, to get the reality of mist and rain on his cheek. Yet even when his eyes were opened on the mist and rain, on the moving patch of light from the lamps, and the hedge at the roadside retreating by jerks, the night shadows outside the coach would fall into the train of the night shadows within. The real Banking-house by Temple Bar, the real business of the past day, the real strong rooms, the real express sent after him, and the real message returned, would all be there. Out of the midst of them, the ghostly face would rise, and he would accost it again.", " Triumph The dread tribunal of five Judges, Public Prosecutor, and determined Jury, sat every day. Their lists went forth every evening, and were read out by the gaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners. The standard gaoler-joke was, \u201cCome out and listen to the Evening Paper, you inside there!\u201d \u201cCharles Evremonde, called Darnay!\u201d So at last began the Evening Paper at La Force. When a name was called, its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded. Charles Evremonde, called Darnay, had reason to know the usage; he had seen hundreds pass away so. His bloated gaoler, who wore spectacles to read with, glanced over them to assure himself that he had taken his place, and went through the list, making a similar short pause at each name. There were twenty-three names, but only twenty were responded to; for one of the prisoners so summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten, and two had already been guillotined and forgotten.", " And _I_ know you're John, you know. Which of the two goes first? And regarding that name of Pross, likewise. That warn't your name over the water.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cWell, I don't know all I mean, for I can't call to mind what your name was, over the water.\u201d \u201cNo?\u201d \u201cNo. But I'll swear it was a name of two syllables.\u201d \u201cIndeed?\u201d \u201cYes. T'other one's was one syllable. I know you. You was a spy--witness at the Bailey. What, in the name of the Father of Lies, own father to yourself, was you called at that time?\u201d \u201cBarsad,\u201d said another voice, striking in. \u201cThat's the name for a thousand pound!\u201d cried Jerry. The speaker who struck in, was Sydney Carton. He had his hands behind him under the skirts of his riding-coat, and he stood at Mr. Cruncher's elbow as negligently as he might have stood at the Old Bailey itself. \u201cDon't be alarmed, my dear Miss Pross. I arrived at Mr. Lorry's, to his surprise, yesterday evening; we agreed that I would not present myself elsewhere until all was well, or unless I could be useful; I present myself here, to beg a little talk with your brother.", " The House approached Mr. Lorry, and laying a soiled and unopened letter before him, asked if he had yet discovered any traces of the person to whom it was addressed? The House laid the letter down so close to Darnay that he saw the direction--the more quickly because it was his own right name. The address, turned into English, ran: \u201cVery pressing. To Monsieur heretofore the Marquis St. Evremonde, of France. Confided to the cares of Messrs. Tellson and Co., Bankers, London, England.\u201d On the marriage morning, Doctor Manette had made it his one urgent and express request to Charles Darnay, that the secret of this name should be--unless he, the Doctor, dissolved the obligation--kept inviolate between them. Nobody else knew it to be his name; his own wife had no suspicion of the fact; Mr. Lorry could have none. \u201cNo,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, in reply to the House; \u201cI have referred it, I think, to everybody now here, and no one can tell me where this gentleman is to be found.\u201d The hands of the clock verging upon the hour of closing the Bank, there was a general set of the current of talkers past Mr. Lorry's desk."], "Whose side occupation is as a \u201cResurrection-Man\u201d?": [" The crowd about him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant, and from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back; at last it got to Jerry: \u201cWitnesses.\u201d \u201cFor which side?\u201d \u201cAgainst.\u201d \u201cAgainst what side?\u201d \u201cThe prisoner's.\u201d The Judge, whose eyes had gone in the general direction, recalled them, leaned back in his seat, and looked steadily at the man whose life was in his hand, as Mr. Attorney-General rose to spin the rope, grind the axe, and hammer the nails into the scaffold. III. A Disappointment Mr. Attorney-General had to inform the jury, that the prisoner before them, though young in years, was old in the treasonable practices which claimed the forfeit of his life. That this correspondence with the public enemy was not a correspondence of to-day, or of yesterday, or even of last year, or of the year before. That, it was certain the prisoner had, for longer than that, been in the habit of passing and repassing between France and England, on secret business of which he could give no honest account.", " There was no fish for breakfast, and not much of anything else. Mr. Cruncher was out of spirits, and out of temper, and kept an iron pot-lid by him as a projectile for the correction of Mrs. Cruncher, in case he should observe any symptoms of her saying Grace. He was brushed and washed at the usual hour, and set off with his son to pursue his ostensible calling. Young Jerry, walking with the stool under his arm at his father's side along sunny and crowded Fleet-street, was a very different Young Jerry from him of the previous night, running home through darkness and solitude from his grim pursuer. His cunning was fresh with the day, and his qualms were gone with the night--in which particulars it is not improbable that he had compeers in Fleet-street and the City of London, that fine morning. \u201cFather,\u201d said Young Jerry, as they walked along: taking care to keep at arm's length and to have the stool well between them: \u201cwhat's a Resurrection-Man?\u201d Mr. Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered, \u201cHow should I know?\u201d \u201cI thought you knowed everything, father,\u201d said the artless boy.", " \u201cCourage, dear miss! Courage! Business! The worst will be over in a moment; it is but passing the room-door, and the worst is over. Then, all the good you bring to him, all the relief, all the happiness you bring to him, begin. Let our good friend here, assist you on that side. That's well, friend Defarge. Come, now. Business, business!\u201d They went up slowly and softly. The staircase was short, and they were soon at the top. There, as it had an abrupt turn in it, they came all at once in sight of three men, whose heads were bent down close together at the side of a door, and who were intently looking into the room to which the door belonged, through some chinks or holes in the wall. On hearing footsteps close at hand, these three turned, and rose, and showed themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the wine-shop. \u201cI forgot them in the surprise of your visit,\u201d explained Monsieur Defarge.", " He occupied rooms in the Bank, in his fidelity to the House of which he had grown to be a part, like strong root-ivy. It chanced that they derived a kind of security from the patriotic occupation of the main building, but the true-hearted old gentleman never calculated about that. All such circumstances were indifferent to him, so that he did his duty. On the opposite side of the courtyard, under a colonnade, was extensive standing--for carriages--where, indeed, some carriages of Monseigneur yet stood. Against two of the pillars were fastened two great flaring flambeaux, and in the light of these, standing out in the open air, was a large grindstone: a roughly mounted thing which appeared to have hurriedly been brought there from some neighbouring smithy, or other workshop. Rising and looking out of window at these harmless objects, Mr. Lorry shivered, and retired to his seat by the fire."], "What saves Sydney Carton from his self-proclaimed wasted life?": [" _I_ know it well, but do you know it? In your own heart, do you feel quite certain?\u201d Her father answered, with a cheerful firmness of conviction he could scarcely have assumed, \u201cQuite sure, my darling! More than that,\u201d he added, as he tenderly kissed her: \u201cmy future is far brighter, Lucie, seen through your marriage, than it could have been--nay, than it ever was--without it.\u201d \u201cIf I could hope _that_, my father!--\u201d \u201cBelieve it, love! Indeed it is so. Consider how natural and how plain it is, my dear, that it should be so. You, devoted and young, cannot fully appreciate the anxiety I have felt that your life should not be wasted--\u201d She moved her hand towards his lips, but he took it in his, and repeated the word. \u201c--wasted, my child--should not be wasted, struck aside from the natural order of things--for my sake. Your unselfishness cannot entirely comprehend how much my mind has gone on this; but, only ask yourself, how could my happiness be perfect, while yours was incomplete?\u201d \u201cIf I had never seen Charles, my father, I should have been quite happy with you.\u201d He smiled at her unconscious admission that she would have been unhappy without Charles, having seen him; and replied: \u201cMy child, you did see him, and it is Charles.", " \u201cDon't despond,\u201d said Carton, very gently; \u201cdon't grieve. I encouraged Doctor Manette in this idea, because I felt that it might one day be consolatory to her. Otherwise, she might think 'his life was wantonly thrown away or wasted,' and that might trouble her.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, yes,\u201d returned Mr. Lorry, drying his eyes, \u201cyou are right. But he will perish; there is no real hope.\u201d \u201cYes. He will perish: there is no real hope,\u201d echoed Carton. And walked with a settled step, down-stairs. XII. Darkness Sydney Carton paused in the street, not quite decided where to go. \u201cAt Tellson's banking-house at nine,\u201d he said, with a musing face. \u201cShall I do well, in the mean time, to show myself? I think so. It is best that these people should know there is such a man as I here; it is a sound precaution, and may be a necessary preparation. But care, care, care! Let me think it out!\u201d Checking his steps which had begun to tend towards an object, he took a turn or two in the already darkening street, and traced the thought in his mind to its possible consequences.", " Why do I do it?\u201d \u201cI never saw you do it yet,\u201d muttered Carton. \u201cI do it because it's politic; I do it on principle. And look at me! I get on.\u201d \u201cYou don't get on with your account of your matrimonial intentions,\u201d answered Carton, with a careless air; \u201cI wish you would keep to that. As to me--will you never understand that I am incorrigible?\u201d He asked the question with some appearance of scorn. \u201cYou have no business to be incorrigible,\u201d was his friend's answer, delivered in no very soothing tone. \u201cI have no business to be, at all, that I know of,\u201d said Sydney Carton. \u201cWho is the lady?\u201d \u201cNow, don't let my announcement of the name make you uncomfortable, Sydney,\u201d said Mr. Stryver, preparing him with ostentatious friendliness for the disclosure he was about to make, \u201cbecause I know you don't mean half you say; and if you meant it all, it would be of no importance. I make this little preface, because you once mentioned the young lady to me in slighting terms.\u201d \u201cI did?\u201d \u201cCertainly; and in these chambers.\u201d Sydney Carton looked at his punch and looked at his complacent friend; drank his punch and looked at his complacent friend.", " His indifference to fire was sufficiently remarkable to elicit a word of remonstrance from Mr. Lorry; his boot was still upon the hot embers of the flaming log, when it had broken under the weight of his foot. \u201cI forgot it,\u201d he said. Mr. Lorry's eyes were again attracted to his face. Taking note of the wasted air which clouded the naturally handsome features, and having the expression of prisoners' faces fresh in his mind, he was strongly reminded of that expression. \u201cAnd your duties here have drawn to an end, sir?\u201d said Carton, turning to him. \u201cYes. As I was telling you last night when Lucie came in so unexpectedly, I have at length done all that I can do here. I hoped to have left them in perfect safety, and then to have quitted Paris. I have my Leave to Pass. I was ready to go.\u201d They were both silent. \u201cYours is a long life to look back upon, sir?\u201d said Carton, wistfully. \u201cI am in my seventy-eighth year.\u201d \u201cYou have been useful all your life; steadily and constantly occupied; trusted, respected, and looked up to?\u201d \u201cI have been a man of business, ever since I have been a man."], "What did Monsieur Defarge do before he was a wine shop owner and revolutionary?": [" Knitting There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. As early as six o'clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping through its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending over measures of wine. Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that he sold at this time. A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy. No vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur Defarge: but, a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay hidden in the dregs of it. This had been the third morning in succession, on which there had been early drinking at the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. It had begun on Monday, and here was Wednesday come. There had been more of early brooding than drinking; for, many men had listened and whispered and slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door, who could not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls.", " He knew beforehand what the price of his luxury was; he has paid the price.\u201d \u201cI believe,\u201d said the spy, dropping his soft voice to a tone that invited confidence, and expressing an injured revolutionary susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face: \u201cI believe there is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood, touching the poor fellow? Between ourselves.\u201d \u201cIs there?\u201d asked madame, vacantly. \u201cIs there not?\u201d \u201c--Here is my husband!\u201d said Madame Defarge. As the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door, the spy saluted him by touching his hat, and saying, with an engaging smile, \u201cGood day, Jacques!\u201d Defarge stopped short, and stared at him. \u201cGood day, Jacques!\u201d the spy repeated; with not quite so much confidence, or quite so easy a smile under the stare. \u201cYou deceive yourself, monsieur,\u201d returned the keeper of the wine-shop. \u201cYou mistake me for another. That is not my name. I am Ernest Defarge.\u201d \u201cIt is all the same,\u201d said the spy, airily, but discomfited too: \u201cgood day!\u201d \u201cGood day!\u201d answered Defarge, drily.", " As he passed behind the counter, he took notice that the elderly gentleman said in a look to the young lady, \u201cThis is our man.\u201d \u201cWhat the devil do _you_ do in that galley there?\u201d said Monsieur Defarge to himself; \u201cI don't know you.\u201d But, he feigned not to notice the two strangers, and fell into discourse with the triumvirate of customers who were drinking at the counter. \u201cHow goes it, Jacques?\u201d said one of these three to Monsieur Defarge. \u201cIs all the spilt wine swallowed?\u201d \u201cEvery drop, Jacques,\u201d answered Monsieur Defarge. When this interchange of Christian name was effected, Madame Defarge, picking her teeth with her toothpick, coughed another grain of cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line. \u201cIt is not often,\u201d said the second of the three, addressing Monsieur Defarge, \u201cthat many of these miserable beasts know the taste of wine, or of anything but black bread and death.", " \u201cWillingly, sir,\u201d said Monsieur Defarge, and quietly stepped with him to the door. Their conference was very short, but very decided. Almost at the first word, Monsieur Defarge started and became deeply attentive. It had not lasted a minute, when he nodded and went out. The gentleman then beckoned to the young lady, and they, too, went out. Madame Defarge knitted with nimble fingers and steady eyebrows, and saw nothing. Mr. Jarvis Lorry and Miss Manette, emerging from the wine-shop thus, joined Monsieur Defarge in the doorway to which he had directed his own company just before. It opened from a stinking little black courtyard, and was the general public entrance to a great pile of houses, inhabited by a great number of people. In the gloomy tile-paved entry to the gloomy tile-paved staircase, Monsieur Defarge bent down on one knee to the child of his old master, and put her hand to his lips."], "Which characters go through profound transformations?": [" And yet there is not in France, with its rich variety of soil and climate, a blade, a leaf, a root, a sprig, a peppercorn, which will grow to maturity under conditions more certain than those that have produced this horror. Crush humanity out of shape once more, under similar hammers, and it will twist itself into the same tortured forms. Sow the same seed of rapacious license and oppression over again, and it will surely yield the same fruit according to its kind. Six tumbrils roll along the streets. Change these back again to what they were, thou powerful enchanter, Time, and they shall be seen to be the carriages of absolute monarchs, the equipages of feudal nobles, the toilettes of flaring Jezebels, the churches that are not my father's house but dens of thieves, the huts of millions of starving peasants! No; the great magician who majestically works out the appointed order of the Creator, never reverses his transformations.", " Look at him. Look at me. Is there no old banker, no old business, no old servant, no old time, rising in your mind, Monsieur Manette?\u201d As the captive of many years sat looking fixedly, by turns, at Mr. Lorry and at Defarge, some long obliterated marks of an actively intent intelligence in the middle of the forehead, gradually forced themselves through the black mist that had fallen on him. They were overclouded again, they were fainter, they were gone; but they had been there. And so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him, and where she now stood looking at him, with hands which at first had been only raised in frightened compassion, if not even to keep him off and shut out the sight of him, but which were now extending towards him, trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young breast, and love it back to life and hope--so exactly was the expression repeated (though in stronger characters) on her fair young face, that it looked as though it had passed like a moving light, from him to her.", " Now, the stake I have resolved to play for, in case of the worst, is a friend in the Conciergerie. And the friend I purpose to myself to win, is Mr. Barsad.\u201d \u201cYou need have good cards, sir,\u201d said the spy. \u201cI'll run them over. I'll see what I hold,--Mr. Lorry, you know what a brute I am; I wish you'd give me a little brandy.\u201d It was put before him, and he drank off a glassful--drank off another glassful--pushed the bottle thoughtfully away. \u201cMr. Barsad,\u201d he went on, in the tone of one who really was looking over a hand at cards: \u201cSheep of the prisons, emissary of Republican committees, now turnkey, now prisoner, always spy and secret informer, so much the more valuable here for being English that an Englishman is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a Frenchman, represents himself to his employers under a false name. That's a very good card. Mr. Barsad, now in the employ of the republican French government, was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic English government, the enemy of France and freedom.", " I had kept the matter a profound secret, even from my wife; and this, too, I resolved to state in my letter. I had no apprehension whatever of my real danger; but I was conscious that there might be danger for others, if others were compromised by possessing the knowledge that I possessed. \u201cI was much engaged that day, and could not complete my letter that night. I rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it. It was the last day of the year. The letter was lying before me just completed, when I was told that a lady waited, who wished to see me. ***** \u201cI am growing more and more unequal to the task I have set myself. It is so cold, so dark, my senses are so benumbed, and the gloom upon me is so dreadful. \u201cThe lady was young, engaging, and handsome, but not marked for long life. She was in great agitation. She presented herself to me as the wife of the Marquis St. Evremonde. I connected the title by which the boy had addressed the elder brother, with the initial letter embroidered on the scarf, and had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that I had seen that nobleman very lately."], "What helps explain Madame Defarge\u2019s vengefulness and bloodlust?": [" It was a passionate, loving, thankful, womanly action, but the hand made no response--dropped cold and heavy, and took to its knitting again. There was something in its touch that gave Lucie a check. She stopped in the act of putting the note in her bosom, and, with her hands yet at her neck, looked terrified at Madame Defarge. Madame Defarge met the lifted eyebrows and forehead with a cold, impassive stare. \u201cMy dear,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, striking in to explain; \u201cthere are frequent risings in the streets; and, although it is not likely they will ever trouble you, Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power to protect at such times, to the end that she may know them--that she may identify them. I believe,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, rather halting in his reassuring words, as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself upon him more and more, \u201cI state the case, Citizen Defarge?\u201d Defarge looked gloomily at his wife, and gave no other answer than a gruff sound of acquiescence.", " The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to fall, threatening and dark, on both the mother and the child. \u201cIt is enough, my husband,\u201d said Madame Defarge. \u201cI have seen them. We may go.\u201d But, the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it--not visible and presented, but indistinct and withheld--to alarm Lucie into saying, as she laid her appealing hand on Madame Defarge's dress: \u201cYou will be good to my poor husband. You will do him no harm. You will help me to see him if you can?\u201d \u201cYour husband is not my business here,\u201d returned Madame Defarge, looking down at her with perfect composure. \u201cIt is the daughter of your father who is my business here.\u201d \u201cFor my sake, then, be merciful to my husband. For my child's sake! She will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful. We are more afraid of you than of these others.\u201d Madame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her husband.", " Good day, one and all!\u201d \u201cHave the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a mouthful of cool fresh water, madame.\u201d Madame complied with a polite air. \u201cMarvellous cognac this, madame!\u201d It was the first time it had ever been so complimented, and Madame Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better. She said, however, that the cognac was flattered, and took up her knitting. The visitor watched her fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity of observing the place in general. \u201cYou knit with great skill, madame.\u201d \u201cI am accustomed to it.\u201d \u201cA pretty pattern too!\u201d \u201c_You_ think so?\u201d said madame, looking at him with a smile. \u201cDecidedly. May one ask what it is for?\u201d \u201cPastime,\u201d said madame, still looking at him with a smile while her fingers moved nimbly. \u201cNot for use?\u201d \u201cThat depends. I may find a use for it one day. If I do--Well,\u201d said madame, drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of coquetry, \u201cI'll use it!\u201d It was remarkable; but, the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge.", " Wife of Evremonde! Child of Evremonde! Any person but this miserable fool, answer the Citizeness Defarge!\u201d Perhaps the following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in the expression of Miss Pross's face, perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from either suggestion, whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone. Three of the doors she opened swiftly, and looked in. \u201cThose rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing, there are odds and ends upon the ground. There is no one in that room behind you! Let me look.\u201d \u201cNever!\u201d said Miss Pross, who understood the request as perfectly as Madame Defarge understood the answer. \u201cIf they are not in that room, they are gone, and can be pursued and brought back,\u201d said Madame Defarge to herself. \u201cAs long as you don't know whether they are in that room or not, you are uncertain what to do,\u201d said Miss Pross to herself; \u201cand you shall not know that, if I can prevent your knowing it; and know that, or not know that, you shall not leave here while I can hold you.\u201d \u201cI have been in the streets from the first, nothing has stopped me, I will tear you to pieces, but I will have you from that door,\u201d said Madame Defarge."], "What characterizes Lucie?": [" It was well guarded, and he got up to go among the trusty people who were watching it, when his door suddenly opened, and two figures rushed in, at sight of which he fell back in amazement. Lucie and her father! Lucie with her arms stretched out to him, and with that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified, that it seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give force and power to it in this one passage of her life. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d cried Mr. Lorry, breathless and confused. \u201cWhat is the matter? Lucie! Manette! What has happened? What has brought you here? What is it?\u201d With the look fixed upon him, in her paleness and wildness, she panted out in his arms, imploringly, \u201cO my dear friend!

That night--it was the fourteenth of August--he sat up late, and wrote two fervent letters; one was to Lucie, explaining the strong obligation he was under to go to Paris, and showing her, at length, the reasons that he had, for feeling confident that he could become involved in no personal danger there; the other was to the Doctor, confiding Lucie and their dear child to his care, and dwelling on the same topics with the strongest assurances.", " Doctor Manette received him kindly, and so did Lucie. But, Miss Pross suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body, and retired into the house. She was not unfrequently the victim of this disorder, and she called it, in familiar conversation, \u201ca fit of the jerks.\u201d The Doctor was in his best condition, and looked specially young. The resemblance between him and Lucie was very strong at such times, and as they sat side by side, she leaning on his shoulder, and he resting his arm on the back of her chair, it was very agreeable to trace the likeness. He had been talking all day, on many subjects, and with unusual vivacity. \u201cPray, Doctor Manette,\u201d said Mr. Darnay, as they sat under the plane-tree--and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand, which happened to be the old buildings of London--\u201chave you seen much of the Tower?\u201d \u201cLucie and I have been there; but only casually.", " I knew it would be so; I knew I could help Charles out of all danger; I told Lucie so.--What is that noise?\u201d His hand was again upon the window. \u201cDon't look!\u201d cried Mr. Lorry, absolutely desperate. \u201cNo, Lucie, my dear, nor you!\u201d He got his arm round her, and held her. \u201cDon't be so terrified, my love. I solemnly swear to you that I know of no harm having happened to Charles; that I had no suspicion even of his being in this fatal place.

There is no help for you in any action on your part to-night; you cannot possibly stir out. I say this, because what I must bid you to do for Charles's sake, is the hardest thing to do of all. You must instantly be obedient, still, and quiet."], "Which character can be interpreted as being redeemed by actions?": [" Her father thanks you.\u201d He offered his hand; but his eyes did not go with it. \u201cI know,\u201d said Darnay, respectfully, \u201chow can I fail to know, Doctor Manette, I who have seen you together from day to day, that between you and Miss Manette there is an affection so unusual, so touching, so belonging to the circumstances in which it has been nurtured, that it can have few parallels, even in the tenderness between a father and child. I know, Doctor Manette--how can I fail to know--that, mingled with the affection and duty of a daughter who has become a woman, there is, in her heart, towards you, all the love and reliance of infancy itself. I know that, as in her childhood she had no parent, so she is now devoted to you with all the constancy and fervour of her present years and character, united to the trustfulness and attachment of the early days in which you were lost to her. I know perfectly well that if you had been restored to her from the world beyond this life, you could hardly be invested, in her sight, with a more sacred character than that in which you are always with her.", " We have seen enough of it, to know that it teems with interest; little more.\u201d \u201c_I_ have been there, as you remember,\u201d said Darnay, with a smile, though reddening a little angrily, \u201cin another character, and not in a character that gives facilities for seeing much of it. They told me a curious thing when I was there.\u201d \u201cWhat was that?\u201d Lucie asked. \u201cIn making some alterations, the workmen came upon an old dungeon, which had been, for many years, built up and forgotten. Every stone of its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by prisoners--dates, names, complaints, and prayers. Upon a corner stone in an angle of the wall, one prisoner, who seemed to have gone to execution, had cut as his last work, three letters. They were done with some very poor instrument, and hurriedly, with an unsteady hand. At first, they were read as D. I. C.; but, on being more carefully examined, the last letter was found to be G. There was no record or legend of any prisoner with those initials, and many fruitless guesses were made what the name could have been.", " The shadows of the wintry afternoon were beginning to fall, and even now the dreadful carts were rolling through the streets. Her mind pursued them, looking for him among the Condemned; and then she clung closer to his real presence and trembled more. Her father, cheering her, showed a compassionate superiority to this woman's weakness, which was wonderful to see. No garret, no shoemaking, no One Hundred and Five, North Tower, now! He had accomplished the task he had set himself, his promise was redeemed, he had saved Charles. Let them all lean upon him. Their housekeeping was of a very frugal kind: not only because that was the safest way of life, involving the least offence to the people, but because they were not rich, and Charles, throughout his imprisonment, had had to pay heavily for his bad food, and for his guard, and towards the living of the poorer prisoners. Partly on this account, and partly to avoid a domestic spy, they kept no servant; the citizen and citizeness who acted as porters at the courtyard gate, rendered them occasional service; and Jerry (almost wholly transferred to them by Mr. Lorry) had become their daily retainer, and had his bed there every night.", " Come into the dark room here, and let us have one final word alone.\u201d IX. The Game Made While Sydney Carton and the Sheep of the prisons were in the adjoining dark room, speaking so low that not a sound was heard, Mr. Lorry looked at Jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust. That honest tradesman's manner of receiving the look, did not inspire confidence; he changed the leg on which he rested, as often as if he had fifty of those limbs, and were trying them all; he examined his finger-nails with a very questionable closeness of attention; and whenever Mr. Lorry's eye caught his, he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the hollow of a hand before it, which is seldom, if ever, known to be an infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character. \u201cJerry,\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cCome here.\u201d Mr. Cruncher came forward sideways, with one of his shoulders in advance of him. \u201cWhat have you been, besides a messenger?\u201d After some cogitation, accompanied with an intent look at his patron, Mr. Cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying, \u201cAgicultooral character.\u201d \u201cMy mind misgives me much,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, angrily shaking a forefinger at him, \u201cthat you have used the respectable and great house of Tellson's as a blind, and that you have had an unlawful occupation of an infamous description."], "Which characters have been singled out by critics as being too flat?": [" There was nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness and eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger. Neither did the people say anything; after the first cry, they had been silent, and they remained so. The voice of the submissive man who had spoken, was flat and tame in its extreme submission. Monsieur the Marquis ran his eyes over them all, as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes. He took out his purse. \u201cIt is extraordinary to me,\u201d said he, \u201cthat you people cannot take care of yourselves and your children. One or the other of you is for ever in the way. How do I know what injury you have done my horses. See! Give him that.\u201d He threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up, and all the heads craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell. The tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry, \u201cDead!\u201d He was arrested by the quick arrival of another man, for whom the rest made way.", " Look at him. Look at me. Is there no old banker, no old business, no old servant, no old time, rising in your mind, Monsieur Manette?\u201d As the captive of many years sat looking fixedly, by turns, at Mr. Lorry and at Defarge, some long obliterated marks of an actively intent intelligence in the middle of the forehead, gradually forced themselves through the black mist that had fallen on him. They were overclouded again, they were fainter, they were gone; but they had been there. And so exactly was the expression repeated on the fair young face of her who had crept along the wall to a point where she could see him, and where she now stood looking at him, with hands which at first had been only raised in frightened compassion, if not even to keep him off and shut out the sight of him, but which were now extending towards him, trembling with eagerness to lay the spectral face upon her warm young breast, and love it back to life and hope--so exactly was the expression repeated (though in stronger characters) on her fair young face, that it looked as though it had passed like a moving light, from him to her.", " Now, the stake I have resolved to play for, in case of the worst, is a friend in the Conciergerie. And the friend I purpose to myself to win, is Mr. Barsad.\u201d \u201cYou need have good cards, sir,\u201d said the spy. \u201cI'll run them over. I'll see what I hold,--Mr. Lorry, you know what a brute I am; I wish you'd give me a little brandy.\u201d It was put before him, and he drank off a glassful--drank off another glassful--pushed the bottle thoughtfully away. \u201cMr. Barsad,\u201d he went on, in the tone of one who really was looking over a hand at cards: \u201cSheep of the prisons, emissary of Republican committees, now turnkey, now prisoner, always spy and secret informer, so much the more valuable here for being English that an Englishman is less open to suspicion of subornation in those characters than a Frenchman, represents himself to his employers under a false name. That's a very good card.

It is useless to say it, I know, but it rises out of my soul. For you, and for any dear to you, I would do anything. If my career were of that better kind that there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it, I would embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you. Try to hold me in your mind, at some quiet times, as ardent and sincere in this one thing.

Hurry, hurry!\u201d As if his memory were impaired, or his faculties disordered, the prisoner made an effort to rally his attention. As he looked at Carton with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing, Carton--his hand again in his breast--looked steadily at him. \u201cHurry, hurry!\u201d The prisoner bent over the paper, once more. \u201c'If it had been otherwise;'\u201d Carton's hand was again watchfully and softly stealing down; \u201c'I never should have used the longer opportunity.

Before that unjust Tribunal, there was little or no order of procedure, ensuring to any accused person any reasonable hearing. There could have been no such Revolution, if all laws, forms, and ceremonies, had not first been so monstrously abused, that the suicidal vengeance of the Revolution was to scatter them all to the winds. Every eye was turned to the jury. The same determined patriots and good republicans as yesterday and the day before, and to-morrow and the day after. Eager and prominent among them, one man with a craving face, and his fingers perpetually hovering about his lips, whose appearance gave great satisfaction to the spectators. A life-thirsting, cannibal-looking, bloody-minded juryman, the Jacques Three of St. Antoine. The whole jury, as a jury of dogs empannelled to try the deer.", " His resolution was made. He must go to Paris. Yes. The Loadstone Rock was drawing him, and he must sail on, until he struck. He knew of no rock; he saw hardly any danger. The intention with which he had done what he had done, even although he had left it incomplete, presented it before him in an aspect that would be gratefully acknowledged in France on his presenting himself to assert it. Then, that glorious vision of doing good, which is so often the sanguine mirage of so many good minds, arose before him, and he even saw himself in the illusion with some influence to guide this raging Revolution that was running so fearfully wild. As he walked to and fro with his resolution made, he considered that neither Lucie nor her father must know of it until he was gone. Lucie should be spared the pain of separation; and her father, always reluctant to turn his thoughts towards the dangerous ground of old, should come to the knowledge of the step, as a step taken, and not in the balance of suspense and doubt.", " Having supposed that there was sense where there is no sense, and a laudable ambition where there is not a laudable ambition, I am well out of my mistake, and no harm is done. Young women have committed similar follies often before, and have repented them in poverty and obscurity often before. In an unselfish aspect, I am sorry that the thing is dropped, because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view; in a selfish aspect, I am glad that the thing has dropped, because it would have been a bad thing for me in a worldly point of view--it is hardly necessary to say I could have gained nothing by it. There is no harm at all done. I have not proposed to the young lady, and, between ourselves, I am by no means certain, on reflection, that I ever should have committed myself to that extent. Mr. Lorry, you cannot control the mincing vanities and giddinesses of empty-headed girls; you must not expect to do it, or you will always be disappointed.", " He had got somebody to scrawl it up for him, however, who had squeezed Death in with most inappropriate difficulty. On his house-top, he displayed pike and cap, as a good citizen must, and in a window he had stationed his saw inscribed as his \u201cLittle Sainte Guillotine\u201d--for the great sharp female was by that time popularly canonised. His shop was shut and he was not there, which was a relief to Lucie, and left her quite alone. But, he was not far off, for presently she heard a troubled movement and a shouting coming along, which filled her with fear. A moment afterwards, and a throng of people came pouring round the corner by the prison wall, in the midst of whom was the wood-sawyer hand in hand with The Vengeance. There could not be fewer than five hundred people, and they were dancing like five thousand demons. There was no other music than their own singing. They danced to the popular Revolution song, keeping a ferocious time that was like a gnashing of teeth in unison."], "Which one of these is not \u201ca double\u201d in the narrative?": [" \u201c'Monsieur,' said I, 'in my profession, the communications of patients are always received in confidence.' I was guarded in my answer, for I was troubled in my mind with what I had heard and seen. \u201cHer breathing was so difficult to trace, that I carefully tried the pulse and the heart. There was life, and no more. Looking round as I resumed my seat, I found both the brothers intent upon me. ***** \u201cI write with so much difficulty, the cold is so severe, I am so fearful of being detected and consigned to an underground cell and total darkness, that I must abridge this narrative. There is no confusion or failure in my memory; it can recall, and could detail, every word that was ever spoken between me and those brothers. \u201cShe lingered for a week. Towards the last, I could understand some few syllables that she said to me, by placing my ear close to her lips. She asked me where she was, and I told her; who I was, and I told her.", " I denounce them to Heaven and to earth.\u201d A terrible sound arose when the reading of this document was done. A sound of craving and eagerness that had nothing articulate in it but blood. The narrative called up the most revengeful passions of the time, and there was not a head in the nation but must have dropped before it. Little need, in presence of that tribunal and that auditory, to show how the Defarges had not made the paper public, with the other captured Bastille memorials borne in procession, and had kept it, biding their time. Little need to show that this detested family name had long been anathematised by Saint Antoine, and was wrought into the fatal register. The man never trod ground whose virtues and services would have sustained him in that place that day, against such denunciation. And all the worse for the doomed man, that the denouncer was a well-known citizen, his own attached friend, the father of his wife.", " Two score and twelve were told off. From the farmer-general of seventy, whose riches could not buy his life, to the seamstress of twenty, whose poverty and obscurity could not save her. Physical diseases, engendered in the vices and neglects of men, will seize on victims of all degrees; and the frightful moral disorder, born of unspeakable suffering, intolerable oppression, and heartless indifference, smote equally without distinction. Charles Darnay, alone in a cell, had sustained himself with no flattering delusion since he came to it from the Tribunal. In every line of the narrative he had heard, he had heard his condemnation. He had fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him, that he was virtually sentenced by the millions, and that units could avail him nothing. Nevertheless, it was not easy, with the face of his beloved wife fresh before him, to compose his mind to what it must bear.", " The led cows, hastily brought in and tethered to anything that would hold them, were looking stupidly on, or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their trouble, which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter. Some of the people of the chateau, and some of those of the posting-house, and all the taxing authorities, were armed more or less, and were crowded on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way, that was highly fraught with nothing. Already, the mender of roads had penetrated into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends, and was smiting himself in the breast with his blue cap.

The Wine-shop A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street. The accident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled out with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just outside the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell. All the people within reach had suspended their business, or their idleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine. The rough, irregular stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them, had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own jostling group or crowd, according to its size. Some men kneeled down, made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all run out between their fingers. Others, men and women, dipped in the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with handkerchiefs from women's heads, which were squeezed dry into infants' mouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it ran; others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new directions; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed pieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted fragments with eager relish.", " Now, Heaven defeat the fancy of Lucie Darnay, and keep these feet far out of her life! For, they are headlong, mad, and dangerous; and in the years so long after the breaking of the cask at Defarge's wine-shop door, they are not easily purified when once stained red. XXII. The Sea Still Rises Haggard Saint Antoine had had only one exultant week, in which to soften his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could, with the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations, when Madame Defarge sat at her counter, as usual, presiding over the customers. Madame Defarge wore no rose in her head, for the great brotherhood of Spies had become, even in one short week, extremely chary of trusting themselves to the saint's mercies. The lamps across his streets had a portentously elastic swing with them. Madame Defarge, with her arms folded, sat in the morning light and heat, contemplating the wine-shop and the street.", " Those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask, had acquired a tigerish smear about the mouth; and one tall joker so besmirched, his head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it, scrawled upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine-lees--BLOOD. The time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on the street-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there. And now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine, which a momentary gleam had driven from his sacred countenance, the darkness of it was heavy--cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were the lords in waiting on the saintly presence--nobles of great power all of them; but, most especially the last. Samples of a people that had undergone a terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill, and certainly not in the fabulous mill which ground old people young, shivered at every corner, passed in and out at every doorway, looked from every window, fluttered in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook.", " Knitting There had been earlier drinking than usual in the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. As early as six o'clock in the morning, sallow faces peeping through its barred windows had descried other faces within, bending over measures of wine. Monsieur Defarge sold a very thin wine at the best of times, but it would seem to have been an unusually thin wine that he sold at this time. A sour wine, moreover, or a souring, for its influence on the mood of those who drank it was to make them gloomy. No vivacious Bacchanalian flame leaped out of the pressed grape of Monsieur Defarge: but, a smouldering fire that burnt in the dark, lay hidden in the dregs of it. This had been the third morning in succession, on which there had been early drinking at the wine-shop of Monsieur Defarge. It had begun on Monday, and here was Wednesday come. There had been more of early brooding than drinking; for, many men had listened and whispered and slunk about there from the time of the opening of the door, who could not have laid a piece of money on the counter to save their souls."], "Where does A Tale of Two Cities take place?": [" For a few seconds he faintly struggled with the man who had come to lay down his life for him; but, within a minute or so, he was stretched insensible on the ground. Quickly, but with hands as true to the purpose as his heart was, Carton dressed himself in the clothes the prisoner had laid aside, combed back his hair, and tied it with the ribbon the prisoner had worn. Then, he softly called, \u201cEnter there! Come in!\u201d and the Spy presented himself. \u201cYou see?\u201d said Carton, looking up, as he kneeled on one knee beside the insensible figure, putting the paper in the breast: \u201cis your hazard very great?\u201d \u201cMr. Carton,\u201d the Spy answered, with a timid snap of his fingers, \u201cmy hazard is not _that_, in the thick of business here, if you are true to the whole of your bargain.\u201d \u201cDon't fear me. I will be true to the death.\u201d \u201cYou must be, Mr. Carton, if the tale of fifty-two is to be right.

Thus, the rustling of an Angel's wings got blended with the other echoes, and they were not wholly of earth, but had in them that breath of Heaven. Sighs of the winds that blew over a little garden-tomb were mingled with them also, and both were audible to Lucie, in a hushed murmur--like the breathing of a summer sea asleep upon a sandy shore--as the little Lucie, comically studious at the task of the morning, or dressing a doll at her mother's footstool, chattered in the tongues of the Two Cities that were blended in her life. The Echoes rarely answered to the actual tread of Sydney Carton. Some half-dozen times a year, at most, he claimed his privilege of coming in uninvited, and would sit among them through the evening, as he had once done often. He never came there heated with wine. And one other thing regarding him was whispered in the echoes, which has been whispered by all true echoes for ages and ages.", " \u201cA moment! Let me speak of it in its place.

Call assistance!\u201d \u201cYou swear not to betray me?\u201d said the trembling Spy, as he paused for a last moment. \u201cMan, man!\u201d returned Carton, stamping his foot; \u201chave I sworn by no solemn vow already, to go through with this, that you waste the precious moments now? Take him yourself to the courtyard you know of, place him yourself in the carriage, show him yourself to Mr. Lorry, tell him yourself to give him no restorative but air, and to remember my words of last night, and his promise of last night, and drive away!\u201d The Spy withdrew, and Carton seated himself at the table, resting his forehead on his hands."], "What is Mr. Lorry\u2019s occupation?": [" Come into the dark room here, and let us have one final word alone.\u201d IX. The Game Made While Sydney Carton and the Sheep of the prisons were in the adjoining dark room, speaking so low that not a sound was heard, Mr. Lorry looked at Jerry in considerable doubt and mistrust. That honest tradesman's manner of receiving the look, did not inspire confidence; he changed the leg on which he rested, as often as if he had fifty of those limbs, and were trying them all; he examined his finger-nails with a very questionable closeness of attention; and whenever Mr. Lorry's eye caught his, he was taken with that peculiar kind of short cough requiring the hollow of a hand before it, which is seldom, if ever, known to be an infirmity attendant on perfect openness of character. \u201cJerry,\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cCome here.\u201d Mr. Cruncher came forward sideways, with one of his shoulders in advance of him. \u201cWhat have you been, besides a messenger?\u201d After some cogitation, accompanied with an intent look at his patron, Mr. Cruncher conceived the luminous idea of replying, \u201cAgicultooral character.\u201d \u201cMy mind misgives me much,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, angrily shaking a forefinger at him, \u201cthat you have used the respectable and great house of Tellson's as a blind, and that you have had an unlawful occupation of an infamous description.", " \u201cWhy, no, thank you; this is a private visit to yourself, Mr. Lorry; I have come for a private word.\u201d \u201cOh indeed!\u201d said Mr. Lorry, bending down his ear, while his eye strayed to the House afar off. \u201cI am going,\u201d said Mr. Stryver, leaning his arms confidentially on the desk: whereupon, although it was a large double one, there appeared to be not half desk enough for him: \u201cI am going to make an offer of myself in marriage to your agreeable little friend, Miss Manette, Mr. Lorry.\u201d \u201cOh dear me!\u201d cried Mr. Lorry, rubbing his chin, and looking at his visitor dubiously. \u201cOh dear me, sir?\u201d repeated Stryver, drawing back. \u201cOh dear you, sir? What may your meaning be, Mr. Lorry?\u201d \u201cMy meaning,\u201d answered the man of business, \u201cis, of course, friendly and appreciative, and that it does you the greatest credit, and--in short, my meaning is everything you could desire. But--really, you know, Mr. Stryver--\u201d Mr. Lorry paused, and shook his head at him in the oddest manner, as if he were compelled against his will to add, internally, \u201cyou know there really is so much too much of you!\u201d \u201cWell!\u201d said Stryver, slapping the desk with his contentious hand, opening his eyes wider, and taking a long breath, \u201cif I understand you, Mr. Lorry, I'll be hanged!\u201d Mr. Lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that end, and bit the feather of a pen.", " \u201cThe occupation resumed under the influence of this passing affliction so happily recovered from,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, clearing his throat, \u201cwe will call--Blacksmith's work, Blacksmith's work. We will say, to put a case and for the sake of illustration, that he had been used, in his bad time, to work at a little forge. We will say that he was unexpectedly found at his forge again. Is it not a pity that he should keep it by him?\u201d The Doctor shaded his forehead with his hand, and beat his foot nervously on the ground. \u201cHe has always kept it by him,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, with an anxious look at his friend. \u201cNow, would it not be better that he should let it go?\u201d Still, the Doctor, with shaded forehead, beat his foot nervously on the ground. \u201cYou do not find it easy to advise me?\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cI quite understand it to be a nice question. And yet I think--\u201d And there he shook his head, and stopped.", " Walking between her father and Mr. Darnay, Lucie Manette passed into the open air. A hackney-coach was called, and the father and daughter departed in it. Mr. Stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back to the robing-room. Another person, who had not joined the group, or interchanged a word with any one of them, but who had been leaning against the wall where its shadow was darkest, had silently strolled out after the rest, and had looked on until the coach drove away. He now stepped up to where Mr. Lorry and Mr. Darnay stood upon the pavement. \u201cSo, Mr. Lorry! Men of business may speak to Mr. Darnay now?\u201d Nobody had made any acknowledgment of Mr. Carton's part in the day's proceedings; nobody had known of it. He was unrobed, and was none the better for it in appearance. \u201cIf you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind, when the business mind is divided between good-natured impulse and business appearances, you would be amused, Mr. Darnay.\u201d Mr. Lorry reddened, and said, warmly, \u201cYou have mentioned that before, sir."], "Where does Lucy Manette think her father has been?": [" My daughter Lucie is, in this one respect, such a mystery to me; I can make no guess at the state of her heart.\u201d \u201cMay I ask, sir, if you think she is--\u201d As he hesitated, her father supplied the rest. \u201cIs sought by any other suitor?\u201d \u201cIt is what I meant to say.\u201d Her father considered a little before he answered: \u201cYou have seen Mr. Carton here, yourself. Mr. Stryver is here too, occasionally. If it be at all, it can only be by one of these.\u201d \u201cOr both,\u201d said Darnay. \u201cI had not thought of both; I should not think either, likely. You want a promise from me. Tell me what it is.\u201d \u201cIt is, that if Miss Manette should bring to you at any time, on her own part, such a confidence as I have ventured to lay before you, you will bear testimony to what I have said, and to your belief in it. I hope you may be able to think so well of me, as to urge no influence against me. I say nothing more of my stake in this; this is what I ask.", " Now, does he do too much?\u201d \u201cI think not. It may be the character of his mind, to be always in singular need of occupation. That may be, in part, natural to it; in part, the result of affliction. The less it was occupied with healthy things, the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy direction. He may have observed himself, and made the discovery.\u201d \u201cYou are sure that he is not under too great a strain?\u201d \u201cI think I am quite sure of it.\u201d \u201cMy dear Manette, if he were overworked now--\u201d \u201cMy dear Lorry, I doubt if that could easily be. There has been a violent stress in one direction, and it needs a counterweight.\u201d \u201cExcuse me, as a persistent man of business. Assuming for a moment, that he _was_ overworked; it would show itself in some renewal of this disorder?\u201d \u201cI do not think so. I do not think,\u201d said Doctor Manette with the firmness of self-conviction, \u201cthat anything but the one train of association would renew it.", " \u201cPardon me; certainly it was I who said so, but you naturally think so. Of course.\u201d \u201c_I_ think?\u201d returned madame, in a high voice. \u201cI and my husband have enough to do to keep this wine-shop open, without thinking. All we think, here, is how to live. That is the subject _we_ think of, and it gives us, from morning to night, enough to think about, without embarrassing our heads concerning others. _I_ think for others? No, no.\u201d The spy, who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make, did not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face; but, stood with an air of gossiping gallantry, leaning his elbow on Madame Defarge's little counter, and occasionally sipping his cognac. \u201cA bad business this, madame, of Gaspard's execution. Ah! the poor Gaspard!\u201d With a sigh of great compassion. \u201cMy faith!\u201d returned madame, coolly and lightly, \u201cif people use knives for such purposes, they have to pay for it.", " But I have thought it possible that you might have it in your power, if you should deem it right, to give me some.\u201d \u201cDo you seek any promise from me?\u201d \u201cI do seek that.\u201d \u201cWhat is it?\u201d \u201cI well understand that, without you, I could have no hope. I well understand that, even if Miss Manette held me at this moment in her innocent heart--do not think I have the presumption to assume so much--I could retain no place in it against her love for her father.\u201d \u201cIf that be so, do you see what, on the other hand, is involved in it?\u201d \u201cI understand equally well, that a word from her father in any suitor's favour, would outweigh herself and all the world. For which reason, Doctor Manette,\u201d said Darnay, modestly but firmly, \u201cI would not ask that word, to save my life.\u201d \u201cI am sure of it. Charles Darnay, mysteries arise out of close love, as well as out of wide division; in the former case, they are subtle and delicate, and difficult to penetrate."], "How long did Doctor Manette spend in prison?": [" I examine it, very closely. In a hole in the chimney, where a stone has been worked out and replaced, I find a written paper. This is that written paper. I have made it my business to examine some specimens of the writing of Doctor Manette. This is the writing of Doctor Manette. I confide this paper, in the writing of Doctor Manette, to the hands of the President.\u201d \u201cLet it be read.\u201d In a dead silence and stillness--the prisoner under trial looking lovingly at his wife, his wife only looking from him to look with solicitude at her father, Doctor Manette keeping his eyes fixed on the reader, Madame Defarge never taking hers from the prisoner, Defarge never taking his from his feasting wife, and all the other eyes there intent upon the Doctor, who saw none of them--the paper was read, as follows. X. The Substance of the Shadow \u201cI, Alexandre Manette, unfortunate physician, native of Beauvais, and afterwards resident in Paris, write this melancholy paper in my doleful cell in the Bastille, during the last month of the year, 1767.", " \u201cO me, O me! All is lost!\u201d cried she, wringing her hands. \u201cWhat is to be told to Ladybird? He doesn't know me, and is making shoes!\u201d Mr. Lorry said what he could to calm her, and went himself into the Doctor's room. The bench was turned towards the light, as it had been when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before, and his head was bent down, and he was very busy. \u201cDoctor Manette. My dear friend, Doctor Manette!\u201d The Doctor looked at him for a moment--half inquiringly, half as if he were angry at being spoken to--and bent over his work again. He had laid aside his coat and waistcoat; his shirt was open at the throat, as it used to be when he did that work; and even the old haggard, faded surface of face had come back to him. He worked hard--impatiently--as if in some sense of having been interrupted. Mr. Lorry glanced at the work in his hand, and observed that it was a shoe of the old size and shape.", " \u201cYou are a little depressed, too,\u201d said madame, whose quick eyes had never been so intent on the accounts, but they had had a ray or two for him. \u201cOh, the men, the men!\u201d \u201cBut my dear!\u201d began Defarge. \u201cBut my dear!\u201d repeated madame, nodding firmly; \u201cbut my dear! You are faint of heart to-night, my dear!\u201d \u201cWell, then,\u201d said Defarge, as if a thought were wrung out of his breast, \u201cit _is_ a long time.\u201d \u201cIt is a long time,\u201d repeated his wife; \u201cand when is it not a long time? Vengeance and retribution require a long time; it is the rule.\u201d \u201cIt does not take a long time to strike a man with Lightning,\u201d said Defarge. \u201cHow long,\u201d demanded madame, composedly, \u201cdoes it take to make and store the lightning? Tell me.\u201d Defarge raised his head thoughtfully, as if there were something in that too. \u201cIt does not take a long time,\u201d said madame, \u201cfor an earthquake to swallow a town. Eh well! Tell me how long it takes to prepare the earthquake?\u201d \u201cA long time, I suppose,\u201d said Defarge.", " To him, now entered Charles Darnay, at sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand. \u201cCharles Darnay! I rejoice to see you. We have been counting on your return these three or four days past. Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton were both here yesterday, and both made you out to be more than due.\u201d \u201cI am obliged to them for their interest in the matter,\u201d he answered, a little coldly as to them, though very warmly as to the Doctor. \u201cMiss Manette--\u201d \u201cIs well,\u201d said the Doctor, as he stopped short, \u201cand your return will delight us all. She has gone out on some household matters, but will soon be home.\u201d \u201cDoctor Manette, I knew she was from home. I took the opportunity of her being from home, to beg to speak to you.\u201d There was a blank silence. \u201cYes?\u201d said the Doctor, with evident constraint. \u201cBring your chair here, and speak on.\u201d He complied as to the chair, but appeared to find the speaking on less easy."], "Where must Mr. Lorry and Lucy go to get Doctor Manette?": [" \u201cO me, O me!

He worked hard--impatiently--as if in some sense of having been interrupted. Mr. Lorry glanced at the work in his hand, and observed that it was a shoe of the old size and shape.", " He said he had been with Lucie until just now, and had only left her for a few minutes, to come and keep his appointment. Her father had not been seen, since he quitted the banking-house towards four o'clock. She had some faint hopes that his mediation might save Charles, but they were very slight. He had been more than five hours gone: where could he be? Mr. Lorry waited until ten; but, Doctor Manette not returning, and he being unwilling to leave Lucie any longer, it was arranged that he should go back to her, and come to the banking-house again at midnight. In the meanwhile, Carton would wait alone by the fire for the Doctor. He waited and waited, and the clock struck twelve; but Doctor Manette did not come back. Mr. Lorry returned, and found no tidings of him, and brought none. Where could he be? They were discussing this question, and were almost building up some weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence, when they heard him on the stairs.", " I come from Doctor Manette.\u201d \u201cAnd what says he? What does he send me?\u201d Defarge gave into his anxious hand, an open scrap of paper. It bore the words in the Doctor's writing: \u201cCharles is safe, but I cannot safely leave this place yet. I have obtained the favour that the bearer has a short note from Charles to his wife. Let the bearer see his wife.\u201d It was dated from La Force, within an hour. \u201cWill you accompany me,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, joyfully relieved after reading this note aloud, \u201cto where his wife resides?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d returned Defarge. Scarcely noticing as yet, in what a curiously reserved and mechanical way Defarge spoke, Mr. Lorry put on his hat and they went down into the courtyard. There, they found two women; one, knitting. \u201cMadame Defarge, surely!\u201d said Mr. Lorry, who had left her in exactly the same attitude some seventeen years ago. \u201cIt is she,\u201d observed her husband. \u201cDoes Madame go with us?\u201d inquired Mr. Lorry, seeing that she moved as they moved.", " \u201cNow, I trust,\u201d said Sydney to him, \u201cthat the name and influence of Doctor Manette may stand him in as good stead to-morrow--you said he would be before the Tribunal again to-morrow, Mr. Barsad?--\u201d \u201cYes; I believe so.\u201d \u201c--In as good stead to-morrow as to-day. But it may not be so. I own to you, I am shaken, Mr. Lorry, by Doctor Manette's not having had the power to prevent this arrest.\u201d \u201cHe may not have known of it beforehand,\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cBut that very circumstance would be alarming, when we remember how identified he is with his son-in-law.\u201d \u201cThat's true,\u201d Mr. Lorry acknowledged, with his troubled hand at his chin, and his troubled eyes on Carton. \u201cIn short,\u201d said Sydney, \u201cthis is a desperate time, when desperate games are played for desperate stakes. Let the Doctor play the winning game; I will play the losing one. No man's life here is worth purchase. Any one carried home by the people to-day, may be condemned tomorrow."], "What happens when a cask of wine spills along the street in Paris?": [" V. The Wine-shop A large cask of wine had been dropped and broken, in the street. The accident had happened in getting it out of a cart; the cask had tumbled out with a run, the hoops had burst, and it lay on the stones just outside the door of the wine-shop, shattered like a walnut-shell. All the people within reach had suspended their business, or their idleness, to run to the spot and drink the wine. The rough, irregular stones of the street, pointing every way, and designed, one might have thought, expressly to lame all living creatures that approached them, had dammed it into little pools; these were surrounded, each by its own jostling group or crowd, according to its size. Some men kneeled down, made scoops of their two hands joined, and sipped, or tried to help women, who bent over their shoulders, to sip, before the wine had all run out between their fingers. Others, men and women, dipped in the puddles with little mugs of mutilated earthenware, or even with handkerchiefs from women's heads, which were squeezed dry into infants' mouths; others made small mud-embankments, to stem the wine as it ran; others, directed by lookers-on up at high windows, darted here and there, to cut off little streams of wine that started away in new directions; others devoted themselves to the sodden and lee-dyed pieces of the cask, licking, and even champing the moister wine-rotted fragments with eager relish.", " There was no drainage to carry off the wine, and not only did it all get taken up, but so much mud got taken up along with it, that there might have been a scavenger in the street, if anybody acquainted with it could have believed in such a miraculous presence. A shrill sound of laughter and of amused voices--voices of men, women, and children--resounded in the street while this wine game lasted. There was little roughness in the sport, and much playfulness. There was a special companionship in it, an observable inclination on the part of every one to join some other one, which led, especially among the luckier or lighter-hearted, to frolicsome embraces, drinking of healths, shaking of hands, and even joining of hands and dancing, a dozen together. When the wine was gone, and the places where it had been most abundant were raked into a gridiron-pattern by fingers, these demonstrations ceased, as suddenly as they had broken out.", " Now, Heaven defeat the fancy of Lucie Darnay, and keep these feet far out of her life! For, they are headlong, mad, and dangerous; and in the years so long after the breaking of the cask at Defarge's wine-shop door, they are not easily purified when once stained red. XXII. The Sea Still Rises Haggard Saint Antoine had had only one exultant week, in which to soften his modicum of hard and bitter bread to such extent as he could, with the relish of fraternal embraces and congratulations, when Madame Defarge sat at her counter, as usual, presiding over the customers. Madame Defarge wore no rose in her head, for the great brotherhood of Spies had become, even in one short week, extremely chary of trusting themselves to the saint's mercies. The lamps across his streets had a portentously elastic swing with them. Madame Defarge, with her arms folded, sat in the morning light and heat, contemplating the wine-shop and the street.", " Those who had been greedy with the staves of the cask, had acquired a tigerish smear about the mouth; and one tall joker so besmirched, his head more out of a long squalid bag of a nightcap than in it, scrawled upon a wall with his finger dipped in muddy wine-lees--BLOOD. The time was to come, when that wine too would be spilled on the street-stones, and when the stain of it would be red upon many there. And now that the cloud settled on Saint Antoine, which a momentary gleam had driven from his sacred countenance, the darkness of it was heavy--cold, dirt, sickness, ignorance, and want, were the lords in waiting on the saintly presence--nobles of great power all of them; but, most especially the last. Samples of a people that had undergone a terrible grinding and regrinding in the mill, and certainly not in the fabulous mill which ground old people young, shivered at every corner, passed in and out at every doorway, looked from every window, fluttered in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook."], "What is Jacques a codename for?": [" Is it not so, Jacques?\u201d \u201cIt is so, Jacques,\u201d Monsieur Defarge returned. At this second interchange of the Christian name, Madame Defarge, still using her toothpick with profound composure, coughed another grain of cough, and raised her eyebrows by the breadth of another line. The last of the three now said his say, as he put down his empty drinking vessel and smacked his lips. \u201cAh! So much the worse! A bitter taste it is that such poor cattle always have in their mouths, and hard lives they live, Jacques. Am I right, Jacques?\u201d \u201cYou are right, Jacques,\u201d was the response of Monsieur Defarge. This third interchange of the Christian name was completed at the moment when Madame Defarge put her toothpick by, kept her eyebrows up, and slightly rustled in her seat. \u201cHold then! True!\u201d muttered her husband. \u201cGentlemen--my wife!\u201d The three customers pulled off their hats to Madame Defarge, with three flourishes.", " And between them and the white-haired man afar off, was the one small link, that they had once looked in at him through the chinks in the wall.

Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then? \u201cBy his tall figure,\u201d said the mender of roads, softly, and with his finger at his nose. \u201cWhen Monsieur the Marquis demands that evening, 'Say, what is he like?' I make response, 'Tall as a spectre. '\u201d \u201cYou should have said, short as a dwarf,\u201d returned Jacques Two. \u201cBut what did I know? The deed was not then accomplished, neither did he confide in me. Observe! Under those circumstances even, I do not offer my testimony. Monsieur the Marquis indicates me with his finger, standing near our little fountain, and says, 'To me! Bring that rascal!' My faith, messieurs, I offer nothing.\u201d \u201cHe is right there, Jacques,\u201d murmured Defarge, to him who had interrupted. \u201cGo on!\u201d \u201cGood!\u201d said the mender of roads, with an air of mystery.", " There were the four blackened walls, and a rusted iron ring in one of them. \u201cPass that torch slowly along these walls, that I may see them,\u201d said Defarge to the turnkey. The man obeyed, and Defarge followed the light closely with his eyes. \u201cStop!--Look here, Jacques!\u201d \u201cA. M.!\u201d croaked Jacques Three, as he read greedily. \u201cAlexandre Manette,\u201d said Defarge in his ear, following the letters with his swart forefinger, deeply engrained with gunpowder. \u201cAnd here he wrote 'a poor physician.' And it was he, without doubt, who scratched a calendar on this stone. What is that in your hand? A crowbar? Give it me!\u201d He had still the linstock of his gun in his own hand. He made a sudden exchange of the two instruments, and turning on the worm-eaten stool and table, beat them to pieces in a few blows. \u201cHold the light higher!\u201d he said, wrathfully, to the turnkey. \u201cLook among those fragments with care, Jacques."], "Whom do the three Jacques watch through a hole in the wall in the fifth floor?": [" Is it not so, Jacques?\u201d \u201cIt is so, Jacques,\u201d Monsieur Defarge returned.

I leaving my work on the road, the sun going to bed, the carriage of the Marquis slowly ascending the hill, he hanging by the chain--like this.\u201d Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in which he ought to have been perfect by that time, seeing that it had been the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village during a whole year.", " \u201cLeave us, good boys; we have business here.\u201d The three glided by, and went silently down. There appearing to be no other door on that floor, and the keeper of the wine-shop going straight to this one when they were left alone, Mr. Lorry asked him in a whisper, with a little anger: \u201cDo you make a show of Monsieur Manette?\u201d \u201cI show him, in the way you have seen, to a chosen few.\u201d \u201cIs that well?\u201d \u201c_I_ think it is well.\u201d \u201cWho are the few? How do you choose them?\u201d \u201cI choose them as real men, of my name--Jacques is my name--to whom the sight is likely to do good. Enough; you are English; that is another thing. Stay there, if you please, a little moment.\u201d With an admonitory gesture to keep them back, he stooped, and looked in through the crevice in the wall. Soon raising his head again, he struck twice or thrice upon the door--evidently with no other object than to make a noise there. With the same intention, he drew the key across it, three or four times, before he put it clumsily into the lock, and turned it as heavily as he could.", " Jacques One struck in, and asked if he had ever seen the man before? \u201cNever,\u201d answered the mender of roads, recovering his perpendicular. Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then? \u201cBy his tall figure,\u201d said the mender of roads, softly, and with his finger at his nose. \u201cWhen Monsieur the Marquis demands that evening, 'Say, what is he like?' I make response, 'Tall as a spectre. '\u201d \u201cYou should have said, short as a dwarf,\u201d returned Jacques Two. \u201cBut what did I know? The deed was not then accomplished, neither did he confide in me. Observe! Under those circumstances even, I do not offer my testimony. Monsieur the Marquis indicates me with his finger, standing near our little fountain, and says, 'To me! Bring that rascal!' My faith, messieurs, I offer nothing.\u201d \u201cHe is right there, Jacques,\u201d murmured Defarge, to him who had interrupted. \u201cGo on!\u201d \u201cGood!\u201d said the mender of roads, with an air of mystery."], "Whom does Doctor Manette think Lucy is at first?": [" Do you know me?\u201d \u201cYes, I know you, Citizen Doctor.\u201d \u201cWe all know you, Citizen Doctor,\u201d said the other three. He looked abstractedly from one to another, and said, in a lower voice, after a pause: \u201cWill you answer his question to me then? How does this happen?\u201d \u201cCitizen Doctor,\u201d said the first, reluctantly, \u201che has been denounced to the Section of Saint Antoine. This citizen,\u201d pointing out the second who had entered, \u201cis from Saint Antoine.\u201d The citizen here indicated nodded his head, and added: \u201cHe is accused by Saint Antoine.\u201d \u201cOf what?\u201d asked the Doctor. \u201cCitizen Doctor,\u201d said the first, with his former reluctance, \u201cask no more. If the Republic demands sacrifices from you, without doubt you as a good patriot will be happy to make them. The Republic goes before all. The People is supreme. Evremonde, we are pressed.\u201d \u201cOne word,\u201d the Doctor entreated. \u201cWill you tell me who denounced him?\u201d \u201cIt is against rule,\u201d answered the first; \u201cbut you can ask Him of Saint Antoine here.\u201d The Doctor turned his eyes upon that man.", " I examine it, very closely. In a hole in the chimney, where a stone has been worked out and replaced, I find a written paper. This is that written paper. I have made it my business to examine some specimens of the writing of Doctor Manette. This is the writing of Doctor Manette. I confide this paper, in the writing of Doctor Manette, to the hands of the President.\u201d \u201cLet it be read.\u201d In a dead silence and stillness--the prisoner under trial looking lovingly at his wife, his wife only looking from him to look with solicitude at her father, Doctor Manette keeping his eyes fixed on the reader, Madame Defarge never taking hers from the prisoner, Defarge never taking his from his feasting wife, and all the other eyes there intent upon the Doctor, who saw none of them--the paper was read, as follows. X. The Substance of the Shadow \u201cI, Alexandre Manette, unfortunate physician, native of Beauvais, and afterwards resident in Paris, write this melancholy paper in my doleful cell in the Bastille, during the last month of the year, 1767.", " Now, does he do too much?\u201d \u201cI think not. It may be the character of his mind, to be always in singular need of occupation. That may be, in part, natural to it; in part, the result of affliction. The less it was occupied with healthy things, the more it would be in danger of turning in the unhealthy direction. He may have observed himself, and made the discovery.\u201d \u201cYou are sure that he is not under too great a strain?\u201d \u201cI think I am quite sure of it.\u201d \u201cMy dear Manette, if he were overworked now--\u201d \u201cMy dear Lorry, I doubt if that could easily be. There has been a violent stress in one direction, and it needs a counterweight.\u201d \u201cExcuse me, as a persistent man of business. Assuming for a moment, that he _was_ overworked; it would show itself in some renewal of this disorder?\u201d \u201cI do not think so. I do not think,\u201d said Doctor Manette with the firmness of self-conviction, \u201cthat anything but the one train of association would renew it.", " \u201cPardon me; certainly it was I who said so, but you naturally think so. Of course.\u201d \u201c_I_ think?\u201d returned madame, in a high voice. \u201cI and my husband have enough to do to keep this wine-shop open, without thinking. All we think, here, is how to live. That is the subject _we_ think of, and it gives us, from morning to night, enough to think about, without embarrassing our heads concerning others. _I_ think for others? No, no.\u201d The spy, who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make, did not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face; but, stood with an air of gossiping gallantry, leaning his elbow on Madame Defarge's little counter, and occasionally sipping his cognac. \u201cA bad business this, madame, of Gaspard's execution. Ah! the poor Gaspard!\u201d With a sigh of great compassion. \u201cMy faith!\u201d returned madame, coolly and lightly, \u201cif people use knives for such purposes, they have to pay for it."], "What does Lucy want to do now that she\u2019s found her father?": [" He is dead.\u201d \u201cWell! He is quiet. Can I restore him to you?\u201d \u201cAlas, no, Monseigneur! But he lies yonder, under a little heap of poor grass.\u201d \u201cWell?\u201d \u201cMonseigneur, there are so many little heaps of poor grass?\u201d \u201cAgain, well?\u201d She looked an old woman, but was young. Her manner was one of passionate grief; by turns she clasped her veinous and knotted hands together with wild energy, and laid one of them on the carriage-door--tenderly, caressingly, as if it had been a human breast, and could be expected to feel the appealing touch. \u201cMonseigneur, hear me! Monseigneur, hear my petition! My husband died of want; so many die of want; so many more will die of want.\u201d \u201cAgain, well? Can I feed them?\u201d \u201cMonseigneur, the good God knows; but I don't ask it. My petition is, that a morsel of stone or wood, with my husband's name, may be placed over him to show where he lies. Otherwise, the place will be quickly forgotten, it will never be found when I am dead of the same malady, I shall be laid under some other heap of poor grass.", " If he had preserved any definite remembrance of it, there could be no doubt that he had supposed it destroyed with the Bastille, when he had found no mention of it among the relics of prisoners which the populace had discovered there, and which had been described to all the world. He besought her--though he added that he knew it was needless--to console her father, by impressing him through every tender means she could think of, with the truth that he had done nothing for which he could justly reproach himself, but had uniformly forgotten himself for their joint sakes. Next to her preservation of his own last grateful love and blessing, and her overcoming of her sorrow, to devote herself to their dear child, he adjured her, as they would meet in Heaven, to comfort her father. To her father himself, he wrote in the same strain; but, he told her father that he expressly confided his wife and child to his care.", " My daughter Lucie is, in this one respect, such a mystery to me; I can make no guess at the state of her heart.\u201d \u201cMay I ask, sir, if you think she is--\u201d As he hesitated, her father supplied the rest. \u201cIs sought by any other suitor?\u201d \u201cIt is what I meant to say.\u201d Her father considered a little before he answered: \u201cYou have seen Mr. Carton here, yourself. Mr. Stryver is here too, occasionally. If it be at all, it can only be by one of these.\u201d \u201cOr both,\u201d said Darnay. \u201cI had not thought of both; I should not think either, likely. You want a promise from me. Tell me what it is.\u201d \u201cIt is, that if Miss Manette should bring to you at any time, on her own part, such a confidence as I have ventured to lay before you, you will bear testimony to what I have said, and to your belief in it. I hope you may be able to think so well of me, as to urge no influence against me. I say nothing more of my stake in this; this is what I ask.", " Before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation, he had travelled thus far on his last way. Being allowed to purchase the means of writing, and a light, he sat down to write until such time as the prison lamps should be extinguished. He wrote a long letter to Lucie, showing her that he had known nothing of her father's imprisonment, until he had heard of it from herself, and that he had been as ignorant as she of his father's and uncle's responsibility for that misery, until the paper had been read. He had already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name he had relinquished, was the one condition--fully intelligible now--that her father had attached to their betrothal, and was the one promise he had still exacted on the morning of their marriage. He entreated her, for her father's sake, never to seek to know whether her father had become oblivious of the existence of the paper, or had had it recalled to him (for the moment, or for good), by the story of the Tower, on that old Sunday under the dear old plane-tree in the garden."], "What does Jerry Cruncher do for a living?": [" And even then it would not leave him, but followed him upstairs with a bump on every stair, scrambled into bed with him, and bumped down, dead and heavy, on his breast when he fell asleep. From his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his closet was awakened after daybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his father in the family room. Something had gone wrong with him; at least, so Young Jerry inferred, from the circumstance of his holding Mrs. Cruncher by the ears, and knocking the back of her head against the head-board of the bed. \u201cI told you I would,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, \u201cand I did.\u201d \u201cJerry, Jerry, Jerry!\u201d his wife implored. \u201cYou oppose yourself to the profit of the business,\u201d said Jerry, \u201cand me and my partners suffer. You was to honour and obey; why the devil don't you?\u201d \u201cI try to be a good wife, Jerry,\u201d the poor woman protested, with tears. \u201cIs it being a good wife to oppose your husband's business?", " \u201cI am saying nothing.\u201d \u201cWell, then; don't meditate nothing. You might as well flop as meditate. You may as well go again me one way as another. Drop it altogether.\u201d \u201cYes, Jerry.\u201d \u201cYes, Jerry,\u201d repeated Mr. Cruncher sitting down to tea. \u201cAh! It _is_ yes, Jerry. That's about it. You may say yes, Jerry.\u201d Mr. Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations, but made use of them, as people not unfrequently do, to express general ironical dissatisfaction. \u201cYou and your yes, Jerry,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, taking a bite out of his bread-and-butter, and seeming to help it down with a large invisible oyster out of his saucer. \u201cAh! I think so. I believe you.\u201d \u201cYou are going out to-night?\u201d asked his decent wife, when he took another bite. \u201cYes, I am.\u201d \u201cMay I go with you, father?\u201d asked his son, briskly. \u201cNo, you mayn't. I'm a going--as your mother knows--a fishing. That's where I'm going to.", " \u201cHem! Well,\u201d returned Mr. Cruncher, going on again, and lifting off his hat to give his spikes free play, \u201che's a tradesman.\u201d \u201cWhat's his goods, father?\u201d asked the brisk Young Jerry. \u201cHis goods,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, after turning it over in his mind, \u201cis a branch of Scientific goods.\u201d \u201cPersons' bodies, ain't it, father?\u201d asked the lively boy. \u201cI believe it is something of that sort,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher. \u201cOh, father, I should so like to be a Resurrection-Man when I'm quite growed up!\u201d Mr. Cruncher was soothed, but shook his head in a dubious and moral way. \u201cIt depends upon how you dewelop your talents. Be careful to dewelop your talents, and never to say no more than you can help to nobody, and there's no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit for.\u201d As Young Jerry, thus encouraged, went on a few yards in advance, to plant the stool in the shadow of the Bar, Mr. Cruncher added to himself: \u201cJerry, you honest tradesman, there's hopes wot that boy will yet be a blessing to you, and a recompense to you for his mother!\u201d XV.", " Looking that way, Mr. Cruncher made out that some kind of funeral was coming along, and that there was popular objection to this funeral, which engendered uproar. \u201cYoung Jerry,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, turning to his offspring, \u201cit's a buryin'.\u201d \u201cHooroar, father!\u201d cried Young Jerry. The young gentleman uttered this exultant sound with mysterious significance. The elder gentleman took the cry so ill, that he watched his opportunity, and smote the young gentleman on the ear. \u201cWhat d'ye mean? What are you hooroaring at? What do you want to conwey to your own father, you young Rip? This boy is a getting too many for _me_!\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, surveying him. \u201cHim and his hooroars! Don't let me hear no more of you, or you shall feel some more of me. D'ye hear?\u201d \u201cI warn't doing no harm,\u201d Young Jerry protested, rubbing his cheek. \u201cDrop it then,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher; \u201cI won't have none of _your_ no harms."], "In what year do these chapters take place?": [" I write it at stolen intervals, under every difficulty. I design to secrete it in the wall of the chimney, where I have slowly and laboriously made a place of concealment for it. Some pitying hand may find it there, when I and my sorrows are dust. \u201cThese words are formed by the rusty iron point with which I write with difficulty in scrapings of soot and charcoal from the chimney, mixed with blood, in the last month of the tenth year of my captivity. Hope has quite departed from my breast. I know from terrible warnings I have noted in myself that my reason will not long remain unimpaired, but I solemnly declare that I am at this time in the possession of my right mind--that my memory is exact and circumstantial--and that I write the truth as I shall answer for these my last recorded words, whether they be ever read by men or not, at the Eternal Judgment-seat. \u201cOne cloudy moonlight night, in the third week of December (I think the twenty-second of the month) in the year 1757, I was walking on a retired part of the quay by the Seine for the refreshment of the frosty air, at an hour's distance from my place of residence in the Street of the School of Medicine, when a carriage came along behind me, driven very fast.", " I shall soon be out of the way of harming you, and the rest will soon be far from here, please God! Now, get assistance and take me to the coach.\u201d \u201cYou?\u201d said the Spy nervously. \u201cHim, man, with whom I have exchanged. You go out at the gate by which you brought me in?\u201d \u201cOf course.\u201d \u201cI was weak and faint when you brought me in, and I am fainter now you take me out. The parting interview has overpowered me. Such a thing has happened here, often, and too often. Your life is in your own hands. Quick! Call assistance!\u201d \u201cYou swear not to betray me?\u201d said the trembling Spy, as he paused for a last moment. \u201cMan, man!\u201d returned Carton, stamping his foot; \u201chave I sworn by no solemn vow already, to go through with this, that you waste the precious moments now? Take him yourself to the courtyard you know of, place him yourself in the carriage, show him yourself to Mr. Lorry, tell him yourself to give him no restorative but air, and to remember my words of last night, and his promise of last night, and drive away!\u201d The Spy withdrew, and Carton seated himself at the table, resting his forehead on his hands.", " He only seemed to contrast his present cheerfulness and felicity with the dire endurance that was over. \u201cI have looked at her, speculating thousands of times upon the unborn child from whom I had been rent. Whether it was alive. Whether it had been born alive, or the poor mother's shock had killed it. Whether it was a son who would some day avenge his father. (There was a time in my imprisonment, when my desire for vengeance was unbearable.) Whether it was a son who would never know his father's story; who might even live to weigh the possibility of his father's having disappeared of his own will and act. Whether it was a daughter who would grow to be a woman.\u201d She drew closer to him, and kissed his cheek and his hand. \u201cI have pictured my daughter, to myself, as perfectly forgetful of me--rather, altogether ignorant of me, and unconscious of me. I have cast up the years of her age, year after year.", " The crowd about him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant, and from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back; at last it got to Jerry: \u201cWitnesses.\u201d \u201cFor which side?\u201d \u201cAgainst.\u201d \u201cAgainst what side?\u201d \u201cThe prisoner's.\u201d The Judge, whose eyes had gone in the general direction, recalled them, leaned back in his seat, and looked steadily at the man whose life was in his hand, as Mr. Attorney-General rose to spin the rope, grind the axe, and hammer the nails into the scaffold. III. A Disappointment Mr. Attorney-General had to inform the jury, that the prisoner before them, though young in years, was old in the treasonable practices which claimed the forfeit of his life. That this correspondence with the public enemy was not a correspondence of to-day, or of yesterday, or even of last year, or of the year before. That, it was certain the prisoner had, for longer than that, been in the habit of passing and repassing between France and England, on secret business of which he could give no honest account."], "What is Charles Darnay on trial for?": [" Nothing unbecoming tinged the pride; it was a natural and worthy one; but he observed it as a curiosity. The Doctor knew, that up to that time, his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter and his friend, with his personal affliction, deprivation, and weakness. Now that this was changed, and he knew himself to be invested through that old trial with forces to which they both looked for Charles's ultimate safety and deliverance, he became so far exalted by the change, that he took the lead and direction, and required them as the weak, to trust to him as the strong. The preceding relative positions of himself and Lucie were reversed, yet only as the liveliest gratitude and affection could reverse them, for he could have had no pride but in rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him. \u201cAll curious to see,\u201d thought Mr. Lorry, in his amiably shrewd way, \u201cbut all natural and right; so, take the lead, my dear friend, and keep it; it couldn't be in better hands.\u201d But, though the Doctor tried hard, and never ceased trying, to get Charles Darnay set at liberty, or at least to get him brought to trial, the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him.", " On a steaming, misty afternoon, Mr. Lorry sat at his desk, and Charles Darnay stood leaning on it, talking with him in a low voice. The penitential den once set apart for interviews with the House, was now the news-Exchange, and was filled to overflowing. It was within half an hour or so of the time of closing. \u201cBut, although you are the youngest man that ever lived,\u201d said Charles Darnay, rather hesitating, \u201cI must still suggest to you--\u201d \u201cI understand. That I am too old?\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cUnsettled weather, a long journey, uncertain means of travelling, a disorganised country, a city that may not be even safe for you.\u201d \u201cMy dear Charles,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, with cheerful confidence, \u201cyou touch some of the reasons for my going: not for my staying away. It is safe enough for me; nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better worth interfering with.", " \u201cI begin to have a very good opinion of your understanding.\u201d \u201cNevertheless,\u201d pursued Darnay, rising to ring the bell, \u201cthere is nothing in that, I hope, to prevent my calling the reckoning, and our parting without ill-blood on either side.\u201d Carton rejoining, \u201cNothing in life!\u201d Darnay rang. \u201cDo you call the whole reckoning?\u201d said Carton. On his answering in the affirmative, \u201cThen bring me another pint of this same wine, drawer, and come and wake me at ten.\u201d The bill being paid, Charles Darnay rose and wished him good night. Without returning the wish, Carton rose too, with something of a threat of defiance in his manner, and said, \u201cA last word, Mr. Darnay: you think I am drunk?\u201d \u201cI think you have been drinking, Mr. Carton.\u201d \u201cThink? You know I have been drinking.\u201d \u201cSince I must say so, I know it.\u201d \u201cThen you shall likewise know why. I am a disappointed drudge, sir. I care for no man on earth, and no man on earth cares for me.\u201d \u201cMuch to be regretted.", " To him, now entered Charles Darnay, at sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand. \u201cCharles Darnay! I rejoice to see you. We have been counting on your return these three or four days past. Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton were both here yesterday, and both made you out to be more than due.\u201d \u201cI am obliged to them for their interest in the matter,\u201d he answered, a little coldly as to them, though very warmly as to the Doctor. \u201cMiss Manette--\u201d \u201cIs well,\u201d said the Doctor, as he stopped short, \u201cand your return will delight us all. She has gone out on some household matters, but will soon be home.\u201d \u201cDoctor Manette, I knew she was from home. I took the opportunity of her being from home, to beg to speak to you.\u201d There was a blank silence. \u201cYes?\u201d said the Doctor, with evident constraint. \u201cBring your chair here, and speak on.\u201d He complied as to the chair, but appeared to find the speaking on less easy."], "Why is Darnay acquitted?": [" Speak for yourself.\u201d \u201cI speak for myself,\u201d answered Mr. Lorry, \u201cand for Mr. Darnay, and for Miss Lucie, and--Miss Lucie, do you not think I may speak for us all?\u201d He asked her the question pointedly, and with a glance at her father. His face had become frozen, as it were, in a very curious look at Darnay: an intent look, deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust, not even unmixed with fear. With this strange expression on him his thoughts had wandered away. \u201cMy father,\u201d said Lucie, softly laying her hand on his. He slowly shook the shadow off, and turned to her. \u201cShall we go home, my father?\u201d With a long breath, he answered \u201cYes.\u201d The friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the impression--which he himself had originated--that he would not be released that night. The lights were nearly all extinguished in the passages, the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle, and the dismal place was deserted until to-morrow morning's interest of gallows, pillory, whipping-post, and branding-iron, should repeople it.", " \u201cThat's a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by! How does it feel? Is it worth being tried for one's life, to be the object of such sympathy and compassion, Mr. Darnay?\u201d Again Darnay answered not a word. \u201cShe was mightily pleased to have your message, when I gave it her. Not that she showed she was pleased, but I suppose she was.\u201d The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this disagreeable companion had, of his own free will, assisted him in the strait of the day. He turned the dialogue to that point, and thanked him for it. \u201cI neither want any thanks, nor merit any,\u201d was the careless rejoinder. \u201cIt was nothing to do, in the first place; and I don't know why I did it, in the second. Mr. Darnay, let me ask you a question.\u201d \u201cWillingly, and a small return for your good offices.\u201d \u201cDo you think I particularly like you?\u201d \u201cReally, Mr. Carton,\u201d returned the other, oddly disconcerted, \u201cI have not asked myself the question.\u201d \u201cBut ask yourself the question now.\u201d \u201cYou have acted as if you do; but I don't think you do.\u201d \u201c_I_ don't think I do,\u201d said Carton.", " \u201cDid he though? Is that the sort of fellow? Let us look at his infamous name. D--n the fellow!\u201d Darnay, unable to restrain himself any longer, touched Mr. Stryver on the shoulder, and said: \u201cI know the fellow.\u201d \u201cDo you, by Jupiter?\u201d said Stryver. \u201cI am sorry for it.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cWhy, Mr. Darnay? D'ye hear what he did? Don't ask, why, in these times.\u201d \u201cBut I do ask why?\u201d \u201cThen I tell you again, Mr. Darnay, I am sorry for it. I am sorry to hear you putting any such extraordinary questions. Here is a fellow, who, infected by the most pestilent and blasphemous code of devilry that ever was known, abandoned his property to the vilest scum of the earth that ever did murder by wholesale, and you ask me why I am sorry that a man who instructs youth knows him? Well, but I'll answer you. I am sorry because I believe there is contamination in such a scoundrel. That's why.\u201d Mindful of the secret, Darnay with great difficulty checked himself, and said: \u201cYou may not understand the gentleman.\u201d \u201cI understand how to put _you_ in a corner, Mr. Darnay,\u201d said Bully Stryver, \u201cand I'll do it.", " An hour and a half limped heavily away in the thief-and-rascal crowded passages below, even though assisted off with mutton pies and ale. The hoarse messenger, uncomfortably seated on a form after taking that refection, had dropped into a doze, when a loud murmur and a rapid tide of people setting up the stairs that led to the court, carried him along with them. \u201cJerry! Jerry!\u201d Mr. Lorry was already calling at the door when he got there. \u201cHere, sir! It's a fight to get back again.

On his answering in the affirmative, \u201cThen bring me another pint of this same wine, drawer, and come and wake me at ten.\u201d The bill being paid, Charles Darnay rose and wished him good night. Without returning the wish, Carton rose too, with something of a threat of defiance in his manner, and said, \u201cA last word, Mr. Darnay: you think I am drunk?\u201d \u201cI think you have been drinking, Mr. Carton.\u201d \u201cThink? You know I have been drinking.\u201d \u201cSince I must say so, I know it.\u201d \u201cThen you shall likewise know why. I am a disappointed drudge, sir.

I implore you not to add your death to the bitterness of mine.\u201d \u201cDo I ask you, my dear Darnay, to pass the door? When I ask that, refuse. There are pen and ink and paper on this table. Is your hand steady enough to write?\u201d \u201cIt was when you came in.\u201d \u201cSteady it again, and write what I shall dictate. Quick, friend, quick!\u201d Pressing his hand to his bewildered head, Darnay sat down at the table.

Hurry, hurry!\u201d As if his memory were impaired, or his faculties disordered, the prisoner made an effort to rally his attention. As he looked at Carton with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing, Carton--his hand again in his breast--looked steadily at him. \u201cHurry, hurry!\u201d The prisoner bent over the paper, once more. \u201c'If it had been otherwise;'\u201d Carton's hand was again watchfully and softly stealing down; \u201c'I never should have used the longer opportunity.

How does it feel? Is it worth being tried for one's life, to be the object of such sympathy and compassion, Mr. Darnay?\u201d Again Darnay answered not a word. \u201cShe was mightily pleased to have your message, when I gave it her. Not that she showed she was pleased, but I suppose she was.\u201d The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this disagreeable companion had, of his own free will, assisted him in the strait of the day. He turned the dialogue to that point, and thanked him for it. \u201cI neither want any thanks, nor merit any,\u201d was the careless rejoinder. \u201cIt was nothing to do, in the first place; and I don't know why I did it, in the second.

It was the close of the summer day, and he knew Lucie to be out with Miss Pross. He found the Doctor reading in his arm-chair at a window. The energy which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated their sharpness, had been gradually restored to him. He was now a very energetic man indeed, with great firmness of purpose, strength of resolution, and vigour of action. In his recovered energy he was sometimes a little fitful and sudden, as he had at first been in the exercise of his other recovered faculties; but, this had never been frequently observable, and had grown more and more rare.

She was not unfrequently the victim of this disorder, and she called it, in familiar conversation, \u201ca fit of the jerks.\u201d The Doctor was in his best condition, and looked specially young. The resemblance between him and Lucie was very strong at such times, and as they sat side by side, she leaning on his shoulder, and he resting his arm on the back of her chair, it was very agreeable to trace the likeness. He had been talking all day, on many subjects, and with unusual vivacity. \u201cPray, Doctor Manette,\u201d said Mr. Darnay, as they sat under the plane-tree--and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand, which happened to be the old buildings of London--\u201chave you seen much of the Tower?\u201d \u201cLucie and I have been there; but only casually."], "What story does Darnay tell that makes Doctor Manette startle and look ill?": [" This is idle talk.\u201d So strange was the way in which he faded into silence, and so strange his fixed look when he had ceased to speak, that Darnay felt his own hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it. \u201cYou said something to me,\u201d said Doctor Manette, breaking into a smile. \u201cWhat was it you said to me?\u201d He was at a loss how to answer, until he remembered having spoken of a condition. Relieved as his mind reverted to that, he answered: \u201cYour confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my part. My present name, though but slightly changed from my mother's, is not, as you will remember, my own. I wish to tell you what that is, and why I am in England.\u201d \u201cStop!\u201d said the Doctor of Beauvais. \u201cI wish it, that I may the better deserve your confidence, and have no secret from you.\u201d \u201cStop!\u201d For an instant, the Doctor even had his two hands at his ears; for another instant, even had his two hands laid on Darnay's lips.", " \u201cThe rain-drops are still falling, large, heavy, and few,\u201d said Doctor Manette. \u201cIt comes slowly.\u201d \u201cIt comes surely,\u201d said Carton.

She has gone out on some household matters, but will soon be home.\u201d \u201cDoctor Manette, I knew she was from home. I took the opportunity of her being from home, to beg to speak to you.\u201d There was a blank silence. \u201cYes?\u201d said the Doctor, with evident constraint. \u201cBring your chair here, and speak on.\u201d He complied as to the chair, but appeared to find the speaking on less easy.", " I examine it, very closely.

I answered. The carriage was then so far in advance of me that two gentlemen had time to open the door and alight before I came up with it. \u201cI observed that they were both wrapped in cloaks, and appeared to conceal themselves. As they stood side by side near the carriage door, I also observed that they both looked of about my own age, or rather younger, and that they were greatly alike, in stature, manner, voice, and (as far as I could see) face too. \u201c'You are Doctor Manette?' said one. \u201cI am.\u201d \u201c'Doctor Manette, formerly of Beauvais,' said the other; 'the young physician, originally an expert surgeon, who within the last year or two has made a rising reputation in Paris?'", " \u201cThat.

Defarge closed the door carefully, and spoke in a subdued voice: \u201cJacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three! This is the witness encountered by appointment, by me, Jacques Four. He will tell you all. Speak, Jacques Five!\u201d The mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his swarthy forehead with it, and said, \u201cWhere shall I commence, monsieur?\u201d \u201cCommence,\u201d was Monsieur Defarge's not unreasonable reply, \u201cat the commencement.\u201d \u201cI saw him then, messieurs,\u201d began the mender of roads, \u201ca year ago this running summer, underneath the carriage of the Marquis, hanging by the chain. Behold the manner of it. I leaving my work on the road, the sun going to bed, the carriage of the Marquis slowly ascending the hill, he hanging by the chain--like this.\u201d Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in which he ought to have been perfect by that time, seeing that it had been the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village during a whole year.", " Jacques One struck in, and asked if he had ever seen the man before? \u201cNever,\u201d answered the mender of roads, recovering his perpendicular. Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then? \u201cBy his tall figure,\u201d said the mender of roads, softly, and with his finger at his nose. \u201cWhen Monsieur the Marquis demands that evening, 'Say, what is he like?' I make response, 'Tall as a spectre. '\u201d \u201cYou should have said, short as a dwarf,\u201d returned Jacques Two. \u201cBut what did I know? The deed was not then accomplished, neither did he confide in me. Observe! Under those circumstances even, I do not offer my testimony. Monsieur the Marquis indicates me with his finger, standing near our little fountain, and says, 'To me! Bring that rascal!' My faith, messieurs, I offer nothing.\u201d \u201cHe is right there, Jacques,\u201d murmured Defarge, to him who had interrupted. \u201cGo on!\u201d \u201cGood!\u201d said the mender of roads, with an air of mystery.", " \u201cTouch then.\u201d It was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this time, after observing these operations. They again joined hands. \u201cTo-night?\u201d said the mender of roads. \u201cTo-night,\u201d said the man, putting the pipe in his mouth. \u201cWhere?\u201d \u201cHere.\u201d He and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at one another, with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge of bayonets, until the sky began to clear over the village. \u201cShow me!\u201d said the traveller then, moving to the brow of the hill. \u201cSee!\u201d returned the mender of roads, with extended finger. \u201cYou go down here, and straight through the street, and past the fountain--\u201d \u201cTo the Devil with all that!\u201d interrupted the other, rolling his eye over the landscape. \u201c_I_ go through no streets and past no fountains.

He looked at them, and saw in them, without knowing it, the slow sure filing down of misery-worn face and figure, that was to make the meagreness of Frenchmen an English superstition which should survive the truth through the best part of a hundred years. Monsieur the Marquis cast his eyes over the submissive faces that drooped before him, as the like of himself had drooped before Monseigneur of the Court--only the difference was, that these faces drooped merely to suffer and not to propitiate--when a grizzled mender of the roads joined the group. \u201cBring me hither that fellow!\u201d said the Marquis to the courier. The fellow was brought, cap in hand, and the other fellows closed round to look and listen, in the manner of the people at the Paris fountain. \u201cI passed you on the road?\u201d \u201cMonseigneur, it is true."], "What does Darnay tell the Marquis that their family legacy is?": [" Oh Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, I pray you be you true to me! \u201cFrom this prison here of horror, whence I every hour tend nearer and nearer to destruction, I send you, Monsieur heretofore the Marquis, the assurance of my dolorous and unhappy service. \u201cYour afflicted, \u201cGabelle.\u201d The latent uneasiness in Darnay's mind was roused to vigourous life by this letter. The peril of an old servant and a good one, whose only crime was fidelity to himself and his family, stared him so reproachfully in the face, that, as he walked to and fro in the Temple considering what to do, he almost hid his face from the passersby. He knew very well, that in his horror of the deed which had culminated the bad deeds and bad reputation of the old family house, in his resentful suspicions of his uncle, and in the aversion with which his conscience regarded the crumbling fabric that he was supposed to uphold, he had acted imperfectly.", " \u201cDetestation of the high is the involuntary homage of the low.\u201d \u201cThere is not,\u201d pursued the nephew, in his former tone, \u201ca face I can look at, in all this country round about us, which looks at me with any deference on it but the dark deference of fear and slavery.\u201d \u201cA compliment,\u201d said the Marquis, \u201cto the grandeur of the family, merited by the manner in which the family has sustained its grandeur. Hah!\u201d And he took another gentle little pinch of snuff, and lightly crossed his legs. But, when his nephew, leaning an elbow on the table, covered his eyes thoughtfully and dejectedly with his hand, the fine mask looked at him sideways with a stronger concentration of keenness, closeness, and dislike, than was comportable with its wearer's assumption of indifference. \u201cRepression is the only lasting philosophy. The dark deference of fear and slavery, my friend,\u201d observed the Marquis, \u201cwill keep the dogs obedient to the whip, as long as this roof,\u201d looking up to it, \u201cshuts out the sky.\u201d That might not be so long as the Marquis supposed.", " Ask him, is that so.\u201d \u201cIt is so,\u201d assented Defarge again. \u201cI communicate to him that secret. I smite this bosom with these two hands as I smite it now, and I tell him, 'Defarge, I was brought up among the fishermen of the sea-shore, and that peasant family so injured by the two Evremonde brothers, as that Bastille paper describes, is my family. Defarge, that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon the ground was my sister, that husband was my sister's husband, that unborn child was their child, that brother was my brother, that father was my father, those dead are my dead, and that summons to answer for those things descends to me!' Ask him, is that so.\u201d \u201cIt is so,\u201d assented Defarge once more. \u201cThen tell Wind and Fire where to stop,\u201d returned madame; \u201cbut don't tell me.\u201d Both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature of her wrath--the listener could feel how white she was, without seeing her--and both highly commended it.", " After sipping his cognac to the end, he added: \u201cYes, Miss Manette is going to be married. But not to an Englishman; to one who, like herself, is French by birth. And speaking of Gaspard (ah, poor Gaspard! It was cruel, cruel! ), it is a curious thing that she is going to marry the nephew of Monsieur the Marquis, for whom Gaspard was exalted to that height of so many feet; in other words, the present Marquis. But he lives unknown in England, he is no Marquis there; he is Mr. Charles Darnay. D'Aulnais is the name of his mother's family.\u201d Madame Defarge knitted steadily, but the intelligence had a palpable effect upon her husband. Do what he would, behind the little counter, as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe, he was troubled, and his hand was not trustworthy. The spy would have been no spy if he had failed to see it, or to record it in his mind. Having made, at least, this one hit, whatever it might prove to be worth, and no customers coming in to help him to any other, Mr. Barsad paid for what he had drunk, and took his leave: taking occasion to say, in a genteel manner, before he departed, that he looked forward to the pleasure of seeing Monsieur and Madame Defarge again."], "What happens to the Marquis the next morning?": [" \u201cWhat has gone wrong?\u201d said Monsieur, calmly looking out.

I had no apprehension whatever of my real danger; but I was conscious that there might be danger for others, if others were compromised by possessing the knowledge that I possessed. \u201cI was much engaged that day, and could not complete my letter that night. I rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it. It was the last day of the year.

It is so cold, so dark, my senses are so benumbed, and the gloom upon me is so dreadful. \u201cThe lady was young, engaging, and handsome, but not marked for long life. She was in great agitation. She presented herself to me as the wife of the Marquis St. Evremonde. I connected the title by which the boy had addressed the elder brother, with the initial letter embroidered on the scarf, and had no difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that I had seen that nobleman very lately."], "Who tells Doctor Manette of his love for Lucie?": [" Dear Doctor Manette, I love your daughter fondly, dearly, disinterestedly, devotedly. If ever there were love in the world, I love her. You have loved yourself; let your old love speak for me!\u201d The Doctor sat with his face turned away, and his eyes bent on the ground. At the last words, he stretched out his hand again, hurriedly, and cried: \u201cNot that, sir! Let that be! I adjure you, do not recall that!\u201d His cry was so like a cry of actual pain, that it rang in Charles Darnay's ears long after he had ceased. He motioned with the hand he had extended, and it seemed to be an appeal to Darnay to pause. The latter so received it, and remained silent. \u201cI ask your pardon,\u201d said the Doctor, in a subdued tone, after some moments. \u201cI do not doubt your loving Lucie; you may be satisfied of it.\u201d He turned towards him in his chair, but did not look at him, or raise his eyes.

But, Miss Pross suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body, and retired into the house. She was not unfrequently the victim of this disorder, and she called it, in familiar conversation, \u201ca fit of the jerks.\u201d The Doctor was in his best condition, and looked specially young. The resemblance between him and Lucie was very strong at such times, and as they sat side by side, she leaning on his shoulder, and he resting his arm on the back of her chair, it was very agreeable to trace the likeness. He had been talking all day, on many subjects, and with unusual vivacity. \u201cPray, Doctor Manette,\u201d said Mr. Darnay, as they sat under the plane-tree--and he said it in the natural pursuit of the topic in hand, which happened to be the old buildings of London--\u201chave you seen much of the Tower?\u201d \u201cLucie and I have been there; but only casually.", " \u201cDo you suppose,\u201d Mr. Lorry went on, with a laughing twinkle in his bright eye, as it looked kindly at her, \u201cthat Doctor Manette has any theory of his own, preserved through all those years, relative to the cause of his being so oppressed; perhaps, even to the name of his oppressor?\u201d \u201cI don't suppose anything about it but what Ladybird tells me.\u201d \u201cAnd that is--?\u201d \u201cThat she thinks he has.\u201d \u201cNow don't be angry at my asking all these questions; because I am a mere dull man of business, and you are a woman of business.\u201d \u201cDull?\u201d Miss Pross inquired, with placidity. Rather wishing his modest adjective away, Mr. Lorry replied, \u201cNo, no, no. Surely not. To return to business:--Is it not remarkable that Doctor Manette, unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured he is, should never touch upon that question? I will not say with me, though he had business relations with me many years ago, and we are now intimate; I will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly attached, and who is so devotedly attached to him?", " I examine it, very closely.

But, that circumstance too, had had its influence in his course. He walked to and fro, with thoughts very busy, until it was time to return to Tellson's and take leave of Mr. Lorry. As soon as he arrived in Paris he would present himself to this old friend, but he must say nothing of his intention now. A carriage with post-horses was ready at the Bank door, and Jerry was booted and equipped. \u201cI have delivered that letter,\u201d said Charles Darnay to Mr. Lorry. \u201cI would not consent to your being charged with any written answer, but perhaps you will take a verbal one?\u201d \u201cThat I will, and readily,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, \u201cif it is not dangerous.\u201d \u201cNot at all. Though it is to a prisoner in the Abbaye.\u201d \u201cWhat is his name?\u201d said Mr. Lorry, with his open pocket-book in his hand.", " On a day in August, when Mr. Stryver (after notifying to his jackal that \u201che had thought better of that marrying matter\u201d) had carried his delicacy into Devonshire, and when the sight and scent of flowers in the City streets had some waifs of goodness in them for the worst, of health for the sickliest, and of youth for the oldest, Sydney's feet still trod those stones. From being irresolute and purposeless, his feet became animated by an intention, and, in the working out of that intention, they took him to the Doctor's door. He was shown up-stairs, and found Lucie at her work, alone. She had never been quite at her ease with him, and received him with some little embarrassment as he seated himself near her table. But, looking up at his face in the interchange of the first few common-places, she observed a change in it. \u201cI fear you are not well, Mr. Carton!\u201d \u201cNo. But the life I lead, Miss Manette, is not conducive to health.", " Walking between her father and Mr. Darnay, Lucie Manette passed into the open air. A hackney-coach was called, and the father and daughter departed in it. Mr. Stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back to the robing-room. Another person, who had not joined the group, or interchanged a word with any one of them, but who had been leaning against the wall where its shadow was darkest, had silently strolled out after the rest, and had looked on until the coach drove away. He now stepped up to where Mr. Lorry and Mr. Darnay stood upon the pavement. \u201cSo, Mr. Lorry! Men of business may speak to Mr. Darnay now?\u201d Nobody had made any acknowledgment of Mr. Carton's part in the day's proceedings; nobody had known of it. He was unrobed, and was none the better for it in appearance. \u201cIf you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind, when the business mind is divided between good-natured impulse and business appearances, you would be amused, Mr. Darnay.\u201d Mr. Lorry reddened, and said, warmly, \u201cYou have mentioned that before, sir.", " Do you go with me to the Bank?\u201d \u201cI'll hear what you have got to say. Yes, I'll go with you.\u201d \u201cI propose that we first conduct your sister safely to the corner of her own street. Let me take your arm, Miss Pross. This is not a good city, at this time, for you to be out in, unprotected; and as your escort knows Mr. Barsad, I will invite him to Mr. Lorry's with us. Are we ready? Come then!\u201d Miss Pross recalled soon afterwards, and to the end of her life remembered, that as she pressed her hands on Sydney's arm and looked up in his face, imploring him to do no hurt to Solomon, there was a braced purpose in the arm and a kind of inspiration in the eyes, which not only contradicted his light manner, but changed and raised the man. She was too much occupied then with fears for the brother who so little deserved her affection, and with Sydney's friendly reassurances, adequately to heed what she observed."], "What does Mr. Lorry find out about Stryver from Doctor Manette?": [" The confidence is not of my seeking, recollect. Now, you think I may not be right?\u201d \u201cNot I!\u201d said Stryver, whistling. \u201cI can't undertake to find third parties in common sense; I can only find it for myself. I suppose sense in certain quarters; you suppose mincing bread-and-butter nonsense. It's new to me, but you are right, I dare say.\u201d \u201cWhat I suppose, Mr. Stryver, I claim to characterise for myself--And understand me, sir,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, quickly flushing again, \u201cI will not--not even at Tellson's--have it characterised for me by any gentleman breathing.\u201d \u201cThere! I beg your pardon!\u201d said Stryver. \u201cGranted. Thank you. Well, Mr. Stryver, I was about to say:--it might be painful to you to find yourself mistaken, it might be painful to Doctor Manette to have the task of being explicit with you, it might be very painful to Miss Manette to have the task of being explicit with you. You know the terms upon which I have the honour and happiness to stand with the family.", " \u201cD--n it all, sir!\u201d said Stryver, staring at him, \u201cam I not eligible?\u201d \u201cOh dear yes! Yes. Oh yes, you're eligible!\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cIf you say eligible, you are eligible.\u201d \u201cAm I not prosperous?\u201d asked Stryver. \u201cOh! if you come to prosperous, you are prosperous,\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cAnd advancing?\u201d \u201cIf you come to advancing you know,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, delighted to be able to make another admission, \u201cnobody can doubt that.\u201d \u201cThen what on earth is your meaning, Mr. Lorry?\u201d demanded Stryver, perceptibly crestfallen. \u201cWell! I--Were you going there now?\u201d asked Mr. Lorry. \u201cStraight!\u201d said Stryver, with a plump of his fist on the desk. \u201cThen I think I wouldn't, if I was you.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d said Stryver. \u201cNow, I'll put you in a corner,\u201d forensically shaking a forefinger at him. \u201cYou are a man of business and bound to have a reason. State your reason. Why wouldn't you go?\u201d \u201cBecause,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, \u201cI wouldn't go on such an object without having some cause to believe that I should succeed.\u201d \u201cD--n _me_!\u201d cried Stryver, \u201cbut this beats everything.\u201d Mr. Lorry glanced at the distant House, and glanced at the angry Stryver.", " \u201cThat is what I mean to tell you, sir,\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cPray let there be no mistake about it.\u201d Mr. Stryver sucked the end of a ruler for a little while, and then stood hitting a tune out of his teeth with it, which probably gave him the toothache. He broke the awkward silence by saying: \u201cThis is something new to me, Mr. Lorry. You deliberately advise me not to go up to Soho and offer myself--_my_self, Stryver of the King's Bench bar?\u201d \u201cDo you ask me for my advice, Mr. Stryver?\u201d \u201cYes, I do.\u201d \u201cVery good. Then I give it, and you have repeated it correctly.\u201d \u201cAnd all I can say of it is,\u201d laughed Stryver with a vexed laugh, \u201cthat this--ha, ha!--beats everything past, present, and to come.\u201d \u201cNow understand me,\u201d pursued Mr. Lorry. \u201cAs a man of business, I am not justified in saying anything about this matter, for, as a man of business, I know nothing of it. But, as an old fellow, who has carried Miss Manette in his arms, who is the trusted friend of Miss Manette and of her father too, and who has a great affection for them both, I have spoken.", " \u201cWhy, no, thank you; this is a private visit to yourself, Mr. Lorry; I have come for a private word.\u201d \u201cOh indeed!\u201d said Mr. Lorry, bending down his ear, while his eye strayed to the House afar off. \u201cI am going,\u201d said Mr. Stryver, leaning his arms confidentially on the desk: whereupon, although it was a large double one, there appeared to be not half desk enough for him: \u201cI am going to make an offer of myself in marriage to your agreeable little friend, Miss Manette, Mr. Lorry.\u201d \u201cOh dear me!\u201d cried Mr. Lorry, rubbing his chin, and looking at his visitor dubiously. \u201cOh dear me, sir?\u201d repeated Stryver, drawing back. \u201cOh dear you, sir? What may your meaning be, Mr. Lorry?\u201d \u201cMy meaning,\u201d answered the man of business, \u201cis, of course, friendly and appreciative, and that it does you the greatest credit, and--in short, my meaning is everything you could desire. But--really, you know, Mr. Stryver--\u201d Mr. Lorry paused, and shook his head at him in the oddest manner, as if he were compelled against his will to add, internally, \u201cyou know there really is so much too much of you!\u201d \u201cWell!\u201d said Stryver, slapping the desk with his contentious hand, opening his eyes wider, and taking a long breath, \u201cif I understand you, Mr. Lorry, I'll be hanged!\u201d Mr. Lorry adjusted his little wig at both ears as a means towards that end, and bit the feather of a pen."], "Who tells Lucie he loves her and would die for her?": [" I know that when she is clinging to you, the hands of baby, girl, and woman, all in one, are round your neck. I know that in loving you she sees and loves her mother at her own age, sees and loves you at my age, loves her mother broken-hearted, loves you through your dreadful trial and in your blessed restoration. I have known this, night and day, since I have known you in your home.\u201d Her father sat silent, with his face bent down. His breathing was a little quickened; but he repressed all other signs of agitation. \u201cDear Doctor Manette, always knowing this, always seeing her and you with this hallowed light about you, I have forborne, and forborne, as long as it was in the nature of man to do it. I have felt, and do even now feel, that to bring my love--even mine--between you, is to touch your history with something not quite so good as itself. But I love her. Heaven is my witness that I love her!\u201d \u201cI believe it,\u201d answered her father, mournfully.", " While they despise your breath, and would stop it for ever and ever, in you or in a hundred like you rather than in one of their own horses or dogs, they only know what your breath tells them. Let it deceive them, then, a little longer; it cannot deceive them too much.\u201d Madame Defarge looked superciliously at the client, and nodded in confirmation. \u201cAs to you,\u201d said she, \u201cyou would shout and shed tears for anything, if it made a show and a noise. Say! Would you not?\u201d \u201cTruly, madame, I think so. For the moment.\u201d \u201cIf you were shown a great heap of dolls, and were set upon them to pluck them to pieces and despoil them for your own advantage, you would pick out the richest and gayest. Say! Would you not?\u201d \u201cTruly yes, madame.\u201d \u201cYes. And if you were shown a flock of birds, unable to fly, and were set upon them to strip them of their feathers for your own advantage, you would set upon the birds of the finest feathers; would you not?\u201d \u201cIt is true, madame.\u201d \u201cYou have seen both dolls and birds to-day,\u201d said Madame Defarge, with a wave of her hand towards the place where they had last been apparent; \u201cnow, go home!\u201d XVI.", " Not to divide with Lucie her privilege as your child, companion, and friend; but to come in aid of it, and bind her closer to you, if such a thing can be.\u201d His touch still lingered on her father's hand. Answering the touch for a moment, but not coldly, her father rested his hands upon the arms of his chair, and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the conference. A struggle was evidently in his face; a struggle with that occasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread. \u201cYou speak so feelingly and so manfully, Charles Darnay, that I thank you with all my heart, and will open all my heart--or nearly so. Have you any reason to believe that Lucie loves you?\u201d \u201cNone. As yet, none.\u201d \u201cIs it the immediate object of this confidence, that you may at once ascertain that, with my knowledge?\u201d \u201cNot even so. I might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks; I might (mistaken or not mistaken) have that hopefulness to-morrow.\u201d \u201cDo you seek any guidance from me?\u201d \u201cI ask none, sir.", " The corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes; it had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet, that it seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had set it going. \u201cHere they are!\u201d said Miss Pross, rising to break up the conference; \u201cand now we shall have hundreds of people pretty soon!\u201d It was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties, such a peculiar Ear of a place, that as Mr. Lorry stood at the open window, looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard, he fancied they would never approach. Not only would the echoes die away, as though the steps had gone; but, echoes of other steps that never came would be heard in their stead, and would die away for good when they seemed close at hand. However, father and daughter did at last appear, and Miss Pross was ready at the street door to receive them. Miss Pross was a pleasant sight, albeit wild, and red, and grim, taking off her darling's bonnet when she came up-stairs, and touching it up with the ends of her handkerchief, and blowing the dust off it, and folding her mantle ready for laying by, and smoothing her rich hair with as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she had been the vainest and handsomest of women."], "What does Carton say about his life?": [" Take up the pen and finish. Hurry, hurry!\u201d As if his memory were impaired, or his faculties disordered, the prisoner made an effort to rally his attention. As he looked at Carton with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing, Carton--his hand again in his breast--looked steadily at him. \u201cHurry, hurry!\u201d The prisoner bent over the paper, once more. \u201c'If it had been otherwise;'\u201d Carton's hand was again watchfully and softly stealing down; \u201c'I never should have used the longer opportunity. If it had been otherwise;'\u201d the hand was at the prisoner's face; \u201c'I should but have had so much the more to answer for. If it had been otherwise--'\u201d Carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into unintelligible signs. Carton's hand moved back to his breast no more. The prisoner sprang up with a reproachful look, but Carton's hand was close and firm at his nostrils, and Carton's left arm caught him round the waist.", " The prisoner was like a young child in his hands. \u201cCarton! Dear Carton! It is madness. It cannot be accomplished, it never can be done, it has been attempted, and has always failed. I implore you not to add your death to the bitterness of mine.\u201d \u201cDo I ask you, my dear Darnay, to pass the door? When I ask that, refuse. There are pen and ink and paper on this table. Is your hand steady enough to write?\u201d \u201cIt was when you came in.\u201d \u201cSteady it again, and write what I shall dictate. Quick, friend, quick!\u201d Pressing his hand to his bewildered head, Darnay sat down at the table. Carton, with his right hand in his breast, stood close beside him. \u201cWrite exactly as I speak.\u201d \u201cTo whom do I address it?\u201d \u201cTo no one.\u201d Carton still had his hand in his breast. \u201cDo I date it?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d The prisoner looked up, at each question. Carton, standing over him with his hand in his breast, looked down. \u201c'If you remember,'\u201d said Carton, dictating, \u201c'the words that passed between us, long ago, you will readily comprehend this when you see it.", " There, he laid her down on a couch, where her child and Miss Pross wept over her. \u201cDon't recall her to herself,\u201d he said, softly, to the latter, \u201cshe is better so. Don't revive her to consciousness, while she only faints.\u201d \u201cOh, Carton, Carton, dear Carton!\u201d cried little Lucie, springing up and throwing her arms passionately round him, in a burst of grief. \u201cNow that you have come, I think you will do something to help mamma, something to save papa! O, look at her, dear Carton! Can you, of all the people who love her, bear to see her so?\u201d He bent over the child, and laid her blooming cheek against his face. He put her gently from him, and looked at her unconscious mother. \u201cBefore I go,\u201d he said, and paused--\u201cI may kiss her?\u201d It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face with his lips, he murmured some words. The child, who was nearest to him, told them afterwards, and told her grandchildren when she was a handsome old lady, that she heard him say, \u201cA life you love.\u201d When he had gone out into the next room, he turned suddenly on Mr. Lorry and her father, who were following, and said to the latter: \u201cYou had great influence but yesterday, Doctor Manette; let it at least be tried.", " \u201cI begin to have a very good opinion of your understanding.\u201d \u201cNevertheless,\u201d pursued Darnay, rising to ring the bell, \u201cthere is nothing in that, I hope, to prevent my calling the reckoning, and our parting without ill-blood on either side.\u201d Carton rejoining, \u201cNothing in life!\u201d Darnay rang. \u201cDo you call the whole reckoning?\u201d said Carton. On his answering in the affirmative, \u201cThen bring me another pint of this same wine, drawer, and come and wake me at ten.\u201d The bill being paid, Charles Darnay rose and wished him good night. Without returning the wish, Carton rose too, with something of a threat of defiance in his manner, and said, \u201cA last word, Mr. Darnay: you think I am drunk?\u201d \u201cI think you have been drinking, Mr. Carton.\u201d \u201cThink? You know I have been drinking.\u201d \u201cSince I must say so, I know it.\u201d \u201cThen you shall likewise know why. I am a disappointed drudge, sir.

No! Not he! I'll have my head took off, if he was ever in it.\u201d The spy looked round at the two gentlemen; they both looked in unspeakable astonishment at Jerry. \u201cI tell you,\u201d said Jerry, \u201cthat you buried paving-stones and earth in that there coffin. Don't go and tell me that you buried Cly. It was a take in. Me and two more knows it.\u201d \u201cHow do you know it?\u201d \u201cWhat's that to you?

I'd catch hold of your throat and choke you for half a guinea.\u201d Sydney Carton, who, with Mr. Lorry, had been lost in amazement at this turn of the business, here requested Mr. Cruncher to moderate and explain himself.", " What's it about?\u201d \u201c_I_ don't know,\u201d said the man. \u201cSpies! Yaha! Tst! Spies!\u201d He asked another man. \u201cWho is it?\u201d \u201c_I_ don't know,\u201d returned the man, clapping his hands to his mouth nevertheless, and vociferating in a surprising heat and with the greatest ardour, \u201cSpies!

Tst! Yah! Old Bailey Spi--i--ies!\u201d \u201cWhy, to be sure!\u201d exclaimed Jerry, recalling the Trial at which he had assisted. \u201cI've seen him. Dead, is he?\u201d \u201cDead as mutton,\u201d returned the other, \u201cand can't be too dead. Have 'em out, there! Spies! Pull 'em out, there! Spies!\u201d The idea was so acceptable in the prevalent absence of any idea, that the crowd caught it up with eagerness, and loudly repeating the suggestion to have 'em out, and to pull 'em out, mobbed the two vehicles so closely that they came to a stop.", " Thus, with beer-drinking, pipe-smoking, song-roaring, and infinite caricaturing of woe, the disorderly procession went its way, recruiting at every step, and all the shops shutting up before it. Its destination was the old church of Saint Pancras, far off in the fields. It got there in course of time; insisted on pouring into the burial-ground; finally, accomplished the interment of the deceased Roger Cly in its own way, and highly to its own satisfaction. The dead man disposed of, and the crowd being under the necessity of providing some other entertainment for itself, another brighter genius (or perhaps the same) conceived the humour of impeaching casual passers-by, as Old Bailey spies, and wreaking vengeance on them. Chase was given to some scores of inoffensive persons who had never been near the Old Bailey in their lives, in the realisation of this fancy, and they were roughly hustled and maltreated.", " No. Yet I know the face.\u201d \u201cI think not. I am sure not. It can't be,\u201d said the spy. \u201cIt-can't-be,\u201d muttered Sydney Carton, retrospectively, and idling his glass (which fortunately was a small one) again. \u201cCan't-be. Spoke good French. Yet like a foreigner, I thought?\u201d \u201cProvincial,\u201d said the spy. \u201cNo. Foreign!\u201d cried Carton, striking his open hand on the table, as a light broke clearly on his mind. \u201cCly! Disguised, but the same man. We had that man before us at the Old Bailey.\u201d \u201cNow, there you are hasty, sir,\u201d said Barsad, with a smile that gave his aquiline nose an extra inclination to one side; \u201cthere you really give me an advantage over you. Cly (who I will unreservedly admit, at this distance of time, was a partner of mine) has been dead several years. I attended him in his last illness. He was buried in London, at the church of Saint Pancras-in-the-Fields. His unpopularity with the blackguard multitude at the moment prevented my following his remains, but I helped to lay him in his coffin.\u201d Here, Mr. Lorry became aware, from where he sat, of a most remarkable goblin shadow on the wall."], "What does Jerry Cruncher\u2019s son see his father do?": [" \u201cI am saying nothing.\u201d \u201cWell, then; don't meditate nothing.

You may say yes, Jerry.\u201d Mr. Cruncher had no particular meaning in these sulky corroborations, but made use of them, as people not unfrequently do, to express general ironical dissatisfaction. \u201cYou and your yes, Jerry,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, taking a bite out of his bread-and-butter, and seeming to help it down with a large invisible oyster out of his saucer. \u201cAh!

From his oppressed slumber, Young Jerry in his closet was awakened after daybreak and before sunrise, by the presence of his father in the family room. Something had gone wrong with him; at least, so Young Jerry inferred, from the circumstance of his holding Mrs. Cruncher by the ears, and knocking the back of her head against the head-board of the bed. \u201cI told you I would,\u201d said Mr. Cruncher, \u201cand I did.\u201d \u201cJerry, Jerry, Jerry!\u201d his wife implored. \u201cYou oppose yourself to the profit of the business,\u201d said Jerry, \u201cand me and my partners suffer. You was to honour and obey; why the devil don't you?\u201d \u201cI try to be a good wife, Jerry,\u201d the poor woman protested, with tears. \u201cIs it being a good wife to oppose your husband's business?", " There was no fish for breakfast, and not much of anything else. Mr. Cruncher was out of spirits, and out of temper, and kept an iron pot-lid by him as a projectile for the correction of Mrs. Cruncher, in case he should observe any symptoms of her saying Grace. He was brushed and washed at the usual hour, and set off with his son to pursue his ostensible calling. Young Jerry, walking with the stool under his arm at his father's side along sunny and crowded Fleet-street, was a very different Young Jerry from him of the previous night, running home through darkness and solitude from his grim pursuer. His cunning was fresh with the day, and his qualms were gone with the night--in which particulars it is not improbable that he had compeers in Fleet-street and the City of London, that fine morning. \u201cFather,\u201d said Young Jerry, as they walked along: taking care to keep at arm's length and to have the stool well between them: \u201cwhat's a Resurrection-Man?\u201d Mr. Cruncher came to a stop on the pavement before he answered, \u201cHow should I know?\u201d \u201cI thought you knowed everything, father,\u201d said the artless boy.", " \u201cHem!

Be careful to dewelop your talents, and never to say no more than you can help to nobody, and there's no telling at the present time what you may not come to be fit for.\u201d As Young Jerry, thus encouraged, went on a few yards in advance, to plant the stool in the shadow of the Bar, Mr. Cruncher added to himself: \u201cJerry, you honest tradesman, there's hopes wot that boy will yet be a blessing to you, and a recompense to you for his mother!\u201d XV."], "What does the mender of roads tell the Jacques about?": [" Jacques One struck in, and asked if he had ever seen the man before? \u201cNever,\u201d answered the mender of roads, recovering his perpendicular. Jacques Three demanded how he afterwards recognised him then? \u201cBy his tall figure,\u201d said the mender of roads, softly, and with his finger at his nose. \u201cWhen Monsieur the Marquis demands that evening, 'Say, what is he like?' I make response, 'Tall as a spectre. '\u201d \u201cYou should have said, short as a dwarf,\u201d returned Jacques Two. \u201cBut what did I know? The deed was not then accomplished, neither did he confide in me. Observe! Under those circumstances even, I do not offer my testimony. Monsieur the Marquis indicates me with his finger, standing near our little fountain, and says, 'To me! Bring that rascal!' My faith, messieurs, I offer nothing.\u201d \u201cHe is right there, Jacques,\u201d murmured Defarge, to him who had interrupted. \u201cGo on!\u201d \u201cGood!\u201d said the mender of roads, with an air of mystery.", " And between them and the white-haired man afar off, was the one small link, that they had once looked in at him through the chinks in the wall. Defarge closed the door carefully, and spoke in a subdued voice: \u201cJacques One, Jacques Two, Jacques Three! This is the witness encountered by appointment, by me, Jacques Four. He will tell you all. Speak, Jacques Five!\u201d The mender of roads, blue cap in hand, wiped his swarthy forehead with it, and said, \u201cWhere shall I commence, monsieur?\u201d \u201cCommence,\u201d was Monsieur Defarge's not unreasonable reply, \u201cat the commencement.\u201d \u201cI saw him then, messieurs,\u201d began the mender of roads, \u201ca year ago this running summer, underneath the carriage of the Marquis, hanging by the chain. Behold the manner of it. I leaving my work on the road, the sun going to bed, the carriage of the Marquis slowly ascending the hill, he hanging by the chain--like this.\u201d Again the mender of roads went through the whole performance; in which he ought to have been perfect by that time, seeing that it had been the infallible resource and indispensable entertainment of his village during a whole year.", " \u201cTouch then.\u201d It was the turn of the mender of roads to say it this time, after observing these operations. They again joined hands. \u201cTo-night?\u201d said the mender of roads. \u201cTo-night,\u201d said the man, putting the pipe in his mouth. \u201cWhere?\u201d \u201cHere.\u201d He and the mender of roads sat on the heap of stones looking silently at one another, with the hail driving in between them like a pigmy charge of bayonets, until the sky began to clear over the village. \u201cShow me!\u201d said the traveller then, moving to the brow of the hill. \u201cSee!\u201d returned the mender of roads, with extended finger. \u201cYou go down here, and straight through the street, and past the fountain--\u201d \u201cTo the Devil with all that!\u201d interrupted the other, rolling his eye over the landscape. \u201c_I_ go through no streets and past no fountains. Well?\u201d \u201cWell! About two leagues beyond the summit of that hill above the village.\u201d \u201cGood. When do you cease to work?\u201d \u201cAt sunset.\u201d \u201cWill you wake me, before departing?", " \u201cGood day, gentlemen!\u201d said Monsieur Defarge. It may have been a signal for loosening the general tongue. It elicited an answering chorus of \u201cGood day!\u201d \u201cIt is bad weather, gentlemen,\u201d said Defarge, shaking his head. Upon which, every man looked at his neighbour, and then all cast down their eyes and sat silent. Except one man, who got up and went out. \u201cMy wife,\u201d said Defarge aloud, addressing Madame Defarge: \u201cI have travelled certain leagues with this good mender of roads, called Jacques. I met him--by accident--a day and half's journey out of Paris. He is a good child, this mender of roads, called Jacques. Give him to drink, my wife!\u201d A second man got up and went out. Madame Defarge set wine before the mender of roads called Jacques, who doffed his blue cap to the company, and drank. In the breast of his blouse he carried some coarse dark bread; he ate of this between whiles, and sat munching and drinking near Madame Defarge's counter."], "What is Madame Defarge knitting?": [" Good day, one and all!\u201d \u201cHave the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a mouthful of cool fresh water, madame.\u201d Madame complied with a polite air. \u201cMarvellous cognac this, madame!\u201d It was the first time it had ever been so complimented, and Madame Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better. She said, however, that the cognac was flattered, and took up her knitting. The visitor watched her fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity of observing the place in general. \u201cYou knit with great skill, madame.\u201d \u201cI am accustomed to it.\u201d \u201cA pretty pattern too!\u201d \u201c_You_ think so?\u201d said madame, looking at him with a smile. \u201cDecidedly. May one ask what it is for?\u201d \u201cPastime,\u201d said madame, still looking at him with a smile while her fingers moved nimbly. \u201cNot for use?\u201d \u201cThat depends. I may find a use for it one day. If I do--Well,\u201d said madame, drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of coquetry, \u201cI'll use it!\u201d It was remarkable; but, the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge.", " The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to fall, threatening and dark, on both the mother and the child. \u201cIt is enough, my husband,\u201d said Madame Defarge. \u201cI have seen them. We may go.\u201d But, the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it--not visible and presented, but indistinct and withheld--to alarm Lucie into saying, as she laid her appealing hand on Madame Defarge's dress: \u201cYou will be good to my poor husband. You will do him no harm. You will help me to see him if you can?\u201d \u201cYour husband is not my business here,\u201d returned Madame Defarge, looking down at her with perfect composure. \u201cIt is the daughter of your father who is my business here.\u201d \u201cFor my sake, then, be merciful to my husband. For my child's sake! She will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful. We are more afraid of you than of these others.\u201d Madame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her husband.", " It was a passionate, loving, thankful, womanly action, but the hand made no response--dropped cold and heavy, and took to its knitting again. There was something in its touch that gave Lucie a check. She stopped in the act of putting the note in her bosom, and, with her hands yet at her neck, looked terrified at Madame Defarge. Madame Defarge met the lifted eyebrows and forehead with a cold, impassive stare. \u201cMy dear,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, striking in to explain; \u201cthere are frequent risings in the streets; and, although it is not likely they will ever trouble you, Madame Defarge wishes to see those whom she has the power to protect at such times, to the end that she may know them--that she may identify them. I believe,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, rather halting in his reassuring words, as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself upon him more and more, \u201cI state the case, Citizen Defarge?\u201d Defarge looked gloomily at his wife, and gave no other answer than a gruff sound of acquiescence.", " \u201cYou had better, Lucie,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, doing all he could to propitiate, by tone and manner, \u201chave the dear child here, and our good Pross. Our good Pross, Defarge, is an English lady, and knows no French.\u201d The lady in question, whose rooted conviction that she was more than a match for any foreigner, was not to be shaken by distress and, danger, appeared with folded arms, and observed in English to The Vengeance, whom her eyes first encountered, \u201cWell, I am sure, Boldface! I hope _you_ are pretty well!\u201d She also bestowed a British cough on Madame Defarge; but, neither of the two took much heed of her. \u201cIs that his child?\u201d said Madame Defarge, stopping in her work for the first time, and pointing her knitting-needle at little Lucie as if it were the finger of Fate. \u201cYes, madame,\u201d answered Mr. Lorry; \u201cthis is our poor prisoner's darling daughter, and only child.\u201d The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed to fall so threatening and dark on the child, that her mother instinctively kneeled on the ground beside her, and held her to her breast."], "Whose name is added to the registry after the spy Barsad\u2019s visit to the wine shop?": [" I wish you had a better employed brother than Mr. Barsad. I wish for your sake Mr. Barsad was not a Sheep of the Prisons.\u201d Sheep was a cant word of the time for a spy, under the gaolers. The spy, who was pale, turned paler, and asked him how he dared-- \u201cI'll tell you,\u201d said Sydney. \u201cI lighted on you, Mr. Barsad, coming out of the prison of the Conciergerie while I was contemplating the walls, an hour or more ago. You have a face to be remembered, and I remember faces well. Made curious by seeing you in that connection, and having a reason, to which you are no stranger, for associating you with the misfortunes of a friend now very unfortunate, I walked in your direction. I walked into the wine-shop here, close after you, and sat near you. I had no difficulty in deducing from your unreserved conversation, and the rumour openly going about among your admirers, the nature of your calling. And gradually, what I had done at random, seemed to shape itself into a purpose, Mr. Barsad.\u201d \u201cWhat purpose?\u201d the spy asked.", " That's an excellent card. Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion, that Mr. Barsad, still in the pay of the aristocratic English government, is the spy of Pitt, the treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom, the English traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so difficult to find. That's a card not to be beaten. Have you followed my hand, Mr. Barsad?\u201d \u201cNot to understand your play,\u201d returned the spy, somewhat uneasily. \u201cI play my Ace, Denunciation of Mr. Barsad to the nearest Section Committee. Look over your hand, Mr. Barsad, and see what you have. Don't hurry.\u201d He drew the bottle near, poured out another glassful of brandy, and drank it off. He saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him. Seeing it, he poured out and drank another glassful. \u201cLook over your hand carefully, Mr. Barsad. Take time.\u201d It was a poorer hand than he suspected.", " He knew beforehand what the price of his luxury was; he has paid the price.\u201d \u201cI believe,\u201d said the spy, dropping his soft voice to a tone that invited confidence, and expressing an injured revolutionary susceptibility in every muscle of his wicked face: \u201cI believe there is much compassion and anger in this neighbourhood, touching the poor fellow? Between ourselves.\u201d \u201cIs there?\u201d asked madame, vacantly. \u201cIs there not?\u201d \u201c--Here is my husband!\u201d said Madame Defarge. As the keeper of the wine-shop entered at the door, the spy saluted him by touching his hat, and saying, with an engaging smile, \u201cGood day, Jacques!\u201d Defarge stopped short, and stared at him. \u201cGood day, Jacques!\u201d the spy repeated; with not quite so much confidence, or quite so easy a smile under the stare. \u201cYou deceive yourself, monsieur,\u201d returned the keeper of the wine-shop. \u201cYou mistake me for another. That is not my name. I am Ernest Defarge.\u201d \u201cIt is all the same,\u201d said the spy, airily, but discomfited too: \u201cgood day!\u201d \u201cGood day!\u201d answered Defarge, drily.", " \u201cCourage, dear miss! Courage! Business! The worst will be over in a moment; it is but passing the room-door, and the worst is over. Then, all the good you bring to him, all the relief, all the happiness you bring to him, begin. Let our good friend here, assist you on that side. That's well, friend Defarge. Come, now. Business, business!\u201d They went up slowly and softly. The staircase was short, and they were soon at the top. There, as it had an abrupt turn in it, they came all at once in sight of three men, whose heads were bent down close together at the side of a door, and who were intently looking into the room to which the door belonged, through some chinks or holes in the wall. On hearing footsteps close at hand, these three turned, and rose, and showed themselves to be the three of one name who had been drinking in the wine-shop. \u201cI forgot them in the surprise of your visit,\u201d explained Monsieur Defarge."], "What do Lucie and Darnay do?": [" Speak for yourself.\u201d \u201cI speak for myself,\u201d answered Mr. Lorry, \u201cand for Mr. Darnay, and for Miss Lucie, and--Miss Lucie, do you not think I may speak for us all?\u201d He asked her the question pointedly, and with a glance at her father. His face had become frozen, as it were, in a very curious look at Darnay: an intent look, deepening into a frown of dislike and distrust, not even unmixed with fear. With this strange expression on him his thoughts had wandered away. \u201cMy father,\u201d said Lucie, softly laying her hand on his. He slowly shook the shadow off, and turned to her. \u201cShall we go home, my father?\u201d With a long breath, he answered \u201cYes.\u201d The friends of the acquitted prisoner had dispersed, under the impression--which he himself had originated--that he would not be released that night. The lights were nearly all extinguished in the passages, the iron gates were being closed with a jar and a rattle, and the dismal place was deserted until to-morrow morning's interest of gallows, pillory, whipping-post, and branding-iron, should repeople it.", " \u201cGabelle.\u201d \u201cGabelle. And what is the message to the unfortunate Gabelle in prison?\u201d \u201cSimply, 'that he has received the letter, and will come. '\u201d \u201cAny time mentioned?\u201d \u201cHe will start upon his journey to-morrow night.\u201d \u201cAny person mentioned?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d He helped Mr. Lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks, and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old Bank, into the misty air of Fleet-street. \u201cMy love to Lucie, and to little Lucie,\u201d said Mr. Lorry at parting, \u201cand take precious care of them till I come back.\u201d Charles Darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled, as the carriage rolled away. That night--it was the fourteenth of August--he sat up late, and wrote two fervent letters; one was to Lucie, explaining the strong obligation he was under to go to Paris, and showing her, at length, the reasons that he had, for feeling confident that he could become involved in no personal danger there; the other was to the Doctor, confiding Lucie and their dear child to his care, and dwelling on the same topics with the strongest assurances.", " It was well guarded, and he got up to go among the trusty people who were watching it, when his door suddenly opened, and two figures rushed in, at sight of which he fell back in amazement. Lucie and her father! Lucie with her arms stretched out to him, and with that old look of earnestness so concentrated and intensified, that it seemed as though it had been stamped upon her face expressly to give force and power to it in this one passage of her life. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d cried Mr. Lorry, breathless and confused. \u201cWhat is the matter? Lucie! Manette! What has happened? What has brought you here? What is it?\u201d With the look fixed upon him, in her paleness and wildness, she panted out in his arms, imploringly, \u201cO my dear friend! My husband!\u201d \u201cYour husband, Lucie?\u201d \u201cCharles.\u201d \u201cWhat of Charles?\u201d \u201cHere. \u201cHere, in Paris?\u201d \u201cHas been here some days--three or four--I don't know how many--I can't collect my thoughts.", " Walking between her father and Mr. Darnay, Lucie Manette passed into the open air. A hackney-coach was called, and the father and daughter departed in it. Mr. Stryver had left them in the passages, to shoulder his way back to the robing-room. Another person, who had not joined the group, or interchanged a word with any one of them, but who had been leaning against the wall where its shadow was darkest, had silently strolled out after the rest, and had looked on until the coach drove away. He now stepped up to where Mr. Lorry and Mr. Darnay stood upon the pavement. \u201cSo, Mr. Lorry! Men of business may speak to Mr. Darnay now?\u201d Nobody had made any acknowledgment of Mr. Carton's part in the day's proceedings; nobody had known of it. He was unrobed, and was none the better for it in appearance. \u201cIf you knew what a conflict goes on in the business mind, when the business mind is divided between good-natured impulse and business appearances, you would be amused, Mr. Darnay.\u201d Mr. Lorry reddened, and said, warmly, \u201cYou have mentioned that before, sir."], "What happens to Doctor Manette because of his talk with Darnay?": [" This is idle talk.\u201d So strange was the way in which he faded into silence, and so strange his fixed look when he had ceased to speak, that Darnay felt his own hand turn cold in the hand that slowly released and dropped it. \u201cYou said something to me,\u201d said Doctor Manette, breaking into a smile. \u201cWhat was it you said to me?\u201d He was at a loss how to answer, until he remembered having spoken of a condition. Relieved as his mind reverted to that, he answered: \u201cYour confidence in me ought to be returned with full confidence on my part. My present name, though but slightly changed from my mother's, is not, as you will remember, my own. I wish to tell you what that is, and why I am in England.\u201d \u201cStop!\u201d said the Doctor of Beauvais. \u201cI wish it, that I may the better deserve your confidence, and have no secret from you.\u201d \u201cStop!\u201d For an instant, the Doctor even had his two hands at his ears; for another instant, even had his two hands laid on Darnay's lips.", " To him, now entered Charles Darnay, at sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand. \u201cCharles Darnay! I rejoice to see you. We have been counting on your return these three or four days past. Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton were both here yesterday, and both made you out to be more than due.\u201d \u201cI am obliged to them for their interest in the matter,\u201d he answered, a little coldly as to them, though very warmly as to the Doctor. \u201cMiss Manette--\u201d \u201cIs well,\u201d said the Doctor, as he stopped short, \u201cand your return will delight us all. She has gone out on some household matters, but will soon be home.\u201d \u201cDoctor Manette, I knew she was from home. I took the opportunity of her being from home, to beg to speak to you.\u201d There was a blank silence. \u201cYes?\u201d said the Doctor, with evident constraint. \u201cBring your chair here, and speak on.\u201d He complied as to the chair, but appeared to find the speaking on less easy.", " I examine it, very closely. In a hole in the chimney, where a stone has been worked out and replaced, I find a written paper. This is that written paper. I have made it my business to examine some specimens of the writing of Doctor Manette. This is the writing of Doctor Manette. I confide this paper, in the writing of Doctor Manette, to the hands of the President.\u201d \u201cLet it be read.\u201d In a dead silence and stillness--the prisoner under trial looking lovingly at his wife, his wife only looking from him to look with solicitude at her father, Doctor Manette keeping his eyes fixed on the reader, Madame Defarge never taking hers from the prisoner, Defarge never taking his from his feasting wife, and all the other eyes there intent upon the Doctor, who saw none of them--the paper was read, as follows. X. The Substance of the Shadow \u201cI, Alexandre Manette, unfortunate physician, native of Beauvais, and afterwards resident in Paris, write this melancholy paper in my doleful cell in the Bastille, during the last month of the year, 1767.", " It was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the answer being obvious. If the impression were not produced by a real corresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, Jarvis Lorry, there? How came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in Doctor Manette's consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the Doctor's bedroom door in the early morning? Within a few minutes, Miss Pross stood whispering at his side. If he had had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have resolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none. He advised that they should let the time go by until the regular breakfast-hour, and should then meet the Doctor as if nothing unusual had occurred. If he appeared to be in his customary state of mind, Mr. Lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from the opinion he had been, in his anxiety, so anxious to obtain."], "What do Mr. Lorry and Miss Pross get Doctor Manette to agree to when he recovers?": [" \u201cPooh! You'd have thought!\u201d said Miss Pross; and Mr. Lorry left off. \u201cHow do you do?\u201d inquired that lady then--sharply, and yet as if to express that she bore him no malice. \u201cI am pretty well, I thank you,\u201d answered Mr. Lorry, with meekness; \u201chow are you?\u201d \u201cNothing to boast of,\u201d said Miss Pross. \u201cIndeed?\u201d \u201cAh! indeed!\u201d said Miss Pross. \u201cI am very much put out about my Ladybird.\u201d \u201cIndeed?\u201d \u201cFor gracious sake say something else besides 'indeed,' or you'll fidget me to death,\u201d said Miss Pross: whose character (dissociated from stature) was shortness. \u201cReally, then?\u201d said Mr. Lorry, as an amendment. \u201cReally, is bad enough,\u201d returned Miss Pross, \u201cbut better. Yes, I am very much put out.\u201d \u201cMay I ask the cause?\u201d \u201cI don't want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of Ladybird, to come here looking after her,\u201d said Miss Pross. \u201c_Do_ dozens come for that purpose?\u201d \u201cHundreds,\u201d said Miss Pross.", " Miss Pross's fidelity of belief in Solomon (deducting a mere trifle for this slight mistake) was quite a serious matter with Mr. Lorry, and had its weight in his good opinion of her. \u201cAs we happen to be alone for the moment, and are both people of business,\u201d he said, when they had got back to the drawing-room and had sat down there in friendly relations, \u201clet me ask you--does the Doctor, in talking with Lucie, never refer to the shoemaking time, yet?\u201d \u201cNever.\u201d \u201cAnd yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him?\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d returned Miss Pross, shaking her head. \u201cBut I don't say he don't refer to it within himself.\u201d \u201cDo you believe that he thinks of it much?\u201d \u201cI do,\u201d said Miss Pross. \u201cDo you imagine--\u201d Mr. Lorry had begun, when Miss Pross took him up short with: \u201cNever imagine anything. Have no imagination at all.\u201d \u201cI stand corrected; do you suppose--you go so far as to suppose, sometimes?\u201d \u201cNow and then,\u201d said Miss Pross.", " \u201cYou might, from your appearance, be the wife of Lucifer,\u201d said Miss Pross, in her breathing. \u201cNevertheless, you shall not get the better of me. I am an Englishwoman.\u201d Madame Defarge looked at her scornfully, but still with something of Miss Pross's own perception that they two were at bay. She saw a tight, hard, wiry woman before her, as Mr. Lorry had seen in the same figure a woman with a strong hand, in the years gone by. She knew full well that Miss Pross was the family's devoted friend; Miss Pross knew full well that Madame Defarge was the family's malevolent enemy. \u201cOn my way yonder,\u201d said Madame Defarge, with a slight movement of her hand towards the fatal spot, \u201cwhere they reserve my chair and my knitting for me, I am come to make my compliments to her in passing. I wish to see her.\u201d \u201cI know that your intentions are evil,\u201d said Miss Pross, \u201cand you may depend upon it, I'll hold my own against them.\u201d Each spoke in her own language; neither understood the other's words; both were very watchful, and intent to deduce from look and manner, what the unintelligible words meant.", " Her darling was a pleasant sight too, embracing her and thanking her, and protesting against her taking so much trouble for her--which last she only dared to do playfully, or Miss Pross, sorely hurt, would have retired to her own chamber and cried. The Doctor was a pleasant sight too, looking on at them, and telling Miss Pross how she spoilt Lucie, in accents and with eyes that had as much spoiling in them as Miss Pross had, and would have had more if it were possible. Mr. Lorry was a pleasant sight too, beaming at all this in his little wig, and thanking his bachelor stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a Home. But, no Hundreds of people came to see the sights, and Mr. Lorry looked in vain for the fulfilment of Miss Pross's prediction. Dinner-time, and still no Hundreds of people.

Not that she showed she was pleased, but I suppose she was.\u201d The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this disagreeable companion had, of his own free will, assisted him in the strait of the day. He turned the dialogue to that point, and thanked him for it. \u201cI neither want any thanks, nor merit any,\u201d was the careless rejoinder. \u201cIt was nothing to do, in the first place; and I don't know why I did it, in the second.

But, the fierce figures were steadily wending East, West, North, and South, be that as it would; and whosoever hung, fire burned. The altitude of the gallows that would turn to water and quench it, no functionary, by any stretch of mathematics, was able to calculate successfully. XXIV. Drawn to the Loadstone Rock In such risings of fire and risings of sea--the firm earth shaken by the rushes of an angry ocean which had now no ebb, but was always on the flow, higher and higher, to the terror and wonder of the beholders on the shore--three years of tempest were consumed."], "Whose castle do the revolutionaries burn down?": [" At the same time, the thin straight lines of the setting of the eyes, and the thin straight lips, and the markings in the nose, curved with a sarcasm that looked handsomely diabolic. \u201cYes,\u201d repeated the Marquis. \u201cA Doctor with a daughter. Yes. So commences the new philosophy! You are fatigued. Good night!\u201d It would have been of as much avail to interrogate any stone face outside the chateau as to interrogate that face of his. The nephew looked at him, in vain, in passing on to the door. \u201cGood night!\u201d said the uncle. \u201cI look to the pleasure of seeing you again in the morning. Good repose! Light Monsieur my nephew to his chamber there!--And burn Monsieur my nephew in his bed, if you will,\u201d he added to himself, before he rang his little bell again, and summoned his valet to his own bedroom. The valet come and gone, Monsieur the Marquis walked to and fro in his loose chamber-robe, to prepare himself gently for sleep, that hot still night.", " Still Knitting Madame Defarge and monsieur her husband returned amicably to the bosom of Saint Antoine, while a speck in a blue cap toiled through the darkness, and through the dust, and down the weary miles of avenue by the wayside, slowly tending towards that point of the compass where the chateau of Monsieur the Marquis, now in his grave, listened to the whispering trees. Such ample leisure had the stone faces, now, for listening to the trees and to the fountain, that the few village scarecrows who, in their quest for herbs to eat and fragments of dead stick to burn, strayed within sight of the great stone courtyard and terrace staircase, had it borne in upon their starved fancy that the expression of the faces was altered. A rumour just lived in the village--had a faint and bare existence there, as its people had--that when the knife struck home, the faces changed, from faces of pride to faces of anger and pain; also, that when that dangling figure was hauled up forty feet above the fountain, they changed again, and bore a cruel look of being avenged, which they would henceforth bear for ever.", " The chateau was left to itself to flame and burn. In the roaring and raging of the conflagration, a red-hot wind, driving straight from the infernal regions, seemed to be blowing the edifice away. With the rising and falling of the blaze, the stone faces showed as if they were in torment. When great masses of stone and timber fell, the face with the two dints in the nose became obscured: anon struggled out of the smoke again, as if it were the face of the cruel Marquis, burning at the stake and contending with the fire. The chateau burned; the nearest trees, laid hold of by the fire, scorched and shrivelled; trees at a distance, fired by the four fierce figures, begirt the blazing edifice with a new forest of smoke. Molten lead and iron boiled in the marble basin of the fountain; the water ran dry; the extinguisher tops of the towers vanished like ice before the heat, and trickled down into four rugged wells of flame.", " yes! You're religious, too. You wouldn't put yourself in opposition to the interests of your husband and child, would you? Not you!\u201d and throwing off other sarcastic sparks from the whirling grindstone of his indignation, Mr. Cruncher betook himself to his boot-cleaning and his general preparation for business. In the meantime, his son, whose head was garnished with tenderer spikes, and whose young eyes stood close by one another, as his father's did, kept the required watch upon his mother. He greatly disturbed that poor woman at intervals, by darting out of his sleeping closet, where he made his toilet, with a suppressed cry of \u201cYou are going to flop, mother. --Halloa, father!\u201d and, after raising this fictitious alarm, darting in again with an undutiful grin. Mr. Cruncher's temper was not at all improved when he came to his breakfast. He resented Mrs. Cruncher's saying grace with particular animosity."], "Who barely escapes from the fire?": [" Examined with attention, its capacity of helping such a look was to be found in the line of the mouth, and the lines of the orbits of the eyes, being much too horizontal and thin; still, in the effect of the face made, it was a handsome face, and a remarkable one. Its owner went downstairs into the courtyard, got into his carriage, and drove away. Not many people had talked with him at the reception; he had stood in a little space apart, and Monseigneur might have been warmer in his manner. It appeared, under the circumstances, rather agreeable to him to see the common people dispersed before his horses, and often barely escaping from being run down. His man drove as if he were charging an enemy, and the furious recklessness of the man brought no check into the face, or to the lips, of the master. The complaint had sometimes made itself audible, even in that deaf city and dumb age, that, in the narrow streets without footways, the fierce patrician custom of hard driving endangered and maimed the mere vulgar in a barbarous manner.", " Where is my wife?\u201d \u201cEh, well! Here you see me!\u201d said madame, composed as ever, but not knitting to-day.

You shall see me at the head of women, by-and-bye.\u201d \u201cCome, then!\u201d cried Defarge, in a resounding voice. \u201cPatriots and friends, we are ready! The Bastille!\u201d With a roar that sounded as if all the breath in France had been shaped into the detested word, the living sea rose, wave on wave, depth on depth, and overflowed the city to that point. Alarm-bells ringing, drums beating, the sea raging and thundering on its new beach, the attack began. Deep ditches, double drawbridge, massive stone walls, eight great towers, cannon, muskets, fire and smoke. Through the fire and through the smoke--in the fire and in the smoke, for the sea cast him up against a cannon, and on the instant he became a cannonier--Defarge of the wine-shop worked like a manful soldier, Two fierce hours.", " The rider from the chateau, and the horse in a foam, clattered away through the village, and galloped up the stony steep, to the prison on the crag. At the gate, a group of officers were looking at the fire; removed from them, a group of soldiers. \u201cHelp, gentlemen--officers! The chateau is on fire; valuable objects may be saved from the flames by timely aid! Help, help!\u201d The officers looked towards the soldiers who looked at the fire; gave no orders; and answered, with shrugs and biting of lips, \u201cIt must burn.\u201d As the rider rattled down the hill again and through the street, the village was illuminating. The mender of roads, and the two hundred and fifty particular friends, inspired as one man and woman by the idea of lighting up, had darted into their houses, and were putting candles in every dull little pane of glass. The general scarcity of everything, occasioned candles to be borrowed in a rather peremptory manner of Monsieur Gabelle; and in a moment of reluctance and hesitation on that functionary's part, the mender of roads, once so submissive to authority, had remarked that carriages were good to make bonfires with, and that post-horses would roast.", " \u201cI am glad you have so much of the Englishman in you, though I wish you had never taken that cold in your voice,\u201d said Miss Pross, approvingly. \u201cBut the question, Doctor Manette.

It would be dangerous for Charles yet.\u201d \u201cHeigh-ho-hum!\u201d said Miss Pross, cheerfully repressing a sigh as she glanced at her darling's golden hair in the light of the fire, \u201cthen we must have patience and wait: that's all. We must hold up our heads and fight low, as my brother Solomon used to say. Now, Mr. Cruncher!--Don't you move, Ladybird!\u201d They went out, leaving Lucie, and her husband, her father, and the child, by a bright fire. Mr. Lorry was expected back presently from the Banking House."], "Why does Tellson\u2019s send Mr. Lorry to France?": [" Moreover, it was the spot to which such French intelligence as was most to be relied upon, came quickest. Again: Tellson's was a munificent house, and extended great liberality to old customers who had fallen from their high estate. Again: those nobles who had seen the coming storm in time, and anticipating plunder or confiscation, had made provident remittances to Tellson's, were always to be heard of there by their needy brethren. To which it must be added that every new-comer from France reported himself and his tidings at Tellson's, almost as a matter of course. For such variety of reasons, Tellson's was at that time, as to French intelligence, a kind of High Exchange; and this was so well known to the public, and the inquiries made there were in consequence so numerous, that Tellson's sometimes wrote the latest news out in a line or so and posted it in the Bank windows, for all who ran through Temple Bar to read.", " How much of the incompleteness of his situation was referable to her father, through the painful anxiety to avoid reviving old associations of France in his mind, he did not discuss with himself. But, that circumstance too, had had its influence in his course. He walked to and fro, with thoughts very busy, until it was time to return to Tellson's and take leave of Mr. Lorry. As soon as he arrived in Paris he would present himself to this old friend, but he must say nothing of his intention now. A carriage with post-horses was ready at the Bank door, and Jerry was booted and equipped. \u201cI have delivered that letter,\u201d said Charles Darnay to Mr. Lorry. \u201cI would not consent to your being charged with any written answer, but perhaps you will take a verbal one?\u201d \u201cThat I will, and readily,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, \u201cif it is not dangerous.\u201d \u201cNot at all. Though it is to a prisoner in the Abbaye.\u201d \u201cWhat is his name?\u201d said Mr. Lorry, with his open pocket-book in his hand.", " But, it was the old scared lost look that troubled Mr. Lorry; and through his absent manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own room when they got up-stairs, Mr. Lorry was reminded of Defarge the wine-shop keeper, and the starlight ride. \u201cI think,\u201d he whispered to Miss Pross, after anxious consideration, \u201cI think we had best not speak to him just now, or at all disturb him. I must look in at Tellson's; so I will go there at once and come back presently. Then, we will take him a ride into the country, and dine there, and all will be well.\u201d It was easier for Mr. Lorry to look in at Tellson's, than to look out of Tellson's. He was detained two hours. When he came back, he ascended the old staircase alone, having asked no question of the servant; going thus into the Doctor's rooms, he was stopped by a low sound of knocking. \u201cGood God!\u201d he said, with a start. \u201cWhat's that?\u201d Miss Pross, with a terrified face, was at his ear.", " This was no passive belief, but an active weapon which they flashed at more convenient places of business. Tellson's (they said) wanted no elbow-room, Tellson's wanted no light, Tellson's wanted no embellishment. Noakes and Co.'s might, or Snooks Brothers' might; but Tellson's, thank Heaven--! Any one of these partners would have disinherited his son on the question of rebuilding Tellson's. In this respect the House was much on a par with the Country; which did very often disinherit its sons for suggesting improvements in laws and customs that had long been highly objectionable, but were only the more respectable. Thus it had come to pass, that Tellson's was the triumphant perfection of inconvenience. After bursting open a door of idiotic obstinacy with a weak rattle in its throat, you fell into Tellson's down two steps, and came to your senses in a miserable little shop, with two little counters, where the oldest of men made your cheque shake as if the wind rustled it, while they examined the signature by the dingiest of windows, which were always under a shower-bath of mud from Fleet-street, and which were made the dingier by their own iron bars proper, and the heavy shadow of Temple Bar."], "What does Gabelle\u2019s letter to Darnay say?": [" \u201cGabelle.\u201d \u201cGabelle. And what is the message to the unfortunate Gabelle in prison?\u201d \u201cSimply, 'that he has received the letter, and will come.

That night--it was the fourteenth of August--he sat up late, and wrote two fervent letters; one was to Lucie, explaining the strong obligation he was under to go to Paris, and showing her, at length, the reasons that he had, for feeling confident that he could become involved in no personal danger there; the other was to the Doctor, confiding Lucie and their dear child to his care, and dwelling on the same topics with the strongest assurances.", " The result of that conference was, that Gabelle again withdrew himself to his housetop behind his stack of chimneys; this time resolved, if his door were broken in (he was a small Southern man of retaliative temperament), to pitch himself head foremost over the parapet, and crush a man or two below. Probably, Monsieur Gabelle passed a long night up there, with the distant chateau for fire and candle, and the beating at his door, combined with the joy-ringing, for music; not to mention his having an ill-omened lamp slung across the road before his posting-house gate, which the village showed a lively inclination to displace in his favour. A trying suspense, to be passing a whole summer night on the brink of the black ocean, ready to take that plunge into it upon which Monsieur Gabelle had resolved! But, the friendly dawn appearing at last, and the rush-candles of the village guttering out, the people happily dispersed, and Monsieur Gabelle came down bringing his life with him for that while.", " \u201cWhat was he like?\u201d \u201cMonseigneur, he was whiter than the miller. All covered with dust, white as a spectre, tall as a spectre!\u201d The picture produced an immense sensation in the little crowd; but all eyes, without comparing notes with other eyes, looked at Monsieur the Marquis. Perhaps, to observe whether he had any spectre on his conscience. \u201cTruly, you did well,\u201d said the Marquis, felicitously sensible that such vermin were not to ruffle him, \u201cto see a thief accompanying my carriage, and not open that great mouth of yours. Bah! Put him aside, Monsieur Gabelle!\u201d Monsieur Gabelle was the Postmaster, and some other taxing functionary united; he had come out with great obsequiousness to assist at this examination, and had held the examined by the drapery of his arm in an official manner. \u201cBah!

I had no apprehension whatever of my real danger; but I was conscious that there might be danger for others, if others were compromised by possessing the knowledge that I possessed. \u201cI was much engaged that day, and could not complete my letter that night. I rose long before my usual time next morning to finish it. It was the last day of the year. The letter was lying before me just completed, when I was told that a lady waited, who wished to see me. ***** \u201cI am growing more and more unequal to the task I have set myself. It is so cold, so dark, my senses are so benumbed, and the gloom upon me is so dreadful. \u201cThe lady was young, engaging, and handsome, but not marked for long life. She was in great agitation. She presented herself to me as the wife of the Marquis St. Evremonde.

It was nothing that the decree bore date since his return to France. There he was, and there was the decree; he had been taken in France, and his head was demanded. \u201cTake off his head!\u201d cried the audience. \u201cAn enemy to the Republic!\u201d The President rang his bell to silence those cries, and asked the prisoner whether it was not true that he had lived many years in England? Undoubtedly it was. Was he not an emigrant then? What did he call himself? Not an emigrant, he hoped, within the sense and spirit of the law. Why not? the President desired to know. Because he had voluntarily relinquished a title that was distasteful to him, and a station that was distasteful to him, and had left his country--he submitted before the word emigrant in the present acceptation by the Tribunal was in use--to live by his own industry in England, rather than on the industry of the overladen people of France.", " Going a fishing.\u201d \u201cYour fishing-rod gets rayther rusty; don't it, father?\u201d \u201cNever you mind.\u201d \u201cShall you bring any fish home, father?\u201d \u201cIf I don't, you'll have short commons, to-morrow,\u201d returned that gentleman, shaking his head; \u201cthat's questions enough for you; I ain't a going out, till you've been long abed.\u201d He devoted himself during the remainder of the evening to keeping a most vigilant watch on Mrs. Cruncher, and sullenly holding her in conversation that she might be prevented from meditating any petitions to his disadvantage. With this view, he urged his son to hold her in conversation also, and led the unfortunate woman a hard life by dwelling on any causes of complaint he could bring against her, rather than he would leave her for a moment to her own reflections. The devoutest person could have rendered no greater homage to the efficacy of an honest prayer than he did in this distrust of his wife.", " How much of the incompleteness of his situation was referable to her father, through the painful anxiety to avoid reviving old associations of France in his mind, he did not discuss with himself. But, that circumstance too, had had its influence in his course. He walked to and fro, with thoughts very busy, until it was time to return to Tellson's and take leave of Mr. Lorry. As soon as he arrived in Paris he would present himself to this old friend, but he must say nothing of his intention now. A carriage with post-horses was ready at the Bank door, and Jerry was booted and equipped. \u201cI have delivered that letter,\u201d said Charles Darnay to Mr. Lorry. \u201cI would not consent to your being charged with any written answer, but perhaps you will take a verbal one?\u201d \u201cThat I will, and readily,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, \u201cif it is not dangerous.\u201d \u201cNot at all. Though it is to a prisoner in the Abbaye.\u201d \u201cWhat is his name?\u201d said Mr. Lorry, with his open pocket-book in his hand.", " \u201cThat's a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by! How does it feel? Is it worth being tried for one's life, to be the object of such sympathy and compassion, Mr. Darnay?\u201d Again Darnay answered not a word. \u201cShe was mightily pleased to have your message, when I gave it her. Not that she showed she was pleased, but I suppose she was.\u201d The allusion served as a timely reminder to Darnay that this disagreeable companion had, of his own free will, assisted him in the strait of the day. He turned the dialogue to that point, and thanked him for it. \u201cI neither want any thanks, nor merit any,\u201d was the careless rejoinder. \u201cIt was nothing to do, in the first place; and I don't know why I did it, in the second. Mr. Darnay, let me ask you a question.\u201d \u201cWillingly, and a small return for your good offices.\u201d \u201cDo you think I particularly like you?\u201d \u201cReally, Mr. Carton,\u201d returned the other, oddly disconcerted, \u201cI have not asked myself the question.\u201d \u201cBut ask yourself the question now.\u201d \u201cYou have acted as if you do; but I don't think you do.\u201d \u201c_I_ don't think I do,\u201d said Carton."], "What form of execution has just been invented?": [" We have seen enough of it, to know that it teems with interest; little more.\u201d \u201c_I_ have been there, as you remember,\u201d said Darnay, with a smile, though reddening a little angrily, \u201cin another character, and not in a character that gives facilities for seeing much of it. They told me a curious thing when I was there.\u201d \u201cWhat was that?\u201d Lucie asked. \u201cIn making some alterations, the workmen came upon an old dungeon, which had been, for many years, built up and forgotten. Every stone of its inner wall was covered by inscriptions which had been carved by prisoners--dates, names, complaints, and prayers. Upon a corner stone in an angle of the wall, one prisoner, who seemed to have gone to execution, had cut as his last work, three letters. They were done with some very poor instrument, and hurriedly, with an unsteady hand. At first, they were read as D. I. C.; but, on being more carefully examined, the last letter was found to be G. There was no record or legend of any prisoner with those initials, and many fruitless guesses were made what the name could have been.", " \u201cThat. At the back there.\u201d \u201cWith his hand in the girl's?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d The man cries, \u201cDown, Evremonde! To the Guillotine all aristocrats! Down, Evremonde!\u201d \u201cHush, hush!\u201d the Spy entreats him, timidly. \u201cAnd why not, citizen?\u201d \u201cHe is going to pay the forfeit: it will be paid in five minutes more. Let him be at peace.\u201d But the man continuing to exclaim, \u201cDown, Evremonde!\u201d the face of Evremonde is for a moment turned towards him. Evremonde then sees the Spy, and looks attentively at him, and goes his way. The clocks are on the stroke of three, and the furrow ploughed among the populace is turning round, to come on into the place of execution, and end. The ridges thrown to this side and to that, now crumble in and close behind the last plough as it passes on, for all are following to the Guillotine. In front of it, seated in chairs, as in a garden of public diversion, are a number of women, busily knitting.", " \u201cPardon me; certainly it was I who said so, but you naturally think so. Of course.\u201d \u201c_I_ think?\u201d returned madame, in a high voice. \u201cI and my husband have enough to do to keep this wine-shop open, without thinking. All we think, here, is how to live. That is the subject _we_ think of, and it gives us, from morning to night, enough to think about, without embarrassing our heads concerning others. _I_ think for others? No, no.\u201d The spy, who was there to pick up any crumbs he could find or make, did not allow his baffled state to express itself in his sinister face; but, stood with an air of gossiping gallantry, leaning his elbow on Madame Defarge's little counter, and occasionally sipping his cognac. \u201cA bad business this, madame, of Gaspard's execution. Ah! the poor Gaspard!\u201d With a sigh of great compassion. \u201cMy faith!\u201d returned madame, coolly and lightly, \u201cif people use knives for such purposes, they have to pay for it.", " Think-not of me, but of the lives that may depend on both of us!\u201d This exordium, and Miss Pross's two hands in quite agonised entreaty clasping his, decided Mr. Cruncher. With an encouraging nod or two, he immediately went out to alter the arrangements, and left her by herself to follow as she had proposed. The having originated a precaution which was already in course of execution, was a great relief to Miss Pross. The necessity of composing her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the streets, was another relief. She looked at her watch, and it was twenty minutes past two. She had no time to lose, but must get ready at once. Afraid, in her extreme perturbation, of the loneliness of the deserted rooms, and of half-imagined faces peeping from behind every open door in them, Miss Pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes, which were swollen and red. Haunted by her feverish apprehensions, she could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the dripping water, but constantly paused and looked round to see that there was no one watching her."], "How does Doctor Manette help Darnay?": [" To him, now entered Charles Darnay, at sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand. \u201cCharles Darnay! I rejoice to see you. We have been counting on your return these three or four days past. Mr. Stryver and Sydney Carton were both here yesterday, and both made you out to be more than due.\u201d \u201cI am obliged to them for their interest in the matter,\u201d he answered, a little coldly as to them, though very warmly as to the Doctor. \u201cMiss Manette--\u201d \u201cIs well,\u201d said the Doctor, as he stopped short, \u201cand your return will delight us all. She has gone out on some household matters, but will soon be home.\u201d \u201cDoctor Manette, I knew she was from home. I took the opportunity of her being from home, to beg to speak to you.\u201d There was a blank silence. \u201cYes?\u201d said the Doctor, with evident constraint. \u201cBring your chair here, and speak on.\u201d He complied as to the chair, but appeared to find the speaking on less easy.", " I examine it, very closely. In a hole in the chimney, where a stone has been worked out and replaced, I find a written paper. This is that written paper. I have made it my business to examine some specimens of the writing of Doctor Manette. This is the writing of Doctor Manette. I confide this paper, in the writing of Doctor Manette, to the hands of the President.\u201d \u201cLet it be read.\u201d In a dead silence and stillness--the prisoner under trial looking lovingly at his wife, his wife only looking from him to look with solicitude at her father, Doctor Manette keeping his eyes fixed on the reader, Madame Defarge never taking hers from the prisoner, Defarge never taking his from his feasting wife, and all the other eyes there intent upon the Doctor, who saw none of them--the paper was read, as follows. X. The Substance of the Shadow \u201cI, Alexandre Manette, unfortunate physician, native of Beauvais, and afterwards resident in Paris, write this melancholy paper in my doleful cell in the Bastille, during the last month of the year, 1767.", " What proof had he of this? He handed in the names of two witnesses; Theophile Gabelle, and Alexandre Manette. But he had married in England? the President reminded him. True, but not an English woman. A citizeness of France? Yes. By birth. Her name and family? \u201cLucie Manette, only daughter of Doctor Manette, the good physician who sits there.\u201d This answer had a happy effect upon the audience. Cries in exaltation of the well-known good physician rent the hall. So capriciously were the people moved, that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before, as if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill him. On these few steps of his dangerous way, Charles Darnay had set his foot according to Doctor Manette's reiterated instructions. The same cautious counsel directed every step that lay before him, and had prepared every inch of his road.", " \u201cI have had the happiness, Doctor Manette, of being so intimate here,\u201d so he at length began, \u201cfor some year and a half, that I hope the topic on which I am about to touch may not--\u201d He was stayed by the Doctor's putting out his hand to stop him. When he had kept it so a little while, he said, drawing it back: \u201cIs Lucie the topic?\u201d \u201cShe is.\u201d \u201cIt is hard for me to speak of her at any time. It is very hard for me to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours, Charles Darnay.\u201d \u201cIt is a tone of fervent admiration, true homage, and deep love, Doctor Manette!\u201d he said deferentially. There was another blank silence before her father rejoined: \u201cI believe it. I do you justice; I believe it.\u201d His constraint was so manifest, and it was so manifest, too, that it originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject, that Charles Darnay hesitated. \u201cShall I go on, sir?\u201d Another blank. \u201cYes, go on.\u201d \u201cYou anticipate what I would say, though you cannot know how earnestly I say it, how earnestly I feel it, without knowing my secret heart, and the hopes and fears and anxieties with which it has long been laden."], "Why does Lucy stand in the same spot outside the prison every day for two hours?": [" But you will not be able to see him, my poor child, and even if you could, it would be unsafe for you to make a sign of recognition.\u201d \u201cO show me the place, my father, and I will go there every day.\u201d From that time, in all weathers, she waited there two hours. As the clock struck two, she was there, and at four she turned resignedly away. When it was not too wet or inclement for her child to be with her, they went together; at other times she was alone; but, she never missed a single day. It was the dark and dirty corner of a small winding street. The hovel of a cutter of wood into lengths for burning, was the only house at that end; all else was wall. On the third day of her being there, he noticed her. \u201cGood day, citizeness.\u201d \u201cGood day, citizen.\u201d This mode of address was now prescribed by decree. It had been established voluntarily some time ago, among the more thorough patriots; but, was now law for everybody.", " See here again! Loo, loo, loo; Loo, loo, loo! And off _her_ head comes! Now, a child. Tickle, tickle; Pickle, pickle! And off _its_ head comes. All the family!\u201d Lucie shuddered as he threw two more billets into his basket, but it was impossible to be there while the wood-sawyer was at work, and not be in his sight. Thenceforth, to secure his good will, she always spoke to him first, and often gave him drink-money, which he readily received. He was an inquisitive fellow, and sometimes when she had quite forgotten him in gazing at the prison roof and grates, and in lifting her heart up to her husband, she would come to herself to find him looking at her, with his knee on his bench and his saw stopped in its work. \u201cBut it's not my business!\u201d he would generally say at those times, and would briskly fall to his sawing again. In all weathers, in the snow and frost of winter, in the bitter winds of spring, in the hot sunshine of summer, in the rains of autumn, and again in the snow and frost of winter, Lucie passed two hours of every day at this place; and every day on leaving it, she kissed the prison wall.", " If you please, committing you in no way, representing you in no way, I will undertake to correct my advice by the exercise of a little new observation and judgment expressly brought to bear upon it. If you should then be dissatisfied with it, you can but test its soundness for yourself; if, on the other hand, you should be satisfied with it, and it should be what it now is, it may spare all sides what is best spared. What do you say?\u201d \u201cHow long would you keep me in town?\u201d \u201cOh! It is only a question of a few hours. I could go to Soho in the evening, and come to your chambers afterwards.\u201d \u201cThen I say yes,\u201d said Stryver: \u201cI won't go up there now, I am not so hot upon it as that comes to; I say yes, and I shall expect you to look in to-night. Good morning.\u201d Then Mr. Stryver turned and burst out of the Bank, causing such a concussion of air on his passage through, that to stand up against it bowing behind the two counters, required the utmost remaining strength of the two ancient clerks.", " I say, Jerry! You'd be in a Blazing bad way, if recalling to life was to come into fashion, Jerry!\u201d III. The Night Shadows A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it! Something of the awfulness, even of Death itself, is referable to this. No more can I turn the leaves of this dear book that I loved, and vainly hope in time to read it all. No more can I look into the depths of this unfathomable water, wherein, as momentary lights glanced into it, I have had glimpses of buried treasure and other things submerged."], "Who often talks to Lucie while she waits outside the prison?": [" Enough of me.\u201d \u201cAnd of me, I am sure,\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cAre you going out?\u201d \u201cI'll walk with you to her gate. You know my vagabond and restless habits. If I should prowl about the streets a long time, don't be uneasy; I shall reappear in the morning. You go to the Court to-morrow?\u201d \u201cYes, unhappily.\u201d \u201cI shall be there, but only as one of the crowd. My Spy will find a place for me. Take my arm, sir.\u201d Mr. Lorry did so, and they went down-stairs and out in the streets. A few minutes brought them to Mr. Lorry's destination. Carton left him there; but lingered at a little distance, and turned back to the gate again when it was shut, and touched it. He had heard of her going to the prison every day. \u201cShe came out here,\u201d he said, looking about him, \u201cturned this way, must have trod on these stones often. Let me follow in her steps.\u201d It was ten o'clock at night when he stood before the prison of La Force, where she had stood hundreds of times.", " \u201cGabelle.\u201d \u201cGabelle. And what is the message to the unfortunate Gabelle in prison?\u201d \u201cSimply, 'that he has received the letter, and will come.

That night--it was the fourteenth of August--he sat up late, and wrote two fervent letters; one was to Lucie, explaining the strong obligation he was under to go to Paris, and showing her, at length, the reasons that he had, for feeling confident that he could become involved in no personal danger there; the other was to the Doctor, confiding Lucie and their dear child to his care, and dwelling on the same topics with the strongest assurances.", " That, he seemed on the point of being at once released, when the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check (not intelligible to the Doctor), which led to a few words of secret conference. That, the man sitting as President had then informed Doctor Manette that the prisoner must remain in custody, but should, for his sake, be held inviolate in safe custody. That, immediately, on a signal, the prisoner was removed to the interior of the prison again; but, that he, the Doctor, had then so strongly pleaded for permission to remain and assure himself that his son-in-law was, through no malice or mischance, delivered to the concourse whose murderous yells outside the gate had often drowned the proceedings, that he had obtained the permission, and had remained in that Hall of Blood until the danger was over. The sights he had seen there, with brief snatches of food and sleep by intervals, shall remain untold.", " But, the time was not come yet; and every wind that blew over France shook the rags of the scarecrows in vain, for the birds, fine of song and feather, took no warning. The wine-shop was a corner shop, better than most others in its appearance and degree, and the master of the wine-shop had stood outside it, in a yellow waistcoat and green breeches, looking on at the struggle for the lost wine. \u201cIt's not my affair,\u201d said he, with a final shrug of the shoulders. \u201cThe people from the market did it. Let them bring another.\u201d There, his eyes happening to catch the tall joker writing up his joke, he called to him across the way: \u201cSay, then, my Gaspard, what do you do there?\u201d The fellow pointed to his joke with immense significance, as is often the way with his tribe. It missed its mark, and completely failed, as is often the way with his tribe too. \u201cWhat now? Are you a subject for the mad hospital?\u201d said the wine-shop keeper, crossing the road, and obliterating the jest with a handful of mud, picked up for the purpose, and smeared over it."], "What happens at Darnay\u2019s first rowdy trial in France?": [" Nothing unbecoming tinged the pride; it was a natural and worthy one; but he observed it as a curiosity. The Doctor knew, that up to that time, his imprisonment had been associated in the minds of his daughter and his friend, with his personal affliction, deprivation, and weakness. Now that this was changed, and he knew himself to be invested through that old trial with forces to which they both looked for Charles's ultimate safety and deliverance, he became so far exalted by the change, that he took the lead and direction, and required them as the weak, to trust to him as the strong. The preceding relative positions of himself and Lucie were reversed, yet only as the liveliest gratitude and affection could reverse them, for he could have had no pride but in rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him. \u201cAll curious to see,\u201d thought Mr. Lorry, in his amiably shrewd way, \u201cbut all natural and right; so, take the lead, my dear friend, and keep it; it couldn't be in better hands.\u201d But, though the Doctor tried hard, and never ceased trying, to get Charles Darnay set at liberty, or at least to get him brought to trial, the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him.", " \u201cThat's a fair young lady to be pitied by and wept for by!

On a night in mid-July, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-nine, Mr. Lorry came in late, from Tellson's, and sat himself down by Lucie and her husband in the dark window. It was a hot, wild night, and they were all three reminded of the old Sunday night when they had looked at the lightning from the same place. \u201cI began to think,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, pushing his brown wig back, \u201cthat I should have to pass the night at Tellson's. We have been so full of business all day, that we have not known what to do first, or which way to turn. There is such an uneasiness in Paris, that we have actually a run of confidence upon us! Our customers over there, seem not to be able to confide their property to us fast enough. There is positively a mania among some of them for sending it to England.\u201d \u201cThat has a bad look,\u201d said Darnay-- \u201cA bad look, you say, my dear Darnay?", " Charles Evremonde, called Darnay, was accused by the public prosecutor as an emigrant, whose life was forfeit to the Republic, under the decree which banished all emigrants on pain of Death.

Mr. Darnay, let me ask you a question.\u201d \u201cWillingly, and a small return for your good offices.\u201d \u201cDo you think I particularly like you?\u201d \u201cReally, Mr. Carton,\u201d returned the other, oddly disconcerted, \u201cI have not asked myself the question.\u201d \u201cBut ask yourself the question now.\u201d \u201cYou have acted as if you do; but I don't think you do.\u201d \u201c_I_ don't think I do,\u201d said Carton.", " \u201cNot much. If it should go ill with the prisoner, I have ensured access to him, once.\u201d Mr. Lorry's countenance fell. \u201cIt is all I could do,\u201d said Carton. \u201cTo propose too much, would be to put this man's head under the axe, and, as he himself said, nothing worse could happen to him if he were denounced. It was obviously the weakness of the position. There is no help for it.\u201d \u201cBut access to him,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, \u201cif it should go ill before the Tribunal, will not save him.\u201d \u201cI never said it would.\u201d Mr. Lorry's eyes gradually sought the fire; his sympathy with his darling, and the heavy disappointment of his second arrest, gradually weakened them; he was an old man now, overborne with anxiety of late, and his tears fell. \u201cYou are a good man and a true friend,\u201d said Carton, in an altered voice. \u201cForgive me if I notice that you are affected. I could not see my father weep, and sit by, careless."], "How does Carton convince Barsad to help him save Darnay?": [" They left her at the corner of the street, and Carton led the way to Mr. Lorry's, which was within a few minutes' walk. John Barsad, or Solomon Pross, walked at his side. Mr. Lorry had just finished his dinner, and was sitting before a cheery little log or two of fire--perhaps looking into their blaze for the picture of that younger elderly gentleman from Tellson's, who had looked into the red coals at the Royal George at Dover, now a good many years ago. He turned his head as they entered, and showed the surprise with which he saw a stranger. \u201cMiss Pross's brother, sir,\u201d said Sydney. \u201cMr. Barsad.\u201d \u201cBarsad?\u201d repeated the old gentleman, \u201cBarsad? I have an association with the name--and with the face.\u201d \u201cI told you you had a remarkable face, Mr. Barsad,\u201d observed Carton, coolly. \u201cPray sit down.\u201d As he took a chair himself, he supplied the link that Mr. Lorry wanted, by saying to him with a frown, \u201cWitness at that trial.\u201d Mr. Lorry immediately remembered, and regarded his new visitor with an undisguised look of abhorrence.", " \u201cMr. Barsad has been recognised by Miss Pross as the affectionate brother you have heard of,\u201d said Sydney, \u201cand has acknowledged the relationship. I pass to worse news. Darnay has been arrested again.\u201d Struck with consternation, the old gentleman exclaimed, \u201cWhat do you tell me! I left him safe and free within these two hours, and am about to return to him!\u201d \u201cArrested for all that. When was it done, Mr. Barsad?\u201d \u201cJust now, if at all.\u201d \u201cMr. Barsad is the best authority possible, sir,\u201d said Sydney, \u201cand I have it from Mr. Barsad's communication to a friend and brother Sheep over a bottle of wine, that the arrest has taken place. He left the messengers at the gate, and saw them admitted by the porter. There is no earthly doubt that he is retaken.\u201d Mr. Lorry's business eye read in the speaker's face that it was loss of time to dwell upon the point. Confused, but sensible that something might depend on his presence of mind, he commanded himself, and was silently attentive.", " That's an excellent card. Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion, that Mr. Barsad, still in the pay of the aristocratic English government, is the spy of Pitt, the treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom, the English traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so difficult to find. That's a card not to be beaten. Have you followed my hand, Mr. Barsad?\u201d \u201cNot to understand your play,\u201d returned the spy, somewhat uneasily. \u201cI play my Ace, Denunciation of Mr. Barsad to the nearest Section Committee. Look over your hand, Mr. Barsad, and see what you have. Don't hurry.\u201d He drew the bottle near, poured out another glassful of brandy, and drank it off. He saw that the spy was fearful of his drinking himself into a fit state for the immediate denunciation of him. Seeing it, he poured out and drank another glassful. \u201cLook over your hand carefully, Mr. Barsad. Take time.\u201d It was a poorer hand than he suspected.", " There, he laid her down on a couch, where her child and Miss Pross wept over her. \u201cDon't recall her to herself,\u201d he said, softly, to the latter, \u201cshe is better so. Don't revive her to consciousness, while she only faints.\u201d \u201cOh, Carton, Carton, dear Carton!\u201d cried little Lucie, springing up and throwing her arms passionately round him, in a burst of grief. \u201cNow that you have come, I think you will do something to help mamma, something to save papa! O, look at her, dear Carton! Can you, of all the people who love her, bear to see her so?\u201d He bent over the child, and laid her blooming cheek against his face. He put her gently from him, and looked at her unconscious mother. \u201cBefore I go,\u201d he said, and paused--\u201cI may kiss her?\u201d It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face with his lips, he murmured some words. The child, who was nearest to him, told them afterwards, and told her grandchildren when she was a handsome old lady, that she heard him say, \u201cA life you love.\u201d When he had gone out into the next room, he turned suddenly on Mr. Lorry and her father, who were following, and said to the latter: \u201cYou had great influence but yesterday, Doctor Manette; let it at least be tried."], "What does the letter that Defarge reads reveal about Darnay\u2019s father and uncle?": [" \u201cOn the contrary; I come direct.\u201d \u201cPardon me! I mean, not a long time on the journey; a long time intending the journey.\u201d \u201cI have been detained by\u201d--the nephew stopped a moment in his answer--\u201cvarious business.\u201d \u201cWithout doubt,\u201d said the polished uncle. So long as a servant was present, no other words passed between them. When coffee had been served and they were alone together, the nephew, looking at the uncle and meeting the eyes of the face that was like a fine mask, opened a conversation. \u201cI have come back, sir, as you anticipate, pursuing the object that took me away. It carried me into great and unexpected peril; but it is a sacred object, and if it had carried me to death I hope it would have sustained me.\u201d \u201cNot to death,\u201d said the uncle; \u201cit is not necessary to say, to death.\u201d \u201cI doubt, sir,\u201d returned the nephew, \u201cwhether, if it had carried me to the utmost brink of death, you would have cared to stop me there.\u201d The deepened marks in the nose, and the lengthening of the fine straight lines in the cruel face, looked ominous as to that; the uncle made a graceful gesture of protest, which was so clearly a slight form of good breeding that it was not reassuring.", " Before it had set in dark on the night of his condemnation, he had travelled thus far on his last way. Being allowed to purchase the means of writing, and a light, he sat down to write until such time as the prison lamps should be extinguished. He wrote a long letter to Lucie, showing her that he had known nothing of her father's imprisonment, until he had heard of it from herself, and that he had been as ignorant as she of his father's and uncle's responsibility for that misery, until the paper had been read. He had already explained to her that his concealment from herself of the name he had relinquished, was the one condition--fully intelligible now--that her father had attached to their betrothal, and was the one promise he had still exacted on the morning of their marriage. He entreated her, for her father's sake, never to seek to know whether her father had become oblivious of the existence of the paper, or had had it recalled to him (for the moment, or for good), by the story of the Tower, on that old Sunday under the dear old plane-tree in the garden.", " \u201cIndeed, sir,\u201d pursued the nephew, \u201cfor anything I know, you may have expressly worked to give a more suspicious appearance to the suspicious circumstances that surrounded me.\u201d \u201cNo, no, no,\u201d said the uncle, pleasantly. \u201cBut, however that may be,\u201d resumed the nephew, glancing at him with deep distrust, \u201cI know that your diplomacy would stop me by any means, and would know no scruple as to means.\u201d \u201cMy friend, I told you so,\u201d said the uncle, with a fine pulsation in the two marks. \u201cDo me the favour to recall that I told you so, long ago.\u201d \u201cI recall it.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d said the Marquis--very sweetly indeed. His tone lingered in the air, almost like the tone of a musical instrument. \u201cIn effect, sir,\u201d pursued the nephew, \u201cI believe it to be at once your bad fortune, and my good fortune, that has kept me out of a prison in France here.\u201d \u201cI do not quite understand,\u201d returned the uncle, sipping his coffee.", " \u201cDare I ask you to explain?\u201d \u201cI believe that if you were not in disgrace with the Court, and had not been overshadowed by that cloud for years past, a letter de cachet would have sent me to some fortress indefinitely.\u201d \u201cIt is possible,\u201d said the uncle, with great calmness. \u201cFor the honour of the family, I could even resolve to incommode you to that extent. Pray excuse me!\u201d \u201cI perceive that, happily for me, the Reception of the day before yesterday was, as usual, a cold one,\u201d observed the nephew. \u201cI would not say happily, my friend,\u201d returned the uncle, with refined politeness; \u201cI would not be sure of that. A good opportunity for consideration, surrounded by the advantages of solitude, might influence your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for yourself. But it is useless to discuss the question. I am, as you say, at a disadvantage. These little instruments of correction, these gentle aids to the power and honour of families, these slight favours that might so incommode you, are only to be obtained now by interest and importunity."], "Why is Charles Darnay going to be executed?": [" All here, yourself excepted, saw the King take it, in his carriage in the street, sitting beside the Queen. It is Defarge whom you see here, who, at the hazard of his life, darted out before the horses, with the petition in his hand.\u201d \u201cAnd once again listen, Jacques!\u201d said the kneeling Number Three: his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves, with a strikingly greedy air, as if he hungered for something--that was neither food nor drink; \u201cthe guard, horse and foot, surrounded the petitioner, and struck him blows. You hear?\u201d \u201cI hear, messieurs.\u201d \u201cGo on then,\u201d said Defarge. \u201cAgain; on the other hand, they whisper at the fountain,\u201d resumed the countryman, \u201cthat he is brought down into our country to be executed on the spot, and that he will very certainly be executed. They even whisper that because he has slain Monseigneur, and because Monseigneur was the father of his tenants--serfs--what you will--he will be executed as a parricide.", " On a steaming, misty afternoon, Mr. Lorry sat at his desk, and Charles Darnay stood leaning on it, talking with him in a low voice. The penitential den once set apart for interviews with the House, was now the news-Exchange, and was filled to overflowing. It was within half an hour or so of the time of closing. \u201cBut, although you are the youngest man that ever lived,\u201d said Charles Darnay, rather hesitating, \u201cI must still suggest to you--\u201d \u201cI understand. That I am too old?\u201d said Mr. Lorry. \u201cUnsettled weather, a long journey, uncertain means of travelling, a disorganised country, a city that may not be even safe for you.\u201d \u201cMy dear Charles,\u201d said Mr. Lorry, with cheerful confidence, \u201cyou touch some of the reasons for my going: not for my staying away. It is safe enough for me; nobody will care to interfere with an old fellow of hard upon fourscore when there are so many people there much better worth interfering with.", " Only last night, after you had left us, when I was talking to Lucie--\u201d \u201cWhen you were talking to Lucie,\u201d Mr. Lorry repeated. \u201cYes. I wonder you are not ashamed to mention the name of Lucie! Wishing you were going to France at this time of day!\u201d \u201cHowever, I am not going,\u201d said Charles Darnay, with a smile. \u201cIt is more to the purpose that you say you are.\u201d \u201cAnd I am, in plain reality. The truth is, my dear Charles,\u201d Mr. Lorry glanced at the distant House, and lowered his voice, \u201cyou can have no conception of the difficulty with which our business is transacted, and of the peril in which our books and papers over yonder are involved. The Lord above knows what the compromising consequences would be to numbers of people, if some of our documents were seized or destroyed; and they might be, at any time, you know, for who can say that Paris is not set afire to-day, or sacked to-morrow! Now, a judicious selection from these with the least possible delay, and the burying of them, or otherwise getting of them out of harm's way, is within the power (without loss of precious time) of scarcely any one but myself, if any one.", " \u201cWe really have not heads enough; it would be a pity, I think.\u201d \u201cHe was signalling with her when I saw her,\u201d argued Madame Defarge; \u201cI cannot speak of one without the other; and I must not be silent, and trust the case wholly to him, this little citizen here. For, I am not a bad witness.\u201d The Vengeance and Jacques Three vied with each other in their fervent protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of witnesses. The little citizen, not to be outdone, declared her to be a celestial witness. \u201cHe must take his chance,\u201d said Madame Defarge. \u201cNo, I cannot spare him! You are engaged at three o'clock; you are going to see the batch of to-day executed.--You?\u201d The question was addressed to the wood-sawyer, who hurriedly replied in the affirmative: seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent of Republicans, and that he would be in effect the most desolate of Republicans, if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national barber."], "What is revealed about Madame Defarge?": [" The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to fall, threatening and dark, on both the mother and the child. \u201cIt is enough, my husband,\u201d said Madame Defarge. \u201cI have seen them. We may go.\u201d But, the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it--not visible and presented, but indistinct and withheld--to alarm Lucie into saying, as she laid her appealing hand on Madame Defarge's dress: \u201cYou will be good to my poor husband. You will do him no harm. You will help me to see him if you can?\u201d \u201cYour husband is not my business here,\u201d returned Madame Defarge, looking down at her with perfect composure. \u201cIt is the daughter of your father who is my business here.\u201d \u201cFor my sake, then, be merciful to my husband. For my child's sake! She will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful. We are more afraid of you than of these others.\u201d Madame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her husband.", " Good day, one and all!\u201d \u201cHave the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a mouthful of cool fresh water, madame.\u201d Madame complied with a polite air. \u201cMarvellous cognac this, madame!\u201d It was the first time it had ever been so complimented, and Madame Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better. She said, however, that the cognac was flattered, and took up her knitting. The visitor watched her fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity of observing the place in general. \u201cYou knit with great skill, madame.\u201d \u201cI am accustomed to it.\u201d \u201cA pretty pattern too!\u201d \u201c_You_ think so?\u201d said madame, looking at him with a smile. \u201cDecidedly. May one ask what it is for?\u201d \u201cPastime,\u201d said madame, still looking at him with a smile while her fingers moved nimbly. \u201cNot for use?\u201d \u201cThat depends. I may find a use for it one day. If I do--Well,\u201d said madame, drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of coquetry, \u201cI'll use it!\u201d It was remarkable; but, the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge.", " Wife of Evremonde! Child of Evremonde! Any person but this miserable fool, answer the Citizeness Defarge!\u201d Perhaps the following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in the expression of Miss Pross's face, perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from either suggestion, whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone. Three of the doors she opened swiftly, and looked in. \u201cThose rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing, there are odds and ends upon the ground. There is no one in that room behind you! Let me look.\u201d \u201cNever!\u201d said Miss Pross, who understood the request as perfectly as Madame Defarge understood the answer. \u201cIf they are not in that room, they are gone, and can be pursued and brought back,\u201d said Madame Defarge to herself. \u201cAs long as you don't know whether they are in that room or not, you are uncertain what to do,\u201d said Miss Pross to herself; \u201cand you shall not know that, if I can prevent your knowing it; and know that, or not know that, you shall not leave here while I can hold you.\u201d \u201cI have been in the streets from the first, nothing has stopped me, I will tear you to pieces, but I will have you from that door,\u201d said Madame Defarge.", " In one of those pauses she recoiled and cried out, for she saw a figure standing in the room. The basin fell to the ground broken, and the water flowed to the feet of Madame Defarge. By strange stern ways, and through much staining blood, those feet had come to meet that water. Madame Defarge looked coldly at her, and said, \u201cThe wife of Evremonde; where is she?\u201d It flashed upon Miss Pross's mind that the doors were all standing open, and would suggest the flight. Her first act was to shut them. There were four in the room, and she shut them all. She then placed herself before the door of the chamber which Lucie had occupied. Madame Defarge's dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement, and rested on her when it was finished. Miss Pross had nothing beautiful about her; years had not tamed the wildness, or softened the grimness, of her appearance; but, she too was a determined woman in her different way, and she measured Madame Defarge with her eyes, every inch."], "What does Carton do at the Manettes\u2019?": [" Take up the pen and finish. Hurry, hurry!\u201d As if his memory were impaired, or his faculties disordered, the prisoner made an effort to rally his attention. As he looked at Carton with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing, Carton--his hand again in his breast--looked steadily at him. \u201cHurry, hurry!\u201d The prisoner bent over the paper, once more. \u201c'If it had been otherwise;'\u201d Carton's hand was again watchfully and softly stealing down; \u201c'I never should have used the longer opportunity. If it had been otherwise;'\u201d the hand was at the prisoner's face; \u201c'I should but have had so much the more to answer for. If it had been otherwise--'\u201d Carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into unintelligible signs. Carton's hand moved back to his breast no more. The prisoner sprang up with a reproachful look, but Carton's hand was close and firm at his nostrils, and Carton's left arm caught him round the waist.", " The prisoner was like a young child in his hands. \u201cCarton!

You are free from that misfortune, however.\u201d Though he said the last words, with a slip into his usual manner, there was a true feeling and respect both in his tone and in his touch, that Mr. Lorry, who had never seen the better side of him, was wholly unprepared for. He gave him his hand, and Carton gently pressed it. \u201cTo return to poor Darnay,\u201d said Carton. \u201cDon't tell Her of this interview, or this arrangement. It would not enable Her to go to see him. She might think it was contrived, in case of the worse, to convey to him the means of anticipating the sentence.\u201d Mr. Lorry had not thought of that, and he looked quickly at Carton to see if it were in his mind. It seemed to be; he returned the look, and evidently understood it. \u201cShe might think a thousand things,\u201d Carton said, \u201cand any of them would only add to her trouble.", " Towards Soho, therefore, Mr. Stryver shouldered his way from the Temple, while the bloom of the Long Vacation's infancy was still upon it. Anybody who had seen him projecting himself into Soho while he was yet on Saint Dunstan's side of Temple Bar, bursting in his full-blown way along the pavement, to the jostlement of all weaker people, might have seen how safe and strong he was. His way taking him past Tellson's, and he both banking at Tellson's and knowing Mr. Lorry as the intimate friend of the Manettes, it entered Mr. Stryver's mind to enter the bank, and reveal to Mr. Lorry the brightness of the Soho horizon. So, he pushed open the door with the weak rattle in its throat, stumbled down the two steps, got past the two ancient cashiers, and shouldered himself into the musty back closet where Mr. Lorry sat at great books ruled for figures, with perpendicular iron bars to his window as if that were ruled for figures too, and everything under the clouds were a sum."], "How does Carton get Darnay to switch places with him?": [" \u201cI begin to have a very good opinion of your understanding.\u201d \u201cNevertheless,\u201d pursued Darnay, rising to ring the bell, \u201cthere is nothing in that, I hope, to prevent my calling the reckoning, and our parting without ill-blood on either side.\u201d Carton rejoining, \u201cNothing in life!\u201d Darnay rang. \u201cDo you call the whole reckoning?\u201d said Carton. On his answering in the affirmative, \u201cThen bring me another pint of this same wine, drawer, and come and wake me at ten.\u201d The bill being paid, Charles Darnay rose and wished him good night. Without returning the wish, Carton rose too, with something of a threat of defiance in his manner, and said, \u201cA last word, Mr. Darnay: you think I am drunk?\u201d \u201cI think you have been drinking, Mr. Carton.\u201d \u201cThink?

The prisoner sprang up with a reproachful look, but Carton's hand was close and firm at his nostrils, and Carton's left arm caught him round the waist."], "What happens when Madame Defarge arrives at the Manette apartment?": [" The shadow attendant on Madame Defarge and her party seemed then to fall, threatening and dark, on both the mother and the child. \u201cIt is enough, my husband,\u201d said Madame Defarge. \u201cI have seen them. We may go.\u201d But, the suppressed manner had enough of menace in it--not visible and presented, but indistinct and withheld--to alarm Lucie into saying, as she laid her appealing hand on Madame Defarge's dress: \u201cYou will be good to my poor husband. You will do him no harm. You will help me to see him if you can?\u201d \u201cYour husband is not my business here,\u201d returned Madame Defarge, looking down at her with perfect composure. \u201cIt is the daughter of your father who is my business here.\u201d \u201cFor my sake, then, be merciful to my husband. For my child's sake! She will put her hands together and pray you to be merciful. We are more afraid of you than of these others.\u201d Madame Defarge received it as a compliment, and looked at her husband.", " Good day, one and all!\u201d \u201cHave the goodness to give me a little glass of old cognac, and a mouthful of cool fresh water, madame.\u201d Madame complied with a polite air. \u201cMarvellous cognac this, madame!\u201d It was the first time it had ever been so complimented, and Madame Defarge knew enough of its antecedents to know better. She said, however, that the cognac was flattered, and took up her knitting. The visitor watched her fingers for a few moments, and took the opportunity of observing the place in general. \u201cYou knit with great skill, madame.\u201d \u201cI am accustomed to it.\u201d \u201cA pretty pattern too!\u201d \u201c_You_ think so?\u201d said madame, looking at him with a smile. \u201cDecidedly. May one ask what it is for?\u201d \u201cPastime,\u201d said madame, still looking at him with a smile while her fingers moved nimbly. \u201cNot for use?\u201d \u201cThat depends. I may find a use for it one day. If I do--Well,\u201d said madame, drawing a breath and nodding her head with a stern kind of coquetry, \u201cI'll use it!\u201d It was remarkable; but, the taste of Saint Antoine seemed to be decidedly opposed to a rose on the head-dress of Madame Defarge.", " Wife of Evremonde! Child of Evremonde! Any person but this miserable fool, answer the Citizeness Defarge!\u201d Perhaps the following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in the expression of Miss Pross's face, perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from either suggestion, whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone. Three of the doors she opened swiftly, and looked in. \u201cThose rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing, there are odds and ends upon the ground. There is no one in that room behind you! Let me look.\u201d \u201cNever!\u201d said Miss Pross, who understood the request as perfectly as Madame Defarge understood the answer. \u201cIf they are not in that room, they are gone, and can be pursued and brought back,\u201d said Madame Defarge to herself. \u201cAs long as you don't know whether they are in that room or not, you are uncertain what to do,\u201d said Miss Pross to herself; \u201cand you shall not know that, if I can prevent your knowing it; and know that, or not know that, you shall not leave here while I can hold you.\u201d \u201cI have been in the streets from the first, nothing has stopped me, I will tear you to pieces, but I will have you from that door,\u201d said Madame Defarge.", " In one of those pauses she recoiled and cried out, for she saw a figure standing in the room. The basin fell to the ground broken, and the water flowed to the feet of Madame Defarge. By strange stern ways, and through much staining blood, those feet had come to meet that water. Madame Defarge looked coldly at her, and said, \u201cThe wife of Evremonde; where is she?\u201d It flashed upon Miss Pross's mind that the doors were all standing open, and would suggest the flight. Her first act was to shut them. There were four in the room, and she shut them all. She then placed herself before the door of the chamber which Lucie had occupied. Madame Defarge's dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement, and rested on her when it was finished. Miss Pross had nothing beautiful about her; years had not tamed the wildness, or softened the grimness, of her appearance; but, she too was a determined woman in her different way, and she measured Madame Defarge with her eyes, every inch."], "How does Carton feel before he is executed?": [" All here, yourself excepted, saw the King take it, in his carriage in the street, sitting beside the Queen. It is Defarge whom you see here, who, at the hazard of his life, darted out before the horses, with the petition in his hand.\u201d \u201cAnd once again listen, Jacques!\u201d said the kneeling Number Three: his fingers ever wandering over and over those fine nerves, with a strikingly greedy air, as if he hungered for something--that was neither food nor drink; \u201cthe guard, horse and foot, surrounded the petitioner, and struck him blows. You hear?\u201d \u201cI hear, messieurs.\u201d \u201cGo on then,\u201d said Defarge. \u201cAgain; on the other hand, they whisper at the fountain,\u201d resumed the countryman, \u201cthat he is brought down into our country to be executed on the spot, and that he will very certainly be executed. They even whisper that because he has slain Monseigneur, and because Monseigneur was the father of his tenants--serfs--what you will--he will be executed as a parricide.", " Are you astonished?\u201d Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, \u201cWhy should I be astonished?\u201d \u201cYou approve?\u201d Carton, still drinking the punch, rejoined, \u201cWhy should I not approve?\u201d \u201cWell!\u201d said his friend Stryver, \u201cyou take it more easily than I fancied you would, and are less mercenary on my behalf than I thought you would be; though, to be sure, you know well enough by this time that your ancient chum is a man of a pretty strong will. Yes, Sydney, I have had enough of this style of life, with no other as a change from it; I feel that it is a pleasant thing for a man to have a home when he feels inclined to go to it (when he doesn't, he can stay away), and I feel that Miss Manette will tell well in any station, and will always do me credit. So I have made up my mind. And now, Sydney, old boy, I want to say a word to _you_ about _your_ prospects. You are in a bad way, you know; you really are in a bad way.", " Take up the pen and finish. Hurry, hurry!\u201d As if his memory were impaired, or his faculties disordered, the prisoner made an effort to rally his attention. As he looked at Carton with clouded eyes and with an altered manner of breathing, Carton--his hand again in his breast--looked steadily at him. \u201cHurry, hurry!\u201d The prisoner bent over the paper, once more. \u201c'If it had been otherwise;'\u201d Carton's hand was again watchfully and softly stealing down; \u201c'I never should have used the longer opportunity. If it had been otherwise;'\u201d the hand was at the prisoner's face; \u201c'I should but have had so much the more to answer for. If it had been otherwise--'\u201d Carton looked at the pen and saw it was trailing off into unintelligible signs. Carton's hand moved back to his breast no more. The prisoner sprang up with a reproachful look, but Carton's hand was close and firm at his nostrils, and Carton's left arm caught him round the waist.", " Let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at.\u201d Drawing his arm through his own, he took him down Ludgate-hill to Fleet-street, and so, up a covered way, into a tavern. Here, they were shown into a little room, where Charles Darnay was soon recruiting his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine: while Carton sat opposite to him at the same table, with his separate bottle of port before him, and his fully half-insolent manner upon him. \u201cDo you feel, yet, that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again, Mr. Darnay?\u201d \u201cI am frightfully confused regarding time and place; but I am so far mended as to feel that.\u201d \u201cIt must be an immense satisfaction!\u201d He said it bitterly, and filled up his glass again: which was a large one. \u201cAs to me, the greatest desire I have, is to forget that I belong to it. It has no good in it for me--except wine like this--nor I for it. So we are not much alike in that particular."]}
