A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\u201d \u201cHow so? How can it affect them?\u201d \u201cMy dear Mr. Bennet,\u201d replied his wife, \u201chow can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.\u201d \u201cIs that his design in settling here?\u201d \u201cDesign! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.\u201d \u201cI see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party.\u201d \u201cMy dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.\u201d \u201cIn such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\u201d \u201cBut, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.\u201d \u201cIt is more than I engage for, I assure you.\u201d \u201cBut consider your daughters.", " Chapter 26 Mrs. Gardiner\u2019s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on: \u201cYou are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against _him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.\u201d \u201cMy dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.\u201d \u201cYes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.\u201d \u201cWell, then, you need not be under any alarm.", " I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.\u201d Chapter 4 When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very much she admired him. \u201cHe is just what a young man ought to be,\u201d said she, \u201csensible, good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!\u2014so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!\u201d \u201cHe is also handsome,\u201d replied Elizabeth, \u201cwhich a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can. His character is thereby complete.\u201d \u201cI was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I did not expect such a compliment.\u201d \u201cDid not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference between us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room."], "The Bennet familylives in the village of": [" Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane\u2019s pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife\u2019s views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a different story to hear. \u201cOh, my dear Mr. Bennet,\u201d as she entered the room, \u201cwe have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball.", " \u201cIt must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year.\u201d \u201cUndoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had.\u201d \u201cYes; he introduced us to his sister.\u201d \u201cAnd do you like her?\u201d \u201cVery much.\u201d \u201cI have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad you liked her. I hope she will turn out well.\u201d \u201cI dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.\u201d \u201cDid you go by the village of Kympton?\u201d \u201cI do not recollect that we did.\u201d \u201cI mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A most delightful place!\u2014Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited me in every respect.\u201d \u201cHow should you have liked making sermons?\u201d \u201cExceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing.", " I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into my house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. And you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner.\u201d Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry. \u201cWell, well,\u201d said he, \u201cdo not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of them.\u201d Chapter 49 Two days after Mr. Bennet\u2019s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, \u201cI beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean, Hill?", " The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner\u2019s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters\u2019, and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the headquarters. Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence."], "Mr. Bingley, whenhe attends the ball in Meryton, seems to be quite taken with": [" to Miss Lydia Bennet,\u2019 without there being a syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything. It was my brother Gardiner\u2019s drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?\u201d Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell. \u201cIt is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,\u201d continued her mother, \u201cbut at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the \u2014\u2014shire, and of his being gone into the regulars. Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so many as he deserves.\u201d Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat.", " His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother\u2019s ear: \u201cI am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.\u201d Lydia declared herself satisfied. \u201cOh! yes\u2014it would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,\u201d she added, \u201cI shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.\u201d Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations\u2019 behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of all Miss Bingley\u2019s witticisms on _fine eyes_.", " Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister\u2019s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy\u2019s regard.\u201d \u201cMr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\u201d \u201cNo; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\u201d \u201cThis account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am satisfied. But what does he say of the living?\u201d \u201cHe does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only.\u201d \u201cI have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley\u2019s sincerity,\u201d said Elizabeth warmly; \u201cbut you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.", " An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him from London\u2014his five sisters and a cousin."], "How does Mr. Darcyoffend Elizabeth at the first ball?": [" Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield. Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attention of the officers, to whom her uncle\u2019s good dinners, and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.", " Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane\u2019s pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations.

Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire\u2014and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too\u2014for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.\u201d \u201cI am not afraid of you,\u201d said he, smilingly. \u201cPray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,\u201d cried Colonel Fitzwilliam. \u201cI should like to know how he behaves among strangers.\u201d \u201cYou shall hear then\u2014but prepare yourself for something very dreadful. The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball\u2014and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner.", " I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library.\u201d No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said: \u201cBy the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure.\u201d \u201cIf you mean Darcy,\u201d cried her brother, \u201che may go to bed, if he chooses, before it begins\u2014but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send round my cards.\u201d \u201cI should like balls infinitely better,\u201d she replied, \u201cif they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting."], "Elizabeth\u2019s bestfriend is named": [" \u201cWhat will be his surprise,\u201d thought she, \u201cwhen he knows who they are? He takes them now for people of fashion.\u201d The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners.", " On finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words: \u201cMay I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?\u201d Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs. Bennet answered instantly, \u201cOh dear!\u2014yes\u2014certainly. I am sure Lizzy will be very happy\u2014I am sure she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs.\u201d And, gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out: \u201cDear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am going away myself.\u201d \u201cNo, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.\u201d And upon Elizabeth\u2019s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added: \u201cLizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins.\u201d Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction\u2014and a moment\u2019s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion.", " They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh. They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt. She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth\u2019s salutation than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship\u2019s entrance, though no request of introduction had been made. Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth, \u201cI hope you are well, Miss Bennet.", " Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy\u2019s meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley\u2019s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend. Elizabeth\u2019s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully."], "Why does Jane\u2019svisit to the Bingleys end up lasting for days?": [" Have you never happened to see her there?\u201d She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away. Chapter 31 Colonel Fitzwilliam\u2019s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither\u2014for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the gentlemen\u2019s arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening.", " It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Bingley and Jane she had never doubted; but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted. \u201cThere were some very strong objections against the lady,\u201d were Colonel Fitzwilliam\u2019s words; and those strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in London.", " She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine\u2019s behaviour was most friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins\u2019s picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest. Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys. Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been lost. \u201cMy aunt,\u201d she continued, \u201cis going to-morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.\u201d She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.", " But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where they like.\u201d \u201cUnless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do.\u201d \u201cOur habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money.\u201d \u201cIs this,\u201d thought Elizabeth, \u201cmeant for me?\u201d and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, \u201cAnd pray, what is the usual price of an earl\u2019s younger son? Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.\u201d He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said: \u201cI imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind."], "What does it meanthat Mr. Bennet\u2019s property is \u201centailed\u201d?": [" There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed.\u201d \u201cI am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps, when we are better acquainted\u2014\u201d He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins\u2019s admiration. The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised; and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet\u2019s heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property. The dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was owing.", " I knew you would be wishing me joy.\u201d \u201cNay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is absolutely settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed; and, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you.\u201d He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long. Chapter 7 Mr. Bennet\u2019s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother\u2019s fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds. She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade.", " However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters. \u201cMy dear Mr. Bennet,\u201d said his lady to him one day, \u201chave you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?\u201d Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. \u201cBut it is,\u201d returned she; \u201cfor Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.\u201d Mr. Bennet made no answer. \u201cDo you not want to know who has taken it?\u201d cried his wife impatiently. \u201c_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.\u201d This was invitation enough. \u201cWhy, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.\u201d \u201cWhat is his name?\u201d \u201cBingley.\u201d \u201cIs he married or single?\u201d \u201cOh!", " The first part of Mrs. Gardiner\u2019s business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was done she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her girls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it. \u201cI do not blame Jane,\u201d she continued, \u201cfor Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins\u2019s wife by this time, had it not been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him.

Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in those points where he most wants care.

Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense. \u201cI see your design, Bingley,\u201d said his friend. \u201cYou dislike an argument, and want to silence this.\u201d \u201cPerhaps I do.

Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins\u2019s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte\u2019s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.", " Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.

To the civil inquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley\u2019s, she could not make a very favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike. Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency."], "Where do theBingleys and Darcy go for the winter?": [" Many of my acquaintances are already there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd\u2014but of that I despair.

I will have no reserves from _you_.\u201d \u201cMr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister.", " Her ease and good spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called \u201cMrs. Wickham\u201d by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids. \u201cWell, mamma,\u201d said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, \u201cand what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get husbands.

Must it be so?\u201d \u201cOh, lord! yes;\u2014there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.\u201d \u201cI should like it beyond anything!\u201d said her mother.", " Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth\u2019s person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother\u2019s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not err. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister. \u201cHow very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,\u201d she cried; \u201cI never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again.\u201d However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.", " it was melancholy to leave her to such society! But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms. At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at Rosings."], "In March, Elizabethgoes to visit": [" Promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford.\u201d Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit. \u201cMy father and Maria are coming to me in March,\u201d added Charlotte, \u201cand I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome as either of them.\u201d The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte\u2019s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen.", " When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news. Chapter 2 Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with: \u201cI hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.\u201d \u201cWe are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,\u201d said her mother resentfully, \u201csince we are not to visit.\u201d \u201cBut you forget, mamma,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cthat we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.\u201d \u201cI do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of her own.", " Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.\u201d Chapter 27 With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake.", " Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit him if you do not.\u201d \u201cYou are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.\u201d \u201cI desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.\u201d \u201cThey have none of them much to recommend them,\u201d replied he; \u201cthey are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters.\u201d \u201cMr."], "Lady Catherinede Bourgh is Darcy\u2019s": [" \u201cI know very well, madam,\u201d said he, \u201cthat when persons sit down to a card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters.\u201d Mr. Wickham\u2019s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh. \u201cLady Catherine de Bourgh,\u201d she replied, \u201chas very lately given him a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long.\u201d \u201cYou know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.\u201d \u201cNo, indeed, I did not.", " I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.\u201d \u201cYou are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!\u201d \u201cIndeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier. I believe him to be Lady Catherine\u2019s _nephew_. It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se\u2019nnight.\u201d Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance.", " my dear,\u201d said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, \u201cit is not Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them; the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little creature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?\u201d \u201cShe is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind. Why does she not come in?\u201d \u201cOh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in.\u201d \u201cI like her appearance,\u201d said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. \u201cShe looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will make him a very proper wife.\u201d Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth\u2019s high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way.", " He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh\u2014the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire."], "When Darcy firstproposes to Elizabeth, he spends most of the proposal dwelling on": [" Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be of service\u2014and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything.\u201d Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister\u2019s ready acquiescence. \u201cI hope,\u201d added Mrs. Gardiner, \u201cthat no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her.\u201d \u201cAnd _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London!", " But now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia\u2019s marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation. \u201cGood gracious!\u201d cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next morning, \u201cif that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him? Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley\u2019s way.\u201d Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet. As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, \u201cMrs.", " She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself\u2014from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin\u2019s affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question. At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin\u2019s corroboration.", " His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother. Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady\u2019s fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister\u2019s countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own room, Jane, taking out the letter, said: \u201cThis is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good deal."], "When Darcy proposesfor the first time, Elizabeth": [" The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte\u2019s first sketch. She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be. The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter. The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her\u2014their opinion of everybody\u2014would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that, whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.", " Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her neighbours\u2019 looks, their equal amazement in beholding it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time with:\u2014\u201cIt is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. _I_ talked about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples.\u201d He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said.", " Mr. what\u2019s-his-name. That tall, proud man.\u201d \u201cGood gracious! Mr. Darcy!\u2014and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley\u2019s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him.\u201d Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr. Bingley\u2019s friend, without being heard by either of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs. Gardiner\u2019s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.", " Chapter 58 Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine\u2019s visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of walking; Mary could never spare time; but the remaining five set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he might be doing the same."], "Elizabeth\u2019s feelingstoward Darcy begin to change when he": [" There\u2014I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable.

How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.\u201d \u201cYou are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!\u201d \u201cIndeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier. I believe him to be Lady Catherine\u2019s _nephew_. It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se\u2019nnight.\u201d Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance.", " But the morrow passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son-in-law that she ventured not to speak to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark her deference for his opinion. Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem. \u201cI admire all my three sons-in-law highly,\u201d said he. \u201cWickham, perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well as Jane\u2019s.\u201d Chapter 60 Elizabeth\u2019s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. \u201cHow could you begin?\u201d said she. \u201cI can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?\u201d \u201cI cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation."], "Darcy\u2019s estateis called": [" \u201cWhat can be the meaning of this?\u201d said Charlotte, as soon as he was gone. \u201cMy dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never have called us in this familiar way.\u201d But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte\u2019s wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt.", " There\u2014I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable.

Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief. \u201cThey met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. \u201cEverything being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy\u2019s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came home.", " \u201cI had once had some thought of fixing in town myself\u2014for I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas.\u201d He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her: \u201cMy dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much beauty is before you.\u201d And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy who, though extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William: \u201cIndeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.\u201d Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of her hand, but in vain."], "Where does Lydiaspend the summer, and why?": [" Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the \u2014\u2014shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight.\u201d \u201cAre they indeed!\u201d cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction. \u201cThey are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to go too of all things!

It is excellent news\u2014capital news\u2014and about a certain person we all like!\u201d Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need not stay.", " After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton. The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent.", " \u201cWell, Lizzy,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet one day, \u201cwhat is your opinion _now_ of this sad business of Jane\u2019s? For my part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day. But I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is a very undeserving young man\u2014and I do not suppose there\u2019s the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of everybody, too, who is likely to know.\u201d \u201cI do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.\u201d \u201cOh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done.\u201d But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no answer.", " That lady, I suppose, is your mother.\u201d Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was. \u201cAnd _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters.\u201d \u201cYes, madam,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady Catherine. \u201cShe is my youngest girl but one.

I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins\u2019s character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state.\u201d Elizabeth quietly answered \u201cUndoubtedly;\u201d and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins\u2019s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte\u2019s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.", " A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their _three_ months\u2019 acquaintance they had been intimate _two_. The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister\u2019s feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone\u2019s congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish. \u201cI cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,\u201d said she, \u201cThough I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.\u201d In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned.", " As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia\u2019s general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said: \u201cLydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances.\u201d \u201cIf you were aware,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cof the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia\u2019s unguarded and imprudent manner\u2014nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair.\u201d \u201cAlready arisen?\u201d repeated Mr. Bennet.", " Surprise was the least of her feelings on this development.

I had not an idea of it.\u201d Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law\u2019s entreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before. \u201cWhat, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?\u201d she cried. \u201cSure he will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?\u201d As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it.", " He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham\u2019s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.", " The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town\u2014and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear what she says.\u201d She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a house. The next was in these words: \u201cI do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.\u201d To these highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley\u2019s being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.", " As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go.

Oh, Lydia!\u201d \u201cI comfort myself with thinking,\u201d replied Jane, \u201cthat he certainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced.", " \u201cAnd may I ask\u2014\u201d said Elizabeth; \u201cbut the terms, I suppose, must be complied with.\u201d \u201cComplied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.\u201d \u201cAnd they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!\u201d \u201cYes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever to pay him.\u201d \u201cMoney! My uncle!\u201d cried Jane, \u201cwhat do you mean, sir?\u201d \u201cI mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am gone.\u201d \u201cThat is very true,\u201d said Elizabeth; \u201cthough it had not occurred to me before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle\u2019s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said her father; \u201cWickham\u2019s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds.", " But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where they like.\u201d \u201cUnless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do.\u201d \u201cOur habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money.\u201d \u201cIs this,\u201d thought Elizabeth, \u201cmeant for me?\u201d and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, \u201cAnd pray, what is the usual price of an earl\u2019s younger son? Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.\u201d He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said: \u201cI imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind."], "When he returnsto Netherfield, Mr. Bingley": [" He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?\u201d \u201cPerfectly so, I thank you.\u201d She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a short pause added: \u201cI think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?\u201d \u201cI have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in the future. He has many friends, and is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing.\u201d \u201cIf he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle.\u201d \u201cI should not be surprised,\u201d said Darcy, \u201cif he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers.\u201d Elizabeth made no answer.", " Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister\u2019s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy\u2019s regard.\u201d \u201cMr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\u201d \u201cNo; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\u201d \u201cThis account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am satisfied. But what does he say of the living?\u201d \u201cHe does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only.\u201d \u201cI have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley\u2019s sincerity,\u201d said Elizabeth warmly; \u201cbut you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.", " Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? Oh! no.\u201d \u201cI can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley\u2019s being imposed on, than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks.\u201d \u201cIt is difficult indeed\u2014it is distressing. One does not know what to think.\u201d \u201cI beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.\u201d But Jane could think with certainty on only one point\u2014that Mr. Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public. The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday.", " However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters. \u201cMy dear Mr. Bennet,\u201d said his lady to him one day, \u201chave you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?\u201d Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. \u201cBut it is,\u201d returned she; \u201cfor Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.\u201d Mr. Bennet made no answer. \u201cDo you not want to know who has taken it?\u201d cried his wife impatiently. \u201c_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.\u201d This was invitation enough. \u201cWhy, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.\u201d \u201cWhat is his name?\u201d \u201cBingley.\u201d \u201cIs he married or single?\u201d \u201cOh!"], "What does LadyCatherine forbid Elizabeth to do?": [" I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.\u201d \u201cTen thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be repaid?\u201d Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house. Their father then went on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room. \u201cAnd they are really to be married!\u201d cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves. \u201cHow strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!\u201d \u201cI comfort myself with thinking,\u201d replied Jane, \u201cthat he certainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced.", " Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?\u201d \u201cYes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?\u201d \u201cBecause honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all.", " The moment of her release from him was ecstasy. She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her: \u201cI dare say you will find him very agreeable.\u201d \u201cHeaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an evil.\u201d When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence.", " As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.\u201d \u201cI do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking the truth from her heart.\u201d \u201cYou are uniformly charming!\u201d cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry; \u201cand I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable.\u201d To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female."], "What are Elizabeth's most notable virtues": [" On finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words: \u201cMay I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?\u201d Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs. Bennet answered instantly, \u201cOh dear!\u2014yes\u2014certainly. I am sure Lizzy will be very happy\u2014I am sure she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs.\u201d And, gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out: \u201cDear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am going away myself.\u201d \u201cNo, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.\u201d And upon Elizabeth\u2019s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added: \u201cLizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins.\u201d Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction\u2014and a moment\u2019s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion.", " They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh. They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt. She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth\u2019s salutation than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship\u2019s entrance, though no request of introduction had been made. Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth, \u201cI hope you are well, Miss Bennet.", " Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy\u2019s meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley\u2019s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend. Elizabeth\u2019s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.", " Elizabeth silently attended her. When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in fact, nothing to do elsewhere. When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present."], "Which characteristic does Elizabeth have to overcome in the novel": [" In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offense. The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much. Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so\u2014but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they would not object to know more of.", " She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself. \u201cShe did not choose it,\u201d said her daughter, \u201cshe would go.\u201d \u201cShe is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously civil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well. She is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so, passing through Meryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you, Lizzy?\u201d Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible. Chapter 57 The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she, for many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly.", " Chapter 40 Elizabeth\u2019s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself. Miss Bennet\u2019s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister\u2019s refusal must have given him. \u201cHis being so sure of succeeding was wrong,\u201d said she, \u201cand certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment!\u201d \u201cIndeed,\u201d replied Elizabeth, \u201cI am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.", " Jane should therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his attention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses.\u201d \u201cYour plan is a good one,\u201d replied Elizabeth, \u201cwhere nothing is in question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But these are not Jane\u2019s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite enough to make her understand his character.\u201d \u201cNot as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent together\u2014and four evenings may do a great deal.\u201d \u201cYes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Charlotte, \u201cI wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth."], "What trait does Darcy have to get over to be with Elizabeth": [" She had never heard of him before his entrance into the \u2014\u2014shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years\u2019 continuance. But no such recollection befriended her.", " It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more we may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as lost. As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother, and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as to what is to be done.\u201d \u201cOh! my dear brother,\u201d replied Mrs. Bennet, \u201cthat is exactly what I could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them, after they are married. And, above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my wits\u2014and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me\u2014such spasms in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day.", " She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.\u201d \u201cI know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man\u2014he is a great friend of Darcy\u2019s.\u201d \u201cOh! yes,\u201d said Elizabeth drily; \u201cMr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.\u201d \u201cCare of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.\u201d \u201cWhat is it you mean?\u201d \u201cIt is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady\u2019s family, it would be an unpleasant thing.\u201d \u201cYou may depend upon my not mentioning it.\u201d \u201cAnd remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley.", " And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes\u2019 time, and then we all set out. However, I recollected afterwards that if he _had_ been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.\u201d \u201cMr. Darcy!\u201d repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement. \u201cOh, yes!\u2014he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!\u201d \u201cIf it was to be secret,\u201d said Jane, \u201csay not another word on the subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.\u201d \u201cOh! certainly,\u201d said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; \u201cwe will ask you no questions.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d said Lydia, \u201cfor if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry.\u201d On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away."], "Which two characters serve as foils for Elizabeth and Darcy": [" Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner promised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily settled. They were to be off as soon as possible. \u201cBut what is to be done about Pemberley?\u201d cried Mrs. Gardiner. \u201cJohn told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us; was it so?\u201d \u201cYes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement. _That_ is all settled.\u201d \u201cWhat is all settled?\u201d repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare. \u201cAnd are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!\u201d But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure.", " From the further disadvantage of Lydia\u2019s society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going. Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet\u2019s being quite unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters\u2019 beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance. As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune.", " Having been frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her, an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure, for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified, and her preference secured at any time by their renewal.", " _I_ only want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte\u2019s marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is unaccountable!\u201d \u201cMy dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins\u2019s respectability, and Charlotte\u2019s steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for everybody\u2019s sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin.\u201d \u201cTo oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart."], "Which of the following best describe Mr. Bennett's behavior throughout the novel": [" But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of Wickham\u2019s resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality\u2014deliberated on the probability of each statement\u2014but with little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy\u2019s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole. The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at Mr. Wickham\u2019s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice.", " When Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by Charlotte\u2019s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten. She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining in, observed: \u201cYes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home.", " The first part of Mrs. Gardiner\u2019s business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was done she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her girls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it. \u201cI do not blame Jane,\u201d she continued, \u201cfor Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins\u2019s wife by this time, had it not been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister.", " She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it. In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother\u2019s words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical. \u201cWhat is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear.\u201d \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing!\u201d Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone."], "Which two traits define Mr. Collins": [" Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course. Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces. Lydia\u2019s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.", " Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_.\u201d Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication. \u201cI have not the pleasure of understanding you,\u201d said he, when she had finished her speech. \u201cOf what are you talking?\u201d \u201cOf Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.\u201d \u201cAnd what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.\u201d \u201cSpeak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him.\u201d \u201cLet her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.\u201d Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library.", " I wish you had been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice! Only think of _that_, my dear; he actually danced with her twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_\u2014\u201d \u201cIf he had had any compassion for _me_,\u201d cried her husband impatiently, \u201che would not have danced half so much!", " \u201cI am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,\u201d said he, \u201cthat a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her.\u201d Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help for it, however. Mr. Wickham\u2019s happiness and her own were perforce delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins\u2019s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could."], "Which two Bennet sisters are most charmed by the soldiers": [" Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the \u2014\u2014shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight.\u201d \u201cAre they indeed!\u201d cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction. \u201cThey are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d thought Elizabeth, \u201c_that_ would be a delightful scheme indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!\u201d \u201cNow I have got some news for you,\u201d said Lydia, as they sat down at table. \u201cWhat do you think? It is excellent news\u2014capital news\u2014and about a certain person we all like!\u201d Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need not stay.", " Chapter 9 Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister\u2019s room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast. Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield.", " I wish you had been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice! Only think of _that_, my dear; he actually danced with her twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas.

He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected. Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to _his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other. Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia\u2019s example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid."], "Why does Charlotte accept Mr. Collins' proposal": [" \u201cI am by no means of the opinion, I assure you,\u201d said he, \u201cthat a ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause, and not to any disrespect for her.\u201d Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in.

Mr. Wickham\u2019s happiness and her own were perforce delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins\u2019s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could.", " Mrs. Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him. She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others; there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her, and though by no means so clever as herself, she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of this kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before. The possibility of Mr. Collins\u2019s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out: \u201cEngaged to Mr. Collins!", " On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.\u201d It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now. \u201cYou are too hasty, sir,\u201d she cried. \u201cYou forget that I have made no answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them.\u201d \u201cI am not now to learn,\u201d replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the hand, \u201cthat it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.\u201d \u201cUpon my word, sir,\u201d cried Elizabeth, \u201cyour hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration.", " Presuming however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on. Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress."], "Which two characters act most snobbishly toward Elizabeth": [" Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire\u2014paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word. Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody. At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual way, and after a moment\u2019s pause, added: \u201cMy eldest sister has been in town these three months.", " Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.\u201d \u201cWhich do you mean?\u201d and turning round he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said: \u201cShe is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.\u201d Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous. The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters.", " She was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors. The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.", " _I_ only want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte\u2019s marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is unaccountable!\u201d \u201cMy dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins\u2019s respectability, and Charlotte\u2019s steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for everybody\u2019s sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin.\u201d \u201cTo oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart."], "What is Mrs. Bennet's primary goal in life": [" It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane\u2019s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life.", " And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And what do you think she said besides? \u2018Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last.\u2019 She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever lived\u2014and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.\u201d Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley\u2019s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals. \u201cIt has been a very agreeable day,\u201d said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. \u201cThe party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we may often meet again.\u201d Elizabeth smiled.", " Jane heard them with horror. \u201cA gamester!\u201d she cried. \u201cThis is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.\u201d Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law\u2019s entreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before. \u201cWhat, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?\u201d she cried. \u201cSure he will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?\u201d As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it.", " As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister. Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Phillips\u2019s manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life. Chapter 16 As no objection was made to the young people\u2019s engagement with their aunt, and all Mr. Collins\u2019s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle\u2019s invitation, and was then in the house."], "How is Mr. Darcy initially perceived": [" Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth\u2019s person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother\u2019s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not err. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister. \u201cHow very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,\u201d she cried; \u201cI never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again.\u201d However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.", " Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister\u2019s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy\u2019s regard.\u201d \u201cMr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\u201d \u201cNo; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\u201d \u201cThis account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am satisfied. But what does he say of the living?\u201d \u201cHe does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only.\u201d \u201cI have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley\u2019s sincerity,\u201d said Elizabeth warmly; \u201cbut you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.", " But Jane was to go home with her, and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation. It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she could wait even for Longbourn, before she told her sister of Mr. Darcy\u2019s proposals. To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate; and her fear, if she once entered on the subject, of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister further. Chapter 39 It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of \u2014\u2014, in Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet\u2019s carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman\u2019s punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room up stairs.", " Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane\u2019s letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her. \u201cMr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday."], "What does Wickham lead Elizabeth to believe about Darcy": [" When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself. Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy\u2019s eyes were fixed on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine, however, at last that she drew his notice because there was something more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present. The supposition did not pain her.", " Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister\u2019s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy\u2019s regard.\u201d \u201cMr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\u201d \u201cNo; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\u201d \u201cThis account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am satisfied. But what does he say of the living?\u201d \u201cHe does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only.\u201d \u201cI have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley\u2019s sincerity,\u201d said Elizabeth warmly; \u201cbut you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.", " I will take care of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it.\u201d \u201cElizabeth, you are not serious now.\u201d \u201cI beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw\u2014and if he becomes really attached to me\u2014I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence of it. Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father\u2019s opinion of me does me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist?", " Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began. \u201cBelieve me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected mother\u2019s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of my future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying\u2014and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.\u201d The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further, and he continued: \u201cMy reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly\u2014which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness."], "What does Darcy do to Elizabeth when he visits her in the Collins' home": [" From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes\u2019 conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get out. Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins\u2019s joints of meat were too large for her family.", " His surprise was great. He had never had the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.\u201d Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend. \u201cDid you speak from your own observation,\u201d said she, \u201cwhen you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?\u201d \u201cFrom the former. I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her affection.\u201d \u201cAnd your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to him.\u201d \u201cIt did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but his reliance on mine made every thing easy.", " Jane heard them with horror. \u201cA gamester!\u201d she cried. \u201cThis is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.\u201d Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law\u2019s entreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before. \u201cWhat, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?\u201d she cried. \u201cSure he will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?\u201d As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it.", " His pride, in that direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and judgement he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he has very much at heart.\u201d Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge him. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again."], "Whom does Lydia marry": [" Surprise was the least of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise\u2014all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey. She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion.", " I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.\u201d \u201cTen thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be repaid?\u201d Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house. Their father then went on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room. \u201cAnd they are really to be married!\u201d cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves. \u201cHow strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!\u201d \u201cI comfort myself with thinking,\u201d replied Jane, \u201cthat he certainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced.", " \u201cAnd may I ask\u2014\u201d said Elizabeth; \u201cbut the terms, I suppose, must be complied with.\u201d \u201cComplied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.\u201d \u201cAnd they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!\u201d \u201cYes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever to pay him.\u201d \u201cMoney! My uncle!\u201d cried Jane, \u201cwhat do you mean, sir?\u201d \u201cI mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am gone.\u201d \u201cThat is very true,\u201d said Elizabeth; \u201cthough it had not occurred to me before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle\u2019s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said her father; \u201cWickham\u2019s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds.", " But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where they like.\u201d \u201cUnless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do.\u201d \u201cOur habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money.\u201d \u201cIs this,\u201d thought Elizabeth, \u201cmeant for me?\u201d and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, \u201cAnd pray, what is the usual price of an earl\u2019s younger son? Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.\u201d He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said: \u201cI imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind."], "What does Lady Catherine de Bourgh demand of Elizabeth": [" \u201cI know very well, madam,\u201d said he, \u201cthat when persons sit down to a card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters.\u201d Mr. Wickham\u2019s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh. \u201cLady Catherine de Bourgh,\u201d she replied, \u201chas very lately given him a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long.\u201d \u201cYou know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.\u201d \u201cNo, indeed, I did not.", " my dear,\u201d said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, \u201cit is not Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them; the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little creature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?\u201d \u201cShe is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind. Why does she not come in?\u201d \u201cOh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in.\u201d \u201cI like her appearance,\u201d said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. \u201cShe looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will make him a very proper wife.\u201d Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth\u2019s high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way.", " I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.\u201d \u201cYou are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!\u201d \u201cIndeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier. I believe him to be Lady Catherine\u2019s _nephew_. It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se\u2019nnight.\u201d Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance.", " He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh\u2014the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire."], "What hinders romantic love in the novel": [" I am not romantic, you know; I never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins\u2019s character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state.\u201d Elizabeth quietly answered \u201cUndoubtedly;\u201d and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins\u2019s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte\u2019s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.", " We do not suffer by accident. It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before.\u201d \u201cBut that expression of \u2018violently in love\u2019 is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour\u2019s acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_ Mr. Bingley\u2019s love?\u201d \u201cI never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?\u201d \u201cOh, yes!\u2014of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt.", " Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy. All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on: \u201cI am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.", " \u201cThere has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!\u201d \u201cI have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,\u201d said Darcy. \u201cOf a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.\u201d Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage."], "In the society portrayed in the novel, what is most important to a woman": [" \u201cIt was the prospect of constant society, and good society,\u201d he added, \u201cwhich was my chief inducement to enter the \u2014\u2014shire. I knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them. Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society. A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession\u2014I was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.\u201d \u201cIndeed!\u201d \u201cYes\u2014the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.", " \u201cMr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridge\u2014most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman\u2019s education. My father was not only fond of this young man\u2019s society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities\u2014the want of principle, which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have.", " The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town\u2014and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear what she says.\u201d She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a house. The next was in these words: \u201cI do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.\u201d To these highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley\u2019s being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.", " It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam\u2019s manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind. But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice\u2014a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliam\u2019s occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself seriously to work to find it out."], "What is the role of journeys in the novel": [" Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys\u2014and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance.\u201d Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, \u201c_You_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have been always at Longbourn.\u201d Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice: \u201cAre you pleased with Kent?\u201d A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise\u2014and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her walk. The _t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate_ surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away."], "Which character's home plays the greatest symbolic role in the novel": [" This room was my late master\u2019s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then. He was very fond of them.\u201d This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham\u2019s being among them. Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old. \u201cAnd is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?\u201d said Mrs. Gardiner. \u201cOh! yes\u2014the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!\u2014She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her\u2014a present from my master; she comes here to-morrow with him.\u201d Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister. \u201cIs your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?\u201d \u201cNot so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.\u201d \u201cExcept,\u201d thought Elizabeth, \u201cwhen she goes to Ramsgate.\u201d \u201cIf your master would marry, you might see more of him.\u201d \u201cYes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be.", " Jane heard them with horror. \u201cA gamester!\u201d she cried. \u201cThis is wholly unexpected.

It does not follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.\u201d \u201cLizzy,\u201d cried her mother, \u201cremember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.\u201d \u201cI did not know before,\u201d continued Bingley immediately, \u201cthat you were a studier of character. It must be an amusing study.\u201d \u201cYes, but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at least that advantage.\u201d \u201cThe country,\u201d said Darcy, \u201ccan in general supply but a few subjects for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society.\u201d \u201cBut people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever.\u201d \u201cYes, indeed,\u201d cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood.", " And when I returned home, the \u2014\u2014shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight\u2019s time. As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a consequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was far enough from my thoughts.\u201d \u201cWhen they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other?\u201d \u201cNot the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away."], "In what way is Austen's criticism of class limited": [" She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class.\u201d Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham\u2019s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillips\u2019s supper party, but his manners recommended him to everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent.", " She had never heard of him before his entrance into the \u2014\u2014shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years\u2019 continuance. But no such recollection befriended her.", " He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way. By Elizabeth\u2019s instructions, she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself. Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth\u2019s persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.", " You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;\u2014though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.\u201d \u201cI was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way.\u201d \u201cI can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me.\u201d \u201cOh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.\u201d Darcy mentioned his letter. \u201cDid it,\u201d said he, \u201cdid it soon make you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?\u201d She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed."], "Who would agree that \u201ca single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife\u201d?": [" However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters. \u201cMy dear Mr. Bennet,\u201d said his lady to him one day, \u201chave you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?\u201d Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. \u201cBut it is,\u201d returned she; \u201cfor Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.\u201d Mr. Bennet made no answer. \u201cDo you not want to know who has taken it?\u201d cried his wife impatiently. \u201c_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.\u201d This was invitation enough. \u201cWhy, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.\u201d \u201cWhat is his name?\u201d \u201cBingley.\u201d \u201cIs he married or single?\u201d \u201cOh!", " Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\u201d \u201cHow so? How can it affect them?\u201d \u201cMy dear Mr. Bennet,\u201d replied his wife, \u201chow can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.\u201d \u201cIs that his design in settling here?\u201d \u201cDesign! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.\u201d \u201cI see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party.\u201d \u201cMy dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.\u201d \u201cIn such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\u201d \u201cBut, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.\u201d \u201cIt is more than I engage for, I assure you.\u201d \u201cBut consider your daughters.", " Chapter 26 Mrs. Gardiner\u2019s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on: \u201cYou are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against _him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.\u201d \u201cMy dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.\u201d \u201cYes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.\u201d \u201cWell, then, you need not be under any alarm.", " Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point, and had time to consider of it. Her reflections were in general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable; his society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it was the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation."], "What is the name of the estate where Mr. Bingley lives?": [" It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother\u2014very, very proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father\u2019s death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education.\u201d After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying: \u201cI am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you know Mr. Bingley?\u201d \u201cNot at all.\u201d \u201cHe is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr. Darcy is.\u201d \u201cProbably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses.", " They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother\u2019s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade. Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase. His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but, though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table\u2014nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.", " What could she mean by it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to decorum.\u201d \u201cIt shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,\u201d said Bingley. \u201cI am afraid, Mr. Darcy,\u201d observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, \u201cthat this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.\u201d \u201cNot at all,\u201d he replied; \u201cthey were brightened by the exercise.\u201d A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again: \u201cI have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.\u201d \u201cI think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton.\u201d \u201cYes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.\u201d \u201cThat is capital,\u201d added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.", " She complained bitterly of all this to her husband. \u201cIndeed, Mr. Bennet,\u201d said she, \u201cit is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _I_ should be forced to make way for _her_, and live to see her take her place in it!\u201d \u201cMy dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor.\u201d This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before. \u201cI cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was not for the entail, I should not mind it.\u201d \u201cWhat should not you mind?\u201d \u201cI should not mind anything at all.\u201d \u201cLet us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility.\u201d \u201cI never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one\u2019s own daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!"], "Mrs. Bennett is interested in making the acquaintance of Mr. Bingley in order to do what?": [" \u201cThey have both,\u201d said she, \u201cbeen deceived, I dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side.\u201d \u201cVery true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business? Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody.\u201d \u201cLaugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father\u2019s favourite in such a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it.", " With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he had the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist. \u201cI know little of the game at present,\u201d said he, \u201cbut I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation in life\u2014\u201d Mrs. Phillips was very glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason. Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there seemed danger of Lydia\u2019s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular.", " His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle Lord \u2014\u2014, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen them from her husband\u2019s room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding: \u201cI may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me.\u201d Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.", " She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.\u201d \u201cI know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man\u2014he is a great friend of Darcy\u2019s.\u201d \u201cOh! yes,\u201d said Elizabeth drily; \u201cMr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.\u201d \u201cCare of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.\u201d \u201cWhat is it you mean?\u201d \u201cIt is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady\u2019s family, it would be an unpleasant thing.\u201d \u201cYou may depend upon my not mentioning it.\u201d \u201cAnd remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley."], "Where do Mr. Bingley and Jane Bennett first meet?": [" My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month\u2019s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him.\u201d \u201cSo much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane correspond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling.\u201d \u201cShe will drop the acquaintance entirely.\u201d But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley\u2019s being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane\u2019s attractions.", " Mr. what\u2019s-his-name. That tall, proud man.\u201d \u201cGood gracious! Mr. Darcy!\u2014and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley\u2019s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him.\u201d Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr. Bingley\u2019s friend, without being heard by either of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs. Gardiner\u2019s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.", " When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news. Chapter 2 Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with: \u201cI hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.\u201d \u201cWe are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,\u201d said her mother resentfully, \u201csince we are not to visit.\u201d \u201cBut you forget, mamma,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cthat we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.\u201d \u201cI do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of her own.", " Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister\u2019s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy\u2019s regard.\u201d \u201cMr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\u201d \u201cNo; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\u201d \u201cThis account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am satisfied. But what does he say of the living?\u201d \u201cHe does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only.\u201d \u201cI have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley\u2019s sincerity,\u201d said Elizabeth warmly; \u201cbut you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only."], "What word does Mr. Darcy first use to describe Elizabeth Bennett?": [" _My_ father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips, appears to do so much credit to\u2014but he gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father\u2019s active superintendence, and when, immediately before my father\u2019s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of his affection to myself.\u201d \u201cHow strange!\u201d cried Elizabeth. \u201cHow abominable! I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest\u2014for dishonesty I must call it.\u201d \u201cIt _is_ wonderful,\u201d replied Wickham, \u201cfor almost all his actions may be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend.", " She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it. In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother\u2019s words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical. \u201cWhat is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear.\u201d \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing!\u201d Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.", " She was of great use and comfort to us all. And Lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters\u2019, if they should be of use to us.\u201d \u201cShe had better have stayed at home,\u201d cried Elizabeth; \u201cperhaps she _meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one\u2019s neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.\u201d She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter. \u201cHe meant I believe,\u201d replied Jane, \u201cto go to Epsom, the place where they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if anything could be made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham.", " The first part of Mrs. Gardiner\u2019s business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was done she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her girls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it. \u201cI do not blame Jane,\u201d she continued, \u201cfor Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins\u2019s wife by this time, had it not been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister."], "Who is Charlotte Lucas?": [" His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her deserving her mother\u2019s reproach prevented his feeling any regret. While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper, \u201cI am glad you are come, for there is such fun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.\u201d Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty, who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family. \u201cPray do, my dear Miss Lucas,\u201d she added in a melancholy tone, \u201cfor nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me.", " Mr. Bennet\u2019s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter! Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton. Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet\u2019s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away.", " The moment of her release from him was ecstasy. She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her: \u201cI dare say you will find him very agreeable.\u201d \u201cHeaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an evil.\u201d When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence.", " This was very amiable, but Charlotte\u2019s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins\u2019s addresses, by engaging them towards herself. Such was Miss Lucas\u2019s scheme; and appearances were so favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday."], "After her first meeting with Mr. Darcy, why does Elizabeth vow never to dance with him?": [" Mr. what\u2019s-his-name. That tall, proud man.\u201d \u201cGood gracious! Mr. Darcy!\u2014and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley\u2019s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him.\u201d Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern.

But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs. Gardiner\u2019s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.", " Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began: \u201cWhat a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished society.\u201d \u201cCertainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance.\u201d Sir William only smiled. \u201cYour friend performs delightfully,\u201d he continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; \u201cand I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.\u201d \u201cYou saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.\u201d \u201cYes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do you often dance at St. James\u2019s?\u201d \u201cNever, sir.\u201d \u201cDo you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?\u201d \u201cIt is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.\u201d \u201cYou have a house in town, I conclude?\u201d Mr. Darcy bowed.", " Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her neighbours\u2019 looks, their equal amazement in beholding it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time with:\u2014\u201cIt is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. _I_ talked about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples.\u201d He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said.", " \u201cCome, Darcy,\u201d said he, \u201cI must have you dance. I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better dance.\u201d \u201cI certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.\u201d \u201cI would not be so fastidious as you are,\u201d cried Mr. Bingley, \u201cfor a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty.\u201d \u201c_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,\u201d said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet. \u201cOh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable."], "Shortly after the Bennets become acquainted with the Bingleys, who goes to Meryton to visit Mrs. Bennet\u2019s sister, Mrs. Phillips?": [" Mr. Collins\u2019s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley\u2019s continued absence. Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood.", " As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister. Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Phillips\u2019s manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life. Chapter 16 As no objection was made to the young people\u2019s engagement with their aunt, and all Mr. Collins\u2019s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle\u2019s invitation, and was then in the house.", " From the further disadvantage of Lydia\u2019s society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going. Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet\u2019s being quite unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters\u2019 beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance. As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune.", " If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.\u201d But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and smiled and shook her head by turns. \u201cWell, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,\u201d (for Mrs. Phillips first brought her the news). \u201cWell, so much the better. Not that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen? But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it."], "When Jane accepts an invitation to visit the Bingleys, how does she travel?": [" She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine\u2019s behaviour was most friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins\u2019s picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest. Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys. Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been lost. \u201cMy aunt,\u201d she continued, \u201cis going to-morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.\u201d She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.", " Have you never happened to see her there?\u201d She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane, and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet. The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away. Chapter 31 Colonel Fitzwilliam\u2019s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither\u2014for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the gentlemen\u2019s arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening.", " As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister. Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Phillips\u2019s manners and politeness.

The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it\u2014of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth\u2019s warm commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment."], "Which room in Darcy\u2019s ancestral home is discussed during Elizabeth\u2019s first visit with Mr. Bingley, his sisters, and Mr. Darcy?": [" He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on. \u201cMr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief. \u201cThey met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. \u201cEverything being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy\u2019s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came home.", " Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister\u2019s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy\u2019s regard.\u201d \u201cMr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\u201d \u201cNo; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\u201d \u201cThis account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am satisfied. But what does he say of the living?\u201d \u201cHe does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only.\u201d \u201cI have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley\u2019s sincerity,\u201d said Elizabeth warmly; \u201cbut you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.", " It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother\u2014very, very proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father\u2019s death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education.\u201d After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying: \u201cI am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you know Mr. Bingley?\u201d \u201cNot at all.\u201d \u201cHe is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr. Darcy is.\u201d \u201cProbably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses.", " She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips\u2019s. Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy\u2014that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that _he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy\u2019s character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son."], "While visiting Jane at Netherfield, what event does 15 year-old Lydia Bennet ask Mr. Bingley to host?": [" They were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them. The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again. \u201cAs soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet, \u201cyou will wait on him of course.\u201d \u201cNo, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool\u2019s errand again.\u201d His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield. \u201c\u2019Tis an _etiquette_ I despise,\u201d said he. \u201cIf he wants our society, let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend _my_ hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again.\u201d \u201cWell, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him.", " \u201cWhat an excellent father you have, girls!\u201d said she, when the door was shut. \u201cI do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness; or me, either, for that matter. At our time of life it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new acquaintances every day; but for your sakes, we would do anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, I dare say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d said Lydia stoutly, \u201cI am not afraid; for though I _am_ the youngest, I\u2019m the tallest.\u201d The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr. Bennet\u2019s visit, and determining when they should ask him to dinner. Chapter 3 Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley. They attacked him in various ways\u2014with barefaced questions, ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he eluded the skill of them all, and they were at last obliged to accept the second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas.", " When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news. Chapter 2 Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with: \u201cI hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.\u201d \u201cWe are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,\u201d said her mother resentfully, \u201csince we are not to visit.\u201d \u201cBut you forget, mamma,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cthat we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.\u201d \u201cI do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces of her own.", " Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia\u2019s interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon. Chapter 15 Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity."], "What social blunder does Mrs. Bennet make when she visits Mr. Bingley\u2019s home with her younger daughters?": [" It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane\u2019s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life.", " She would not listen, therefore, to her daughter\u2019s proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley\u2019s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected. \u201cIndeed I have, sir,\u201d was her answer. \u201cShe is a great deal too ill to be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass a little longer on your kindness.\u201d \u201cRemoved!\u201d cried Bingley. \u201cIt must not be thought of. My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal.\u201d \u201cYou may depend upon it, Madam,\u201d said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, \u201cthat Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she remains with us.\u201d Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.", " Jane heard them with horror. \u201cA gamester!\u201d she cried. \u201cThis is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.\u201d Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law\u2019s entreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before. \u201cWhat, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?\u201d she cried. \u201cSure he will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?\u201d As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it.", " What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters must be very young?\u201d \u201cYes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much in company. But really, ma\u2019am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.\u201d \u201cUpon my word,\u201d said her ladyship, \u201cyou give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?\u201d \u201cWith three younger sisters grown up,\u201d replied Elizabeth, smiling, \u201cyour ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.\u201d Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence."], "During his visit with the Bingleys at Netherfield, who does Mr. Darcy write to in the evenings?": [" Jane should therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his attention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses.\u201d \u201cYour plan is a good one,\u201d replied Elizabeth, \u201cwhere nothing is in question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But these are not Jane\u2019s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite enough to make her understand his character.\u201d \u201cNot as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent together\u2014and four evenings may do a great deal.\u201d \u201cYes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Charlotte, \u201cI wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth.", " \u201cHow delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!\u201d He made no answer. \u201cYou write uncommonly fast.\u201d \u201cYou are mistaken. I write rather slowly.\u201d \u201cHow many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!\u201d \u201cIt is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.\u201d \u201cPray tell your sister that I long to see her.\u201d \u201cI have already told her so once, by your desire.\u201d \u201cI am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend pens remarkably well.\u201d \u201cThank you\u2014but I always mend my own.\u201d \u201cHow can you contrive to write so even?\u201d He was silent. \u201cTell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp; and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley\u2019s.\u201d \u201cWill you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again?", " At present I have not room to do them justice.\u201d \u201cOh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?\u201d \u201cThey are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me to determine.\u201d \u201cIt is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with ease, cannot write ill.\u201d \u201cThat will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,\u201d cried her brother, \u201cbecause he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?\u201d \u201cMy style of writing is very different from yours.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d cried Miss Bingley, \u201cCharles writes in the most careless way imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.\u201d \u201cMy ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them\u2014by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.\u201d \u201cYour humility, Mr. Bingley,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cmust disarm reproof.\u201d \u201cNothing is more deceitful,\u201d said Darcy, \u201cthan the appearance of humility.", " There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on. Yours, etc., \u201cEDW.

Consider how important every moment is in such a case.\u201d \u201cLet me write for you,\u201d said Jane, \u201cif you dislike the trouble yourself.\u201d \u201cI dislike it very much,\u201d he replied; \u201cbut it must be done.\u201d And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house."], "What instrument does Miss Bingley play for her guests?": [" She asked her, at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother\u2019s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then observed, \u201cYour father\u2019s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For your sake,\u201d turning to Charlotte, \u201cI am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh\u2019s family. Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?\u201d \u201cA little.\u201d \u201cOh! then\u2014some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to\u2014\u2014You shall try it some day. Do your sisters play and sing?\u201d \u201cOne of them does.\u201d \u201cWhy did not you all learn?", " \u201cI am very glad to hear such a good account of her,\u201d said Lady Catherine; \u201cand pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practice a good deal.\u201d \u201cI assure you, madam,\u201d he replied, \u201cthat she does not need such advice. She practises very constantly.\u201d \u201cSo much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson\u2019s room. She would be in nobody\u2019s way, you know, in that part of the house.\u201d Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt\u2019s ill-breeding, and made no answer.", " When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer\u2019s countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said: \u201cYou mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me? I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well. There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me.\u201d \u201cI shall not say you are mistaken,\u201d he replied, \u201cbecause you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own.\u201d Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam, \u201cYour cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say.", " I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done.\u201d \u201cMy fingers,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cdo not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women\u2019s do. They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault\u2014because I will not take the trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other woman\u2019s of superior execution.\u201d Darcy smiled and said, \u201cYou are perfectly right. You have employed your time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.\u201d Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again. Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy: \u201cMiss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a London master."], "Why is Darcy glad to see Jane and Elizabeth return home after Jane has recovered from her illness?": [" \u201cI did not think Caroline in spirits,\u201d were her words, \u201cbut she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached her. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall see them soon here.\u201d Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister\u2019s being in town. Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley\u2019s inattention. After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer.", " Jane heard them with horror. \u201cA gamester!\u201d she cried. \u201cThis is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.\u201d Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law\u2019s entreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before. \u201cWhat, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?\u201d she cried. \u201cSure he will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?\u201d As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it.", " Chapter 9 Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister\u2019s room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast. Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield.", " Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved\u2014nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley\u2019s carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made. The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay, for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other. The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her\u2014that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right."], "When Mr. Bennet dies, who will inherit his estate?": [" Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I can assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place\u2014which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother\u2019s decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to.", " She complained bitterly of all this to her husband. \u201cIndeed, Mr. Bennet,\u201d said she, \u201cit is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _I_ should be forced to make way for _her_, and live to see her take her place in it!\u201d \u201cMy dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor.\u201d This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before. \u201cI cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was not for the entail, I should not mind it.\u201d \u201cWhat should not you mind?\u201d \u201cI should not mind anything at all.\u201d \u201cLet us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility.\u201d \u201cI never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one\u2019s own daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!", " After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained: \u201cAbout a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.\u201d \u201cOh! my dear,\u201d cried his wife, \u201cI cannot bear to hear that mentioned. Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it.\u201d Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. They had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.", " They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother\u2019s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade. Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase. His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but, though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table\u2014nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her."], "What is Mr. Collins\u2019 profession?": [" Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_.\u201d Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication. \u201cI have not the pleasure of understanding you,\u201d said he, when she had finished her speech. \u201cOf what are you talking?\u201d \u201cOf Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.\u201d \u201cAnd what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.\u201d \u201cSpeak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him.\u201d \u201cLet her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.\u201d Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library.", " _My_ father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Phillips, appears to do so much credit to\u2014but he gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father\u2019s active superintendence, and when, immediately before my father\u2019s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of his affection to myself.\u201d \u201cHow strange!\u201d cried Elizabeth. \u201cHow abominable! I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you! If from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest\u2014for dishonesty I must call it.\u201d \u201cIt _is_ wonderful,\u201d replied Wickham, \u201cfor almost all his actions may be traced to pride; and pride had often been his best friend.", " Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course. Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces. Lydia\u2019s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go.", " You have delighted us long enough. Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.\u201d Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father\u2019s speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to. \u201cIf I,\u201d said Mr. Collins, \u201cwere so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however, to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible."], "When he first arrives at the Bennet\u2019s house, which woman does Mr. Collins consider courting?": [" Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.

He took the hint, and soon began with, \u201cThis seems a very comfortable house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford.\u201d \u201cI believe she did\u2014and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object.\u201d \u201cMr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife.\u201d \u201cYes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding\u2014though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her.\u201d \u201cIt must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends.\u201d \u201cAn easy distance, do you call it?", " Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.

Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Phillips\u2019s manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life. Chapter 16 As no objection was made to the young people\u2019s engagement with their aunt, and all Mr. Collins\u2019s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle\u2019s invitation, and was then in the house."], "During their conversation at the Phillips\u2019 dinner party, Wickham tells Elizabeth that Darcy wronged him by ___?": [" She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class.\u201d Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham\u2019s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillips\u2019s supper party, but his manners recommended him to everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent.", " To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however. The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The officers of the \u2014\u2014shire were in general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room. Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.", " He does not want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and perhaps agreeable\u2014allowing something for fortune and figure.\u201d The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged that she would not make herself uneasy.", " She was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy\u2019s further notice; though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in it. The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart, and, by a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests."], "Who is Lady Catherine de Bourgh?": [" \u201cI know very well, madam,\u201d said he, \u201cthat when persons sit down to a card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters.\u201d Mr. Wickham\u2019s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh. \u201cLady Catherine de Bourgh,\u201d she replied, \u201chas very lately given him a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long.\u201d \u201cYou know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.\u201d \u201cNo, indeed, I did not.", " my dear,\u201d said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, \u201cit is not Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them; the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little creature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?\u201d \u201cShe is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind. Why does she not come in?\u201d \u201cOh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in.\u201d \u201cI like her appearance,\u201d said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. \u201cShe looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will make him a very proper wife.\u201d Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth\u2019s high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way.", " I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.\u201d \u201cYou are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!\u201d \u201cIndeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier. I believe him to be Lady Catherine\u2019s _nephew_. It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se\u2019nnight.\u201d Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance.", " He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh\u2014the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire."], "What explanation does Wickham\u2019s friend Denny give for Wickham\u2019s failure to attend the ball at Netherfield?": [" I am so grieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He _was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey.\u201d \u201cAnd was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?\u201d \u201cYes; but, when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything of their plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying\u2014and from _that_, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.\u201d \u201cAnd till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?\u201d \u201cHow was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt a little uneasy\u2014a little fearful of my sister\u2019s happiness with him in marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right.", " If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after\u2014the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia. Chapter 18 Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her.", " But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope to be in the future secured, when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them, which is due to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd. \u201cI had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him in love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas\u2019s accidental information, that Bingley\u2019s attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage.", " \u201cThere is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found. Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in \u2014\u2014 street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia."], "At the Netherfield ball, who does Miss Bingley warn Elizabeth not to trust?": [" If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once.

How much sooner one tires of anything than of a book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library.\u201d No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said: \u201cBy the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure.\u201d \u201cIf you mean Darcy,\u201d cried her brother, \u201che may go to bed, if he chooses, before it begins\u2014but as for the ball, it is quite a settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough, I shall send round my cards.\u201d \u201cI should like balls infinitely better,\u201d she replied, \u201cif they were carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting.", " Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield. Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attention of the officers, to whom her uncle\u2019s good dinners, and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it.", " Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane\u2019s pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife\u2019s views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a different story to hear. \u201cOh, my dear Mr. Bennet,\u201d as she entered the room, \u201cwe have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball."], "At the Netherfield ball, Mary Bennet embarrasses herself by ___?": [" Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way.

Mary\u2019s powers were by no means fitted for such a display; her voice was weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She looked at Jane, to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however, imperturbably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud, \u201cThat will do extremely well, child.", " If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after\u2014the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.

You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_.\u201d Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication. \u201cI have not the pleasure of understanding you,\u201d said he, when she had finished her speech. \u201cOf what are you talking?\u201d \u201cOf Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.\u201d \u201cAnd what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.\u201d \u201cSpeak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him.\u201d \u201cLet her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.\u201d Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library.", " \u201cAnd may I ask\u2014\u201d said Elizabeth; \u201cbut the terms, I suppose, must be complied with.\u201d \u201cComplied with! I am only ashamed of his asking so little.\u201d \u201cAnd they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!\u201d \u201cYes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever to pay him.\u201d \u201cMoney! My uncle!\u201d cried Jane, \u201cwhat do you mean, sir?\u201d \u201cI mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am gone.\u201d \u201cThat is very true,\u201d said Elizabeth; \u201cthough it had not occurred to me before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle\u2019s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said her father; \u201cWickham\u2019s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds.", " But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where they like.\u201d \u201cUnless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do.\u201d \u201cOur habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money.\u201d \u201cIs this,\u201d thought Elizabeth, \u201cmeant for me?\u201d and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, \u201cAnd pray, what is the usual price of an earl\u2019s younger son? Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.\u201d He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said: \u201cI imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having someone at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind.", " \u201cCome here, child,\u201d cried her father as she appeared. \u201cI have sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?\u201d Elizabeth replied that it was. \u201cVery well\u2014and this offer of marriage you have refused?\u201d \u201cI have, sir.\u201d \u201cVery well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?\u201d \u201cYes, or I will never see her again.\u201d \u201cAn unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you _do_.\u201d Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed. \u201cWhat do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way?"], "In Miss Bingley\u2019s letter informing Jane of the party\u2019s return to the city, who does she imply will be married shortly?": [" His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage. She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane\u2019s last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said: \u201cI did not know before that you ever walked this way.\u201d \u201cI have been making the tour of the park,\u201d he replied, \u201cas I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?\u201d \u201cNo, I should have turned in a moment.\u201d And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together.", " His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother. Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady\u2019s fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister\u2019s countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own room, Jane, taking out the letter, said: \u201cThis is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good deal.", " Have you heard from my uncle?\u201d \u201cYes I have had a letter from him by express.\u201d \u201cWell, and what news does it bring\u2014good or bad?\u201d \u201cWhat is there of good to be expected?\u201d said he, taking the letter from his pocket. \u201cBut perhaps you would like to read it.\u201d Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up. \u201cRead it aloud,\u201d said their father, \u201cfor I hardly know myself what it is about.\u201d \u201cGracechurch Street, _Monday, August_ 2. \u201cMy dear Brother, \u201cAt last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such as, upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were. The particulars I reserve till we meet; it is enough to know they are discovered. I have seen them both\u2014\u201d \u201cThen it is as I always hoped,\u201d cried Jane; \u201cthey are married!\u201d Elizabeth read on: \u201cI have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side, I hope it will not be long before they are.", " Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner\u2019s hope of Lydia\u2019s being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct. \u201cMy dear, dear Lydia!\u201d she cried. \u201cThis is delightful indeed! She will be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen! My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he would manage everything! How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself."], "Whose behavior is Elizabeth referring to when she complains that people lack \u201cmerit or sense\u201d?": [" Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she could believe possible. She was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughter\u2019s nuptials, than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took place. Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot. She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister\u2019s frailty would have mortified her so much\u2014not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them.", " To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming\u2014at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire. The colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes, as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure. \u201cLet me first see how he behaves,\u201d said she; \u201cit will then be early enough for expectation.\u201d She sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to lift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door.", " _I_ only want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte\u2019s marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is unaccountable!\u201d \u201cMy dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins\u2019s respectability, and Charlotte\u2019s steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for everybody\u2019s sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin.\u201d \u201cTo oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart.", " But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.\u201d \u201cIf we thought alike of Miss Bingley,\u201d replied Jane, \u201cyour representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself.\u201d \u201cThat is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived, by all means. You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.\u201d \u201cBut, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?\u201d \u201cYou must decide for yourself,\u201d said Elizabeth; \u201cand if, upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him.\u201d \u201cHow can you talk so?\u201d said Jane, faintly smiling."], "After it seems Jane has lost her chance with Bingley, where does Mr. Gardiner offer to take her?": [" But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think Charlotte so _very_ plain\u2014but then she is our particular friend.\u201d \u201cShe seems a very pleasant young woman.\u201d \u201cOh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane\u2019s beauty. I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane\u2014one does not often see anybody better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother Gardiner\u2019s in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away. But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.\u201d \u201cAnd so ended his affection,\u201d said Elizabeth impatiently.", " Mrs. Bennet\u2019s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read, \u201cWell, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.\u201d \u201cIt is from Miss Bingley,\u201d said Jane, and then read it aloud. \u201cMY DEAR FRIEND,\u2014 \u201cIf you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives, for a whole day\u2019s _t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate_ between two women can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.\u2014Yours ever, \u201cCAROLINE BINGLEY\u201d \u201cWith the officers!\u201d cried Lydia. \u201cI wonder my aunt did not tell us of _that_.\u201d \u201cDining out,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet, \u201cthat is very unlucky.\u201d \u201cCan I have the carriage?\u201d said Jane. \u201cNo, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to rain; and then you must stay all night.\u201d \u201cThat would be a good scheme,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cif you were sure that they would not offer to send her home.\u201d \u201cOh!", " What could she mean by it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to decorum.\u201d \u201cIt shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,\u201d said Bingley. \u201cI am afraid, Mr. Darcy,\u201d observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, \u201cthat this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.\u201d \u201cNot at all,\u201d he replied; \u201cthey were brightened by the exercise.\u201d A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again: \u201cI have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.\u201d \u201cI think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton.\u201d \u201cYes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.\u201d \u201cThat is capital,\u201d added her sister, and they both laughed heartily.", " The first part of Mrs. Gardiner\u2019s business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was done she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of. They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her girls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it. \u201cI do not blame Jane,\u201d she continued, \u201cfor Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins\u2019s wife by this time, had it not been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister."], "After observing her rapport with Wickham, which relative warns Elizabeth that he is not a suitable match for her?": [" It is nearly fifty miles.\u201d \u201cAnd what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day\u2019s journey. Yes, I call it a very easy distance.\u201d \u201cI should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_ of the match,\u201d cried Elizabeth. \u201cI should never have said Mrs. Collins was settled _near_ her family.\u201d \u201cIt is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.\u201d As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered: \u201cI do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the case _here_.", " And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And what do you think she said besides? \u2018Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last.\u2019 She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever lived\u2014and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.\u201d Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley\u2019s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals. \u201cIt has been a very agreeable day,\u201d said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. \u201cThe party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we may often meet again.\u201d Elizabeth smiled.", " On the contrary, every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At present I will say nothing about it.\u201d \u201cYou are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to re-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.\u201d The tumult of Elizabeth\u2019s mind was allayed by this conversation. She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she might wish to talk again of either.", " As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister. Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Phillips\u2019s manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life. Chapter 16 As no objection was made to the young people\u2019s engagement with their aunt, and all Mr. Collins\u2019s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle\u2019s invitation, and was then in the house."], "What promise does Elizabeth make to Charlotte?": [" \u201cAnd will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?\u201d \u201cI will make no promise of the kind.\u201d \u201cMiss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the assurance I require.\u201d \u201cAnd I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make _their_ marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to me, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.", " Promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford.\u201d Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit. \u201cMy father and Maria are coming to me in March,\u201d added Charlotte, \u201cand I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome as either of them.\u201d The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte\u2019s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen.", " She would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy\u2019s sister, as by Wickham\u2019s account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away. Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in Charlotte\u2019s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.", " my dear,\u201d said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, \u201cit is not Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them; the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little creature. Who would have thought that she could be so thin and small?\u201d \u201cShe is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind. Why does she not come in?\u201d \u201cOh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in.\u201d \u201cI like her appearance,\u201d said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. \u201cShe looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will make him a very proper wife.\u201d Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth\u2019s high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way."], "When Wickham shifts his attentions to Miss King, Elizabeth assumes it\u2019s because ___?": [" Lydia laughed, and said: \u201cAye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not? There is no danger of Wickham\u2019s marrying Mary King. There\u2019s for you! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe.\u201d \u201cAnd Mary King is safe!\u201d added Elizabeth; \u201csafe from a connection imprudent as to fortune.\u201d \u201cShe is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.\u201d \u201cBut I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,\u201d said Jane. \u201cI am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never cared three straws about her\u2014who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled thing?\u201d Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal!", " Where does discretion end, and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary.\u201d \u201cIf you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what to think.\u201d \u201cShe is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.\u201d \u201cBut he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather\u2019s death made her mistress of this fortune.\u201d \u201cNo\u2014why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_ affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?\u201d \u201cBut there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event.\u201d \u201cA man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe.", " How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything. His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive; he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair; that proud and repulsive as were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their acquaintance\u2014an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways\u2014seen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust\u2014anything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits; that among his own connections he was esteemed and valued\u2014that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling; that had his actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.", " She would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions.

Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.\u201d Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father\u2019s speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to. \u201cIf I,\u201d said Mr. Collins, \u201cwere so fortunate as to be able to sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however, to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible.", " Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty. The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins\u2019s reach. This, however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors.", " Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will not have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have _her_.\u201d Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication. \u201cI have not the pleasure of understanding you,\u201d said he, when she had finished her speech. \u201cOf what are you talking?\u201d \u201cOf Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.\u201d \u201cAnd what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.\u201d \u201cSpeak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him.\u201d \u201cLet her be called down.

But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for compassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry, and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms. At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown.

But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more difficult to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice\u2014a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel Fitzwilliam\u2019s occasionally laughing at his stupidity, proved that he was generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told her; and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect of love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself seriously to work to find it out.", " Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.\u201d \u201cI had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party.\u201d \u201cTrue; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next?

It is because he will not give himself the trouble.\u201d \u201cI certainly have not the talent which some people possess,\u201d said Darcy, \u201cof conversing easily with those I have never seen before.", " For the last week they had seen very little of Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen only at church. The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine\u2019s drawing-room. Her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins\u2019s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy.", " Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire\u2014paid his compliments, with his usual reserve, to Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his feelings toward her friend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word. Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but his cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody. At length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual way, and after a moment\u2019s pause, added: \u201cMy eldest sister has been in town these three months."], "Why does Elizabeth reject Darcy\u2019s first proposal of marriage?": [" But now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia\u2019s marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation. \u201cGood gracious!\u201d cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next morning, \u201cif that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him? Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley\u2019s way.\u201d Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet. As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, \u201cMrs.", " I wish you very happy and very rich, and by refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise. In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be considered, therefore, as finally settled.\u201d And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had Mr. Collins not thus addressed her: \u201cWhen I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character.\u201d \u201cReally, Mr. Collins,\u201d cried Elizabeth with some warmth, \u201cyou puzzle me exceedingly.", " He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on. \u201cMr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief. \u201cThey met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. \u201cEverything being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy\u2019s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came home.", " On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.\u201d It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now. \u201cYou are too hasty, sir,\u201d she cried. \u201cYou forget that I have made no answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them.\u201d \u201cI am not now to learn,\u201d replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the hand, \u201cthat it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.\u201d \u201cUpon my word, sir,\u201d cried Elizabeth, \u201cyour hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration."], "In Darcy\u2019s letter to Elizabeth after she rejects him, who is it revealed that Wickham once tried to elope with?": [" His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother. Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady\u2019s fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister\u2019s countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own room, Jane, taking out the letter, said: \u201cThis is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good deal.", " \u201cAnd then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over.\u201d \u201cI thank you for my share of the favour,\u201d said Elizabeth; \u201cbut I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands.\u201d Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight. No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not. Wickham\u2019s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia\u2019s for him. She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion.", " Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy\u2019s meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley\u2019s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend. Elizabeth\u2019s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.", " After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained: \u201cAbout a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.\u201d \u201cOh! my dear,\u201d cried his wife, \u201cI cannot bear to hear that mentioned. Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it.\u201d Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. They had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about."], "When Elizabeth and Jane meet Lydia and Kitty on their way home from London, the younger girls are obsessed with ___?": [" Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs. Forster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.\u201d With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia, assisted by Kitty\u2019s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham\u2019s name. Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth: \u201cI am glad you are come back, Lizzy.\u201d Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person\u2019s, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her.", " Jane heard them with horror. \u201cA gamester!\u201d she cried. \u201cThis is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.\u201d Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law\u2019s entreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before. \u201cWhat, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?\u201d she cried. \u201cSure he will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?\u201d As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it.", " It will pass away soon enough.\u201d \u201cDo you suppose them to be in London?\u201d \u201cYes; where else can they be so well concealed?\u201d \u201cAnd Lydia used to want to go to London,\u201d added Kitty. \u201cShe is happy then,\u201d said her father drily; \u201cand her residence there will probably be of some duration.\u201d Then after a short silence he continued: \u201cLizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.\u201d They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother\u2019s tea. \u201cThis is a parade,\u201d he cried, \u201cwhich does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away.\u201d \u201cI am not going to run away, papa,\u201d said Kitty fretfully. \u201cIf _I_ should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.\u201d \u201c_You_ go to Brighton.", " Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?\u201d \u201cI advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet, \u201cto walk to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view.\u201d \u201cIt may do very well for the others,\u201d replied Mr. Bingley; \u201cbut I am sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won\u2019t it, Kitty?\u201d Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying: \u201cI am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is all for Jane\u2019s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to inconvenience.\u201d During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet\u2019s consent should be asked in the course of the evening."], "Where do Lydia and Kitty hope to convince their parents to spend the summer?": [" Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the \u2014\u2014shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight.\u201d \u201cAre they indeed!\u201d cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction. \u201cThey are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d thought Elizabeth, \u201c_that_ would be a delightful scheme indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!\u201d \u201cNow I have got some news for you,\u201d said Lydia, as they sat down at table. \u201cWhat do you think? It is excellent news\u2014capital news\u2014and about a certain person we all like!\u201d Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need not stay.", " After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton. The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent.", " They were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them. The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again. \u201cAs soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet, \u201cyou will wait on him of course.\u201d \u201cNo, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool\u2019s errand again.\u201d His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield. \u201c\u2019Tis an _etiquette_ I despise,\u201d said he. \u201cIf he wants our society, let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend _my_ hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again.\u201d \u201cWell, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him.", " Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?\u201d \u201cI advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet, \u201cto walk to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view.\u201d \u201cIt may do very well for the others,\u201d replied Mr. Bingley; \u201cbut I am sure it will be too much for Kitty.

So, do not put yourself to inconvenience.\u201d During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet\u2019s consent should be asked in the course of the evening."], "Which Bennet daughter is invited to Brighton by the wife of Colonel Forster?": [" I thought I should have broken my heart.\u201d \u201cI am sure I shall break _mine_,\u201d said Lydia. \u201cIf one could but go to Brighton!\u201d observed Mrs. Bennet. \u201cOh, yes!\u2014if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable.\u201d \u201cA little sea-bathing would set me up forever.\u201d \u201cAnd my aunt Phillips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,\u201d added Kitty. Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy\u2019s objections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend. But the gloom of Lydia\u2019s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married.", " She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord! how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would _chaperon_ you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster\u2019s. Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman\u2019s clothes on purpose to pass for a lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least.", " And as to my father, I never in my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not; but circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What he means to do I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening.", " Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia\u2019s short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B. intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but no further; for on entering that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I know not what to think. After making every possible inquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success\u2014no such people had been seen to pass through."], "Mr. Darcy\u2019s home, where Elizabeth tours with the Gardiners, is known as ___?": [" Miss Bennet accepted her aunt\u2019s invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as she hoped by Caroline\u2019s not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him. The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it\u2014of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth\u2019s warm commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.", " But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner\u2019s curiosity; it was not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify inquiry. Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant\u2019s report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected.", " The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One enjoyment was certain\u2014that of suitableness of companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences\u2014cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure\u2014and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad. It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner\u2019s former residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated.", " Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister\u2019s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy\u2019s regard.\u201d \u201cMr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\u201d \u201cNo; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\u201d \u201cThis account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am satisfied. But what does he say of the living?\u201d \u201cHe does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only.\u201d \u201cI have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley\u2019s sincerity,\u201d said Elizabeth warmly; \u201cbut you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only."], "What does Elizabeth daydream about during her tour of Darcy\u2019s estate with the Gardiners?": [" After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained: \u201cAbout a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.\u201d \u201cOh! my dear,\u201d cried his wife, \u201cI cannot bear to hear that mentioned. Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it.\u201d Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. They had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.", " She complained bitterly of all this to her husband. \u201cIndeed, Mr. Bennet,\u201d said she, \u201cit is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _I_ should be forced to make way for _her_, and live to see her take her place in it!\u201d \u201cMy dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor.\u201d This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before. \u201cI cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was not for the entail, I should not mind it.\u201d \u201cWhat should not you mind?\u201d \u201cI should not mind anything at all.\u201d \u201cLet us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility.\u201d \u201cI never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one\u2019s own daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!", " They were of a respectable family in the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brother\u2019s fortune and their own had been acquired by trade. Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase. His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but, though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table\u2014nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her.", " \u201cIt must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year.\u201d \u201cUndoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had.\u201d \u201cYes; he introduced us to his sister.\u201d \u201cAnd do you like her?\u201d \u201cVery much.\u201d \u201cI have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad you liked her. I hope she will turn out well.\u201d \u201cI dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.\u201d \u201cDid you go by the village of Kympton?\u201d \u201cI do not recollect that we did.\u201d \u201cI mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A most delightful place!\u2014Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited me in every respect.\u201d \u201cHow should you have liked making sermons?\u201d \u201cExceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing."], "During her tour of Darcy\u2019s home, Elizabeth is interested to hear the housekeeper describe Darcy as ___?": [" \u201cThey have both,\u201d said she, \u201cbeen deceived, I dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side.\u201d \u201cVery true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business? Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody.\u201d \u201cLaugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father\u2019s favourite in such a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it.", " She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it. In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother\u2019s words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical. \u201cWhat is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear.\u201d \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing!\u201d Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone.", " Its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something! They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her being where she was. The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much less fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They followed her into the dining-parlour.", " \u201cWe have not determined how far it shall carry us,\u201d said Mrs. Gardiner, \u201cbut, perhaps, to the Lakes.\u201d No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. \u201cOh, my dear, dear aunt,\u201d she rapturously cried, \u201cwhat delight! what felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What are young men to rocks and mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We _will_ know where we have gone\u2014we _will_ recollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let _our_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers.\u201d Chapter 28 Every object in the next day\u2019s journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight."], "Where does Elizabeth first meet Georgiana?": [" Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley\u2019s good humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to _talk_ of giving them a hint to be gone. Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy\u2019s marriage; but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she dropt all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth. Pemberley was now Georgiana\u2019s home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each other even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother.", " Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth\u2019s person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother\u2019s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not err. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister. \u201cHow very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,\u201d she cried; \u201cI never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again.\u201d However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.", " Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy\u2019s meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley\u2019s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend. Elizabeth\u2019s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.", " Many of my acquaintances are already there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd\u2014but of that I despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you.\u201d \u201cIt is evident by this,\u201d added Jane, \u201cthat he comes back no more this winter.\u201d \u201cIt is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he _should_.\u201d \u201cWhy will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own master. But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_.\u201d \u201cMr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister."], "Miss Bingley makes a spiteful remark to Elizabeth about \u201ca great loss to your family.\u201d What is she referring to?": [" My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to do.\u201d Mr. Wickham\u2019s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife\u2019s. He smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things. \u201cHe is as fine a fellow,\u201d said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of the house, \u201cas ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.\u201d The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days. \u201cI often think,\u201d said she, \u201cthat there is nothing so bad as parting with one\u2019s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.\u201d \u201cThis is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,\u201d said Elizabeth. \u201cIt must make you better satisfied that your other four are single.\u201d \u201cIt is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married, but only because her husband\u2019s regiment happens to be so far off.", " I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.\u201d \u201cAre you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this?\u201d \u201c_I_ never saw such a woman. _I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe united.\u201d Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room. \u201cElizabeth Bennet,\u201d said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, \u201cis one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.\u201d \u201cUndoubtedly,\u201d replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, \u201cthere is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation.", " She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.\u201d \u201cI know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man\u2014he is a great friend of Darcy\u2019s.\u201d \u201cOh! yes,\u201d said Elizabeth drily; \u201cMr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.\u201d \u201cCare of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.\u201d \u201cWhat is it you mean?\u201d \u201cIt is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady\u2019s family, it would be an unpleasant thing.\u201d \u201cYou may depend upon my not mentioning it.\u201d \u201cAnd remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley.", " They must be a great loss to _your_ family.\u201d In Darcy\u2019s presence she dared not mention Wickham\u2019s name; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment\u2019s distress; but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone. While she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy\u2019s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps."], "Why does Elizabeth avoid discussing Wickham with Miss Bingley?": [" But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley.\u201d Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing further to wish. \u201cNow I am quite happy,\u201d said she, \u201cfor you will be as happy as myself. I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley\u2019s friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it to another, not to you.\u201d Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend.", " I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite\u2019s guilt; but really, considering his descent, one could not expect much better.\u201d \u201cHis guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,\u201d said Elizabeth angrily; \u201cfor I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy\u2019s steward, and of _that_, I can assure you, he informed me himself.\u201d \u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.", " She would not listen, therefore, to her daughter\u2019s proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley\u2019s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected. \u201cIndeed I have, sir,\u201d was her answer. \u201cShe is a great deal too ill to be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass a little longer on your kindness.\u201d \u201cRemoved!\u201d cried Bingley. \u201cIt must not be thought of. My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal.\u201d \u201cYou may depend upon it, Madam,\u201d said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, \u201cthat Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she remains with us.\u201d Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.", " Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy\u2019s meditated elopement.

Very odd! And you only the second. The younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters must be very young?\u201d \u201cYes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much in company. But really, ma\u2019am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early. The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.\u201d \u201cUpon my word,\u201d said her ladyship, \u201cyou give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?\u201d \u201cWith three younger sisters grown up,\u201d replied Elizabeth, smiling, \u201cyour ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.\u201d Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.", " At present I have not room to do them justice.\u201d \u201cOh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?\u201d \u201cThey are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me to determine.\u201d \u201cIt is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with ease, cannot write ill.\u201d \u201cThat will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,\u201d cried her brother, \u201cbecause he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?\u201d \u201cMy style of writing is very different from yours.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d cried Miss Bingley, \u201cCharles writes in the most careless way imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.\u201d \u201cMy ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them\u2014by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.\u201d \u201cYour humility, Mr. Bingley,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cmust disarm reproof.\u201d \u201cNothing is more deceitful,\u201d said Darcy, \u201cthan the appearance of humility.", " I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I acted. Regard for my sister\u2019s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham\u2019s chief object was unquestionably my sister\u2019s fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have been complete indeed. \u201cThis, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham.", " How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs, I cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject.\u201d \u201cNot so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister\u2019s infamous elopement. I know it all; that the young man\u2019s marrying her was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is _such_ a girl to be my nephew\u2019s sister? Is _her_ husband, who is the son of his late father\u2019s steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!\u2014of what are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?\u201d \u201cYou can _now_ have nothing further to say,\u201d she resentfully answered. \u201cYou have insulted me in every possible method. I must beg to return to the house.\u201d And she rose as she spoke."], "Who does Elizabeth immediately confide in about the scandal of Lydia\u2019s elopement?": [" Surprise was the least of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise\u2014all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey. She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion.", " He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he had seen and talked with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham\u2019s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us.", " \u201cAnd then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over.\u201d \u201cI thank you for my share of the favour,\u201d said Elizabeth; \u201cbut I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands.\u201d Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight. No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not. Wickham\u2019s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia\u2019s for him. She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion.", " Mary, however, continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them. In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making any inquiries, which Jane was equally eager to satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued the subject, by saying, \u201cBut tell me all and everything about it which I have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place? They must have seen them together for ever.\u201d \u201cColonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydia\u2019s side, but nothing to give him any alarm."], "What is the Bennet family\u2019s greatest worry after Lydia disappears?": [" As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia\u2019s general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said: \u201cLydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances.\u201d \u201cIf you were aware,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cof the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia\u2019s unguarded and imprudent manner\u2014nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair.\u201d \u201cAlready arisen?\u201d repeated Mr. Bennet.", " Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs. Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydia\u2019s interruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would resume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any affront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon. Chapter 15 Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he had merely kept the necessary terms, without forming at it any useful acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity.", " GARDINER.\u201d Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham\u2019s removal from the \u2014\u2014shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia\u2019s being settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody, and had so many favourites. \u201cShe is so fond of Mrs. Forster,\u201d said she, \u201cit will be quite shocking to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General \u2014\u2014\u2019s regiment.\u201d His daughter\u2019s request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the North, received at first an absolute negative.", " A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their _three_ months\u2019 acquaintance they had been intimate _two_. The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister\u2019s feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone\u2019s congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish. \u201cI cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,\u201d said she, \u201cThough I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.\u201d In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned."], "While Mr. Bennet searches for Lydia and Wickham in London, the Bennets receive a rude letter from ___?": [" Jane heard them with horror. \u201cA gamester!\u201d she cried. \u201cThis is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.\u201d Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law\u2019s entreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before. \u201cWhat, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?\u201d she cried. \u201cSure he will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?\u201d As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it.", " Chapter 51 Their sister\u2019s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet them at \u2014\u2014, and they were to return in it by dinner-time. Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_ been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure. They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy. Lydia\u2019s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness.", " Pray write instantly, and let me understand it\u2014unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance.\u201d \u201cNot that I _shall_, though,\u201d she added to herself, as she finished the letter; \u201cand my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out.\u201d Jane\u2019s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it;\u2014till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante. Chapter 52 Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could. She was no sooner in possession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be interrupted, she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial.", " \u201cThere is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found. Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in \u2014\u2014 street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia."], "What is given as the most likely reason for Wickham agreeing to marry Lydia?": [" They may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.\u201d \u201cBut why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their marriage be private? Oh, no, no\u2014this is not likely. His most particular friend, you see by Jane\u2019s account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia\u2014what attraction has she beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce.", " Surprise was the least of her feelings on this development.

My uncle!\u201d cried Jane, \u201cwhat do you mean, sir?\u201d \u201cI mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am gone.\u201d \u201cThat is very true,\u201d said Elizabeth; \u201cthough it had not occurred to me before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle\u2019s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said her father; \u201cWickham\u2019s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds.", " I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.\u201d \u201cTen thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be repaid?\u201d Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house. Their father then went on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room. \u201cAnd they are really to be married!\u201d cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves. \u201cHow strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!\u201d \u201cI comfort myself with thinking,\u201d replied Jane, \u201cthat he certainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced."], "Who is Elizabeth surprised to learn was present at Lydia\u2019s wedding?": [" My dear Charlotte\u2014impossible!\u201d The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied: \u201cWhy should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman\u2019s good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?\u201d But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness. \u201cI see what you are feeling,\u201d replied Charlotte. \u201cYou must be surprised, very much surprised\u2014so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done.", " The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner\u2019s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters\u2019, and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the headquarters. Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence.", " Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys\u2014and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance.\u201d Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, \u201c_You_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have been always at Longbourn.\u201d Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice: \u201cAre you pleased with Kent?\u201d A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise\u2014and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her walk. The _t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate_ surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away.", " Lydia came to us; and Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was exactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour while she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane\u2019s letter last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner, representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her. \u201cMr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday."], "Who supplied the money to facilitate Wickham\u2019s marriage to Lydia?": [" Surprise was the least of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise\u2014all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey. She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion.", " With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he had the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist. \u201cI know little of the game at present,\u201d said he, \u201cbut I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation in life\u2014\u201d Mrs. Phillips was very glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason. Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there seemed danger of Lydia\u2019s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular.", " They may be there, though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional purpose. It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London than in Scotland.\u201d \u201cBut why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their marriage be private? Oh, no, no\u2014this is not likely. His most particular friend, you see by Jane\u2019s account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia\u2014what attraction has she beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce.", " Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!\u201d Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr. Gardiner\u2019s behaviour laid them all under. \u201cFor we must attribute this happy conclusion,\u201d she added, \u201cin a great measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d cried her mother, \u201cit is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy! In a short time I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well it sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter, that I am sure I can\u2019t write; so I will dictate, and you write for me."], "Having nearly destroyed her family\u2019s respectability by eloping with Wickham, Lydia\u2019s attitude upon her return is best described as ___?": [" A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their _three_ months\u2019 acquaintance they had been intimate _two_. The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister\u2019s feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone\u2019s congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish. \u201cI cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,\u201d said she, \u201cThough I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.\u201d In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned.", " Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her. But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give.", " If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth\u2019s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if otherwise\u2014if regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object, and even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham, and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia\u2019s infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business. Never, since reading Jane\u2019s second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham\u2019s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation.", " \u201cMr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridge\u2014most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman\u2019s education. My father was not only fond of this young man\u2019s society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities\u2014the want of principle, which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have."], "When the news arrives that Bingley will return to Netherfield Park, Mr. Bennet embarrasses the family by ___?": [" If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.\u201d But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and smiled and shook her head by turns. \u201cWell, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,\u201d (for Mrs. Phillips first brought her the news). \u201cWell, so much the better. Not that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen? But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it.", " However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters. \u201cMy dear Mr. Bennet,\u201d said his lady to him one day, \u201chave you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?\u201d Mr. Bennet replied that he had not. \u201cBut it is,\u201d returned she; \u201cfor Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.\u201d Mr. Bennet made no answer. \u201cDo you not want to know who has taken it?\u201d cried his wife impatiently. \u201c_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.\u201d This was invitation enough. \u201cWhy, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.\u201d \u201cWhat is his name?\u201d \u201cBingley.\u201d \u201cIs he married or single?\u201d \u201cOh!", " Darcy said nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of \u201cLord, how tired I am!\u201d accompanied by a violent yawn. When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time.", " She continued in very agitated reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine\u2019s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlotte\u2019s observation, and hurried her away to her room. Chapter 35 Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was impossible to think of anything else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved, soon after breakfast, to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy\u2019s sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park, she turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground. After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and look into the park."], "After their engagement, Jane learns that Bingley never visited her in London because ___?": [" Lady Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley, and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), had only set _that_ down as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked forward to as possible at some future time.", " Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers\u2019 names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Phillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley\u2019s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign. After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr. Bennet coolly observed: \u201cFrom all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced.\u201d Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the next morning to London.", " She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther. After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home. \u201cWhat could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!\u201d was a wonder which introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs. Darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it. \u201cI must ask whether you were surprised?\u201d said Elizabeth. \u201cNot at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.\u201d \u201cThat is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.\u201d And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the case. \u201cOn the evening before my going to London,\u201d said he, \u201cI made a confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent.", " Even Elizabeth began to fear\u2014not that Bingley was indifferent\u2014but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane\u2019s happiness, and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its frequently occurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London might be too much, she feared, for the strength of his attachment. As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more painful than Elizabeth\u2019s, but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back she would think herself very ill used."], "Why does Lady Catherine de Bourgh come to visit the Bennet household?": [" \u201cI know very well, madam,\u201d said he, \u201cthat when persons sit down to a card-table, they must take their chances of these things, and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object.

But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh\u2014the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time.

I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.\u2019 Mr. Collins moreover adds, \u2018I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia\u2019s sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known.", " Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?\u201d \u201cI advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet, \u201cto walk to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view.\u201d \u201cIt may do very well for the others,\u201d replied Mr. Bingley; \u201cbut I am sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won\u2019t it, Kitty?\u201d Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying: \u201cI am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is all for Jane\u2019s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to inconvenience.\u201d During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet\u2019s consent should be asked in the course of the evening.", " Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she \u201c_wished_ they might be happy.\u201d Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother\u2019s ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room. As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said: \u201cI shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.\u201d \u201c_That_ you certainly shall.\u201d \u201cAnd I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?\u201d \u201cWe shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.\u201d \u201cI am not likely to leave Kent for some time.", " Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins\u2019s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St. James\u2019s. The whole family, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlotte\u2019s dying an old maid."], "Where do Jane and Bingley settle after their wedding?": [" We will settle with your father about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.\u201d She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted. One day\u2019s delay, she observed, would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head. \u201cI will go to Meryton,\u201d said she, \u201cas soon as I am dressed, and tell the good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage. An airing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you heard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding.\u201d Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy.", " to put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?\u201d \u201cYes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?\u201d \u201cMost willingly.\u201d \u201cYou shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you.\u201d Jane shook her head. \u201cIndeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot. She is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way.", " If he had been wavering before as to what he should do, which had often seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way. \u201cIf, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days,\u201d she added, \u201cI shall know how to understand it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him at all.\u201d The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet\u2019s curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.", " Lady Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley, and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), had only set _that_ down as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked forward to as possible at some future time."]}
