Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\u201d \u201cHow so? How can it affect them?\u201d \u201cMy dear Mr. Bennet,\u201d replied his wife, \u201chow can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.\u201d \u201cIs that his design in settling here?\u201d \u201cDesign! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.\u201d \u201cI see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party.\u201d \u201cMy dear, you flatter me.", " Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against _him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.\u201d \u201cMy dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.\u201d \u201cYes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.\u201d \u201cWell, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it.\u201d \u201cElizabeth, you are not serious now.\u201d \u201cI beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw\u2014and if he becomes really attached to me\u2014I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence of it. Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father\u2019s opinion of me does me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist?", " She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything else, awakened a suspicion of the truth. The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent. Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away. At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet\u2019s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here. \u201cYou are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!\u2014engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no, you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.\u201d \u201cThis is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are engaged.\u201d Jane looked at her doubtingly. \u201cOh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much you dislike him.\u201d \u201cYou know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now.", " She was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I acted. Regard for my sister\u2019s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham\u2019s chief object was unquestionably my sister\u2019s fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have been complete indeed. \u201cThis, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he had imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at. Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination. \u201cYou may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed."], "The Bennet familylives in the village of": [" Elizabeth felt Jane\u2019s pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough never to be without partners, which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a book he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that his wife\u2019s views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found out that he had a different story to hear. \u201cOh, my dear Mr. Bennet,\u201d as she entered the room, \u201cwe have had a most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with her twice! Only think of _that_, my dear; he actually danced with her twice! and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand up with her! But, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance.", " \u201cShe is happy then,\u201d said her father drily; \u201cand her residence there will probably be of some duration.\u201d Then after a short silence he continued: \u201cLizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which, considering the event, shows some greatness of mind.\u201d They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her mother\u2019s tea. \u201cThis is a parade,\u201d he cried, \u201cwhich does one good; it gives such an elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty runs away.\u201d \u201cI am not going to run away, papa,\u201d said Kitty fretfully. \u201cIf _I_ should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia.\u201d \u201c_You_ go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as Eastbourne for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it. No officer is ever to enter into my house again, nor even to pass through the village. Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up with one of your sisters. And you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner.\u201d Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to cry. \u201cWell, well,\u201d said he, \u201cdo not make yourself unhappy. If you are a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review at the end of them.\u201d Chapter 49 Two days after Mr. Bennet\u2019s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, \u201cI beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean, Hill?", " \u201cI almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me. But of course she did not mention my name to you.\u201d \u201cYes, she did.\u201d \u201cAnd what did she say?\u201d \u201cThat you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had\u2014not turned out well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely misrepresented.\u201d \u201cCertainly,\u201d he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said: \u201cI was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.\u201d \u201cPerhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,\u201d said Elizabeth. \u201cIt must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year.\u201d \u201cUndoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had.\u201d \u201cYes; he introduced us to his sister.\u201d \u201cAnd do you like her?\u201d \u201cVery much.\u201d \u201cI have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad you liked her. I hope she will turn out well.\u201d \u201cI dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.\u201d \u201cDid you go by the village of Kympton?\u201d \u201cI do not recollect that we did.\u201d \u201cI mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had.", " She has a very good notion of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne\u2019s. Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.\u201d Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin\u2019s praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation. Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth\u2019s performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship\u2019s carriage was ready to take them all home. Chapter 32 Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village, when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension was putting away her half-finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and, to her very great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room. He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies were to be within."], "Mr. Bingley, whenhe attends the ball in Meryton, seems to be quite taken with": [" The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday.

To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet\u2019s civilities. The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy\u2019s look and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was, at any rate, a ball.", " Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attention of the officers, to whom her uncle\u2019s good dinners, and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother\u2019s ear: \u201cI am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.\u201d Lydia declared herself satisfied. \u201cOh! yes\u2014it would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again.

Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire\u2014and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too\u2014for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.\u201d \u201cI am not afraid of you,\u201d said he, smilingly. \u201cPray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,\u201d cried Colonel Fitzwilliam. \u201cI should like to know how he behaves among strangers.\u201d \u201cYou shall hear then\u2014but prepare yourself for something very dreadful.

Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends. This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself. \u201cWhat will be his surprise,\u201d thought she, \u201cwhen he knows who they are? He takes them now for people of fashion.\u201d The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it, and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the connection was evident; he sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence, his taste, or his good manners. The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport.", " Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure. Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield. Chapter 19 The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words: \u201cMay I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?\u201d Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs. Bennet answered instantly, \u201cOh dear!\u2014yes\u2014certainly. I am sure Lizzy will be very happy\u2014I am sure she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs.\u201d And, gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out: \u201cDear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go.", " Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her. When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in fact, nothing to do elsewhere. When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.", " As it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh. They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt. She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth\u2019s salutation than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship\u2019s entrance, though no request of introduction had been made. Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth, \u201cI hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your mother.\u201d Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was. \u201cAnd _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters.\u201d \u201cYes, madam,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady Catherine. \u201cShe is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.\u201d \u201cYou have a very small park here,\u201d returned Lady Catherine after a short silence."], "Why does Jane\u2019svisit to the Bingleys end up lasting for days?": [" If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him, _he_ was the cause, his pride and caprice were the cause, of all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted. \u201cThere were some very strong objections against the lady,\u201d were Colonel Fitzwilliam\u2019s words; and those strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in London. \u201cTo Jane herself,\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cthere could be no possibility of objection; all loveliness and goodness as she is!\u2014her understanding excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could anything be urged against my father, who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain, and respectability which he will probably never reach.\u201d When she thought of her mother, her confidence gave way a little; but she would not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend\u2019s connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.", " She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine\u2019s behaviour was most friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins\u2019s picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest. Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys. Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been lost. \u201cMy aunt,\u201d she continued, \u201cis going to-morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.\u201d She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley. \u201cI did not think Caroline in spirits,\u201d were her words, \u201cbut she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached her. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him.", " I wonder he does not marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Colonel Fitzwilliam, \u201cthat is an advantage which he must divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.\u201d \u201cAre you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make? Does your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she may like to have her own way.\u201d As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth. She directly replied: \u201cYou need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.\u201d \u201cI know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike man\u2014he is a great friend of Darcy\u2019s.\u201d \u201cOh! yes,\u201d said Elizabeth drily; \u201cMr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.\u201d \u201cCare of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in those points where he most wants care.", " how shall I bear so much happiness!\u201d She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty. Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation. \u201cAnd this,\u201d said she, \u201cis the end of all his friend\u2019s anxious circumspection! of all his sister\u2019s falsehood and contrivance! the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!\u201d In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose. \u201cWhere is your sister?\u201d said he hastily, as he opened the door. \u201cWith my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.\u201d He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane\u2019s perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself. It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of Miss Bennet\u2019s mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as made her look handsomer than ever."], "What does it meanthat Mr. Bennet\u2019s property is \u201centailed\u201d?": [" He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage. This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs. Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily. \u201cYou are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so oddly.\u201d \u201cYou allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.\u201d \u201cAh! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things I know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed.\u201d \u201cI am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps, when we are better acquainted\u2014\u201d He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins\u2019s admiration. The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised; and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet\u2019s heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property.", " I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the noise\u2014the nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all those people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!\u201d \u201cYour conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.\u201d Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections. Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity: \u201cMiss Elizabeth Bennet.\u201d \u201cMiss Elizabeth Bennet!\u201d repeated Miss Bingley. \u201cI am all astonishment. How long has she been such a favourite?\u2014and pray, when am I to wish you joy?\u201d \u201cThat is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady\u2019s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.\u201d \u201cNay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is absolutely settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law, indeed; and, of course, she will always be at Pemberley with you.\u201d He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her that all was safe, her wit flowed long. Chapter 7 Mr. Bennet\u2019s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother\u2019s fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply the deficiency of his.", " I do not believe she often sees such at home.\u201d \u201cThe person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.\u201d Mrs. Bennet\u2019s eyes sparkled. \u201cA gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr. Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley. But\u2014good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell\u2014I must speak to Hill this moment.\u201d \u201cIt is _not_ Mr. Bingley,\u201d said her husband; \u201cit is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life.\u201d This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once. After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained: \u201cAbout a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.\u201d \u201cOh! my dear,\u201d cried his wife, \u201cI cannot bear to hear that mentioned. Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it.\u201d Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. They had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.", " They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her girls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it. \u201cI do not blame Jane,\u201d she continued, \u201cfor Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins\u2019s wife by this time, had it not been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves.\u201d Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth\u2019s correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the conversation. When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. \u201cIt seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,\u201d said she. \u201cI am sorry it went off. But these things happen so often!"], "What reason doesWickham give Elizabeth for his dislike of Darcy?": [" For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy\u2019s; but you shall do as you choose.\u201d It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane. \u201cI do not know when I have been more shocked,\u201d said she. \u201cWickham so very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it so.\u201d \u201cOh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.\u201d \u201cPoor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!\u201d \u201cThere certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it.\u201d \u201cI never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you used to do.\u201d \u201cAnd yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one\u2019s genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.\u201d \u201cLizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now.\u201d \u201cIndeed, I could not.", " If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on. Yours, etc., \u201cEDW. GARDINER.\u201d \u201cIs it possible?\u201d cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. \u201cCan it be possible that he will marry her?\u201d \u201cWickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,\u201d said her sister. \u201cMy dear father, I congratulate you.\u201d \u201cAnd have you answered the letter?\u201d cried Elizabeth. \u201cNo; but it must be done soon.\u201d Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he wrote. \u201cOh! my dear father,\u201d she cried, \u201ccome back and write immediately. Consider how important every moment is in such a case.\u201d \u201cLet me write for you,\u201d said Jane, \u201cif you dislike the trouble yourself.\u201d \u201cI dislike it very much,\u201d he replied; \u201cbut it must be done.\u201d And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house. \u201cAnd may I ask\u2014\u201d said Elizabeth; \u201cbut the terms, I suppose, must be complied with.\u201d \u201cComplied with!", " Presuming however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on. Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress. But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner\u2019s curiosity; it was not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify inquiry. Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.", " \u201cBut what,\u201d said she, after a pause, \u201ccan have been his motive? What can have induced him to behave so cruelly?\u201d \u201cA thorough, determined dislike of me\u2014a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father\u2019s uncommon attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood\u2014the sort of preference which was often given me.\u201d \u201cI had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this\u2014though I have never liked him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this.\u201d After a few minutes\u2019 reflection, however, she continued, \u201cI _do_ remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition must be dreadful.\u201d \u201cI will not trust myself on the subject,\u201d replied Wickham; \u201c_I_ can hardly be just to him.\u201d Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, \u201cTo treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his father!\u201d She could have added, \u201cA young man, too, like _you_, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable\u201d\u2014but she contented herself with, \u201cand one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!\u201d \u201cWe were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care."], "To which Bennetdaughter does Mr. Collins propose marriage?": [" \u201cI have not the pleasure of understanding you,\u201d said he, when she had finished her speech. \u201cOf what are you talking?\u201d \u201cOf Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.\u201d \u201cAnd what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.\u201d \u201cSpeak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him.\u201d \u201cLet her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.\u201d Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library. \u201cCome here, child,\u201d cried her father as she appeared. \u201cI have sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?\u201d Elizabeth replied that it was. \u201cVery well\u2014and this offer of marriage you have refused?\u201d \u201cI have, sir.\u201d \u201cVery well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?\u201d \u201cYes, or I will never see her again.\u201d \u201cAn unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you _do_.\u201d Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed. \u201cWhat do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way?", " Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman\u2019s good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?\u201d But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness. \u201cI see what you are feeling,\u201d replied Charlotte. \u201cYou must be surprised, very much surprised\u2014so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins\u2019s character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state.\u201d Elizabeth quietly answered \u201cUndoubtedly;\u201d and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins\u2019s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte\u2019s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.", " What could your ladyship propose by it?\u201d \u201cAt once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.\u201d \u201cYour coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,\u201d said Elizabeth coolly, \u201cwill be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence.\u201d \u201cIf! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad?\u201d \u201cI never heard that it was.\u201d \u201cAnd can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?\u201d \u201cI do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. _You_ may ask questions which _I_ shall not choose to answer.\u201d \u201cThis is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?\u201d \u201cYour ladyship has declared it to be impossible.\u201d \u201cIt ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his reason. But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation, have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You may have drawn him in.\u201d \u201cIf I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.\u201d \u201cMiss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world, and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.\u201d \u201cBut you are not entitled to know _mine;_ nor will such behaviour as this, ever induce me to be explicit.\u201d \u201cLet me be rightly understood.", " She had fully proposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help for it, however. Mr. Wickham\u2019s happiness and her own were perforce delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins\u2019s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors. The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him. If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once."], "Whom does Mr.Collins marry?": [" \u201cI have not the pleasure of understanding you,\u201d said he, when she had finished her speech. \u201cOf what are you talking?\u201d \u201cOf Mr. Collins and Lizzy.

The strangeness of Mr. Collins\u2019s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte\u2019s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.", " I am only ashamed of his asking so little.\u201d \u201cAnd they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!\u201d \u201cYes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever to pay him.\u201d \u201cMoney! My uncle!\u201d cried Jane, \u201cwhat do you mean, sir?\u201d \u201cI mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am gone.\u201d \u201cThat is very true,\u201d said Elizabeth; \u201cthough it had not occurred to me before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle\u2019s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said her father; \u201cWickham\u2019s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.\u201d \u201cTen thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be repaid?\u201d Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house. Their father then went on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room. \u201cAnd they are really to be married!\u201d cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves. \u201cHow strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be thankful.", " Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia\u2019s infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business. Never, since reading Jane\u2019s second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham\u2019s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise\u2014all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey. She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been fluctuating but never without an object."], "Why does MissBingley dislike Elizabeth?": [" If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on. Yours, etc., \u201cEDW. GARDINER.\u201d \u201cIs it possible?\u201d cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. \u201cCan it be possible that he will marry her?\u201d \u201cWickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,\u201d said her sister. \u201cMy dear father, I congratulate you.\u201d \u201cAnd have you answered the letter?\u201d cried Elizabeth. \u201cNo; but it must be done soon.\u201d Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he wrote. \u201cOh! my dear father,\u201d she cried, \u201ccome back and write immediately. Consider how important every moment is in such a case.\u201d \u201cLet me write for you,\u201d said Jane, \u201cif you dislike the trouble yourself.\u201d \u201cI dislike it very much,\u201d he replied; \u201cbut it must be done.\u201d And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house. \u201cAnd may I ask\u2014\u201d said Elizabeth; \u201cbut the terms, I suppose, must be complied with.\u201d \u201cComplied with!", " For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Darcy\u2019s; but you shall do as you choose.\u201d It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane. \u201cI do not know when I have been more shocked,\u201d said she. \u201cWickham so very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear Lizzy, only consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion, too! and having to relate such a thing of his sister! It is really too distressing. I am sure you must feel it so.\u201d \u201cOh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather.\u201d \u201cPoor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner!\u201d \u201cThere certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it.\u201d \u201cI never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you used to do.\u201d \u201cAnd yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one\u2019s genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.\u201d \u201cLizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now.\u201d \u201cIndeed, I could not.", " \u201cBut what,\u201d said she, after a pause, \u201ccan have been his motive? What can have induced him to behave so cruelly?\u201d \u201cA thorough, determined dislike of me\u2014a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father\u2019s uncommon attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood\u2014the sort of preference which was often given me.\u201d \u201cI had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this\u2014though I have never liked him. I had not thought so very ill of him. I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this.\u201d After a few minutes\u2019 reflection, however, she continued, \u201cI _do_ remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition must be dreadful.\u201d \u201cI will not trust myself on the subject,\u201d replied Wickham; \u201c_I_ can hardly be just to him.\u201d Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, \u201cTo treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his father!\u201d She could have added, \u201cA young man, too, like _you_, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable\u201d\u2014but she contented herself with, \u201cand one, too, who had probably been his companion from childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!\u201d \u201cWe were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care.", " Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes. Chapter 8 At five o\u2019clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley\u2019s, she could not make a very favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her former dislike. Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his attentions to herself most pleasing, and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at cards; who, when he found her to prefer a plain dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her."], "Where do theBingleys and Darcy go for the winter?": [" Her ease and good spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called \u201cMrs. Wickham\u201d by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids. \u201cWell, mamma,\u201d said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, \u201cand what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.\u201d \u201cVery true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don\u2019t at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?\u201d \u201cOh, lord! yes;\u2014there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.\u201d \u201cI should like it beyond anything!\u201d said her mother. \u201cAnd then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over.\u201d \u201cI thank you for my share of the favour,\u201d said Elizabeth; \u201cbut I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands.\u201d Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.", " I depend on you for that.\u201d To these highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley\u2019s being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his. \u201cIt is unlucky,\u201d said she, after a short pause, \u201cthat you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by them.\u201d \u201cCaroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:\u201d \u201cWhen my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are already there for the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest friend, had any intention of making one of the crowd\u2014but of that I despair.", " Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully. Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth\u2019s person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother\u2019s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not err. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister. \u201cHow very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,\u201d she cried; \u201cI never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again.\u201d However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer. \u201cFor my own part,\u201d she rejoined, \u201cI must confess that I never could see any beauty in her.", " After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton. The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire."], "In March, Elizabethgoes to visit": [" As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said: \u201cI shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.\u201d \u201c_That_ you certainly shall.\u201d \u201cAnd I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?\u201d \u201cWe shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.\u201d \u201cI am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford.\u201d Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit. \u201cMy father and Maria are coming to me in March,\u201d added Charlotte, \u201cand I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome as either of them.\u201d The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte\u2019s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen.", " You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.\u201d \u201cYou mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least.\u201d \u201cAh, you do not know what I suffer.\u201d \u201cBut I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.\u201d \u201cIt will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them.\u201d \u201cDepend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all.\u201d Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news. Chapter 2 Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with: \u201cI hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.\u201d \u201cWe are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,\u201d said her mother resentfully, \u201csince we are not to visit.\u201d \u201cBut you forget, mamma,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cthat we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.\u201d \u201cI do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing.", " March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte\u2019s first sketch. She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be. The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter. The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her\u2014their opinion of everybody\u2014would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that, whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.", " It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next\u2014and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do. She could not think of Darcy\u2019s leaving Kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him. While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her. But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better. She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began: \u201cIn vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed."], "Lady Catherinede Bourgh is Darcy\u2019s": [" \u201cLady Catherine de Bourgh,\u201d she replied, \u201chas very lately given him a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long.\u201d \u201cYou know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.\u201d \u201cNo, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine\u2019s connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday.\u201d \u201cHer daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.\u201d This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined for another. \u201cMr. Collins,\u201d said she, \u201cspeaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.\u201d \u201cI believe her to be both in a great degree,\u201d replied Wickham; \u201cI have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class.\u201d Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham\u2019s attentions.", " Mr. Bingley\u2019s defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did before.\u201d She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr. Bingley\u2019s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them, and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery. \u201cI have found out,\u201d said he, \u201cby a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before.", " After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer. The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship\u2019s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh\u2014the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.", " This match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is engaged to _my daughter_. Now what have you to say?\u201d \u201cOnly this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me.\u201d Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied: \u201cThe engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy, they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of _his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?\u201d \u201cYes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice?"], "When Darcy firstproposes to Elizabeth, he spends most of the proposal dwelling on": [" Presuming however, that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on. Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased, and on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction, though while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress. But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner\u2019s curiosity; it was not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of; it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify inquiry. Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.", " His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage. She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane\u2019s last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said: \u201cI did not know before that you ever walked this way.\u201d \u201cI have been making the tour of the park,\u201d he replied, \u201cas I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?\u201d \u201cNo, I should have turned in a moment.\u201d And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together. \u201cDo you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?\u201d said she. \u201cYes\u2014if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He arranges the business just as he pleases.\u201d \u201cAnd if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.\u201d \u201cHe likes to have his own way very well,\u201d replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.", " When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing further to wish. \u201cNow I am quite happy,\u201d said she, \u201cfor you will be as happy as myself. I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley\u2019s friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it to another, not to you.\u201d Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia\u2019s marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation. \u201cGood gracious!\u201d cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next morning, \u201cif that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him? Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley\u2019s way.\u201d Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet.", " But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be of service\u2014and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything.\u201d Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister\u2019s ready acquiescence. \u201cI hope,\u201d added Mrs. Gardiner, \u201cthat no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her.\u201d \u201cAnd _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month\u2019s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him.\u201d \u201cSo much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane correspond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling.\u201d \u201cShe will drop the acquaintance entirely.\u201d But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley\u2019s being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless."], "When Darcy proposesfor the first time, Elizabeth": [" March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte\u2019s first sketch. She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be. The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter. The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her\u2014their opinion of everybody\u2014would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that, whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.", " Mr. what\u2019s-his-name. That tall, proud man.\u201d \u201cGood gracious! Mr. Darcy!\u2014and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley\u2019s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him.\u201d Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr. Bingley\u2019s friend, without being heard by either of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs. Gardiner\u2019s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming\u2014at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire.", " He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley\u2019s, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother\u2019s entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility: \u201cPray, Miss Eliza, are not the \u2014\u2014shire Militia removed from Meryton? They must be a great loss to _your_ family.\u201d In Darcy\u2019s presence she dared not mention Wickham\u2019s name; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment\u2019s distress; but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone.", " _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an evil.\u201d When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her neighbours\u2019 looks, their equal amazement in beholding it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time with:\u2014\u201cIt is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. _I_ talked about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples.\u201d He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said. \u201cVery well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones."], "Elizabeth\u2019s feelingstoward Darcy begin to change when he": [" It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I knew that I _had_ begun.\u201d \u201cMy beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners\u2014my behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?\u201d \u201cFor the liveliness of your mind, I did.\u201d \u201cYou may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less. The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused, and interested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really amiable, you would have hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you. There\u2014I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of me\u2014but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love.\u201d \u201cWas there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was ill at Netherfield?\u201d \u201cDearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last.", " Of this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with. He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas\u2019s, where a large party were assembled. \u201cWhat does Mr. Darcy mean,\u201d said she to Charlotte, \u201cby listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?\u201d \u201cThat is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.\u201d \u201cBut if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.\u201d On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said: \u201cDid you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?\u201d \u201cWith great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady energetic.\u201d \u201cYou are severe on us.\u201d \u201cIt will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,\u201d said Miss Lucas. \u201cI am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.\u201d \u201cYou are a very strange creature by way of a friend!\u2014always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody!", " My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.\u201d \u201cYou are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!\u201d \u201cIndeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier. I believe him to be Lady Catherine\u2019s _nephew_. It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday se\u2019nnight.\u201d Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme, assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side; and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and, when she ceased speaking, replied thus: \u201cMy dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom\u2014provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty.", " Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters\u2019 beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance. As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this effect: \u201cMy dear Lizzy, \u201cI wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help. Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not. \u201cYours, etc.\u201d As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind."], "Darcy\u2019s estateis called": [" He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on. \u201cMr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief. \u201cThey met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. \u201cEverything being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy\u2019s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business. \u201cOn Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.", " \u201cWhat can be the meaning of this?\u201d said Charlotte, as soon as he was gone. \u201cMy dear, Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never have called us in this familiar way.\u201d But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte\u2019s wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him, as well as by his evident admiration of her, of her former favourite George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam\u2019s manners, she believed he might have the best informed mind.", " What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?\u201d \u201cBecause you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.\u201d \u201cBut I was embarrassed.\u201d \u201cAnd so was I.\u201d \u201cYou might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.\u201d \u201cA man who had felt less, might.\u201d \u201cHow unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you _would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. _Too much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the subject. This will never do.\u201d \u201cYou need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady Catherine\u2019s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of yours. My aunt\u2019s intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.\u201d \u201cLady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to Netherfield for?", " \u201cShall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?\u201d \u201cI can answer your question,\u201d said Fitzwilliam, \u201cwithout applying to him. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.\u201d \u201cI certainly have not the talent which some people possess,\u201d said Darcy, \u201cof conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done.\u201d \u201cMy fingers,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cdo not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women\u2019s do. They have not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault\u2014because I will not take the trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other woman\u2019s of superior execution.\u201d Darcy smiled and said, \u201cYou are perfectly right. You have employed your time much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.\u201d Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again. Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy: \u201cMiss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and could have the advantage of a London master."], "Where does Lydiaspend the summer, and why?": [" After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton. The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire.", " For about three years I heard little of him; but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him, he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it, were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present him to the living in question\u2014of which he trusted there could be little doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could not have forgotten my revered father\u2019s intentions. You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for resisting every repetition to it. His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances\u2014and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived I know not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice. \u201cI must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother\u2019s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid, he so far recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent to an elopement.", " \u201cThey are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d thought Elizabeth, \u201c_that_ would be a delightful scheme indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!\u201d \u201cNow I have got some news for you,\u201d said Lydia, as they sat down at table. \u201cWhat do you think? It is excellent news\u2014capital news\u2014and about a certain person we all like!\u201d Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said: \u201cAye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not? There is no danger of Wickham\u2019s marrying Mary King. There\u2019s for you! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe.\u201d \u201cAnd Mary King is safe!\u201d added Elizabeth; \u201csafe from a connection imprudent as to fortune.\u201d \u201cShe is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.\u201d \u201cBut I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,\u201d said Jane.", " \u201cWell, Lizzy,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet one day, \u201cwhat is your opinion _now_ of this sad business of Jane\u2019s? For my part, I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody. I told my sister Phillips so the other day. But I cannot find out that Jane saw anything of him in London. Well, he is a very undeserving young man\u2014and I do not suppose there\u2019s the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now. There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have inquired of everybody, too, who is likely to know.\u201d \u201cI do not believe he will ever live at Netherfield any more.\u201d \u201cOh well! it is just as he chooses. Nobody wants him to come. Though I shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill; and if I was her, I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart; and then he will be sorry for what he has done.\u201d But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation, she made no answer. \u201cWell, Lizzy,\u201d continued her mother, soon afterwards, \u201cand so the Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is an excellent manager, I dare say. If she is half as sharp as her mother, she is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in _their_ housekeeping, I dare say.\u201d \u201cNo, nothing at all.\u201d \u201cA great deal of good management, depend upon it."], "What sociallydisastrous romantic decision does Lydia make?": [" \u201cI cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,\u201d said she, \u201cThough I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.\u201d In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia\u2019s general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said: \u201cLydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances.\u201d \u201cIf you were aware,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cof the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia\u2019s unguarded and imprudent manner\u2014nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair.\u201d \u201cAlready arisen?\u201d repeated Mr. Bennet.", " Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman\u2019s good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?\u201d But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness. \u201cI see what you are feeling,\u201d replied Charlotte. \u201cYou must be surprised, very much surprised\u2014so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins\u2019s character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state.\u201d Elizabeth quietly answered \u201cUndoubtedly;\u201d and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins\u2019s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte\u2019s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.", " Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia\u2019s infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business. Never, since reading Jane\u2019s second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham\u2019s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise\u2014all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey. She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been fluctuating but never without an object.", " I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the world I love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without him, so think it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the surprise the greater, when I write to them and sign my name \u2018Lydia Wickham.\u2019 What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement, and dancing with him to-night. Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all; and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster. I hope you will drink to our good journey. \u201cYour affectionate friend, \u201cLYDIA BENNET.\u201d \u201cOh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!\u201d cried Elizabeth when she had finished it. \u201cWhat a letter is this, to be written at such a moment! But at least it shows that _she_ was serious on the subject of their journey. Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a _scheme_ of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!\u201d \u201cI never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten minutes."], "Who spearheadsthe search for Lydia after Mr. Bennet returns home in defeat?": [" Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. \u201cA gamester!\u201d she cried. \u201cThis is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.\u201d Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law\u2019s entreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before. \u201cWhat, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?\u201d she cried. \u201cSure he will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?\u201d As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn. Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world. His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.", " Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected. Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to _his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other. Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia\u2019s example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia\u2019s society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going. Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet\u2019s being quite unable to sit alone.", " \u201cI cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,\u201d said she, \u201cThough I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.\u201d In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go.

Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady\u2019s fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister\u2019s countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own room, Jane, taking out the letter, said: \u201cThis is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town\u2014and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear what she says.\u201d She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a house. The next was in these words: \u201cI do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence."], "Who pays offWickham, convincing him to marry Lydia?": [" Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia\u2019s infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business.

Oh, Lydia!\u201d \u201cI comfort myself with thinking,\u201d replied Jane, \u201cthat he certainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?\u201d \u201cIf he were ever able to learn what Wickham\u2019s debts have been,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cand how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!\u201d \u201cWe must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,\u201d said Jane: \u201cI hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten.\u201d \u201cTheir conduct has been such,\u201d replied Elizabeth, \u201cas neither you, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget.", " I am only ashamed of his asking so little.\u201d \u201cAnd they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!\u201d \u201cYes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever to pay him.\u201d \u201cMoney! My uncle!\u201d cried Jane, \u201cwhat do you mean, sir?\u201d \u201cI mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am gone.\u201d \u201cThat is very true,\u201d said Elizabeth; \u201cthough it had not occurred to me before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle\u2019s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said her father; \u201cWickham\u2019s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.\u201d \u201cTen thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be repaid?\u201d Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house. Their father then went on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room. \u201cAnd they are really to be married!\u201d cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves. \u201cHow strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be thankful.", " Why must their marriage be private? Oh, no, no\u2014this is not likely. His most particular friend, you see by Jane\u2019s account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia\u2014what attraction has she beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father\u2019s behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter.\u201d \u201cBut can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?\u201d \u201cIt does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,\u201d replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, \u201cthat a sister\u2019s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a twelvemonth\u2014she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity."], "When he returnsto Netherfield, Mr. Bingley": [" They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed: \u201cHow very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?\u201d \u201cPerfectly so, I thank you.\u201d She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a short pause added: \u201cI think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?\u201d \u201cI have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in the future. He has many friends, and is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing.\u201d \u201cIf he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle.\u201d \u201cI should not be surprised,\u201d said Darcy, \u201cif he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers.\u201d Elizabeth made no answer.", " Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and sometimes made choice of his county; but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase. His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but, though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table\u2014nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for half-an-hour\u2014was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately. Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy\u2019s regard, Bingley had the firmest reliance, and of his judgement the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was the superior.", " \u201cIf I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, \u201cand all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.\u201d In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet\u2019s visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse. An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly.", " They repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of \u201cLord, how tired I am!\u201d accompanied by a violent yawn. When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time. Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months."], "What does LadyCatherine forbid Elizabeth to do?": [" I am only ashamed of his asking so little.\u201d \u201cAnd they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!\u201d \u201cYes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever to pay him.\u201d \u201cMoney!

Their father then went on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room. \u201cAnd they are really to be married!\u201d cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves. \u201cHow strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be thankful.", " And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?\u201d \u201cBecause honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him. Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us.\u201d \u201cThese are heavy misfortunes,\u201d replied Elizabeth. \u201cBut the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine.\u201d \u201cObstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person\u2019s whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.\u201d \u201c_That_ will make your ladyship\u2019s situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on _me_.\u201d \u201cI will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father\u2019s, from respectable, honourable, and ancient\u2014though untitled\u2014families.", " My feelings in every respect forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant female, intending to plague you, but as a rational creature, speaking the truth from her heart.\u201d \u201cYou are uniformly charming!\u201d cried he, with an air of awkward gallantry; \u201cand I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of being acceptable.\u201d To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female. Chapter 20 Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.", " Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her. But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from him was ecstasy. She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her: \u201cI dare say you will find him very agreeable.\u201d \u201cHeaven forbid!"], "What are Elizabeth's most notable virtues": [" Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins, she thought with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure. Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield. Chapter 19 The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the observances, which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words: \u201cMay I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth, when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning?\u201d Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs. Bennet answered instantly, \u201cOh dear!\u2014yes\u2014certainly. I am sure Lizzy will be very happy\u2014I am sure she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs.\u201d And, gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out: \u201cDear madam, do not go. I beg you will not go.", " Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal, however, to much conversation, and when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her. When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came, and having examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it; advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment; nor were the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in fact, nothing to do elsewhere. When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern in parting with her, that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present.", " As it was certain, however, that somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh. They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even inferior to what Elizabeth felt. She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no other reply to Elizabeth\u2019s salutation than a slight inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyship\u2019s entrance, though no request of introduction had been made. Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting for a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth, \u201cI hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your mother.\u201d Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was. \u201cAnd _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters.\u201d \u201cYes, madam,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady Catherine. \u201cShe is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.\u201d \u201cYou have a very small park here,\u201d returned Lady Catherine after a short silence.", " Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable. \u201cHow could I ever think her like her nephew?\u201d said she, as she looked in her face. As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following manner:\u2014 \u201cYou can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I come.\u201d Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment. \u201cIndeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here.\u201d \u201cMiss Bennet,\u201d replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, \u201cyou ought to know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I _know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you.\u201d \u201cIf you believed it impossible to be true,\u201d said Elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain, \u201cI wonder you took the trouble of coming so far."], "Which characteristic does Elizabeth have to overcome in the novel": [" Jane should therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his attention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses.\u201d \u201cYour plan is a good one,\u201d replied Elizabeth, \u201cwhere nothing is in question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But these are not Jane\u2019s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite enough to make her understand his character.\u201d \u201cNot as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent together\u2014and four evenings may do a great deal.\u201d \u201cYes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Charlotte, \u201cI wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth.", " Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offense. The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much. Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so\u2014but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose. Chapter 5 Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty.", " She dreaded seeing Mr. Wickham again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to _her_ of the regiment\u2019s approaching removal was indeed beyond expression. In a fortnight they were to go\u2014and once gone, she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account. She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last. Chapter 40 Elizabeth\u2019s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised, she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself. Miss Bennet\u2019s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister\u2019s refusal must have given him.", " While she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy\u2019s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy\u2019s meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley\u2019s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend. Elizabeth\u2019s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more."], "What trait does Darcy have to get over to be with Elizabeth": [" She had never heard of him before his entrance into the \u2014\u2014shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years\u2019 continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself\u2014from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin\u2019s affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question.", " Her ease and good spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called \u201cMrs. Wickham\u201d by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids. \u201cWell, mamma,\u201d said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, \u201cand what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.\u201d \u201cVery true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don\u2019t at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?\u201d \u201cOh, lord! yes;\u2014there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.\u201d \u201cI should like it beyond anything!\u201d said her mother. \u201cAnd then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over.\u201d \u201cI thank you for my share of the favour,\u201d said Elizabeth; \u201cbut I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands.\u201d Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.", " From something that he told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.\u201d \u201cWhat is it you mean?\u201d \u201cIt is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady\u2019s family, it would be an unpleasant thing.\u201d \u201cYou may depend upon my not mentioning it.\u201d \u201cAnd remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.\u201d \u201cDid Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?\u201d \u201cI understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady.\u201d \u201cAnd what arts did he use to separate them?\u201d \u201cHe did not talk to me of his own arts,\u201d said Fitzwilliam, smiling. \u201cHe only told me what I have now told you.\u201d Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful. \u201cI am thinking of what you have been telling me,\u201d said she.", " And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes\u2019 time, and then we all set out. However, I recollected afterwards that if he _had_ been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.\u201d \u201cMr. Darcy!\u201d repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement. \u201cOh, yes!\u2014he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!\u201d \u201cIf it was to be secret,\u201d said Jane, \u201csay not another word on the subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.\u201d \u201cOh! certainly,\u201d said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; \u201cwe will ask you no questions.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d said Lydia, \u201cfor if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry.\u201d On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away. But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her sister\u2019s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go."], "Which two characters serve as foils for Elizabeth and Darcy": [" Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters\u2019 beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance. As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this effect: \u201cMy dear Lizzy, \u201cI wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help. Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not. \u201cYours, etc.\u201d As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.", " _That_ is all settled.\u201d \u201cWhat is all settled?\u201d repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare. \u201cAnd are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!\u201d But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr. Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn. Chapter 47 \u201cI have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,\u201d said her uncle, as they drove from the town; \u201cand really, upon serious consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does on the matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel\u2019s family, that I am strongly inclined to hope the best.", " You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I hope, though you have but a short lease.\u201d \u201cWhatever I do is done in a hurry,\u201d replied he; \u201cand therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.\u201d \u201cThat is exactly what I should have supposed of you,\u201d said Elizabeth. \u201cYou begin to comprehend me, do you?\u201d cried he, turning towards her. \u201cOh! yes\u2014I understand you perfectly.\u201d \u201cI wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful.\u201d \u201cThat is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.\u201d \u201cLizzy,\u201d cried her mother, \u201cremember where you are, and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.\u201d \u201cI did not know before,\u201d continued Bingley immediately, \u201cthat you were a studier of character. It must be an amusing study.\u201d \u201cYes, but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at least that advantage.\u201d \u201cThe country,\u201d said Darcy, \u201ccan in general supply but a few subjects for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society.\u201d \u201cBut people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be observed in them for ever.\u201d \u201cYes, indeed,\u201d cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood.", " Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve.\u201d Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister\u2019s warm affection. \u201cNay,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cthis is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. _I_ only want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte\u2019s marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is unaccountable!\u201d \u201cMy dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins\u2019s respectability, and Charlotte\u2019s steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for everybody\u2019s sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin.\u201d \u201cTo oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart."], "Which of the following best describe Mr. Bennett's behavior throughout the novel": [" The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his own words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to the will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory, and as she recalled his very words, it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other; and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did not err. But when she read and re-read with the closest attention, the particulars immediately following of Wickham\u2019s resigning all pretensions to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality\u2014deliberated on the probability of each statement\u2014but with little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render Mr. Darcy\u2019s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole. The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at Mr. Wickham\u2019s charge, exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could bring no proof of its injustice.", " If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on. Yours, etc., \u201cEDW. GARDINER.\u201d \u201cIs it possible?\u201d cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. \u201cCan it be possible that he will marry her?\u201d \u201cWickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,\u201d said her sister. \u201cMy dear father, I congratulate you.\u201d \u201cAnd have you answered the letter?\u201d cried Elizabeth. \u201cNo; but it must be done soon.\u201d Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he wrote. \u201cOh! my dear father,\u201d she cried, \u201ccome back and write immediately. Consider how important every moment is in such a case.\u201d \u201cLet me write for you,\u201d said Jane, \u201cif you dislike the trouble yourself.\u201d \u201cI dislike it very much,\u201d he replied; \u201cbut it must be done.\u201d And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house. \u201cAnd may I ask\u2014\u201d said Elizabeth; \u201cbut the terms, I suppose, must be complied with.\u201d \u201cComplied with!", " The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks. On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard. They had frequently been staying with her in town. The first part of Mrs. Gardiner\u2019s business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was done she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.", " \u201cLouisa, you will not mind my waking Mr. Hurst?\u201d Her sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was opened; and Darcy, after a few moments\u2019 recollection, was not sorry for it. He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention. Chapter 12 In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Jane\u2019s week, could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to Elizabeth\u2019s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs. Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively resolved\u2014nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long, she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley\u2019s carriage immediately, and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned, and the request made. The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred."], "Which two traits define Mr. Collins": [" \u201cI have not the pleasure of understanding you,\u201d said he, when she had finished her speech. \u201cOf what are you talking?\u201d \u201cOf Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.\u201d \u201cAnd what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.\u201d \u201cSpeak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him.\u201d \u201cLet her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.\u201d Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library. \u201cCome here, child,\u201d cried her father as she appeared. \u201cI have sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?\u201d Elizabeth replied that it was. \u201cVery well\u2014and this offer of marriage you have refused?\u201d \u201cI have, sir.\u201d \u201cVery well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?\u201d \u201cYes, or I will never see her again.\u201d \u201cAn unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you _do_.\u201d Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed. \u201cWhat do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way?", " Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course. Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces. Lydia\u2019s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go. In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_.", " Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman\u2019s good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?\u201d But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness. \u201cI see what you are feeling,\u201d replied Charlotte. \u201cYou must be surprised, very much surprised\u2014so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins\u2019s character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state.\u201d Elizabeth quietly answered \u201cUndoubtedly;\u201d and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins\u2019s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte\u2019s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.", " Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless. As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister. Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Phillips\u2019s manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life. Chapter 16 As no objection was made to the young people\u2019s engagement with their aunt, and all Mr. Collins\u2019s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle\u2019s invitation, and was then in the house. When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its proprietor\u2014when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine\u2019s drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper\u2019s room."], "Which two Bennet sisters are most charmed by the soldiers": [" This she would not hear of; but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brother\u2019s proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness, however, by duets after supper, while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister. Chapter 9 Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister\u2019s room, and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her own judgement of her situation. The note was immediately dispatched, and its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast. Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield.", " So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and asked her for the two next. Then the two third he danced with Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_\u2014\u201d \u201cIf he had had any compassion for _me_,\u201d cried her husband impatiently, \u201che would not have danced half so much! For God\u2019s sake, say no more of his partners. Oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance!\u201d \u201cOh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him. He is so excessively handsome! And his sisters are charming women. I never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace upon Mrs. Hurst\u2019s gown\u2014\u201d Here she was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any description of finery. She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy. \u201cBut I can assure you,\u201d she added, \u201cthat Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting _his_ fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him! He walked here, and he walked there, fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him one of your set-downs. I quite detest the man.\u201d Chapter 4 When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister just how very much she admired him.", " Her ease and good spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called \u201cMrs. Wickham\u201d by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to show her ring, and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids. \u201cWell, mamma,\u201d said she, when they were all returned to the breakfast room, \u201cand what do you think of my husband? Is not he a charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.\u201d \u201cVery true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don\u2019t at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?\u201d \u201cOh, lord! yes;\u2014there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.\u201d \u201cI should like it beyond anything!\u201d said her mother. \u201cAnd then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over.\u201d \u201cI thank you for my share of the favour,\u201d said Elizabeth; \u201cbut I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands.\u201d Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.", " It was really a very handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.\u201d As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley\u2019s two sisters. Her mother\u2019s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do."], "Why does Charlotte accept Mr. Collins' proposal": [" Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman\u2019s good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?\u201d But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness. \u201cI see what you are feeling,\u201d replied Charlotte. \u201cYou must be surprised, very much surprised\u2014so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins\u2019s character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state.\u201d Elizabeth quietly answered \u201cUndoubtedly;\u201d and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family.

She had always felt that Charlotte\u2019s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.", " It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by Charlotte\u2019s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten. She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining in, observed: \u201cYes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home. Her ladyship\u2019s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I _should_ say, one of her ladyship\u2019s carriages, for she has several.\u201d \u201cLady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,\u201d added Charlotte, \u201cand a most attentive neighbour.\u201d \u201cVery true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.\u201d The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had already been written; and when it closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon Charlotte\u2019s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well.", " The room in which the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement. From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes\u2019 conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get out. Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins\u2019s joints of meat were too large for her family.", " Why does she not come in?\u201d \u201cOh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in.\u201d \u201cI like her appearance,\u201d said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. \u201cShe looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will make him a very proper wife.\u201d Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth\u2019s high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way. At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day. Chapter 29 Mr. Collins\u2019s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete. The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherine\u2019s condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough. \u201cI confess,\u201d said he, \u201cthat I should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship\u2019s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings."], "Which two characters act most snobbishly toward Elizabeth": [" The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth. Good-bye.\u201d She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening. Chapter 11 When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit. But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object; Miss Bingley\u2019s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was \u201cvery glad;\u201d but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley\u2019s salutation. He was full of joy and attention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the door.", " Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters\u2019 beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance. As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this effect: \u201cMy dear Lizzy, \u201cI wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help. Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not. \u201cYours, etc.\u201d As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.", " Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve.\u201d Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister\u2019s warm affection. \u201cNay,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cthis is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. _I_ only want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte\u2019s marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is unaccountable!\u201d \u201cMy dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins\u2019s respectability, and Charlotte\u2019s steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for everybody\u2019s sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin.\u201d \u201cTo oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart.", " Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty.\u201d \u201c_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,\u201d said Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet. \u201cOh! She is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner to introduce you.\u201d \u201cWhich do you mean?\u201d and turning round he looked for a moment at Elizabeth, till catching her eye, he withdrew his own and coldly said: \u201cShe is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles, for you are wasting your time with me.\u201d Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him. She told the story, however, with great spirit among her friends; for she had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in anything ridiculous. The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs. Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be, though in a quieter way."], "What is Mrs. Bennet's primary goal in life": [" Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. \u201cA gamester!\u201d she cried. \u201cThis is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.\u201d Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law\u2019s entreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before. \u201cWhat, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?\u201d she cried. \u201cSure he will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?\u201d As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn. Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world. His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.", " The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks. On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard. They had frequently been staying with her in town. The first part of Mrs. Gardiner\u2019s business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was done she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.", " Mrs. Phillips\u2019s vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax on his forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her sister, stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley\u2019s good humour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar. Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley. Chapter 61 Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.", " Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them. \u201cWell girls,\u201d said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, \u201cWhat say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well, I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The venison was roasted to a turn\u2014and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucases\u2019 last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And what do you think she said besides? \u2018Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her at Netherfield at last.\u2019 She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good a creature as ever lived\u2014and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.\u201d Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of Bingley\u2019s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at last; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals."], "How is Mr. Darcy initially perceived": [" Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully. Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth\u2019s person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother\u2019s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not err. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister. \u201cHow very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,\u201d she cried; \u201cI never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again.\u201d However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer. \u201cFor my own part,\u201d she rejoined, \u201cI must confess that I never could see any beauty in her.", " Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way before the hope of Jane\u2019s being in the fairest way for happiness. \u201cI want to know,\u201d said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister\u2019s, \u201cwhat you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d replied Jane, \u201cI have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister\u2019s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy\u2019s regard.\u201d \u201cMr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\u201d \u201cNo; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\u201d \u201cThis account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am satisfied. But what does he say of the living?\u201d \u201cHe does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only.\u201d \u201cI have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley\u2019s sincerity,\u201d said Elizabeth warmly; \u201cbut you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.", " She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine\u2019s behaviour was most friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins\u2019s picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest. Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys. Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been lost. \u201cMy aunt,\u201d she continued, \u201cis going to-morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.\u201d She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley. \u201cI did not think Caroline in spirits,\u201d were her words, \u201cbut she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached her. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him.", " The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he was moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness, pronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again towards the gate. He had by that time reached it also, and, holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty composure, \u201cI have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?\u201d And then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight. With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her still increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter-paper, written quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated from Rosings, at eight o\u2019clock in the morning, and was as follows:\u2014 \u201cBe not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you."], "What does Wickham lead Elizabeth to believe about Darcy": [" Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way before the hope of Jane\u2019s being in the fairest way for happiness. \u201cI want to know,\u201d said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister\u2019s, \u201cwhat you have learnt about Mr. Wickham.

Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.\u201d \u201cWhat you ask,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cis no sacrifice on my side; and Mr. Darcy had much better finish his letter.\u201d Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter. When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she seated herself. Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister, and while they were thus employed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy\u2019s eyes were fixed on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her, was still more strange. She could only imagine, however, at last that she drew his notice because there was something more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked him too little to care for his approbation. After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near Elizabeth, said to her: \u201cDo not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel?\u201d She smiled, but made no answer.", " What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses.\u201d \u201cMy manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong. How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?\u201d \u201cHate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction.\u201d \u201cI am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met at Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?\u201d \u201cNo indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.\u201d \u201cYour surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you. My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.\u201d \u201cMy object _then_,\u201d replied Darcy, \u201cwas to show you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you.\u201d He then told her of Georgiana\u2019s delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.", " \u201cI am trying to make it out.\u201d \u201cAnd what is your success?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cI do not get on at all. I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.\u201d \u201cI can readily believe,\u201d answered he gravely, \u201cthat reports may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.\u201d \u201cBut if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity.\u201d \u201cI would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,\u201d he coldly replied. She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree, for in Darcy\u2019s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her, which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against another. They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her: \u201cSo, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham! Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man quite forgot to tell you, among his other communication, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy\u2019s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy\u2019s using him ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he has always been remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner."], "What does Darcy do to Elizabeth when he visits her in the Collins' home": [" The room in which the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth had at first rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a more pleasant aspect; but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment, had they sat in one equally lively; and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement. From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh drove by in her phaeton, which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes\u2019 conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get out. Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship, and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work, and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins\u2019s joints of meat were too large for her family.", " Pemberley was now Georgiana\u2019s home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each other even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way. By Elizabeth\u2019s instructions, she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself. Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth\u2019s persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.", " \u201cI have not the pleasure of understanding you,\u201d said he, when she had finished her speech. \u201cOf what are you talking?\u201d \u201cOf Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.\u201d \u201cAnd what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.\u201d \u201cSpeak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him.\u201d \u201cLet her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.\u201d Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library. \u201cCome here, child,\u201d cried her father as she appeared. \u201cI have sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?\u201d Elizabeth replied that it was. \u201cVery well\u2014and this offer of marriage you have refused?\u201d \u201cI have, sir.\u201d \u201cVery well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?\u201d \u201cYes, or I will never see her again.\u201d \u201cAn unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you _do_.\u201d Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed. \u201cWhat do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way?", " Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman\u2019s good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?\u201d But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness. \u201cI see what you are feeling,\u201d replied Charlotte. \u201cYou must be surprised, very much surprised\u2014so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins\u2019s character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state.\u201d Elizabeth quietly answered \u201cUndoubtedly;\u201d and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins\u2019s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte\u2019s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage."], "Whom does Lydia marry": [" Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia\u2019s infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business. Never, since reading Jane\u2019s second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham\u2019s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise\u2014all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey. She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been fluctuating but never without an object.", " That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!\u201d \u201cI comfort myself with thinking,\u201d replied Jane, \u201cthat he certainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?\u201d \u201cIf he were ever able to learn what Wickham\u2019s debts have been,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cand how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!\u201d \u201cWe must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,\u201d said Jane: \u201cI hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten.\u201d \u201cTheir conduct has been such,\u201d replied Elizabeth, \u201cas neither you, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget.", " I am only ashamed of his asking so little.\u201d \u201cAnd they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!\u201d \u201cYes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever to pay him.\u201d \u201cMoney! My uncle!\u201d cried Jane, \u201cwhat do you mean, sir?\u201d \u201cI mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am gone.\u201d \u201cThat is very true,\u201d said Elizabeth; \u201cthough it had not occurred to me before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle\u2019s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said her father; \u201cWickham\u2019s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.\u201d \u201cTen thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be repaid?\u201d Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house. Their father then went on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room. \u201cAnd they are really to be married!\u201d cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves. \u201cHow strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be thankful.", " Why must their marriage be private? Oh, no, no\u2014this is not likely. His most particular friend, you see by Jane\u2019s account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia\u2014what attraction has she beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father\u2019s behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter.\u201d \u201cBut can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?\u201d \u201cIt does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,\u201d replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, \u201cthat a sister\u2019s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a twelvemonth\u2014she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity."], "What does Lady Catherine de Bourgh demand of Elizabeth": [" \u201cLady Catherine de Bourgh,\u201d she replied, \u201chas very lately given him a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long.\u201d \u201cYou know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.\u201d \u201cNo, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine\u2019s connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday.\u201d \u201cHer daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.\u201d This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined for another. \u201cMr. Collins,\u201d said she, \u201cspeaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.\u201d \u201cI believe her to be both in a great degree,\u201d replied Wickham; \u201cI have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class.\u201d Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham\u2019s attentions.", " After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer. The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship\u2019s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh\u2014the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.", " Mr. Bingley\u2019s defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did before.\u201d She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr. Bingley\u2019s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them, and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery. \u201cI have found out,\u201d said he, \u201cby a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before.", " The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.\u201d \u201cUpon my word,\u201d said her ladyship, \u201cyou give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?\u201d \u201cWith three younger sisters grown up,\u201d replied Elizabeth, smiling, \u201cyour ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.\u201d Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence. \u201cYou cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not conceal your age.\u201d \u201cI am not one-and-twenty.\u201d When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh\u2019s being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking\u2014stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself."], "What hinders romantic love in the novel": [" A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent.\u201d \u201cAn excellent consolation in its way,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cbut it will not do for _us_. We do not suffer by accident. It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before.\u201d \u201cBut that expression of \u2018violently in love\u2019 is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour\u2019s acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_ Mr. Bingley\u2019s love?\u201d \u201cI never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to dance; and I spoke to him twice myself, without receiving an answer. Could there be finer symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?\u201d \u201cOh, yes!\u2014of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor Jane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.", " Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman\u2019s good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?\u201d But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness. \u201cI see what you are feeling,\u201d replied Charlotte. \u201cYou must be surprised, very much surprised\u2014so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins\u2019s character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state.\u201d Elizabeth quietly answered \u201cUndoubtedly;\u201d and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins\u2019s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte\u2019s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.", " But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.\u201d \u201cAnd so ended his affection,\u201d said Elizabeth impatiently. \u201cThere has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!\u201d \u201cI have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,\u201d said Darcy. \u201cOf a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.\u201d Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part indeed without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.", " The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than in Charlotte\u2019s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him happy. All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating the circumstances, she thus went on: \u201cI am now convinced, my dear aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name, and wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial towards _him_; they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in love with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance. Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain.\u201d Chapter 27 With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away."], "In the society portrayed in the novel, what is most important to a woman": [" His behaviour to myself has been scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and everything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father.\u201d Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry. Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but very intelligible gallantry. \u201cIt was the prospect of constant society, and good society,\u201d he added, \u201cwhich was my chief inducement to enter the \u2014\u2014shire. I knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend Denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintances Meryton had procured them. Society, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society. A military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession\u2014I was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now.\u201d \u201cIndeed!\u201d \u201cYes\u2014the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift.", " Of what he has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity. \u201cMr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and afterwards at Cambridge\u2014most important assistance, as his own father, always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to give him a gentleman\u2019s education. My father was not only fond of this young man\u2019s society, whose manners were always engaging; he had also the highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession, intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The vicious propensities\u2014the want of principle, which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have. Here again I shall give you pain\u2014to what degree you only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character\u2014it adds even another motive.", " Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother\u2019s thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away. \u201cYes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So genteel and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.\u201d \u201cDid Charlotte dine with you?\u201d \u201cNo, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own work; _my_ daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think Charlotte so _very_ plain\u2014but then she is our particular friend.\u201d \u201cShe seems a very pleasant young woman.\u201d \u201cOh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane\u2019s beauty. I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane\u2014one does not often see anybody better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother Gardiner\u2019s in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.", " She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas. \u201cIt may perhaps be pleasant,\u201d replied Charlotte, \u201cto be able to impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all _begin_ freely\u2014a slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement. In nine cases out of ten a woman had better show _more_ affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.\u201d \u201cBut she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If _I_ can perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton, indeed, not to discover it too.\u201d \u201cRemember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane\u2019s disposition as you do.\u201d \u201cBut if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to conceal it, he must find it out.\u201d \u201cPerhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But, though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and, as they always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together."], "What is the role of journeys in the novel": [" Anything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.\u201d As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered: \u201cI do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the case _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys\u2014and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance.\u201d Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, \u201c_You_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have been always at Longbourn.\u201d Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice: \u201cAre you pleased with Kent?\u201d A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise\u2014and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her walk. The _t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate_ surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away."], "Which character's home plays the greatest symbolic role in the novel": [" But, Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not.\u201d Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master. \u201cDoes that young lady know Mr. Darcy?\u201d Elizabeth coloured, and said: \u201cA little.\u201d \u201cAnd do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma\u2019am?\u201d \u201cYes, very handsome.\u201d \u201cI am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late master\u2019s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to be then. He was very fond of them.\u201d This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham\u2019s being among them. Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old. \u201cAnd is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?\u201d said Mrs. Gardiner. \u201cOh! yes\u2014the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so accomplished!\u2014She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her\u2014a present from my master; she comes here to-morrow with him.\u201d Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either by pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister. \u201cIs your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?\u201d \u201cNot so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.\u201d \u201cExcept,\u201d thought Elizabeth, \u201cwhen she goes to Ramsgate.\u201d \u201cIf your master would marry, you might see more of him.\u201d \u201cYes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be.", " If she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her. \u201cMr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach him. I thought him very sly;\u2014he hardly ever mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion. \u201cPray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing. \u201cBut I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half hour. \u201cYours, very sincerely, \u201cM. GARDINER.\u201d The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister\u2019s match, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!", " But how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable?\u201d Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they had met in Kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning. \u201cBut perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,\u201d replied her uncle. \u201cYour great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him at his word, as he might change his mind another day, and warn me off his grounds.\u201d Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character, but said nothing. \u201cFrom what we have seen of him,\u201d continued Mrs. Gardiner, \u201cI really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character! I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal master, I suppose, and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue.\u201d Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham\u2019s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire.", " \u201cMrs. Collins, you must send a servant with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper. You must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly guarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her having two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy, of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.\u201d \u201cMy uncle is to send a servant for us.\u201d \u201cOh! Your uncle! He keeps a man-servant, does he? I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you change horses? Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be attended to.\u201d Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she was alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections."], "In what way is Austen's criticism of class limited": [" She had never heard of him before his entrance into the \u2014\u2014shire Militia, in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who, on meeting him accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself. As to his real character, had information been in her power, she had never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue. She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years\u2019 continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could see him instantly before her, in every charm of air and address; but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once more continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself\u2014from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousin\u2019s affairs, and whose character she had no reason to question.", " \u201cLady Catherine de Bourgh,\u201d she replied, \u201chas very lately given him a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long.\u201d \u201cYou know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.\u201d \u201cNo, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine\u2019s connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday.\u201d \u201cHer daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.\u201d This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined for another. \u201cMr. Collins,\u201d said she, \u201cspeaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.\u201d \u201cI believe her to be both in a great degree,\u201d replied Wickham; \u201cI have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class.\u201d Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham\u2019s attentions.", " Pemberley was now Georgiana\u2019s home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each other even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way. By Elizabeth\u2019s instructions, she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself. Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth\u2019s persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.", " She complained bitterly of all this to her husband. \u201cIndeed, Mr. Bennet,\u201d said she, \u201cit is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _I_ should be forced to make way for _her_, and live to see her take her place in it!\u201d \u201cMy dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor.\u201d This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before. \u201cI cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was not for the entail, I should not mind it.\u201d \u201cWhat should not you mind?\u201d \u201cI should not mind anything at all.\u201d \u201cLet us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility.\u201d \u201cI never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one\u2019s own daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too! Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?\u201d \u201cI leave it to yourself to determine,\u201d said Mr. Bennet. Chapter 24 Miss Bingley\u2019s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her brother\u2019s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country."], "Who would agree that \u201ca single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife\u201d?": [" \u201cBut it is,\u201d returned she; \u201cfor Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told me all about it.\u201d Mr. Bennet made no answer. \u201cDo you not want to know who has taken it?\u201d cried his wife impatiently. \u201c_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.\u201d This was invitation enough. \u201cWhy, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week.\u201d \u201cWhat is his name?\u201d \u201cBingley.\u201d \u201cIs he married or single?\u201d \u201cOh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\u201d \u201cHow so? How can it affect them?\u201d \u201cMy dear Mr. Bennet,\u201d replied his wife, \u201chow can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.\u201d \u201cIs that his design in settling here?\u201d \u201cDesign! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.\u201d \u201cI see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party.\u201d \u201cMy dear, you flatter me.", " Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against _him_; he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is, you must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.\u201d \u201cMy dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.\u201d \u201cYes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.\u201d \u201cWell, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it.\u201d \u201cElizabeth, you are not serious now.\u201d \u201cI beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw\u2014and if he becomes really attached to me\u2014I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence of it. Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father\u2019s opinion of me does me the greatest honour, and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every day that where there is affection, young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist?", " Mrs. Bennet said only, \u201cNonsense, nonsense!\u201d \u201cWhat can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?\u201d cried he. \u201cDo you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you, Mary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts.\u201d Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how. \u201cWhile Mary is adjusting her ideas,\u201d he continued, \u201clet us return to Mr. Bingley.\u201d \u201cI am sick of Mr. Bingley,\u201d cried his wife. \u201cI am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me that before? If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on him. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.\u201d The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished; that of Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first tumult of joy was over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while. \u201cHow good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now.\u201d \u201cNow, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,\u201d said Mr. Bennet; and, as he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.", " But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there. In as short a time as Mr. Collins\u2019s long speeches would allow, everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment were gained. Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins\u2019s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more interest than the matter had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St. James\u2019s."], "What is the name of the estate where Mr. Bingley lives?": [" Not to appear to disgrace his family, to degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride, which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister, and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers.\u201d \u201cWhat sort of girl is Miss Darcy?\u201d He shook his head. \u201cI wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy. But she is too much like her brother\u2014very, very proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father\u2019s death, her home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her education.\u201d After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying: \u201cI am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr. Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you know Mr. Bingley?\u201d \u201cNot at all.\u201d \u201cHe is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr. Darcy is.\u201d \u201cProbably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses.", " I do not believe she often sees such at home.\u201d \u201cThe person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.\u201d Mrs. Bennet\u2019s eyes sparkled. \u201cA gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr. Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley. But\u2014good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell\u2014I must speak to Hill this moment.\u201d \u201cIt is _not_ Mr. Bingley,\u201d said her husband; \u201cit is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life.\u201d This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once. After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained: \u201cAbout a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.\u201d \u201cOh! my dear,\u201d cried his wife, \u201cI cannot bear to hear that mentioned. Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it.\u201d Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. They had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.", " She complained bitterly of all this to her husband. \u201cIndeed, Mr. Bennet,\u201d said she, \u201cit is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _I_ should be forced to make way for _her_, and live to see her take her place in it!\u201d \u201cMy dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor.\u201d This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before. \u201cI cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was not for the entail, I should not mind it.\u201d \u201cWhat should not you mind?\u201d \u201cI should not mind anything at all.\u201d \u201cLet us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility.\u201d \u201cI never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one\u2019s own daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too! Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?\u201d \u201cI leave it to yourself to determine,\u201d said Mr. Bennet. Chapter 24 Miss Bingley\u2019s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her brother\u2019s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country.", " \u201cI am afraid, Mr. Darcy,\u201d observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper, \u201cthat this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes.\u201d \u201cNot at all,\u201d he replied; \u201cthey were brightened by the exercise.\u201d A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again: \u201cI have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she is really a very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it.\u201d \u201cI think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton.\u201d \u201cYes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.\u201d \u201cThat is capital,\u201d added her sister, and they both laughed heartily. \u201cIf they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,\u201d cried Bingley, \u201cit would not make them one jot less agreeable.\u201d \u201cBut it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world,\u201d replied Darcy. To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friend\u2019s vulgar relations. With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her room on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee. She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her sleep, and when it seemed to her rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself."], "Mrs. Bennett is interested in making the acquaintance of Mr. Bingley in order to do what?": [" \u201cThey have both,\u201d said she, \u201cbeen deceived, I dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side.\u201d \u201cVery true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business? Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody.\u201d \u201cLaugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father\u2019s favourite in such a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? Oh! no.\u201d \u201cI can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley\u2019s being imposed on, than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks.\u201d \u201cIt is difficult indeed\u2014it is distressing. One does not know what to think.\u201d \u201cI beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.\u201d But Jane could think with certainty on only one point\u2014that Mr. Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public.", " With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he had the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist. \u201cI know little of the game at present,\u201d said he, \u201cbut I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation in life\u2014\u201d Mrs. Phillips was very glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason. Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there seemed danger of Lydia\u2019s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular. Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told\u2014the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself.", " Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks, and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer, his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley\u2019s designs on him were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself. His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park, hurried home with the great intelligence. On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle Lord \u2014\u2014, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him.", " I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.\u201d \u201cAre you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this?\u201d \u201c_I_ never saw such a woman. _I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe united.\u201d Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room. \u201cElizabeth Bennet,\u201d said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, \u201cis one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.\u201d \u201cUndoubtedly,\u201d replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, \u201cthere is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable.\u201d Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject. Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians."], "Where do Mr. Bingley and Jane Bennett first meet?": [" But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be of service\u2014and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything.\u201d Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister\u2019s ready acquiescence. \u201cI hope,\u201d added Mrs. Gardiner, \u201cthat no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her.\u201d \u201cAnd _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month\u2019s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him.\u201d \u201cSo much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane correspond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling.\u201d \u201cShe will drop the acquaintance entirely.\u201d But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley\u2019s being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless.", " Mr. what\u2019s-his-name. That tall, proud man.\u201d \u201cGood gracious! Mr. Darcy!\u2014and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley\u2019s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him.\u201d Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr. Bingley\u2019s friend, without being heard by either of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs. Gardiner\u2019s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming\u2014at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire.", " Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way before the hope of Jane\u2019s being in the fairest way for happiness. \u201cI want to know,\u201d said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister\u2019s, \u201cwhat you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d replied Jane, \u201cI have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister\u2019s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy\u2019s regard.\u201d \u201cMr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\u201d \u201cNo; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\u201d \u201cThis account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am satisfied. But what does he say of the living?\u201d \u201cHe does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only.\u201d \u201cI have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley\u2019s sincerity,\u201d said Elizabeth warmly; \u201cbut you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.", " It was really a very handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.\u201d As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to like Bingley\u2019s two sisters. Her mother\u2019s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her, lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore, she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing else but her expectation that Jane would soon be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do."], "What word does Mr. Darcy first use to describe Elizabeth Bennett?": [" What made you so shy of me, when you first called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?\u201d \u201cBecause you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.\u201d \u201cBut I was embarrassed.\u201d \u201cAnd so was I.\u201d \u201cYou might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.\u201d \u201cA man who had felt less, might.\u201d \u201cHow unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you _would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when you _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. _Too much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the subject. This will never do.\u201d \u201cYou need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady Catherine\u2019s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of yours. My aunt\u2019s intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.\u201d \u201cLady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to Netherfield for?", " My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in such confusion!\u201d \u201cOh! Jane,\u201d cried Elizabeth, \u201cwas there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?\u201d \u201cI do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties.\u201d \u201cYour attendance upon her has been too much for you. You do not look well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone.\u201d \u201cMary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either of them. Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much, that her hours of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Phillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all. And Lady Lucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters\u2019, if they should be of use to us.\u201d \u201cShe had better have stayed at home,\u201d cried Elizabeth; \u201cperhaps she _meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too little of one\u2019s neighbours.", " And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes\u2019 time, and then we all set out. However, I recollected afterwards that if he _had_ been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.\u201d \u201cMr. Darcy!\u201d repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement. \u201cOh, yes!\u2014he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!\u201d \u201cIf it was to be secret,\u201d said Jane, \u201csay not another word on the subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.\u201d \u201cOh! certainly,\u201d said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; \u201cwe will ask you no questions.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d said Lydia, \u201cfor if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry.\u201d On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away. But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her sister\u2019s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.", " The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth. Good-bye.\u201d She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening. Chapter 11 When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit. But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object; Miss Bingley\u2019s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was \u201cvery glad;\u201d but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley\u2019s salutation. He was full of joy and attention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the door."], "Who is Charlotte Lucas?": [" Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. \u201cIt keeps him in good humour,\u201d said she, \u201cand I am more obliged to you than I can express.\u201d Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was very amiable, but Charlotte\u2019s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her from any return of Mr. Collins\u2019s addresses, by engaging them towards herself. Such was Miss Lucas\u2019s scheme; and appearances were so favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon. But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character, for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins, from a conviction that if they saw him depart, they could not fail to conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging, he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane.", " Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother\u2019s thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away. \u201cYes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So genteel and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.\u201d \u201cDid Charlotte dine with you?\u201d \u201cNo, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own work; _my_ daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think Charlotte so _very_ plain\u2014but then she is our particular friend.\u201d \u201cShe seems a very pleasant young woman.\u201d \u201cOh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane\u2019s beauty. I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane\u2014one does not often see anybody better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother Gardiner\u2019s in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.", " Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton. Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was, though Mrs. Bennet\u2019s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away. Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his return. Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth\u2019s abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men.", " Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her. But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from him was ecstasy. She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her: \u201cI dare say you will find him very agreeable.\u201d \u201cHeaven forbid!"], "After her first meeting with Mr. Darcy, why does Elizabeth vow never to dance with him?": [" Mr. what\u2019s-his-name. That tall, proud man.\u201d \u201cGood gracious! Mr. Darcy!\u2014and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley\u2019s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him.\u201d Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr. Bingley\u2019s friend, without being heard by either of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs. Gardiner\u2019s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming\u2014at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire.", " Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party. His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again. Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters. Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to hear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it. \u201cCome, Darcy,\u201d said he, \u201cI must have you dance. I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better dance.\u201d \u201cI certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with.\u201d \u201cI would not be so fastidious as you are,\u201d cried Mr. Bingley, \u201cfor a kingdom!", " Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too much engrossed by his thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began: \u201cWhat a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished society.\u201d \u201cCertainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world. Every savage can dance.\u201d Sir William only smiled. \u201cYour friend performs delightfully,\u201d he continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; \u201cand I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.\u201d \u201cYou saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.\u201d \u201cYes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do you often dance at St. James\u2019s?\u201d \u201cNever, sir.\u201d \u201cDo you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?\u201d \u201cIt is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.\u201d \u201cYou have a house in town, I conclude?\u201d Mr. Darcy bowed. \u201cI had once had some thought of fixing in town myself\u2014for I am fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas.\u201d He paused in hopes of an answer; but his companion was not disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was struck with the action of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to her: \u201cMy dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing?", " _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all! To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not wish me such an evil.\u201d When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence. Elizabeth made no answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her neighbours\u2019 looks, their equal amazement in beholding it. They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk, she made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time with:\u2014\u201cIt is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. _I_ talked about the dance, and _you_ ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples.\u201d He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said. \u201cVery well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones."], "Shortly after the Bennets become acquainted with the Bingleys, who goes to Meryton to visit Mrs. Bennet\u2019s sister, Mrs. Phillips?": [" Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds. She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade. The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner\u2019s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters\u2019, and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the headquarters. Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers\u2019 names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Phillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown before.", " The pain of separation, however, might be alleviated on his side, by preparations for the reception of his bride; as he had reason to hope, that shortly after his return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men. He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his fair cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father another letter of thanks. On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife, who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible, gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his sister, as well by nature as education. The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within view of his own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs. Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant woman, and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces. Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a particular regard. They had frequently been staying with her in town. The first part of Mrs. Gardiner\u2019s business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions. When this was done she had a less active part to play. It became her turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and much to complain of.", " \u201cI often think,\u201d said she, \u201cthat there is nothing so bad as parting with one\u2019s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.\u201d \u201cThis is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,\u201d said Elizabeth. \u201cIt must make you better satisfied that your other four are single.\u201d \u201cIt is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married, but only because her husband\u2019s regiment happens to be so far off. If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.\u201d But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and smiled and shook her head by turns. \u201cWell, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,\u201d (for Mrs. Phillips first brought her the news). \u201cWell, so much the better. Not that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen? But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?\u201d \u201cYou may depend on it,\u201d replied the other, \u201cfor Mrs. Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true.", " Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty, reserved, and fastidious, and his manners, though well-bred, were not inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared, Darcy was continually giving offense. The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with more pleasant people or prettier girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him; there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and, as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty, but she smiled too much. Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so\u2014but still they admired her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt authorized by such commendation to think of her as he chose. Chapter 5 Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty."], "When Jane accepts an invitation to visit the Bingleys, how does she travel?": [" She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine\u2019s behaviour was most friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins\u2019s picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest. Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys. Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been lost. \u201cMy aunt,\u201d she continued, \u201cis going to-morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.\u201d She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley. \u201cI did not think Caroline in spirits,\u201d were her words, \u201cbut she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached her. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him.", " It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane\u2019s attractions. Miss Bennet accepted her aunt\u2019s invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as she hoped by Caroline\u2019s not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him. The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it\u2014of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth\u2019s warm commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment. To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers.", " You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.\u201d \u201cYou mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these last twenty years at least.\u201d \u201cAh, you do not know what I suffer.\u201d \u201cBut I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.\u201d \u201cIt will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not visit them.\u201d \u201cDepend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them all.\u201d Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters married; its solace was visiting and news. Chapter 2 Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr. Bingley. He had always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with: \u201cI hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.\u201d \u201cWe are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,\u201d said her mother resentfully, \u201csince we are not to visit.\u201d \u201cBut you forget, mamma,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cthat we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.\u201d \u201cI do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing.", " \u201cIf I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet to her husband, \u201cand all the others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for.\u201d In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet\u2019s visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library. He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose beauty he had heard much; but he saw only the father. The ladies were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat, and rode a black horse. An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day, and, consequently, unable to accept the honour of their invitation, etc. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire; and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another, and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly."], "Which room in Darcy\u2019s ancestral home is discussed during Elizabeth\u2019s first visit with Mr. Bingley, his sisters, and Mr. Darcy?": [" He must go somewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live on. \u201cMr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once. Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief. \u201cThey met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. \u201cEverything being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy\u2019s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business. \u201cOn Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.", " Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way before the hope of Jane\u2019s being in the fairest way for happiness. \u201cI want to know,\u201d said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister\u2019s, \u201cwhat you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d replied Jane, \u201cI have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister\u2019s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy\u2019s regard.\u201d \u201cMr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\u201d \u201cNo; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\u201d \u201cThis account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am satisfied. But what does he say of the living?\u201d \u201cHe does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only.\u201d \u201cI have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley\u2019s sincerity,\u201d said Elizabeth warmly; \u201cbut you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.", " The girls grieved over such a number of ladies, but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing, that instead of twelve he brought only six with him from London\u2014his five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether\u2014Mr. Bingley, his two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man. Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he had a pleasant countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women, with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be proud; to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his friend. Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room; he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield.", " At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin\u2019s corroboration. She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips\u2019s. Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy\u2014that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that _he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy\u2019s character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son. How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything."], "While visiting Jane at Netherfield, what event does 15 year-old Lydia Bennet ask Mr. Bingley to host?": [" You take delight in vexing me.

Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he suddenly addressed her with: \u201cI hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.\u201d \u201cWe are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,\u201d said her mother resentfully, \u201csince we are not to visit.\u201d \u201cBut you forget, mamma,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cthat we shall meet him at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him.\u201d \u201cI do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing.", " I _will_ leave him to himself.\u201d In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed, more unequal, than she had often seen them. The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again. \u201cAs soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet, \u201cyou will wait on him of course.\u201d \u201cNo, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool\u2019s errand again.\u201d His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield. \u201c\u2019Tis an _etiquette_ I despise,\u201d said he. \u201cIf he wants our society, let him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend _my_ hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again.\u201d \u201cWell, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him. But, however, that shan\u2019t prevent my asking him to dine here, I am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for him.\u201d Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her husband\u2019s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before _they_ did.", " The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet\u2019s civilities. The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy\u2019s look and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was, at any rate, a ball.", " I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well\u2014and, indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him; and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William\u2019s in his regimentals.\u201d \u201cMamma,\u201d cried Lydia, \u201cmy aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson\u2019s as they did when they first came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke\u2019s library.\u201d Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited for an answer. Mrs. Bennet\u2019s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was eagerly calling out, while her daughter read, \u201cWell, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.\u201d \u201cIt is from Miss Bingley,\u201d said Jane, and then read it aloud. \u201cMY DEAR FRIEND,\u2014 \u201cIf you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives, for a whole day\u2019s _t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate_ between two women can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers.\u2014Yours ever, \u201cCAROLINE BINGLEY\u201d \u201cWith the officers!\u201d cried Lydia. \u201cI wonder my aunt did not tell us of _that_.\u201d \u201cDining out,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet, \u201cthat is very unlucky.\u201d \u201cCan I have the carriage?\u201d said Jane."], "What social blunder does Mrs. Bennet make when she visits Mr. Bingley\u2019s home with her younger daughters?": [" \u201cBut so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence.\u201d \u201cIn my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?\u201d \u201cThese are home questions\u2014and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where they like.\u201d \u201cUnless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do.\u201d \u201cOur habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money.\u201d \u201cIs this,\u201d thought Elizabeth, \u201cmeant for me?\u201d and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, \u201cAnd pray, what is the usual price of an earl\u2019s younger son? Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.\u201d He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said: \u201cI imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having someone at his disposal.", " She would not listen, therefore, to her daughter\u2019s proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley\u2019s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected. \u201cIndeed I have, sir,\u201d was her answer. \u201cShe is a great deal too ill to be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass a little longer on your kindness.\u201d \u201cRemoved!\u201d cried Bingley. \u201cIt must not be thought of. My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal.\u201d \u201cYou may depend upon it, Madam,\u201d said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, \u201cthat Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she remains with us.\u201d Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments. \u201cI am sure,\u201d she added, \u201cif it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to _her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield.", " Those who chose to be idle, certainly might.\u201d \u201cAye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf\u2019s calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. \u2018Lady Catherine,\u2019 said she, \u2018you have given me a treasure.\u2019 Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?\u201d \u201cYes, ma\u2019am, all.\u201d \u201cAll! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters must be very young?\u201d \u201cYes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much in company. But really, ma\u2019am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early.", " It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane\u2019s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it. In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother\u2019s words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical. \u201cWhat is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear.\u201d \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing!\u201d Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence."], "During his visit with the Bingleys at Netherfield, who does Mr. Darcy write to in the evenings?": [" Jane should therefore make the most of every half-hour in which she can command his attention. When she is secure of him, there will be more leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses.\u201d \u201cYour plan is a good one,\u201d replied Elizabeth, \u201cwhere nothing is in question but the desire of being well married, and if I were determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But these are not Jane\u2019s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet, she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house, and has since dined with him in company four times. This is not quite enough to make her understand his character.\u201d \u201cNot as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have also been spent together\u2014and four evenings may do a great deal.\u201d \u201cYes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Charlotte, \u201cI wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth.", " Let me mend it for you. I mend pens remarkably well.\u201d \u201cThank you\u2014but I always mend my own.\u201d \u201cHow can you contrive to write so even?\u201d He was silent. \u201cTell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp; and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley\u2019s.\u201d \u201cWill you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At present I have not room to do them justice.\u201d \u201cOh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?\u201d \u201cThey are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me to determine.\u201d \u201cIt is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with ease, cannot write ill.\u201d \u201cThat will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,\u201d cried her brother, \u201cbecause he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?\u201d \u201cMy style of writing is very different from yours.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d cried Miss Bingley, \u201cCharles writes in the most careless way imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.\u201d \u201cMy ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them\u2014by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.\u201d \u201cYour humility, Mr. Bingley,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cmust disarm reproof.\u201d \u201cNothing is more deceitful,\u201d said Darcy, \u201cthan the appearance of humility.", " She wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine\u2019s behaviour was most friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins\u2019s picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest. Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys. Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is. Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been lost. \u201cMy aunt,\u201d she continued, \u201cis going to-morrow into that part of the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.\u201d She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley. \u201cI did not think Caroline in spirits,\u201d were her words, \u201cbut she was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London. I was right, therefore, my last letter had never reached her. I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him.", " If, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business, I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care. Send back your answer as fast as you can, and be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will approve. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on. Yours, etc., \u201cEDW. GARDINER.\u201d \u201cIs it possible?\u201d cried Elizabeth, when she had finished. \u201cCan it be possible that he will marry her?\u201d \u201cWickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him,\u201d said her sister. \u201cMy dear father, I congratulate you.\u201d \u201cAnd have you answered the letter?\u201d cried Elizabeth. \u201cNo; but it must be done soon.\u201d Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he wrote. \u201cOh! my dear father,\u201d she cried, \u201ccome back and write immediately. Consider how important every moment is in such a case.\u201d \u201cLet me write for you,\u201d said Jane, \u201cif you dislike the trouble yourself.\u201d \u201cI dislike it very much,\u201d he replied; \u201cbut it must be done.\u201d And so saying, he turned back with them, and walked towards the house. \u201cAnd may I ask\u2014\u201d said Elizabeth; \u201cbut the terms, I suppose, must be complied with.\u201d \u201cComplied with!"], "What instrument does Miss Bingley play for her guests?": [" I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will never play really well unless she practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson\u2019s room. She would be in nobody\u2019s way, you know, in that part of the house.\u201d Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt\u2019s ill-breeding, and made no answer. When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from her, and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer\u2019s countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said: \u201cYou mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me? I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play so well. There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me.\u201d \u201cI shall not say you are mistaken,\u201d he replied, \u201cbecause you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own.\u201d Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam, \u201cYour cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say.", " For your sake,\u201d turning to Charlotte, \u201cI am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh\u2019s family. Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?\u201d \u201cA little.\u201d \u201cOh! then\u2014some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our instrument is a capital one, probably superior to\u2014\u2014You shall try it some day. Do your sisters play and sing?\u201d \u201cOne of them does.\u201d \u201cWhy did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do you draw?\u201d \u201cNo, not at all.\u201d \u201cWhat, none of you?\u201d \u201cNot one.\u201d \u201cThat is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.\u201d \u201cMy mother would have had no objection, but my father hates London.\u201d \u201cHas your governess left you?\u201d \u201cWe never had any governess.\u201d \u201cNo governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education.\u201d Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case. \u201cThen, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you must have been neglected.\u201d \u201cCompared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.", " They repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of \u201cLord, how tired I am!\u201d accompanied by a violent yawn. When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time. Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months.", " Of this she was perfectly unaware; to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with. He began to wish to know more of her, and as a step towards conversing with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas\u2019s, where a large party were assembled. \u201cWhat does Mr. Darcy mean,\u201d said she to Charlotte, \u201cby listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster?\u201d \u201cThat is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.\u201d \u201cBut if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid of him.\u201d On his approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, she turned to him and said: \u201cDid you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton?\u201d \u201cWith great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady energetic.\u201d \u201cYou are severe on us.\u201d \u201cIt will be _her_ turn soon to be teased,\u201d said Miss Lucas. \u201cI am going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows.\u201d \u201cYou are a very strange creature by way of a friend!\u2014always wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody!"], "Why is Darcy glad to see Jane and Elizabeth return home after Jane has recovered from her illness?": [" The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth. Good-bye.\u201d She then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she rambled about, in the hope of being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening. Chapter 11 When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her sister, and seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room, where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers of conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit. But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object; Miss Bingley\u2019s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy, and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was \u201cvery glad;\u201d but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley\u2019s salutation. He was full of joy and attention. The first half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she should suffer from the change of room; and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be further from the door.", " On distinguishing the ladies of the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour, one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments, touched his hat\u2014a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know. In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his friend. Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr. Phillip\u2019s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia\u2019s pressing entreaties that they should come in, and even in spite of Mrs. Phillips\u2019s throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation. Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if she had not happened to see Mr. Jones\u2019s shop-boy in the street, who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed towards Mr. Collins by Jane\u2019s introduction of him.", " Let me hear from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.\u2014Yours, etc.\u201d This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least. All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy\u2019s sister, as by Wickham\u2019s account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away. Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it.", " They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her girls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it. \u201cI do not blame Jane,\u201d she continued, \u201cfor Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins\u2019s wife by this time, had it not been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves.\u201d Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth\u2019s correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the conversation. When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. \u201cIt seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,\u201d said she. \u201cI am sorry it went off. But these things happen so often!"], "When Mr. Bennet dies, who will inherit his estate?": [" She complained bitterly of all this to her husband. \u201cIndeed, Mr. Bennet,\u201d said she, \u201cit is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _I_ should be forced to make way for _her_, and live to see her take her place in it!\u201d \u201cMy dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor.\u201d This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before. \u201cI cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was not for the entail, I should not mind it.\u201d \u201cWhat should not you mind?\u201d \u201cI should not mind anything at all.\u201d \u201cLet us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility.\u201d \u201cI never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one\u2019s own daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too! Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?\u201d \u201cI leave it to yourself to determine,\u201d said Mr. Bennet. Chapter 24 Miss Bingley\u2019s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her brother\u2019s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country.", " Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford\u2014between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourgh\u2019s footstool, that she said, \u2018Mr. Collins, you must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a gentlewoman for _my_ sake; and for your _own_, let her be an active, useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.\u2019 Allow me, by the way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views were directed towards Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I can assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that the loss to them might be as little as possible, when the melancholy event takes place\u2014which, however, as I have already said, may not be for several years.", " I do not believe she often sees such at home.\u201d \u201cThe person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.\u201d Mrs. Bennet\u2019s eyes sparkled. \u201cA gentleman and a stranger! It is Mr. Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr. Bingley. But\u2014good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a bit of fish to be got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell\u2014I must speak to Hill this moment.\u201d \u201cIt is _not_ Mr. Bingley,\u201d said her husband; \u201cit is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life.\u201d This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and his five daughters at once. After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus explained: \u201cAbout a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases.\u201d \u201cOh! my dear,\u201d cried his wife, \u201cI cannot bear to hear that mentioned. Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it.\u201d Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail. They had often attempted to do it before, but it was a subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.", " He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters; said he had heard much of their beauty, but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage. This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs. Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most readily. \u201cYou are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so oddly.\u201d \u201cYou allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.\u201d \u201cAh! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things I know are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed.\u201d \u201cI am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more; but, perhaps, when we are better acquainted\u2014\u201d He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins\u2019s admiration. The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised; and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet\u2019s heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property."], "What is Mr. Collins\u2019 profession?": [" \u201cI have not the pleasure of understanding you,\u201d said he, when she had finished her speech. \u201cOf what are you talking?\u201d \u201cOf Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.\u201d \u201cAnd what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.\u201d \u201cSpeak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him.\u201d \u201cLet her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.\u201d Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library. \u201cCome here, child,\u201d cried her father as she appeared. \u201cI have sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?\u201d Elizabeth replied that it was. \u201cVery well\u2014and this offer of marriage you have refused?\u201d \u201cI have, sir.\u201d \u201cVery well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?\u201d \u201cYes, or I will never see her again.\u201d \u201cAn unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you _do_.\u201d Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed. \u201cWhat do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way?", " Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course. Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces. Lydia\u2019s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every sister except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him, and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed him after breakfast; and there he would continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the house, he was used to be free from them there; his civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely pleased to close his large book, and go. In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_.", " Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman\u2019s good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?\u201d But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness. \u201cI see what you are feeling,\u201d replied Charlotte. \u201cYou must be surprised, very much surprised\u2014so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins\u2019s character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state.\u201d Elizabeth quietly answered \u201cUndoubtedly;\u201d and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins\u2019s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte\u2019s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.", " Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said, thanking her for every fish he won, and apologising if he thought he won too many. Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names. When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins\u2019s side and as many bows on Sir William\u2019s they departed. As soon as they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings, which, for Charlotte\u2019s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But her commendation, though costing her some trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyship\u2019s praise into his own hands. Chapter 30 Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughter\u2019s being most comfortably settled, and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his morning to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country; but when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments, and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing, and looking out of the window in his own book-room, which fronted the road."], "When he first arrives at the Bennet\u2019s house, which woman does Mr. Collins consider courting?": [" Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.

He took the hint, and soon began with, \u201cThis seems a very comfortable house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford.\u201d \u201cI believe she did\u2014and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object.\u201d \u201cMr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his choice of a wife.\u201d \u201cYes, indeed, his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding\u2014though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her.\u201d \u201cIt must be very agreeable for her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends.\u201d \u201cAn easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.\u201d \u201cAnd what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day\u2019s journey. Yes, I call it a very easy distance.\u201d \u201cI should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_ of the match,\u201d cried Elizabeth. \u201cI should never have said Mrs. Collins was settled _near_ her family.\u201d \u201cIt is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire.", " Mr. Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless. As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong, she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister. Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs. Phillips\u2019s manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be attributed to his connection with them, but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life. Chapter 16 As no objection was made to the young people\u2019s engagement with their aunt, and all Mr. Collins\u2019s scruples of leaving Mr. and Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham had accepted their uncle\u2019s invitation, and was then in the house. When this information was given, and they had all taken their seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire, and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment, that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs. Phillips understood from him what Rosings was, and who was its proprietor\u2014when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherine\u2019s drawing-rooms, and found that the chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she felt all the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeeper\u2019s room."], "During their conversation at the Phillips\u2019 dinner party, Wickham tells Elizabeth that Darcy wronged him by ___?": [" There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillips\u2019s supper party, but his manners recommended him to everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of Mr. and Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper, and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins, had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House. Chapter 17 Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr. Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and concern; she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley\u2019s regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham. The possibility of his having endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing remained therefore to be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained.", " In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he found in Mrs. Phillips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard, and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could. To the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last, however. The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked into the room, Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before, nor thinking of him since, with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration. The officers of the \u2014\u2014shire were in general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set, and the best of them were of the present party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as _they_ were superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips, breathing port wine, who followed them into the room. Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, made her feel that the commonest, dullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker.", " With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he had the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist. \u201cI know little of the game at present,\u201d said he, \u201cbut I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation in life\u2014\u201d Mrs. Phillips was very glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason. Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there seemed danger of Lydia\u2019s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular. Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told\u2014the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself.", " Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and had left her four thousand pounds. She had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade. The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliner\u2019s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than their sisters\u2019, and when nothing better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was the headquarters. Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers\u2019 names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Phillips visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a store of felicity unknown before."], "Who is Lady Catherine de Bourgh?": [" \u201cLady Catherine de Bourgh,\u201d she replied, \u201chas very lately given him a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long.\u201d \u201cYou know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.\u201d \u201cNo, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine\u2019s connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday.\u201d \u201cHer daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.\u201d This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined for another. \u201cMr. Collins,\u201d said she, \u201cspeaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.\u201d \u201cI believe her to be both in a great degree,\u201d replied Wickham; \u201cI have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class.\u201d Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham\u2019s attentions.", " After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer. The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship\u2019s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh\u2014the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.", " Mr. Bingley\u2019s defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did before.\u201d She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr. Bingley\u2019s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them, and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery. \u201cI have found out,\u201d said he, \u201cby a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before.", " The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.\u201d \u201cUpon my word,\u201d said her ladyship, \u201cyou give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?\u201d \u201cWith three younger sisters grown up,\u201d replied Elizabeth, smiling, \u201cyour ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.\u201d Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence. \u201cYou cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not conceal your age.\u201d \u201cI am not one-and-twenty.\u201d When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh\u2019s being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking\u2014stating the mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself."], "What explanation does Wickham\u2019s friend Denny give for Wickham\u2019s failure to attend the ball at Netherfield?": [" The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet\u2019s civilities. The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy\u2019s look and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was, at any rate, a ball.", " After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued the subject, by saying, \u201cBut tell me all and everything about it which I have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place? They must have seen them together for ever.\u201d \u201cColonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydia\u2019s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so grieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He _was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey.\u201d \u201cAnd was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?\u201d \u201cYes; but, when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything of their plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying\u2014and from _that_, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.\u201d \u201cAnd till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?\u201d \u201cHow was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains?", " No aunt, no officers, no news could be sought after\u2014the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia. Chapter 18 Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy\u2019s pleasure in the Bingleys\u2019 invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile, \u201cI do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here.\u201d This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by Elizabeth, and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham\u2019s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.", " When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library.\u201d No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement; when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly towards him and said: \u201cBy the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield?

It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of the day.\u201d \u201cMuch more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would not be near so much like a ball.\u201d Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the room.

She had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the attention of the officers, to whom her uncle\u2019s good dinners, and her own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was very equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mother\u2019s ear: \u201cI am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and when your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when she is ill.\u201d Lydia declared herself satisfied. \u201cOh! yes\u2014it would be much better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again.

But I knew I should persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance.

She shall hear my opinion.\u201d Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library. \u201cCome here, child,\u201d cried her father as she appeared. \u201cI have sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?\u201d Elizabeth replied that it was. \u201cVery well\u2014and this offer of marriage you have refused?\u201d \u201cI have, sir.\u201d \u201cVery well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?\u201d \u201cYes, or I will never see her again.\u201d \u201cAn unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you _do_.\u201d Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed. \u201cWhat do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way?", " Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman\u2019s good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?\u201d But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness. \u201cI see what you are feeling,\u201d replied Charlotte. \u201cYou must be surprised, very much surprised\u2014so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know; I never was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins\u2019s character, connection, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state.\u201d Elizabeth quietly answered \u201cUndoubtedly;\u201d and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins\u2019s making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte\u2019s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own, but she had not supposed it to be possible that, when called into action, she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage.", " I am only ashamed of his asking so little.\u201d \u201cAnd they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!\u201d \u201cYes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever to pay him.\u201d \u201cMoney! My uncle!\u201d cried Jane, \u201cwhat do you mean, sir?\u201d \u201cI mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am gone.\u201d \u201cThat is very true,\u201d said Elizabeth; \u201cthough it had not occurred to me before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle\u2019s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said her father; \u201cWickham\u2019s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.\u201d \u201cTen thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be repaid?\u201d Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house. Their father then went on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room. \u201cAnd they are really to be married!\u201d cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves. \u201cHow strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be thankful.", " Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia\u2019s infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business. Never, since reading Jane\u2019s second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham\u2019s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise\u2014all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey. She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been fluctuating but never without an object."], "In Miss Bingley\u2019s letter informing Jane of the party\u2019s return to the city, who does she imply will be married shortly?": [" It is useless to talk of it.\u201d It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library, therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her. He was writing and, without raising his head, coolly replied: \u201cJust as you please.\u201d \u201cMay we take my uncle\u2019s letter to read to her?\u201d \u201cTake whatever you like, and get away.\u201d Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went up stairs together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner\u2019s hope of Lydia\u2019s being soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct. \u201cMy dear, dear Lydia!\u201d she cried. \u201cThis is delightful indeed! She will be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen! My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he would manage everything! How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the clothes, the wedding clothes!", " His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage. She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane\u2019s last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said: \u201cI did not know before that you ever walked this way.\u201d \u201cI have been making the tour of the park,\u201d he replied, \u201cas I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?\u201d \u201cNo, I should have turned in a moment.\u201d And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together. \u201cDo you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?\u201d said she. \u201cYes\u2014if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He arranges the business just as he pleases.\u201d \u201cAnd if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.\u201d \u201cHe likes to have his own way very well,\u201d replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.", " I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her. My visit was not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall see them soon here.\u201d Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister\u2019s being in town. Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley\u2019s inattention. After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and yet more, the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt. \u201cMy dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in her better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley\u2019s regard for me. But, my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime.", " His accompanying them was a double advantage; she felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother. Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady\u2019s fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister\u2019s countenance change as she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages. Jane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave, than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs. When they had gained their own room, Jane, taking out the letter, said: \u201cThis is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me a good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way to town\u2014and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear what she says.\u201d She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor Street, where Mr. Hurst had a house. The next was in these words: \u201cI do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence."], "Whose behavior is Elizabeth referring to when she complains that people lack \u201cmerit or sense\u201d?": [" Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you deserve.\u201d Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister\u2019s warm affection. \u201cNay,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cthis is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. _I_ only want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not mention; the other is Charlotte\u2019s marriage. It is unaccountable! In every view it is unaccountable!\u201d \u201cMy dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins\u2019s respectability, and Charlotte\u2019s steady, prudent character. Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for everybody\u2019s sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin.\u201d \u201cTo oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart.", " Mr. what\u2019s-his-name. That tall, proud man.\u201d \u201cGood gracious! Mr. Darcy!\u2014and so it does, I vow. Well, any friend of Mr. Bingley\u2019s will always be welcome here, to be sure; but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him.\u201d Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr. Bingley\u2019s friend, without being heard by either of them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs. Gardiner\u2019s letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him. To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and whose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive information, he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming\u2014at his coming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again, was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire.", " But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.\u201d \u201cIf we thought alike of Miss Bingley,\u201d replied Jane, \u201cyour representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself.\u201d \u201cThat is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived, by all means. You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.\u201d \u201cBut, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?\u201d \u201cYou must decide for yourself,\u201d said Elizabeth; \u201cand if, upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him.\u201d \u201cHow can you talk so?\u201d said Jane, faintly smiling. \u201cYou must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could not hesitate.\u201d \u201cI did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider your situation with much compassion.\u201d \u201cBut if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be required.", " She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means. There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended; but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge of a sister\u2019s frailty would have mortified her so much\u2014not, however, from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself, for, at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia\u2019s marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family where, to every other objection, would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned. From such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink. The wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they should meet. What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago, would now have been most gladly and gratefully received!"], "After it seems Jane has lost her chance with Bingley, where does Mr. Gardiner offer to take her?": [" They had all been very ill-used since she last saw her sister. Two of her girls had been upon the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it. \u201cI do not blame Jane,\u201d she continued, \u201cfor Jane would have got Mr. Bingley if she could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard to think that she might have been Mr. Collins\u2019s wife by this time, had it not been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room, and she refused him. The consequence of it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister. They are all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you tell us, of long sleeves.\u201d Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth\u2019s correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the conversation. When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject. \u201cIt seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane,\u201d said she. \u201cI am sorry it went off. But these things happen so often!", " Elizabeth, for the sake of saying something that might turn her mother\u2019s thoughts, now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away. \u201cYes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he? So much the man of fashion! So genteel and easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very important, and never open their mouths, quite mistake the matter.\u201d \u201cDid Charlotte dine with you?\u201d \u201cNo, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own work; _my_ daughters are brought up very differently. But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think Charlotte so _very_ plain\u2014but then she is our particular friend.\u201d \u201cShe seems a very pleasant young woman.\u201d \u201cOh! dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself has often said so, and envied me Jane\u2019s beauty. I do not like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane\u2014one does not often see anybody better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own partiality. When she was only fifteen, there was a man at my brother Gardiner\u2019s in town so much in love with her that my sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.", " \u201cI have not the pleasure of understanding you,\u201d said he, when she had finished her speech. \u201cOf what are you talking?\u201d \u201cOf Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.\u201d \u201cAnd what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.\u201d \u201cSpeak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him.\u201d \u201cLet her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.\u201d Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library. \u201cCome here, child,\u201d cried her father as she appeared. \u201cI have sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?\u201d Elizabeth replied that it was. \u201cVery well\u2014and this offer of marriage you have refused?\u201d \u201cI have, sir.\u201d \u201cVery well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?\u201d \u201cYes, or I will never see her again.\u201d \u201cAn unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you _do_.\u201d Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed. \u201cWhat do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way?", " Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. \u201cA gamester!\u201d she cried. \u201cThis is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.\u201d Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law\u2019s entreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before. \u201cWhat, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?\u201d she cried. \u201cSure he will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?\u201d As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn. Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world. His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing."], "After observing her rapport with Wickham, which relative warns Elizabeth that he is not a suitable match for her?": [" I was uncomfortable enough, I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!\u201d \u201cHow unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly undeserved.\u201d \u201cCertainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is one point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our acquaintances in general understand Wickham\u2019s character.\u201d Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, \u201cSurely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your opinion?\u201d \u201cThat it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public. On the contrary, every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal to it. Wickham will soon be gone; and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found out, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.", " \u201cIt has been a very agreeable day,\u201d said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. \u201cThe party seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we may often meet again.\u201d Elizabeth smiled. \u201cLizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am perfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had any design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally pleasing, than any other man.\u201d \u201cYou are very cruel,\u201d said her sister, \u201cyou will not let me smile, and are provoking me to it every moment.\u201d \u201cHow hard it is in some cases to be believed!\u201d \u201cAnd how impossible in others!\u201d \u201cBut why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge?\u201d \u201cThat is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your confidante.\u201d Chapter 55 A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone. His friend had left him that morning for London, but was to return home in ten days time. He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.", " Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she herself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could console and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out her resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter. Mr. Bennet\u2019s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter! Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable.", " Anything beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.\u201d As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered: \u201cI do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the case _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys\u2014and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_ the present distance.\u201d Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, \u201c_You_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have been always at Longbourn.\u201d Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice: \u201cAre you pleased with Kent?\u201d A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise\u2014and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from her walk. The _t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate_ surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away."], "What promise does Elizabeth make to Charlotte?": [" As they went downstairs together, Charlotte said: \u201cI shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.\u201d \u201c_That_ you certainly shall.\u201d \u201cAnd I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?\u201d \u201cWe shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.\u201d \u201cI am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to come to Hunsford.\u201d Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit. \u201cMy father and Maria are coming to me in March,\u201d added Charlotte, \u201cand I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be as welcome as either of them.\u201d The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to hear, on the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what had been, rather than what was. Charlotte\u2019s first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen.", " It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be forgotten, there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by Charlotte\u2019s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten. She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining in, observed: \u201cYes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home. Her ladyship\u2019s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I _should_ say, one of her ladyship\u2019s carriages, for she has several.\u201d \u201cLady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,\u201d added Charlotte, \u201cand a most attentive neighbour.\u201d \u201cVery true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.\u201d The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had already been written; and when it closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon Charlotte\u2019s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well.", " Their fortune on both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them? The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up.\u201d \u201cIn marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman\u2019s daughter; so far we are equal.\u201d \u201cTrue. You _are_ a gentleman\u2019s daughter. But who was your mother? Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition.\u201d \u201cWhatever my connections may be,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cif your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.\u201d \u201cTell me once for all, are you engaged to him?\u201d Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a moment\u2019s deliberation: \u201cI am not.\u201d Lady Catherine seemed pleased. \u201cAnd will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?\u201d \u201cI will make no promise of the kind.\u201d \u201cMiss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the assurance I require.\u201d \u201cAnd I certainly _never_ shall give it.", " Why does she not come in?\u201d \u201cOh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in.\u201d \u201cI like her appearance,\u201d said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. \u201cShe looks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will make him a very proper wife.\u201d Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth\u2019s high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way. At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day. Chapter 29 Mr. Collins\u2019s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was complete. The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherine\u2019s condescension, as he knew not how to admire enough. \u201cI confess,\u201d said he, \u201cthat I should not have been at all surprised by her ladyship\u2019s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings."], "When Wickham shifts his attentions to Miss King, Elizabeth assumes it\u2019s because ___?": [" It was reasonable, however, to hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley\u2019s visit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance. Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham\u2019s desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well. \u201cBut my dear Elizabeth,\u201d she added, \u201cwhat sort of girl is Miss King? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.\u201d \u201cPray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end, and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary.\u201d \u201cIf you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what to think.\u201d \u201cShe is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.\u201d \u201cBut he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather\u2019s death made her mistress of this fortune.\u201d \u201cNo\u2014why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_ affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?\u201d \u201cBut there seems an indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event.\u201d \u201cA man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe.", " \u201cThey are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d thought Elizabeth, \u201c_that_ would be a delightful scheme indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!\u201d \u201cNow I have got some news for you,\u201d said Lydia, as they sat down at table. \u201cWhat do you think? It is excellent news\u2014capital news\u2014and about a certain person we all like!\u201d Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told he need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said: \u201cAye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for my news; it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not? There is no danger of Wickham\u2019s marrying Mary King. There\u2019s for you! She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe.\u201d \u201cAnd Mary King is safe!\u201d added Elizabeth; \u201csafe from a connection imprudent as to fortune.\u201d \u201cShe is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.\u201d \u201cBut I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,\u201d said Jane.", " Let me hear from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am sure you will be very comfortable there.\u2014Yours, etc.\u201d This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least. All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for him, as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr. Darcy\u2019s sister, as by Wickham\u2019s account, she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away. Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over, he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain. Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune permitted it.", " At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin\u2019s corroboration. She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips\u2019s. Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy\u2014that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that _he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy\u2019s character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son. How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything."], "Where is Mr. Collins\u2019 parish?": [" Mr. Collins must excuse me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am going away myself.\u201d \u201cNo, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you to stay where you are.\u201d And upon Elizabeth\u2019s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about to escape, she added: \u201cLizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing Mr. Collins.\u201d Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction\u2014and a moment\u2019s consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again and tried to conceal, by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began. \u201cBelieve me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little unwillingness; but allow me to assure you, that I have your respected mother\u2019s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as soon as I entered the house, I singled you out as the companion of my future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject, perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying\u2014and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.\u201d The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing, that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further, and he continued: \u201cMy reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness; and thirdly\u2014which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness.", " \u201cI have not the pleasure of understanding you,\u201d said he, when she had finished her speech. \u201cOf what are you talking?\u201d \u201cOf Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.\u201d \u201cAnd what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless business.\u201d \u201cSpeak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him.\u201d \u201cLet her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.\u201d Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library. \u201cCome here, child,\u201d cried her father as she appeared. \u201cI have sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?\u201d Elizabeth replied that it was. \u201cVery well\u2014and this offer of marriage you have refused?\u201d \u201cI have, sir.\u201d \u201cVery well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?\u201d \u201cYes, or I will never see her again.\u201d \u201cAn unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you _do_.\u201d Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed. \u201cWhat do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way?", " Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in commission of the peace of the county, she was a most active magistrate in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty. The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond Mr. Collins\u2019s reach. This, however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough; there were half-hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine\u2019s curiosity. In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.", " He must write his own sermons; and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family.\u201d And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room. Many stared\u2014many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man. To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations, was bad enough, and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable."], "Lady Catherine de Bourgh\u2019s daughter is first described by Elizabeth as ___?": [" \u201cLady Catherine de Bourgh,\u201d she replied, \u201chas very lately given him a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long.\u201d \u201cYou know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.\u201d \u201cNo, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine\u2019s connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday.\u201d \u201cHer daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.\u201d This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined for another. \u201cMr. Collins,\u201d said she, \u201cspeaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.\u201d \u201cI believe her to be both in a great degree,\u201d replied Wickham; \u201cI have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class.\u201d Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham\u2019s attentions.", " The last-born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive!

Pray, what is your age?\u201d \u201cWith three younger sisters grown up,\u201d replied Elizabeth, smiling, \u201cyour ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.\u201d Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence. \u201cYou cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need not conceal your age.\u201d \u201cI am not one-and-twenty.\u201d When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card-tables were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss de Bourgh\u2019s being too hot or too cold, or having too much or too little light.

The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship\u2019s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh\u2014the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she was indisposed.

Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr. Bingley\u2019s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them, and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery. \u201cI have found out,\u201d said he, \u201cby a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness.

Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage. She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane\u2019s last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said: \u201cI did not know before that you ever walked this way.\u201d \u201cI have been making the tour of the park,\u201d he replied, \u201cas I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?\u201d \u201cNo, I should have turned in a moment.\u201d And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together. \u201cDo you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?\u201d said she. \u201cYes\u2014if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He arranges the business just as he pleases.\u201d \u201cAnd if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.\u201d \u201cHe likes to have his own way very well,\u201d replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.", " The subject was pursued no farther, and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away. Chapter 31 Colonel Fitzwilliam\u2019s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they received any invitation thither\u2014for while there were visitors in the house, they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after the gentlemen\u2019s arrival, that they were honoured by such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little of Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had seen only at church. The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherine\u2019s drawing-room. Her ladyship received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact, almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was a welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins\u2019s pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy.", " I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire\u2014and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too\u2014for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.\u201d \u201cI am not afraid of you,\u201d said he, smilingly. \u201cPray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,\u201d cried Colonel Fitzwilliam. \u201cI should like to know how he behaves among strangers.\u201d \u201cYou shall hear then\u2014but prepare yourself for something very dreadful. The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at a ball\u2014and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact.\u201d \u201cI had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party.\u201d \u201cTrue; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.\u201d \u201cPerhaps,\u201d said Darcy, \u201cI should have judged better, had I sought an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.\u201d \u201cShall we ask your cousin the reason of this?\u201d said Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam.", " It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next\u2014and, a still greater, that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits, by all that affection could do. She could not think of Darcy\u2019s leaving Kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all, and agreeable as he was, she did not mean to be unhappy about him. While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door-bell, and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her. But this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In an hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better. She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and then getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began: \u201cIn vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be repressed."], "Why does Elizabeth reject Darcy\u2019s first proposal of marriage?": [" When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing further to wish. \u201cNow I am quite happy,\u201d said she, \u201cfor you will be as happy as myself. I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley\u2019s friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it to another, not to you.\u201d Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia\u2019s marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation. \u201cGood gracious!\u201d cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next morning, \u201cif that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him? Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley\u2019s way.\u201d Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet.", " She had fully proposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins instead! her liveliness had never been worse timed. There was no help for it, however. Mr. Wickham\u2019s happiness and her own were perforce delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins\u2019s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors. The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him. If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once.", " At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been well assured of his cousin\u2019s corroboration. She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening at Mr. Phillips\u2019s. Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr. Darcy\u2014that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that _he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week. She remembered also that, till the Netherfield family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but herself; but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed; that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy\u2019s character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son. How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.", " This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents, which will not be yours till after your mother\u2019s decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head, therefore, I shall be uniformly silent; and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.\u201d It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now. \u201cYou are too hasty, sir,\u201d she cried. \u201cYou forget that I have made no answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them.\u201d \u201cI am not now to learn,\u201d replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the hand, \u201cthat it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second, or even a third time. I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.\u201d \u201cUpon my word, sir,\u201d cried Elizabeth, \u201cyour hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration."], "In Darcy\u2019s letter to Elizabeth after she rejects him, who is it revealed that Wickham once tried to elope with?": [" Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight. No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not. Wickham\u2019s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia\u2019s for him. She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion. Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the country. One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth: \u201cLizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe.", " While she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy\u2019s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy\u2019s meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley\u2019s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend. Elizabeth\u2019s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more.", " do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.\u201d Darcy mentioned his letter. \u201cDid it,\u201d said he, \u201cdid it soon make you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its contents?\u201d She explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed. \u201cI knew,\u201d said he, \u201cthat what I wrote must give you pain, but it was necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me.\u201d \u201cThe letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies.\u201d \u201cWhen I wrote that letter,\u201d replied Darcy, \u201cI believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit.\u201d \u201cThe letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so widely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten.", " She was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I acted. Regard for my sister\u2019s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham\u2019s chief object was unquestionably my sister\u2019s fortune, which is thirty thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have been complete indeed. \u201cThis, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of falsehood he had imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at. Ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either, detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination. \u201cYou may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night; but I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed."], "When Elizabeth and Jane meet Lydia and Kitty on their way home from London, the younger girls are obsessed with ___?": [" Dear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster\u2019s. Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman\u2019s clothes on purpose to pass for a lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs. Forster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.\u201d With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia, assisted by Kitty\u2019s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham\u2019s name. Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth: \u201cI am glad you are come back, Lizzy.\u201d Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects that occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and, on the other, retailing them all to the younger Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person\u2019s, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her.", " \u201cOh! Mary,\u201d said she, \u201cI wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun! As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have treated you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!\u201d To this Mary very gravely replied, \u201cFar be it from me, my dear sister, to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for _me_\u2014I should infinitely prefer a book.\u201d But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all. In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was another reason too for her opposition.", " But do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us? Change of scene might be of service\u2014and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything.\u201d Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister\u2019s ready acquiescence. \u201cI hope,\u201d added Mrs. Gardiner, \u201cthat no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable that they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her.\u201d \u201cAnd _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month\u2019s ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him.\u201d \u201cSo much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane correspond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling.\u201d \u201cShe will drop the acquaintance entirely.\u201d But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley\u2019s being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless.", " Those who chose to be idle, certainly might.\u201d \u201cAye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf\u2019s calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. \u2018Lady Catherine,\u2019 said she, \u2018you have given me a treasure.\u2019 Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?\u201d \u201cYes, ma\u2019am, all.\u201d \u201cAll! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters must be very young?\u201d \u201cYes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much in company. But really, ma\u2019am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early."], "Where do Lydia and Kitty hope to convince their parents to spend the summer?": [" \u201cI am sure,\u201d said she, \u201cI cried for two days together when Colonel Miller\u2019s regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart.\u201d \u201cI am sure I shall break _mine_,\u201d said Lydia. \u201cIf one could but go to Brighton!\u201d observed Mrs. Bennet. \u201cOh, yes!\u2014if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable.\u201d \u201cA little sea-bathing would set me up forever.\u201d \u201cAnd my aunt Phillips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,\u201d added Kitty. Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy\u2019s objections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend. But the gloom of Lydia\u2019s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their _three_ months\u2019 acquaintance they had been intimate _two_. The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister\u2019s feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone\u2019s congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.", " Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been mistaken\u2014or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.\u201d Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley\u2019s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them. Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet\u2019s best comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer. Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. \u201cSo, Lizzy,\u201d said he one day, \u201cyour sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then. It is something to think of, and it gives her a sort of distinction among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time.", " After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton. The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire.", " Dear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster\u2019s.

Give me further particulars. What did Colonel Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place? They must have seen them together for ever.\u201d \u201cColonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality, especially on Lydia\u2019s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so grieved for him! His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He _was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened his journey.\u201d \u201cAnd was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?\u201d \u201cYes; but, when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything of their plans, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying\u2014and from _that_, I am inclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.\u201d \u201cAnd till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?\u201d \u201cHow was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains?", " \u201cI am sure,\u201d said she, \u201cI cried for two days together when Colonel Miller\u2019s regiment went away.

Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country. Under such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief. \u201cThey met several times, for there was much to be discussed. Wickham of course wanted more than he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. \u201cEverything being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy\u2019s next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name, and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business. \u201cOn Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk together.", " It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane\u2019s attractions. Miss Bennet accepted her aunt\u2019s invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as she hoped by Caroline\u2019s not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him. The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it\u2014of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth\u2019s warm commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment. To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers.", " The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One enjoyment was certain\u2014that of suitableness of companions; a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences\u2014cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure\u2014and affection and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad. It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc. are sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner\u2019s former residence, and where she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not in their direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation. \u201cMy love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much?\u201d said her aunt; \u201ca place, too, with which so many of your acquaintances are connected.", " They could not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servant\u2019s report, without any reference to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest, however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market-town where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor. With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged. As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out."], "What does Elizabeth daydream about during her tour of Darcy\u2019s estate with the Gardiners?": [" After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton. The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again within a month, and as that left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to the present plan, were to go no farther northwards than Derbyshire.", " \u201cI almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of me. But of course she did not mention my name to you.\u201d \u201cYes, she did.\u201d \u201cAnd what did she say?\u201d \u201cThat you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had\u2014not turned out well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely misrepresented.\u201d \u201cCertainly,\u201d he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said: \u201cI was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.\u201d \u201cPerhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,\u201d said Elizabeth. \u201cIt must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year.\u201d \u201cUndoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had.\u201d \u201cYes; he introduced us to his sister.\u201d \u201cAnd do you like her?\u201d \u201cVery much.\u201d \u201cI have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad you liked her. I hope she will turn out well.\u201d \u201cI dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.\u201d \u201cDid you go by the village of Kympton?\u201d \u201cI do not recollect that we did.\u201d \u201cI mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had.", " His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage. She was engaged one day as she walked, in perusing Jane\u2019s last letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy, she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her. Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said: \u201cI did not know before that you ever walked this way.\u201d \u201cI have been making the tour of the park,\u201d he replied, \u201cas I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?\u201d \u201cNo, I should have turned in a moment.\u201d And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together. \u201cDo you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?\u201d said she. \u201cYes\u2014if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He arranges the business just as he pleases.\u201d \u201cAnd if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.\u201d \u201cHe likes to have his own way very well,\u201d replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.", " She complained bitterly of all this to her husband. \u201cIndeed, Mr. Bennet,\u201d said she, \u201cit is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _I_ should be forced to make way for _her_, and live to see her take her place in it!\u201d \u201cMy dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the survivor.\u201d This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before. \u201cI cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If it was not for the entail, I should not mind it.\u201d \u201cWhat should not you mind?\u201d \u201cI should not mind anything at all.\u201d \u201cLet us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility.\u201d \u201cI never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the entail. How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one\u2019s own daughters, I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too! Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?\u201d \u201cI leave it to yourself to determine,\u201d said Mr. Bennet. Chapter 24 Miss Bingley\u2019s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter, and concluded with her brother\u2019s regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country."], "During her tour of Darcy\u2019s home, Elizabeth is interested to hear the housekeeper describe Darcy as ___?": [" It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as Jane\u2019s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life. She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it. In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother\u2019s words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper; for, to her inexpressible vexation, she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical. \u201cWhat is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear.\u201d \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be for you to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing!\u201d Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence.", " \u201cThey have both,\u201d said she, \u201cbeen deceived, I dare say, in some way or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side.\u201d \u201cVery true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business? Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody.\u201d \u201cLaugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father\u2019s favourite in such a manner, one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? Oh! no.\u201d \u201cI can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley\u2019s being imposed on, than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks.\u201d \u201cIt is difficult indeed\u2014it is distressing. One does not know what to think.\u201d \u201cI beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think.\u201d But Jane could think with certainty on only one point\u2014that Mr. Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public.", " After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health, good humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should be quartered in Meryton.

When the card-tables were placed, he had the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist. \u201cI know little of the game at present,\u201d said he, \u201cbut I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation in life\u2014\u201d Mrs. Phillips was very glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason. Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there seemed danger of Lydia\u2019s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular. Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told\u2014the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself."], "Where does Elizabeth first meet Georgiana?": [" Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely recollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully. Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth\u2019s person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her brother\u2019s recommendation was enough to ensure her favour; his judgement could not err. And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister. \u201cHow very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,\u201d she cried; \u201cI never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter. She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again.\u201d However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned, no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer. \u201cFor my own part,\u201d she rejoined, \u201cI must confess that I never could see any beauty in her.", " Pemberley was now Georgiana\u2019s home; and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each other even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive, manner of talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way. By Elizabeth\u2019s instructions, she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself. Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew; and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth\u2019s persuasion, he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.", " I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you.\u201d \u201cIt is evident by this,\u201d added Jane, \u201cthat he comes back no more this winter.\u201d \u201cIt is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he _should_.\u201d \u201cWhy will you think so? It must be his own doing. He is his own master. But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_.\u201d \u201cMr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister; and, to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting, from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject; but I will not leave the country without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister\u2019s partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most capable of engaging any woman\u2019s heart.", " He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed; a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them, and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley\u2019s, in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother\u2019s entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility: \u201cPray, Miss Eliza, are not the \u2014\u2014shire Militia removed from Meryton? They must be a great loss to _your_ family.\u201d In Darcy\u2019s presence she dared not mention Wickham\u2019s name; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment\u2019s distress; but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone."], "Miss Bingley makes a spiteful remark to Elizabeth about \u201ca great loss to your family.\u201d What is she referring to?": [" I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.\u201d \u201cAre you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this?\u201d \u201c_I_ never saw such a woman. _I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe united.\u201d Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room. \u201cElizabeth Bennet,\u201d said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, \u201cis one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.\u201d \u201cUndoubtedly,\u201d replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed, \u201cthere is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable.\u201d Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject. Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones being sent for immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians.", " He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning.

You are not going to be _missish_, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d cried Elizabeth, \u201cI am excessively diverted. But it is so strange!\u201d \u201cYes\u2014_that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_ pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins\u2019s correspondence for any consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?\u201d To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by what he said of Mr. Darcy\u2019s indifference, and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his seeing too _little_, she might have fancied too _much_. Chapter 58 Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine\u2019s visit.", " The good news spread quickly through the house, and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded from the world, in some distant farmhouse. But there was much to be talked of in marrying her; and the good-natured wishes for her well-doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this change of circumstances, because with such an husband her misery was considered certain. It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance. \u201cHaye Park might do,\u201d said she, \u201cif the Gouldings could quit it\u2014or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is too far off!"], "Why does Elizabeth avoid discussing Wickham with Miss Bingley?": [" When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing further to wish. \u201cNow I am quite happy,\u201d said she, \u201cfor you will be as happy as myself. I always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley\u2019s friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it to another, not to you.\u201d Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia\u2019s marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in conversation. \u201cGood gracious!\u201d cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next morning, \u201cif that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him? Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley\u2019s way.\u201d Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet.", " Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave way before the hope of Jane\u2019s being in the fairest way for happiness. \u201cI want to know,\u201d said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her sister\u2019s, \u201cwhat you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d replied Jane, \u201cI have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct, the probity, and honour of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has received; and I am sorry to say by his account as well as his sister\u2019s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy\u2019s regard.\u201d \u201cMr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?\u201d \u201cNo; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.\u201d \u201cThis account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am satisfied. But what does he say of the living?\u201d \u201cHe does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only.\u201d \u201cI have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley\u2019s sincerity,\u201d said Elizabeth warmly; \u201cbut you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.", " I do not know the particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame, that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned, and that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way. His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite\u2019s guilt; but really, considering his descent, one could not expect much better.\u201d \u201cHis guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,\u201d said Elizabeth angrily; \u201cfor I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy\u2019s steward, and of _that_, I can assure you, he informed me himself.\u201d \u201cI beg your pardon,\u201d replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer. \u201cExcuse my interference\u2014it was kindly meant.\u201d \u201cInsolent girl!\u201d said Elizabeth to herself. \u201cYou are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr. Darcy.\u201d She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.", " Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight. No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not. Wickham\u2019s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia\u2019s for him. She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion. Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the country. One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth: \u201cLizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe."], "Who writes to Elizabeth to inform her of her younger sister\u2019s elopement?": [" Those who chose to be idle, certainly might.\u201d \u201cAye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if I had known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalf\u2019s calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. \u2018Lady Catherine,\u2019 said she, \u2018you have given me a treasure.\u2019 Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?\u201d \u201cYes, ma\u2019am, all.\u201d \u201cAll! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The younger ones out before the elder ones are married! Your younger sisters must be very young?\u201d \u201cYes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much in company. But really, ma\u2019am, I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early.", " \u201cBut so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence.\u201d \u201cIn my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a fancy for?\u201d \u201cThese are home questions\u2014and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons cannot marry where they like.\u201d \u201cUnless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do.\u201d \u201cOur habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money.\u201d \u201cIs this,\u201d thought Elizabeth, \u201cmeant for me?\u201d and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, \u201cAnd pray, what is the usual price of an earl\u2019s younger son? Unless the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.\u201d He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said: \u201cI imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having someone at his disposal.", " Let me mend it for you. I mend pens remarkably well.\u201d \u201cThank you\u2014but I always mend my own.\u201d \u201cHow can you contrive to write so even?\u201d He was silent. \u201cTell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp; and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantley\u2019s.\u201d \u201cWill you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At present I have not room to do them justice.\u201d \u201cOh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?\u201d \u201cThey are generally long; but whether always charming it is not for me to determine.\u201d \u201cIt is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with ease, cannot write ill.\u201d \u201cThat will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,\u201d cried her brother, \u201cbecause he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?\u201d \u201cMy style of writing is very different from yours.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d cried Miss Bingley, \u201cCharles writes in the most careless way imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.\u201d \u201cMy ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them\u2014by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.\u201d \u201cYour humility, Mr. Bingley,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cmust disarm reproof.\u201d \u201cNothing is more deceitful,\u201d said Darcy, \u201cthan the appearance of humility.", " While she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy, with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy\u2019s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy\u2019s meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley\u2019s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend. Elizabeth\u2019s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able to speak any more."], "Who does Elizabeth immediately confide in about the scandal of Lydia\u2019s elopement?": [" Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia\u2019s infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business. Never, since reading Jane\u2019s second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham\u2019s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise\u2014all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey. She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been fluctuating but never without an object.", " Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight.

Oh, no, no\u2014this is not likely. His most particular friend, you see by Jane\u2019s account, was persuaded of his never intending to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia\u2014what attraction has she beyond youth, health, and good humour that could make him, for her sake, forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father\u2019s behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter.\u201d \u201cBut can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?\u201d \u201cIt does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,\u201d replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, \u201cthat a sister\u2019s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a twelvemonth\u2014she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity.", " From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickham\u2019s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world. His character was to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself. If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never disgrace him. He had been some days in town, before he was able to discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us. \u201cThere is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward-street, and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town. But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted."], "What is the Bennet family\u2019s greatest worry after Lydia disappears?": [" \u201cI cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,\u201d said she, \u201cThough I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.\u201d In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia\u2019s general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said: \u201cLydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances.\u201d \u201cIf you were aware,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cof the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia\u2019s unguarded and imprudent manner\u2014nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair.\u201d \u201cAlready arisen?\u201d repeated Mr. Bennet.", " If she heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her. \u201cMr. Darcy was punctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire. His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his wife may teach him. I thought him very sly;\u2014he hardly ever mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion. \u201cPray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing. \u201cBut I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this half hour. \u201cYours, very sincerely, \u201cM. GARDINER.\u201d The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her sister\u2019s match, which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true!", " She would not listen, therefore, to her daughter\u2019s proposal of being carried home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss Bingley\u2019s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected. \u201cIndeed I have, sir,\u201d was her answer. \u201cShe is a great deal too ill to be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass a little longer on your kindness.\u201d \u201cRemoved!\u201d cried Bingley. \u201cIt must not be thought of. My sister, I am sure, will not hear of her removal.\u201d \u201cYou may depend upon it, Madam,\u201d said Miss Bingley, with cold civility, \u201cthat Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention while she remains with us.\u201d Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments. \u201cI am sure,\u201d she added, \u201cif it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest temper I have ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to _her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over the gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield.", " \u201cI am sure,\u201d said she, \u201cI cried for two days together when Colonel Miller\u2019s regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart.\u201d \u201cI am sure I shall break _mine_,\u201d said Lydia. \u201cIf one could but go to Brighton!\u201d observed Mrs. Bennet. \u201cOh, yes!\u2014if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable.\u201d \u201cA little sea-bathing would set me up forever.\u201d \u201cAnd my aunt Phillips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,\u201d added Kitty. Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy\u2019s objections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend. But the gloom of Lydia\u2019s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their _three_ months\u2019 acquaintance they had been intimate _two_. The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister\u2019s feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone\u2019s congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish."], "While Mr. Bennet searches for Lydia and Wickham in London, the Bennets receive a rude letter from ___?": [" She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be found. Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in \u2014\u2014 street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never been _his_ design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia\u2019s flight on her own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it.", " When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes. Chapter 51 Their sister\u2019s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet them at \u2014\u2014, and they were to return in it by dinner-time. Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_ been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure. They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy. Lydia\u2019s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness. Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial.", " Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family. Jane heard them with horror. \u201cA gamester!\u201d she cried. \u201cThis is wholly unexpected. I had not an idea of it.\u201d Mr. Gardiner added in his letter, that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to his brother-in-law\u2019s entreaty that he would return to his family, and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering what her anxiety for his life had been before. \u201cWhat, is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?\u201d she cried. \u201cSure he will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham, and make him marry her, if he comes away?\u201d As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she and the children should go to London, at the same time that Mr. Bennet came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn. Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world. His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.", " Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia\u2019s infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business.

But as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father\u2019s behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter.\u201d \u201cBut can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him as to consent to live with him on any terms other than marriage?\u201d \u201cIt does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,\u201d replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, \u201cthat a sister\u2019s sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young; she has never been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a twelvemonth\u2014she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity.", " That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness, and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!\u201d \u201cI comfort myself with thinking,\u201d replied Jane, \u201cthat he certainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?\u201d \u201cIf he were ever able to learn what Wickham\u2019s debts have been,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cand how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now, she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!\u201d \u201cWe must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,\u201d said Jane: \u201cI hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten.\u201d \u201cTheir conduct has been such,\u201d replied Elizabeth, \u201cas neither you, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget.", " I am only ashamed of his asking so little.\u201d \u201cAnd they _must_ marry! Yet he is _such_ a man!\u201d \u201cYes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the other, how am I ever to pay him.\u201d \u201cMoney! My uncle!\u201d cried Jane, \u201cwhat do you mean, sir?\u201d \u201cI mean, that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty after I am gone.\u201d \u201cThat is very true,\u201d said Elizabeth; \u201cthough it had not occurred to me before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh! it must be my uncle\u2019s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said her father; \u201cWickham\u2019s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship.\u201d \u201cTen thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be repaid?\u201d Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house. Their father then went on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room. \u201cAnd they are really to be married!\u201d cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves. \u201cHow strange this is! And for _this_ we are to be thankful."], "Who is Elizabeth surprised to learn was present at Lydia\u2019s wedding?": [" Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight. No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not. Wickham\u2019s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it; not equal to Lydia\u2019s for him. She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion. Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every thing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the country. One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth: \u201cLizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe.", " And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes\u2019 time, and then we all set out. However, I recollected afterwards that if he _had_ been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.\u201d \u201cMr. Darcy!\u201d repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement. \u201cOh, yes!\u2014he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!\u201d \u201cIf it was to be secret,\u201d said Jane, \u201csay not another word on the subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.\u201d \u201cOh! certainly,\u201d said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; \u201cwe will ask you no questions.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d said Lydia, \u201cfor if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry.\u201d On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away. But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her sister\u2019s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.", " When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme, and had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes. Chapter 51 Their sister\u2019s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet them at \u2014\u2014, and they were to return in it by dinner-time. Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets, and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_ been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure. They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the carriage drove up to the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy. Lydia\u2019s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand, with an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness. Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite so cordial.", " \u201cI cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,\u201d said she, \u201cThough I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.\u201d In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her were it known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia\u2019s general behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said: \u201cLydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances.\u201d \u201cIf you were aware,\u201d said Elizabeth, \u201cof the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydia\u2019s unguarded and imprudent manner\u2014nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair.\u201d \u201cAlready arisen?\u201d repeated Mr. Bennet."], "Who supplied the money to facilitate Wickham\u2019s marriage to Lydia?": [" Be that as it may, she saw him go with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia\u2019s infamy must produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business. Never, since reading Jane\u2019s second letter, had she entertained a hope of Wickham\u2019s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought, could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least of her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first letter remained in her mind, she was all surprise\u2014all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey. She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions raised them in her opinion. Her affections had continually been fluctuating but never without an object.", " Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters\u2019 beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance. As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this effect: \u201cMy dear Lizzy, \u201cI wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help. Any place would do, of about three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not. \u201cYours, etc.\u201d As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.", " With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young ladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin. When the card-tables were placed, he had the opportunity of obliging her in turn, by sitting down to whist. \u201cI know little of the game at present,\u201d said he, \u201cbut I shall be glad to improve myself, for in my situation in life\u2014\u201d Mrs. Phillips was very glad for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason. Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there seemed danger of Lydia\u2019s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets, she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular. Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him, though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told\u2014the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself.", " I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!\u201d Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr. Gardiner\u2019s behaviour laid them all under. \u201cFor we must attribute this happy conclusion,\u201d she added, \u201cin a great measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d cried her mother, \u201cit is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy! In a short time I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well it sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter, that I am sure I can\u2019t write; so I will dictate, and you write for me. We will settle with your father about the money afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.\u201d She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted."], "Having nearly destroyed her family\u2019s respectability by eloping with Wickham, Lydia\u2019s attitude upon her return is best described as ___?": [" Mr. Wickham had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight. No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and having very frequent parties at home.

Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in \u2014\u2014 street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her, offering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he easily learnt had never been _his_ design. He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia\u2019s flight on her own folly alone. He meant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation, he could conjecture very little about it.", " Attendance, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her. But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her spirits; and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her particular notice. The first two dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn, apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her release from him was ecstasy. She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her: \u201cI dare say you will find him very agreeable.\u201d \u201cHeaven forbid!", " \u201cI am sure,\u201d said she, \u201cI cried for two days together when Colonel Miller\u2019s regiment went away. I thought I should have broken my heart.\u201d \u201cI am sure I shall break _mine_,\u201d said Lydia. \u201cIf one could but go to Brighton!\u201d observed Mrs. Bennet. \u201cOh, yes!\u2014if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable.\u201d \u201cA little sea-bathing would set me up forever.\u201d \u201cAnd my aunt Phillips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,\u201d added Kitty. Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy\u2019s objections; and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend. But the gloom of Lydia\u2019s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of the regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of their _three_ months\u2019 acquaintance they had been intimate _two_. The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister\u2019s feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone\u2019s congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repined at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish."], "When the news arrives that Bingley will return to Netherfield Park, Mr. Bennet embarrasses the family by ___?": [" They repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of \u201cLord, how tired I am!\u201d accompanied by a violent yawn. When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time. Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months.", " \u201cI often think,\u201d said she, \u201cthat there is nothing so bad as parting with one\u2019s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.\u201d \u201cThis is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a daughter,\u201d said Elizabeth. \u201cIt must make you better satisfied that your other four are single.\u201d \u201cIt is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married, but only because her husband\u2019s regiment happens to be so far off. If that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.\u201d But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and smiled and shook her head by turns. \u201cWell, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,\u201d (for Mrs. Phillips first brought her the news). \u201cWell, so much the better. Not that I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen? But that is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it. And so, is it quite certain he is coming?\u201d \u201cYou may depend on it,\u201d replied the other, \u201cfor Mrs. Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true.", " They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed: \u201cHow very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?\u201d \u201cPerfectly so, I thank you.\u201d She found that she was to receive no other answer, and, after a short pause added: \u201cI think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?\u201d \u201cI have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in the future. He has many friends, and is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing.\u201d \u201cIf he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle.\u201d \u201cI should not be surprised,\u201d said Darcy, \u201cif he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers.\u201d Elizabeth made no answer.", " The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long-expected ball at Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet\u2019s civilities. The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy\u2019s look and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single event, or any particular person, for though they each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball was, at any rate, a ball."], "After their engagement, Jane learns that Bingley never visited her in London because ___?": [" This match, to which you have the presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is engaged to _my daughter_. Now what have you to say?\u201d \u201cOnly this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me.\u201d Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied: \u201cThe engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy, they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of _his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?\u201d \u201cYes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice?", " It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that his affection might be reanimated, and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane\u2019s attractions. Miss Bennet accepted her aunt\u2019s invitation with pleasure; and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time, than as she hoped by Caroline\u2019s not living in the same house with her brother, she might occasionally spend a morning with her, without any danger of seeing him. The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Phillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day without its engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister, that they did not once sit down to a family dinner. When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it\u2014of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth\u2019s warm commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment. To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure, unconnected with his general powers.", " She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to each, to be dwelt on farther. After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that it was time to be at home. \u201cWhat could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!\u201d was a wonder which introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs. Darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it. \u201cI must ask whether you were surprised?\u201d said Elizabeth. \u201cNot at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.\u201d \u201cThat is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.\u201d And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the case. \u201cOn the evening before my going to London,\u201d said he, \u201cI made a confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.\u201d Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend. \u201cDid you speak from your own observation,\u201d said she, \u201cwhen you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?\u201d \u201cFrom the former.", " Lady Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley, and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their communication with the Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine), had only set _that_ down as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked forward to as possible at some future time. In revolving Lady Catherine\u2019s expressions, however, she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would address him on his weakest side."], "Why does Lady Catherine de Bourgh come to visit the Bennet household?": [" \u201cLady Catherine de Bourgh,\u201d she replied, \u201chas very lately given him a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long.\u201d \u201cYou know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.\u201d \u201cNo, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine\u2019s connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday.\u201d \u201cHer daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.\u201d This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined for another. \u201cMr. Collins,\u201d said she, \u201cspeaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.\u201d \u201cI believe her to be both in a great degree,\u201d replied Wickham; \u201cI have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride for her nephew, who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class.\u201d Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham\u2019s attentions.", " Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her. She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two, to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself\u2014some shelves in the closet up stairs.\u201d \u201cThat is all very proper and civil, I am sure,\u201d said Mrs. Bennet, \u201cand I dare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?\u201d \u201cThe garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park, her ladyship\u2019s residence.\u201d \u201cI think you said she was a widow, sir? Has she any family?\u201d \u201cShe has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very extensive property.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, \u201cthen she is better off than many girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?\u201d \u201cShe is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex, because there is that in her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth.", " After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer. The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had promised; and, as he had likewise foretold, he took his seat at the bottom of the table, by her ladyship\u2019s desire, and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater. He carved, and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was commended, first by him and then by Sir William, who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh\u2014the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all dinner-time. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish, and fearing she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question, and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.", " Mr. Bingley\u2019s defense of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did before.\u201d She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Mr. Bingley\u2019s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them, and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery. \u201cI have found out,\u201d said he, \u201cby a singular accident, that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh, and of her mother Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with, perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do, and trust he will excuse my not having done it before."], "Who does Lady Catherine de Bourgh want Darcy to marry?": [" \u201cLady Catherine de Bourgh,\u201d she replied, \u201chas very lately given him a living.

No, never. Mr. Darcy is engaged to _my daughter_. Now what have you to say?\u201d \u201cOnly this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me.\u201d Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied: \u201cThe engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy, they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of _his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?\u201d \u201cYes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make another choice?", " After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer.

It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view.\u201d \u201cIt may do very well for the others,\u201d replied Mr. Bingley; \u201cbut I am sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won\u2019t it, Kitty?\u201d Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently consented. As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying: \u201cI am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is all for Jane\u2019s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to him, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to inconvenience.\u201d During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet\u2019s consent should be asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother\u2019s. She could not determine how her mother would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her disapprobation.", " Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land.\u2019 \u201cCan you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this? \u2018This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire,\u2014splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman\u2019s proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.\u2019 \u201cHave you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out: \u201c\u2018My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to imagine that his aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye.\u2019 \u201c_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_ surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in his life! It is admirable!\u201d Elizabeth tried to join in her father\u2019s pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile.", " All that I can promise you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In short, I will do my best.\u201d \u201cPerhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often. At least, you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.\u201d \u201cAs I did the other day,\u201d said Elizabeth with a conscious smile: \u201cvery true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week. You know my mother\u2019s ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied.\u201d Her aunt assured her that she was, and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without being resented. Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he took up his abode with the Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she \u201c_wished_ they might be happy.\u201d Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother\u2019s ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room.", " Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief; and the other that she herself had been barbarously misused by them all; and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could console and nothing could appease her. Nor did that day wear out her resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter. Mr. Bennet\u2019s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and more foolish than his daughter! Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable."], "Where do Jane and Bingley settle after their wedding?": [" And then, you know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he came back again in ten minutes\u2019 time, and then we all set out. However, I recollected afterwards that if he _had_ been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.\u201d \u201cMr. Darcy!\u201d repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement. \u201cOh, yes!\u2014he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!\u201d \u201cIf it was to be secret,\u201d said Jane, \u201csay not another word on the subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.\u201d \u201cOh! certainly,\u201d said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; \u201cwe will ask you no questions.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d said Lydia, \u201cfor if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry.\u201d On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away. But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her sister\u2019s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people, where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.", " With all these circumstances to favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many?\u201d \u201cWhat do you think of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?\u201d said Jane as she finished it. \u201cIs it not clear enough? Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she is perfectly convinced of her brother\u2019s indifference; and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?\u201d \u201cYes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?\u201d \u201cMost willingly.\u201d \u201cYou shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to town in hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you.\u201d Jane shook her head. \u201cIndeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot. She is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is this: We are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that when there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way.", " They repulsed every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of \u201cLord, how tired I am!\u201d accompanied by a violent yawn. When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time. Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months.", " Mr. Darcy\u2019s behaviour astonished and vexed her. \u201cWhy, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,\u201d said she, \u201cdid he come at all?\u201d She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure. \u201cHe could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt, when he was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If he no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing, man! I will think no more about him.\u201d Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look, which showed her better satisfied with their visitors, than Elizabeth. \u201cNow,\u201d said she, \u201cthat this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides, we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance.\u201d \u201cYes, very indifferent indeed,\u201d said Elizabeth, laughingly. \u201cOh, Jane, take care.\u201d \u201cMy dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger now?\u201d \u201cI think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever.\u201d They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour\u2019s visit, had revived. On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time."]}
