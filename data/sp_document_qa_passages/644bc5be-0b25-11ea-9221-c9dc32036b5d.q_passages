{"In \u201cAraby\u201d thenarrator travels to where at the end of the story?": [" The latter, a young man of about forty, was of Gabriel\u2019s size and build, with very round shoulders. His face was fleshy and pallid, touched with colour only at the thick hanging lobes of his ears and at the wide wings of his nose. He had coarse features, a blunt nose, a convex and receding brow, tumid and protruded lips. His heavy-lidded eyes and the disorder of his scanty hair made him look sleepy. He was laughing heartily in a high key at a story which he had been telling Gabriel on the stairs and at the same time rubbing the knuckles of his left fist backwards and forwards into his left eye. \u201cGood-evening, Freddy,\u201d said Aunt Julia. Freddy Malins bade the Misses Morkan good-evening in what seemed an offhand fashion by reason of the habitual catch in his voice and then, seeing that Mr Browne was grinning at him from the sideboard, crossed the room on rather shaky legs and began to repeat in an undertone the story he had just told to Gabriel. \u201cHe\u2019s not so bad, is he?\u201d said Aunt Kate to Gabriel. Gabriel\u2019s brows were dark but he raised them quickly and answered: \u201cO, no, hardly noticeable.\u201d \u201cNow, isn\u2019t he a terrible fellow!\u201d she said. \u201cAnd his poor mother made him take the pledge on New Year\u2019s Eve. But come on, Gabriel, into the drawing-room.\u201d Before leaving the room with Gabriel she signalled to Mr Browne by frowning and shaking her forefinger in warning to and fro. Mr Browne nodded in answer and, when she had gone, said to Freddy Malins: \u201cNow, then, Teddy, I\u2019m going to fill you out a good glass of lemonade just to buck you up.\u201d Freddy Malins, who was nearing the climax of his story, waved the offer aside impatiently but Mr Browne, having first called Freddy Malins\u2019 attention to a disarray in his dress, filled out and handed him a full glass of lemonade.", " \u201cIt\u2019s six of one and half-a-dozen of the other. You ask Hogan, my boy. I showed him a bit about London when he was over there. He\u2019d open your eye.... I say, Tommy, don\u2019t make punch of that whisky: liquor up.\u201d \u201cNo, really....\u201d \u201cO, come on, another one won\u2019t do you any harm. What is it? The same again, I suppose?\u201d \u201cWell ... all right.\u201d \u201c_Fran\u00e7ois_, the same again.... Will you smoke, Tommy?\u201d Ignatius Gallaher produced his cigar-case. The two friends lit their cigars and puffed at them in silence until their drinks were served. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you my opinion,\u201d said Ignatius Gallaher, emerging after some time from the clouds of smoke in which he had taken refuge, \u201cit\u2019s a rum world. Talk of immorality! I\u2019ve heard of cases\u2014what am I saying?\u2014I\u2019ve known them: cases of ... immorality....\u201d Ignatius Gallaher puffed thoughtfully at his cigar and then, in a calm historian\u2019s tone, he proceeded to sketch for his friend some pictures of the corruption which was rife abroad. He summarised the vices of many capitals and seemed inclined to award the palm to Berlin. Some things he could not vouch for (his friends had told him), but of others he had had personal experience. He spared neither rank nor caste. He revealed many of the secrets of religious houses on the Continent and described some of the practices which were fashionable in high society and ended by telling, with details, a story about an English duchess\u2014a story which he knew to be true.", " Farrington stood a drink in his turn. After a while O\u2019Halloran and Paddy Leonard came in and the story was repeated to them. O\u2019Halloran stood tailors of malt, hot, all round and told the story of the retort he had made to the chief clerk when he was in Callan\u2019s of Fownes\u2019s Street; but, as the retort was after the manner of the liberal shepherds in the eclogues, he had to admit that it was not as clever as Farrington\u2019s retort. At this Farrington told the boys to polish off that and have another. Just as they were naming their poisons who should come in but Higgins! Of course he had to join in with the others. The men asked him to give his version of it, and he did so with great vivacity for the sight of five small hot whiskies was very exhilarating. Everyone roared laughing when he showed the way in which Mr Alleyne shook his fist in Farrington\u2019s face. Then he imitated Farrington, saying, _\u201cAnd here was my nabs, as cool as you please,\u201d_ while Farrington looked at the company out of his heavy dirty eyes, smiling and at times drawing forth stray drops of liquor from his moustache with the aid of his lower lip. When that round was over there was a pause. O\u2019Halloran had money but neither of the other two seemed to have any; so the whole party left the shop somewhat regretfully. At the corner of Duke Street Higgins and Nosey Flynn bevelled off to the left while the other three turned back towards the city.", " And if a boy had a girl for a sweetheart and told lies about it then he would give him such a whipping as no boy ever got in this world. He said that there was nothing in this world he would like so well as that. He described to me how he would whip such a boy as if he were unfolding some elaborate mystery. He would love that, he said, better than anything in this world; and his voice, as he led me monotonously through the mystery, grew almost affectionate and seemed to plead with me that I should understand him. I waited till his monologue paused again. Then I stood up abruptly. Lest I should betray my agitation I delayed a few moments pretending to fix my shoe properly and then, saying that I was obliged to go, I bade him good-day. I went up the slope calmly but my heart was beating quickly with fear that he would seize me by the ankles. When I reached the top of the slope I turned round and, without looking at him, called loudly across the field: \u201cMurphy!\u201d My voice had an accent of forced bravery in it and I was ashamed of my paltry stratagem. I had to call the name again before Mahony saw me and hallooed in answer. How my heart beat as he came running across the field to me! He ran as if to bring me aid. And I was penitent; for in my heart I had always despised him a little.

Captain Sinico, of Leoville, Sydney Parade, husband of the deceased, also gave evidence. He stated that the deceased was his wife. He was not in Dublin at the time of the accident as he had arrived only that morning from Rotterdam. They had been married for twenty-two years and had lived happily until about two years ago when his wife began to be rather intemperate in her habits. Miss Mary Sinico said that of late her mother had been in the habit of going out at night to buy spirits. She, witness, had often tried to reason with her mother and had induced her to join a league. She was not at home until an hour after the accident. The jury returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence and exonerated Lennon from all blame. The Deputy Coroner said it was a most painful case, and expressed great sympathy with Captain Sinico and his daughter. He urged on the railway company to take strong measures to prevent the possibility of similar accidents in the future. No blame attached to anyone. Mr Duffy raised his eyes from the paper and gazed out of his window on the cheerless evening landscape. The river lay quiet beside the empty distillery and from time to time a light appeared in some house on the Lucan road.", " Then she played the prelude and said _\u201cNow, Maria!\u201d_ and Maria, blushing very much began to sing in a tiny quavering voice. She sang _I Dreamt that I Dwelt_, and when she came to the second verse she sang again: _I dreamt that I dwelt in marble halls With vassals and serfs at my side And of all who assembled within those walls That I was the hope and the pride. I had riches too great to count, could boast Of a high ancestral name, But I also dreamt, which pleased me most, That you loved me still the same._ But no one tried to show her her mistake; and when she had ended her song Joe was very much moved. He said that there was no time like the long ago and no music for him like poor old Balfe, whatever other people might say; and his eyes filled up so much with tears that he could not find what he was looking for and in the end he had to ask his wife to tell him where the corkscrew was. A PAINFUL CASE Mr James Duffy lived in Chapelizod because he wished to live as far as possible from the city of which he was a citizen and because he found all the other suburbs of Dublin mean, modern and pretentious. He lived in an old sombre house and from his windows he could look into the disused distillery or upwards along the shallow river on which Dublin is built. The lofty walls of his uncarpeted room were free from pictures. He had himself bought every article of furniture in the room: a black iron bedstead, an iron washstand, four cane chairs, a clothes-rack, a coal-scuttle, a fender and irons and a square table on which lay a double desk.", " The cabbage began to deposit a cold white grease on his plate. The girl came over to him to ask was his dinner not properly cooked. He said it was very good and ate a few mouthfuls of it with difficulty. Then he paid his bill and went out. He walked along quickly through the November twilight, his stout hazel stick striking the ground regularly, the fringe of the buff _Mail_ peeping out of a side-pocket of his tight reefer overcoat. On the lonely road which leads from the Parkgate to Chapelizod he slackened his pace. His stick struck the ground less emphatically and his breath, issuing irregularly, almost with a sighing sound, condensed in the wintry air. When he reached his house he went up at once to his bedroom and, taking the paper from his pocket, read the paragraph again by the failing light of the window. He read it not aloud, but moving his lips as a priest does when he reads the prayers _Secreto_. This was the paragraph: DEATH OF A LADY AT SYDNEY PARADE A PAINFUL CASE Today at the City of Dublin Hospital the Deputy Coroner (in the absence of Mr Leverett) held an inquest on the body of Mrs Emily Sinico, aged forty-three years, who was killed at Sydney Parade Station yesterday evening. The evidence showed that the deceased lady, while attempting to cross the line, was knocked down by the engine of the ten o\u2019clock slow train from Kingstown, thereby sustaining injuries of the head and right side which led to her death.", " He met her again a few weeks afterwards at a concert in Earlsfort Terrace and seized the moments when her daughter\u2019s attention was diverted to become intimate. She alluded once or twice to her husband but her tone was not such as to make the allusion a warning. Her name was Mrs Sinico. Her husband\u2019s great-great-grandfather had come from Leghorn. Her husband was captain of a mercantile boat plying between Dublin and Holland; and they had one child. Meeting her a third time by accident he found courage to make an appointment. She came. This was the first of many meetings; they met always in the evening and chose the most quiet quarters for their walks together. Mr Duffy, however, had a distaste for underhand ways and, finding that they were compelled to meet stealthily, he forced her to ask him to her house. Captain Sinico encouraged his visits, thinking that his daughter\u2019s hand was in question. He had dismissed his wife so sincerely from his gallery of pleasures that he did not suspect that anyone else would take an interest in her. As the husband was often away and the daughter out giving music lessons Mr Duffy had many opportunities of enjoying the lady\u2019s society. Neither he nor she had had any such adventure before and neither was conscious of any incongruity. Little by little he entangled his thoughts with hers. He lent her books, provided her with ideas, shared his intellectual life with her."], "Which Irish nationalfigure is celebrated in \u201cIvy Day in the Committee Room\u201d?": [" \u201cI agree with Miss Beirne,\u201d said Mr O\u2019Madden Burke. \u201cPay her nothing.\u201d In another corner of the room were Mrs Kearney and her husband, Mr Bell, Miss Healy and the young lady who had to recite the patriotic piece. Mrs Kearney said that the Committee had treated her scandalously. She had spared neither trouble nor expense and this was how she was repaid. They thought they had only a girl to deal with and that, therefore, they could ride roughshod over her. But she would show them their mistake. They wouldn\u2019t have dared to have treated her like that if she had been a man. But she would see that her daughter got her rights: she wouldn\u2019t be fooled. If they didn\u2019t pay her to the last farthing she would make Dublin ring. Of course she was sorry for the sake of the _artistes_. But what else could she do? She appealed to the second tenor who said he thought she had not been well treated. Then she appealed to Miss Healy. Miss Healy wanted to join the other group but she did not like to do so because she was a great friend of Kathleen\u2019s and the Kearneys had often invited her to their house. As soon as the first part was ended Mr Fitzpatrick and Mr Holohan went over to Mrs Kearney and told her that the other four guineas would be paid after the Committee meeting on the following Tuesday and that, in case her daughter did not play for the second part, the Committee would consider the contract broken and would pay nothing.", " \u201cDid Mr Tierney say when he\u2019d be back?\u201d he asked in a husky falsetto. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say.\u201d Mr O\u2019Connor put his cigarette into his mouth and began to search his pockets. He took out a pack of thin pasteboard cards. \u201cI\u2019ll get you a match,\u201d said the old man. \u201cNever mind, this\u2019ll do,\u201d said Mr O\u2019Connor. He selected one of the cards and read what was printed on it: MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS ROYAL EXCHANGE WARD Mr Richard J. Tierney, P.L.G., respectfully solicits the favour of your vote and influence at the coming election in the Royal Exchange Ward. Mr O\u2019Connor had been engaged by Tierney\u2019s agent to canvass one part of the ward but, as the weather was inclement and his boots let in the wet, he spent a great part of the day sitting by the fire in the Committee Room in Wicklow Street with Jack, the old caretaker. They had been sitting thus since the short day had grown dark. It was the sixth of October, dismal and cold out of doors. Mr O\u2019Connor tore a strip off the card and, lighting it, lit his cigarette. As he did so the flame lit up a leaf of dark glossy ivy in the lapel of his coat. The old man watched him attentively and then, taking up the piece of cardboard again, began to fan the fire slowly while his companion smoked. \u201cAh, yes,\u201d he said, continuing, \u201cit\u2019s hard to know what way to bring up children. Now who\u2019d think he\u2019d turn out like that! I sent him to the Christian Brothers and I done what I could for him, and there he goes boosing about.", " He turned back the way he had come, the rhythm of the engine pounding in his ears. He began to doubt the reality of what memory told him. He halted under a tree and allowed the rhythm to die away. He could not feel her near him in the darkness nor her voice touch his ear. He waited for some minutes listening. He could hear nothing: the night was perfectly silent. He listened again: perfectly silent. He felt that he was alone. IVY DAY IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM Old Jack raked the cinders together with a piece of cardboard and spread them judiciously over the whitening dome of coals. When the dome was thinly covered his face lapsed into darkness but, as he set himself to fan the fire again, his crouching shadow ascended the opposite wall and his face slowly re-emerged into light. It was an old man\u2019s face, very bony and hairy. The moist blue eyes blinked at the fire and the moist mouth fell open at times, munching once or twice mechanically when it closed. When the cinders had caught he laid the piece of cardboard against the wall, sighed and said: \u201cThat\u2019s better now, Mr O\u2019Connor.\u201d Mr O\u2019Connor, a grey-haired young man, whose face was disfigured by many blotches and pimples, had just brought the tobacco for a cigarette into a shapely cylinder but when spoken to he undid his handiwork meditatively.

A volume of Byron\u2019s poems lay before him on the table. He opened it cautiously with his left hand lest he should waken the child and began to read the first poem in the book: _Hushed are the winds and still the evening gloom, Not e\u2019en a Zephyr wanders through the grove, Whilst I return to view my Margaret\u2019s tomb And scatter flowers on the dust I love._ He paused. He felt the rhythm of the verse about him in the room. How melancholy it was! Could he, too, write like that, express the melancholy of his soul in verse? There were so many things he wanted to describe: his sensation of a few hours before on Grattan Bridge, for example. If he could get back again into that mood.... The child awoke and began to cry. He turned from the page and tried to hush it: but it would not be hushed. He began to rock it to and fro in his arms but its wailing cry grew keener. He rocked it faster while his eyes began to read the second stanza: _Within this narrow cell reclines her clay, That clay where once...._ It was useless. He couldn\u2019t read. He couldn\u2019t do anything. The wailing of the child pierced the drum of his ear. It was useless, useless! He was a prisoner for life. His arms trembled with anger and suddenly bending to the child\u2019s face he shouted: \u201cStop!\u201d The child stopped for an instant, had a spasm of fright and began to scream.", " *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DUBLINERS *** Produced by David Reed, Karol Pietrzak, and David Widger cover DUBLINERS by James Joyce Contents The Sisters An Encounter Araby Eveline After the Race Two Gallants The Boarding House A Little Cloud Counterparts Clay A Painful Case Ivy Day in the Committee Room A Mother Grace The Dead THE SISTERS There was no hope for him this time: it was the third stroke.

These barmbracks seemed uncut; but if you went closer you would see that they had been cut into long thick even slices and were ready to be handed round at tea. Maria had cut them herself. Maria was a very, very small person indeed but she had a very long nose and a very long chin. She talked a little through her nose, always soothingly: _\u201cYes, my dear,\u201d_ and _\u201cNo, my dear.\u201d_ She was always sent for when the women quarrelled over their tubs and always succeeded in making peace.

Sometimes he could be very nice. Not long before, when she had been laid up for a day, he had read her out a ghost story and made toast for her at the fire. Another day, when their mother was alive, they had all gone for a picnic to the Hill of Howth. She remembered her father putting on her mother\u2019s bonnet to make the children laugh.

And now she had nobody to protect her. Ernest was dead and Harry, who was in the church decorating business, was nearly always down somewhere in the country. Besides, the invariable squabble for money on Saturday nights had begun to weary her unspeakably.

The streets, shuttered for the repose of Sunday, swarmed with a gaily coloured crowd. Like illumined pearls the lamps shone from the summits of their tall poles upon the living texture below which, changing shape and hue unceasingly, sent up into the warm grey evening air an unchanging unceasing murmur. Two young men came down the hill of Rutland Square. One of them was just bringing a long monologue to a close. The other, who walked on the verge of the path and was at times obliged to step on to the road, owing to his companion\u2019s rudeness, wore an amused listening face. He was squat and ruddy. A yachting cap was shoved far back from his forehead and the narrative to which he listened made constant waves of expression break forth over his face from the corners of his nose and eyes and mouth. Little jets of wheezing laughter followed one another out of his convulsed body. His eyes, twinkling with cunning enjoyment, glanced at every moment towards his companion\u2019s face.

They succeeded in turning him over. His hat had rolled a few yards away and his clothes were smeared with the filth and ooze of the floor on which he had lain, face downwards. His eyes were closed and he breathed with a grunting noise. A thin stream of blood trickled from the corner of his mouth. These two gentlemen and one of the curates carried him up the stairs and laid him down again on the floor of the bar. In two minutes he was surrounded by a ring of men. The manager of the bar asked everyone who he was and who was with him.

They had to go visiting together and, as he had not answered her, Miss Ivors said warmly: \u201cOf course, you\u2019ve no answer.\u201d Gabriel tried to cover his agitation by taking part in the dance with great energy. He avoided her eyes for he had seen a sour expression on her face. But when they met in the long chain he was surprised to feel his hand firmly pressed. She looked at him from under her brows for a moment quizzically until he smiled. Then, just as the chain was about to start again, she stood on tiptoe and whispered into his ear: \u201cWest Briton!\u201d When the lancers were over Gabriel went away to a remote corner of the room where Freddy Malins\u2019 mother was sitting. She was a stout feeble old woman with white hair. Her voice had a catch in it like her son\u2019s and she stuttered slightly. She had been told that Freddy had come and that he was nearly all right. Gabriel asked her whether she had had a good crossing. She lived with her married daughter in Glasgow and came to Dublin on a visit once a year. She answered placidly that she had had a beautiful crossing and that the captain had been most attentive to her.", " She spoke also of the beautiful house her daughter kept in Glasgow, and of all the friends they had there. While her tongue rambled on Gabriel tried to banish from his mind all memory of the unpleasant incident with Miss Ivors. Of course the girl or woman, or whatever she was, was an enthusiast but there was a time for all things. Perhaps he ought not to have answered her like that. But she had no right to call him a West Briton before people, even in joke. She had tried to make him ridiculous before people, heckling him and staring at him with her rabbit\u2019s eyes. He saw his wife making her way towards him through the waltzing couples. When she reached him she said into his ear: \u201cGabriel, Aunt Kate wants to know won\u2019t you carve the goose as usual. Miss Daly will carve the ham and I\u2019ll do the pudding.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d said Gabriel. \u201cShe\u2019s sending in the younger ones first as soon as this waltz is over so that we\u2019ll have the table to ourselves.\u201d \u201cWere you dancing?\u201d asked Gabriel. \u201cOf course I was.

He\u2019s full of conceit, I think.\u201d \u201cThere was no row,\u201d said Gabriel moodily, \u201conly she wanted me to go for a trip to the west of Ireland and I said I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d His wife clasped her hands excitedly and gave a little jump. \u201cO, do go, Gabriel,\u201d she cried.", " \u201cPerhaps that was why you wanted to go to Galway with that Ivors girl?\u201d he said coldly. She looked at him and asked in surprise: \u201cWhat for?\u201d Her eyes made Gabriel feel awkward. He shrugged his shoulders and said: \u201cHow do I know? To see him, perhaps.\u201d She looked away from him along the shaft of light towards the window in silence. \u201cHe is dead,\u201d she said at length. \u201cHe died when he was only seventeen. Isn\u2019t it a terrible thing to die so young as that?\u201d \u201cWhat was he?\u201d asked Gabriel, still ironically. \u201cHe was in the gasworks,\u201d she said. Gabriel felt humiliated by the failure of his irony and by the evocation of this figure from the dead, a boy in the gasworks. While he had been full of memories of their secret life together, full of tenderness and joy and desire, she had been comparing him in her mind with another. A shameful consciousness of his own person assailed him. He saw himself as a ludicrous figure, acting as a pennyboy for his aunts, a nervous, well-meaning sentimentalist, orating to vulgarians and idealising his own clownish lusts, the pitiable fatuous fellow he had caught a glimpse of in the mirror. Instinctively he turned his back more to the light lest she might see the shame that burned upon his forehead. He tried to keep up his tone of cold interrogation, but his voice when he spoke was humble and indifferent. \u201cI suppose you were in love with this Michael Furey, Gretta,\u201d he said.", " But the only thing they would not stand was back answers. Of course they had good reason to be fussy on such a night. And then it was long after ten o\u2019clock and yet there was no sign of Gabriel and his wife. Besides they were dreadfully afraid that Freddy Malins might turn up screwed. They would not wish for worlds that any of Mary Jane\u2019s pupils should see him under the influence; and when he was like that it was sometimes very hard to manage him. Freddy Malins always came late but they wondered what could be keeping Gabriel: and that was what brought them every two minutes to the banisters to ask Lily had Gabriel or Freddy come. \u201cO, Mr Conroy,\u201d said Lily to Gabriel when she opened the door for him, \u201cMiss Kate and Miss Julia thought you were never coming. Good-night, Mrs Conroy.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll engage they did,\u201d said Gabriel, \u201cbut they forget that my wife here takes three mortal hours to dress herself.\u201d He stood on the mat, scraping the snow from his goloshes, while Lily led his wife to the foot of the stairs and called out: \u201cMiss Kate, here\u2019s Mrs Conroy.\u201d Kate and Julia came toddling down the dark stairs at once. Both of them kissed Gabriel\u2019s wife, said she must be perished alive and asked was Gabriel with her. \u201cHere I am as right as the mail, Aunt Kate! Go on up. I\u2019ll follow,\u201d called out Gabriel from the dark. He continued scraping his feet vigorously while the three women went upstairs, laughing, to the ladies\u2019 dressing-room."], "Where does TomKernan fall in \u201cGrace\u201d?": [" I listened to the fall of the coins.

I heard her.\u201d \u201cO, there\u2019s a ... fib!\u201d Observing me the young lady came over and asked me did I wish to buy anything. The tone of her voice was not encouraging; she seemed to have spoken to me out of a sense of duty. I looked humbly at the great jars that stood like eastern guards at either side of the dark entrance to the stall and murmured: \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d The young lady changed the position of one of the vases and went back to the two young men. They began to talk of the same subject. Once or twice the young lady glanced at me over her shoulder. I lingered before her stall, though I knew my stay was useless, to make my interest in her wares seem the more real. Then I turned away slowly and walked down the middle of the bazaar. I allowed the two pennies to fall against the sixpence in my pocket. I heard a voice call from one end of the gallery that the light was out. The upper part of the hall was now completely dark. Gazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature driven and derided by vanity; and my eyes burned with anguish and anger.", " James Lennon, driver of the engine, stated that he had been in the employment of the railway company for fifteen years. On hearing the guard\u2019s whistle he set the train in motion and a second or two afterwards brought it to rest in response to loud cries. The train was going slowly. P. Dunne, railway porter, stated that as the train was about to start he observed a woman attempting to cross the lines. He ran towards her and shouted, but, before he could reach her, she was caught by the buffer of the engine and fell to the ground. _A juror_. \u201cYou saw the lady fall?\u201d _Witness_. \u201cYes.\u201d Police Sergeant Croly deposed that when he arrived he found the deceased lying on the platform apparently dead. He had the body taken to the waiting-room pending the arrival of the ambulance. Constable 57E corroborated. Dr Halpin, assistant house surgeon of the City of Dublin Hospital, stated that the deceased had two lower ribs fractured and had sustained severe contusions of the right shoulder. The right side of the head had been injured in the fall. The injuries were not sufficient to have caused death in a normal person. Death, in his opinion, had been probably due to shock and sudden failure of the heart\u2019s action. Mr H. B. Patterson Finlay, on behalf of the railway company, expressed his deep regret at the accident. The company had always taken every precaution to prevent people crossing the lines except by the bridges, both by placing notices in every station and by the use of patent spring gates at level crossings.", " He was going to study singing only for his health. He had a very good voice, poor Michael Furey.\u201d \u201cWell; and then?\u201d asked Gabriel. \u201cAnd then when it came to the time for me to leave Galway and come up to the convent he was much worse and I wouldn\u2019t be let see him so I wrote him a letter saying I was going up to Dublin and would be back in the summer and hoping he would be better then.\u201d She paused for a moment to get her voice under control and then went on: \u201cThen the night before I left I was in my grandmother\u2019s house in Nuns\u2019 Island, packing up, and I heard gravel thrown up against the window. The window was so wet I couldn\u2019t see so I ran downstairs as I was and slipped out the back into the garden and there was the poor fellow at the end of the garden, shivering.\u201d \u201cAnd did you not tell him to go back?\u201d asked Gabriel. \u201cI implored of him to go home at once and told him he would get his death in the rain. But he said he did not want to live. I can see his eyes as well as well! He was standing at the end of the wall where there was a tree.\u201d \u201cAnd did he go home?\u201d asked Gabriel. \u201cYes, he went home. And when I was only a week in the convent he died and he was buried in Oughterard where his people came from. O, the day I heard that, that he was dead!\u201d She stopped, choking with sobs and, overcome by emotion, flung herself face downward on the bed, sobbing in the quilt. Gabriel held her hand for a moment longer, irresolutely, and then, shy of intruding on her grief, let it fall gently and walked quietly to the window.", " He said they were to leave the report for him at the _Freeman_ office and he would see that it went in. He was a grey-haired man, with a plausible voice and careful manners. He held an extinguished cigar in his hand and the aroma of cigar smoke floated near him. He had not intended to stay a moment because concerts and _artistes_ bored him considerably but he remained leaning against the mantelpiece. Miss Healy stood in front of him, talking and laughing. He was old enough to suspect one reason for her politeness but young enough in spirit to turn the moment to account. The warmth, fragrance and colour of her body appealed to his senses. He was pleasantly conscious that the bosom which he saw rise and fall slowly beneath him rose and fell at that moment for him, that the laughter and fragrance and wilful glances were his tribute. When he could stay no longer he took leave of her regretfully. \u201cO\u2019Madden Burke will write the notice,\u201d he explained to Mr Holohan, \u201cand I\u2019ll see it in.\u201d \u201cThank you very much, Mr Hendrick,\u201d said Mr Holohan, \u201cyou\u2019ll see it in, I know. Now, won\u2019t you have a little something before you go?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d said Mr Hendrick. The two men went along some tortuous passages and up a dark staircase and came to a secluded room where one of the stewards was uncorking bottles for a few gentlemen. One of these gentlemen was Mr O\u2019Madden Burke, who had found out the room by instinct."], "What capturesGretta\u2019s attention while the other guests leave the Morkan partyin \u201cThe Dead\u201d?": [" The pudding was of Aunt Julia\u2019s making and she received praises for it from all quarters. She herself said that it was not quite brown enough. \u201cWell, I hope, Miss Morkan,\u201d said Mr Browne, \u201cthat I\u2019m brown enough for you because, you know, I\u2019m all brown.\u201d All the gentlemen, except Gabriel, ate some of the pudding out of compliment to Aunt Julia. As Gabriel never ate sweets the celery had been left for him. Freddy Malins also took a stalk of celery and ate it with his pudding. He had been told that celery was a capital thing for the blood and he was just then under doctor\u2019s care. Mrs Malins, who had been silent all through the supper, said that her son was going down to Mount Melleray in a week or so. The table then spoke of Mount Melleray, how bracing the air was down there, how hospitable the monks were and how they never asked for a penny-piece from their guests. \u201cAnd do you mean to say,\u201d asked Mr Browne incredulously, \u201cthat a chap can go down there and put up there as if it were a hotel and live on the fat of the land and then come away without paying anything?\u201d \u201cO, most people give some donation to the monastery when they leave.\u201d said Mary Jane. \u201cI wish we had an institution like that in our Church,\u201d said Mr Browne candidly. He was astonished to hear that the monks never spoke, got up at two in the morning and slept in their coffins. He asked what they did it for. \u201cThat\u2019s the rule of the order,\u201d said Aunt Kate firmly.", " \u201cYes, but why?\u201d asked Mr Browne. Aunt Kate repeated that it was the rule, that was all. Mr Browne still seemed not to understand. Freddy Malins explained to him, as best he could, that the monks were trying to make up for the sins committed by all the sinners in the outside world. The explanation was not very clear for Mr Browne grinned and said: \u201cI like that idea very much but wouldn\u2019t a comfortable spring bed do them as well as a coffin?\u201d \u201cThe coffin,\u201d said Mary Jane, \u201cis to remind them of their last end.\u201d As the subject had grown lugubrious it was buried in a silence of the table during which Mrs Malins could be heard saying to her neighbour in an indistinct undertone: \u201cThey are very good men, the monks, very pious men.\u201d The raisins and almonds and figs and apples and oranges and chocolates and sweets were now passed about the table and Aunt Julia invited all the guests to have either port or sherry. At first Mr Bartell D\u2019Arcy refused to take either but one of his neighbours nudged him and whispered something to him upon which he allowed his glass to be filled. Gradually as the last glasses were being filled the conversation ceased. A pause followed, broken only by the noise of the wine and by unsettlings of chairs. The Misses Morkan, all three, looked down at the tablecloth. Someone coughed once or twice and then a few gentlemen patted the table gently as a signal for silence.", " EVELINE She sat at the window watching the evening invade the avenue. Her head was leaned against the window curtains and in her nostrils was the odour of dusty cretonne. She was tired. Few people passed. The man out of the last house passed on his way home; she heard his footsteps clacking along the concrete pavement and afterwards crunching on the cinder path before the new red houses. One time there used to be a field there in which they used to play every evening with other people\u2019s children. Then a man from Belfast bought the field and built houses in it\u2014not like their little brown houses but bright brick houses with shining roofs. The children of the avenue used to play together in that field\u2014the Devines, the Waters, the Dunns, little Keogh the cripple, she and her brothers and sisters. Ernest, however, never played: he was too grown up. Her father used often to hunt them in out of the field with his blackthorn stick; but usually little Keogh used to keep _nix_ and call out when he saw her father coming. Still they seemed to have been rather happy then. Her father was not so bad then; and besides, her mother was alive. That was a long time ago; she and her brothers and sisters were all grown up; her mother was dead. Tizzie Dunn was dead, too, and the Waters had gone back to England. Everything changes. Now she was going to go away like the others, to leave her home. Home!", " He raised his glass of port gallantly, while every member of the company fingered a glass expectantly, and said loudly: \u201cLet us toast them all three together. Let us drink to their health, wealth, long life, happiness and prosperity and may they long continue to hold the proud and self-won position which they hold in their profession and the position of honour and affection which they hold in our hearts.\u201d All the guests stood up, glass in hand, and turning towards the three seated ladies, sang in unison, with Mr Browne as leader: For they are jolly gay fellows, For they are jolly gay fellows, For they are jolly gay fellows, Which nobody can deny. Aunt Kate was making frank use of her handkerchief and even Aunt Julia seemed moved. Freddy Malins beat time with his pudding-fork and the singers turned towards one another, as if in melodious conference, while they sang with emphasis: Unless he tells a lie, Unless he tells a lie. Then, turning once more towards their hostesses, they sang: For they are jolly gay fellows, For they are jolly gay fellows, For they are jolly gay fellows, Which nobody can deny. The acclamation which followed was taken up beyond the door of the supper-room by many of the other guests and renewed time after time, Freddy Malins acting as officer with his fork on high. The piercing morning air came into the hall where they were standing so that Aunt Kate said: \u201cClose the door, somebody."], "Who is referredto as \u201cThe Madam\u201d in \u201cThe Boarding House\u201d?": [" One night he went for his wife with the cleaver and she had to sleep in a neighbour\u2019s house. After that they lived apart. She went to the priest and got a separation from him with care of the children. She would give him neither money nor food nor house-room; and so he was obliged to enlist himself as a sheriff\u2019s man. He was a shabby stooped little drunkard with a white face and a white moustache and white eyebrows, pencilled above his little eyes, which were pink-veined and raw; and all day long he sat in the bailiff\u2019s room, waiting to be put on a job. Mrs Mooney, who had taken what remained of her money out of the butcher business and set up a boarding house in Hardwicke Street, was a big imposing woman. Her house had a floating population made up of tourists from Liverpool and the Isle of Man and, occasionally, _artistes_ from the music-halls. Its resident population was made up of clerks from the city. She governed her house cunningly and firmly, knew when to give credit, when to be stern and when to let things pass. All the resident young men spoke of her as _The Madam_. Mrs Mooney\u2019s young men paid fifteen shillings a week for board and lodgings (beer or stout at dinner excluded). They shared in common tastes and occupations and for this reason they were very chummy with one another. They discussed with one another the chances of favourites and outsiders. Jack Mooney, the Madam\u2019s son, who was clerk to a commission agent in Fleet Street, had the reputation of being a hard case.", " Mr Bell laughed at his fellow-sufferer, held out his hand and said: \u201cShake!\u201d Mrs Kearney passed by these two young men and went to the edge of the screen to view the house. The seats were being filled up rapidly and a pleasant noise circulated in the auditorium. She came back and spoke to her husband privately. Their conversation was evidently about Kathleen for they both glanced at her often as she stood chatting to one of her Nationalist friends, Miss Healy, the contralto. An unknown solitary woman with a pale face walked through the room. The women followed with keen eyes the faded blue dress which was stretched upon a meagre body. Someone said that she was Madam Glynn, the soprano. \u201cI wonder where did they dig her up,\u201d said Kathleen to Miss Healy. \u201cI\u2019m sure I never heard of her.\u201d Miss Healy had to smile. Mr Holohan limped into the dressing-room at that moment and the two young ladies asked him who was the unknown woman. Mr Holohan said that she was Madam Glynn from London. Madam Glynn took her stand in a corner of the room, holding a roll of music stiffly before her and from time to time changing the direction of her startled gaze. The shadow took her faded dress into shelter but fell revengefully into the little cup behind her collar-bone. The noise of the hall became more audible. The first tenor and the baritone arrived together. They were both well dressed, stout and complacent and they brought a breath of opulence among the company.", " Things went on so for a long time and Mrs Mooney began to think of sending Polly back to typewriting when she noticed that something was going on between Polly and one of the young men. She watched the pair and kept her own counsel. Polly knew that she was being watched, but still her mother\u2019s persistent silence could not be misunderstood. There had been no open complicity between mother and daughter, no open understanding but, though people in the house began to talk of the affair, still Mrs Mooney did not intervene. Polly began to grow a little strange in her manner and the young man was evidently perturbed. At last, when she judged it to be the right moment, Mrs Mooney intervened. She dealt with moral problems as a cleaver deals with meat: and in this case she had made up her mind. It was a bright Sunday morning of early summer, promising heat, but with a fresh breeze blowing. All the windows of the boarding house were open and the lace curtains ballooned gently towards the street beneath the raised sashes. The belfry of George\u2019s Church sent out constant peals and worshippers, singly or in groups, traversed the little circus before the church, revealing their purpose by their self-contained demeanour no less than by the little volumes in their gloved hands. Breakfast was over in the boarding house and the table of the breakfast-room was covered with plates on which lay yellow streaks of eggs with morsels of bacon-fat and bacon-rind.", " But that was all passed and done with ... nearly. He still bought a copy of _Reynolds\u2019s Newspaper_ every week but he attended to his religious duties and for nine-tenths of the year lived a regular life. He had money enough to settle down on; it was not that. But the family would look down on her. First of all there was her disreputable father and then her mother\u2019s boarding house was beginning to get a certain fame. He had a notion that he was being had. He could imagine his friends talking of the affair and laughing. She _was_ a little vulgar; sometimes she said \u201cI seen\u201d and \u201cIf I had\u2019ve known.\u201d But what would grammar matter if he really loved her? He could not make up his mind whether to like her or despise her for what she had done. Of course he had done it too. His instinct urged him to remain free, not to marry. Once you are married you are done for, it said. While he was sitting helplessly on the side of the bed in shirt and trousers she tapped lightly at his door and entered. She told him all, that she had made a clean breast of it to her mother and that her mother would speak with him that morning. She cried and threw her arms round his neck, saying: \u201cO Bob! Bob! What am I to do? What am I to do at all?\u201d She would put an end to herself, she said. He comforted her feebly, telling her not to cry, that it would be all right, never fear. He felt against his shirt the agitation of her bosom."], "What does Mariado at the end of \u201cClay\u201d that makes Joe Donnelly cry?": [" They led her up to the table amid laughing and joking and she put her hand out in the air as she was told to do. She moved her hand about here and there in the air and descended on one of the saucers. She felt a soft wet substance with her fingers and was surprised that nobody spoke or took off her bandage. There was a pause for a few seconds; and then a great deal of scuffling and whispering. Somebody said something about the garden, and at last Mrs Donnelly said something very cross to one of the next-door girls and told her to throw it out at once: that was no play. Maria understood that it was wrong that time and so she had to do it over again: and this time she got the prayer-book. After that Mrs Donnelly played Miss McCloud\u2019s Reel for the children and Joe made Maria take a glass of wine. Soon they were all quite merry again and Mrs Donnelly said Maria would enter a convent before the year was out because she had got the prayer-book. Maria had never seen Joe so nice to her as he was that night, so full of pleasant talk and reminiscences. She said they were all very good to her. At last the children grew tired and sleepy and Joe asked Maria would she not sing some little song before she went, one of the old songs. Mrs Donnelly said _\u201cDo, please, Maria!\u201d_ and so Maria had to get up and stand beside the piano. Mrs Donnelly bade the children be quiet and listen to Maria\u2019s song.", " Then Joe asked would she take a bottle of stout and Mrs Donnelly said there was port wine too in the house if she would prefer that. Maria said she would rather they didn\u2019t ask her to take anything: but Joe insisted. So Maria let him have his way and they sat by the fire talking over old times and Maria thought she would put in a good word for Alphy. But Joe cried that God might strike him stone dead if ever he spoke a word to his brother again and Maria said she was sorry she had mentioned the matter. Mrs Donnelly told her husband it was a great shame for him to speak that way of his own flesh and blood but Joe said that Alphy was no brother of his and there was nearly being a row on the head of it. But Joe said he would not lose his temper on account of the night it was and asked his wife to open some more stout. The two next-door girls had arranged some Hallow Eve games and soon everything was merry again. Maria was delighted to see the children so merry and Joe and his wife in such good spirits. The next-door girls put some saucers on the table and then led the children up to the table, blindfold. One got the prayer-book and the other three got the water; and when one of the next-door girls got the ring Mrs Donnelly shook her finger at the blushing girl as much as to say: _O, I know all about it!_ They insisted then on blindfolding Maria and leading her up to the table to see what she would get; and, while they were putting on the bandage, Maria laughed and laughed again till the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of her chin.", " Then she asked all the children had any of them eaten it\u2014by mistake, of course\u2014but the children all said no and looked as if they did not like to eat cakes if they were to be accused of stealing. Everybody had a solution for the mystery and Mrs Donnelly said it was plain that Maria had left it behind her in the tram. Maria, remembering how confused the gentleman with the greyish moustache had made her, coloured with shame and vexation and disappointment. At the thought of the failure of her little surprise and of the two and fourpence she had thrown away for nothing she nearly cried outright. But Joe said it didn\u2019t matter and made her sit down by the fire. He was very nice with her. He told her all that went on in his office, repeating for her a smart answer which he had made to the manager. Maria did not understand why Joe laughed so much over the answer he had made but she said that the manager must have been a very overbearing person to deal with. Joe said he wasn\u2019t so bad when you knew how to take him, that he was a decent sort so long as you didn\u2019t rub him the wrong way. Mrs Donnelly played the piano for the children and they danced and sang. Then the two next-door girls handed round the nuts. Nobody could find the nutcrackers and Joe was nearly getting cross over it and asked how did they expect Maria to crack nuts without a nutcracker. But Maria said she didn\u2019t like nuts and that they weren\u2019t to bother about her.", " If he could only write a book and get it published, that might open the way for him. A volume of Byron\u2019s poems lay before him on the table. He opened it cautiously with his left hand lest he should waken the child and began to read the first poem in the book: _Hushed are the winds and still the evening gloom, Not e\u2019en a Zephyr wanders through the grove, Whilst I return to view my Margaret\u2019s tomb And scatter flowers on the dust I love._ He paused. He felt the rhythm of the verse about him in the room. How melancholy it was! Could he, too, write like that, express the melancholy of his soul in verse? There were so many things he wanted to describe: his sensation of a few hours before on Grattan Bridge, for example. If he could get back again into that mood.... The child awoke and began to cry. He turned from the page and tried to hush it: but it would not be hushed. He began to rock it to and fro in his arms but its wailing cry grew keener. He rocked it faster while his eyes began to read the second stanza: _Within this narrow cell reclines her clay, That clay where once...._ It was useless. He couldn\u2019t read. He couldn\u2019t do anything. The wailing of the child pierced the drum of his ear. It was useless, useless! He was a prisoner for life. His arms trembled with anger and suddenly bending to the child\u2019s face he shouted: \u201cStop!\u201d The child stopped for an instant, had a spasm of fright and began to scream."], "What does Farringtondo when he returns home in \u201cCounterparts\u201d?": [" They can wait.

Little Chandler sat in the room off the hall, holding a child in his arms. To save money they kept no servant but Annie\u2019s young sister Monica came for an hour or so in the morning and an hour or so in the evening to help. But Monica had gone home long ago. It was a quarter to nine. Little Chandler had come home late for tea and, moreover, he had forgotten to bring Annie home the parcel of coffee from Bewley\u2019s. Of course she was in a bad humour and gave him short answers. She said she would do without any tea but when it came near the time at which the shop at the corner closed she decided to go out herself for a quarter of a pound of tea and two pounds of sugar. She put the sleeping child deftly in his arms and said: \u201cHere. Don\u2019t waken him.\u201d A little lamp with a white china shade stood upon the table and its light fell over a photograph which was enclosed in a frame of crumpled horn. It was Annie\u2019s photograph. Little Chandler looked at it, pausing at the thin tight lips. She wore the pale blue summer blouse which he had brought her home as a present one Saturday. It had cost him ten and elevenpence; but what an agony of nervousness it had cost him! How he had suffered that day, waiting at the shop door until the shop was empty, standing at the counter and trying to appear at his ease while the girl piled ladies\u2019 blouses before him, paying at the desk and forgetting to take up the odd penny of his change, being called back by the cashier, and finally, striving to hide his blushes as he left the shop by examining the parcel to see if it was securely tied.", " He listened while the paroxysm of the child\u2019s sobbing grew less and less; and tears of remorse started to his eyes. COUNTERPARTS The bell rang furiously and, when Miss Parker went to the tube, a furious voice called out in a piercing North of Ireland accent: \u201cSend Farrington here!\u201d Miss Parker returned to her machine, saying to a man who was writing at a desk: \u201cMr Alleyne wants you upstairs.\u201d The man muttered \u201c_Blast_ him!\u201d under his breath and pushed back his chair to stand up. When he stood up he was tall and of great bulk. He had a hanging face, dark wine-coloured, with fair eyebrows and moustache: his eyes bulged forward slightly and the whites of them were dirty. He lifted up the counter and, passing by the clients, went out of the office with a heavy step. He went heavily upstairs until he came to the second landing, where a door bore a brass plate with the inscription _Mr Alleyne_. Here he halted, puffing with labour and vexation, and knocked. The shrill voice cried: \u201cCome in!\u201d The man entered Mr Alleyne\u2019s room. Simultaneously Mr Alleyne, a little man wearing gold-rimmed glasses on a clean-shaven face, shot his head up over a pile of documents. The head itself was so pink and hairless it seemed like a large egg reposing on the papers. Mr Alleyne did not lose a moment: \u201cFarrington? What is the meaning of this? Why have I always to complain of you? May I ask you why you haven\u2019t made a copy of that contract between Bodley and Kirwan?", " *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DUBLINERS *** Produced by David Reed, Karol Pietrzak, and David Widger cover DUBLINERS by James Joyce Contents The Sisters An Encounter Araby Eveline After the Race Two Gallants The Boarding House A Little Cloud Counterparts Clay A Painful Case Ivy Day in the Committee Room A Mother Grace The Dead THE SISTERS There was no hope for him this time: it was the third stroke. Night after night I had passed the house (it was vacation time) and studied the lighted square of window: and night after night I had found it lighted in the same way, faintly and evenly. If he was dead, I thought, I would see the reflection of candles on the darkened blind for I knew that two candles must be set at the head of a corpse. He had often said to me: \u201cI am not long for this world,\u201d and I had thought his words idle. Now I knew they were true. Every night as I gazed up at the window I said softly to myself the word paralysis. It had always sounded strangely in my ears, like the word gnomon in the Euclid and the word simony in the Catechism. But now it sounded to me like the name of some maleficent and sinful being. It filled me with fear, and yet I longed to be nearer to it and to look upon its deadly work. Old Cotter was sitting at the fire, smoking, when I came downstairs to supper. While my aunt was ladling out my stirabout he said, as if returning to some former remark of his: \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t say he was exactly ... but there was something queer ... there was something uncanny about him.", " He was going to study singing only for his health.

The dark discreet room, their isolation, the music that still vibrated in their ears united them. This union exalted him, wore away the rough edges of his character, emotionalised his mental life. Sometimes he caught himself listening to the sound of his own voice. He thought that in her eyes he would ascend to an angelical stature; and, as he attached the fervent nature of his companion more and more closely to him, he heard the strange impersonal voice which he recognised as his own, insisting on the soul\u2019s incurable loneliness. We cannot give ourselves, it said: we are our own. The end of these discourses was that one night during which she had shown every sign of unusual excitement, Mrs Sinico caught up his hand passionately and pressed it to her cheek. Mr Duffy was very much surprised. Her interpretation of his words disillusioned him. He did not visit her for a week, then he wrote to her asking her to meet him. As he did not wish their last interview to be troubled by the influence of their ruined confessional they met in a little cakeshop near the Parkgate. It was cold autumn weather but in spite of the cold they wandered up and down the roads of the Park for nearly three hours. They agreed to break off their intercourse: every bond, he said, is a bond to sorrow. When they came out of the Park they walked in silence towards the tram; but here she began to tremble so violently that, fearing another collapse on her part, he bade her good-bye quickly and left her.", " He met her again a few weeks afterwards at a concert in Earlsfort Terrace and seized the moments when her daughter\u2019s attention was diverted to become intimate. She alluded once or twice to her husband but her tone was not such as to make the allusion a warning. Her name was Mrs Sinico. Her husband\u2019s great-great-grandfather had come from Leghorn. Her husband was captain of a mercantile boat plying between Dublin and Holland; and they had one child. Meeting her a third time by accident he found courage to make an appointment. She came. This was the first of many meetings; they met always in the evening and chose the most quiet quarters for their walks together. Mr Duffy, however, had a distaste for underhand ways and, finding that they were compelled to meet stealthily, he forced her to ask him to her house. Captain Sinico encouraged his visits, thinking that his daughter\u2019s hand was in question. He had dismissed his wife so sincerely from his gallery of pleasures that he did not suspect that anyone else would take an interest in her. As the husband was often away and the daughter out giving music lessons Mr Duffy had many opportunities of enjoying the lady\u2019s society. Neither he nor she had had any such adventure before and neither was conscious of any incongruity. Little by little he entangled his thoughts with hers. He lent her books, provided her with ideas, shared his intellectual life with her.", " The gentlemen drank from their glasses, set the glasses again on the table and paused. Then Mr Cunningham turned towards Mr Power and said casually: \u201cOn Thursday night, you said, Jack.\u201d \u201cThursday, yes,\u201d said Mr Power. \u201cRighto!\u201d said Mr Cunningham promptly. \u201cWe can meet in M\u2019Auley\u2019s,\u201d said Mr M\u2019Coy. \u201cThat\u2019ll be the most convenient place.\u201d \u201cBut we mustn\u2019t be late,\u201d said Mr Power earnestly, \u201cbecause it is sure to be crammed to the doors.\u201d \u201cWe can meet at half-seven,\u201d said Mr M\u2019Coy. \u201cRighto!\u201d said Mr Cunningham. \u201cHalf-seven at M\u2019Auley\u2019s be it!\u201d There was a short silence. Mr Kernan waited to see whether he would be taken into his friends\u2019 confidence. Then he asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s in the wind?\u201d \u201cO, it\u2019s nothing,\u201d said Mr Cunningham. \u201cIt\u2019s only a little matter that we\u2019re arranging about for Thursday.\u201d \u201cThe opera, is it?\u201d said Mr Kernan. \u201cNo, no,\u201d said Mr Cunningham in an evasive tone, \u201cit\u2019s just a little ... spiritual matter.\u201d \u201cO,\u201d said Mr Kernan. There was silence again. Then Mr Power said, point blank: \u201cTo tell you the truth, Tom, we\u2019re going to make a retreat.\u201d \u201cYes, that\u2019s it,\u201d said Mr Cunningham, \u201cJack and I and M\u2019Coy here\u2014we\u2019re all going to wash the pot.\u201d He uttered the metaphor with a certain homely energy and, encouraged by his own voice, proceeded: \u201cYou see, we may as well all admit we\u2019re a nice collection of scoundrels, one and all. I say, one and all,\u201d he added with gruff charity and turning to Mr Power.", " There were five or six workingmen in the shop discussing the value of a gentleman\u2019s estate in County Kildare. They drank at intervals from their huge pint tumblers and smoked, spitting often on the floor and sometimes dragging the sawdust over their spits with their heavy boots. Mr Duffy sat on his stool and gazed at them, without seeing or hearing them. After a while they went out and he called for another punch. He sat a long time over it. The shop was very quiet. The proprietor sprawled on the counter reading the _Herald_ and yawning. Now and again a tram was heard swishing along the lonely road outside. As he sat there, living over his life with her and evoking alternately the two images in which he now conceived her, he realised that she was dead, that she had ceased to exist, that she had become a memory. He began to feel ill at ease. He asked himself what else could he have done. He could not have carried on a comedy of deception with her; he could not have lived with her openly. He had done what seemed to him best. How was he to blame? Now that she was gone he understood how lonely her life must have been, sitting night after night alone in that room. His life would be lonely too until he, too, died, ceased to exist, became a memory\u2014if anyone remembered him. It was after nine o\u2019clock when he left the shop. The night was cold and gloomy. He entered the Park by the first gate and walked along under the gaunt trees."], "In \u201cA Mother,\u201dwhy does Mrs. Kearney storm out of the final concert with her daughterwhen it is only halfway through?": [" \u201cOf course they are doing their best, but really they are not good.\u201d Mr Holohan admitted that the _artistes_ were no good but the Committee, he said, had decided to let the first three concerts go as they pleased and reserve all the talent for Saturday night. Mrs Kearney said nothing, but, as the mediocre items followed one another on the platform and the few people in the hall grew fewer and fewer, she began to regret that she had put herself to any expense for such a concert. There was something she didn\u2019t like in the look of things and Mr Fitzpatrick\u2019s vacant smile irritated her very much. However, she said nothing and waited to see how it would end. The concert expired shortly before ten, and everyone went home quickly. The concert on Thursday night was better attended, but Mrs Kearney saw at once that the house was filled with paper. The audience behaved indecorously, as if the concert were an informal dress rehearsal. Mr Fitzpatrick seemed to enjoy himself; he was quite unconscious that Mrs Kearney was taking angry note of his conduct. He stood at the edge of the screen, from time to time jutting out his head and exchanging a laugh with two friends in the corner of the balcony. In the course of the evening, Mrs Kearney learned that the Friday concert was to be abandoned and that the Committee was going to move heaven and earth to secure a bumper house on Saturday night. When she heard this, she sought out Mr Holohan.", " She agreed. She respected her husband in the same way as she respected the General Post Office, as something large, secure and fixed; and though she knew the small number of his talents she appreciated his abstract value as a male. She was glad that he had suggested coming with her. She thought her plans over. The night of the grand concert came. Mrs Kearney, with her husband and daughter, arrived at the Antient Concert Rooms three-quarters of an hour before the time at which the concert was to begin. By ill luck it was a rainy evening. Mrs Kearney placed her daughter\u2019s clothes and music in charge of her husband and went all over the building looking for Mr Holohan or Mr Fitzpatrick. She could find neither. She asked the stewards was any member of the Committee in the hall and, after a great deal of trouble, a steward brought out a little woman named Miss Beirne to whom Mrs Kearney explained that she wanted to see one of the secretaries. Miss Beirne expected them any minute and asked could she do anything. Mrs Kearney looked searchingly at the oldish face which was screwed into an expression of trustfulness and enthusiasm and answered: \u201cNo, thank you!\u201d The little woman hoped they would have a good house. She looked out at the rain until the melancholy of the wet street effaced all the trustfulness and enthusiasm from her twisted features. Then she gave a little sigh and said: \u201cAh, well!", " He appealed to Mr Kearney and to Kathleen. But Mr Kearney continued to stroke his beard and Kathleen looked down, moving the point of her new shoe: it was not her fault. Mrs Kearney repeated: \u201cShe won\u2019t go on without her money.\u201d After a swift struggle of tongues Mr Holohan hobbled out in haste. The room was silent. When the strain of the silence had become somewhat painful Miss Healy said to the baritone: \u201cHave you seen Mrs Pat Campbell this week?\u201d The baritone had not seen her but he had been told that she was very fine. The conversation went no further. The first tenor bent his head and began to count the links of the gold chain which was extended across his waist, smiling and humming random notes to observe the effect on the frontal sinus. From time to time everyone glanced at Mrs Kearney. The noise in the auditorium had risen to a clamour when Mr Fitzpatrick burst into the room, followed by Mr Holohan, who was panting. The clapping and stamping in the hall were punctuated by whistling. Mr Fitzpatrick held a few banknotes in his hand. He counted out four into Mrs Kearney\u2019s hand and said she would get the other half at the interval. Mrs Kearney said: \u201cThis is four shillings short.\u201d But Kathleen gathered in her skirt and said: _\u201cNow, Mr Bell,\u201d_ to the first item, who was shaking like an aspen. The singer and the accompanist went out together. The noise in hall died away. There was a pause of a few seconds: and then the piano was heard.", " Mrs Kearney brought her daughter over to them, and talked to them amiably. She wanted to be on good terms with them but, while she strove to be polite, her eyes followed Mr Holohan in his limping and devious courses. As soon as she could she excused herself and went out after him. \u201cMr Holohan, I want to speak to you for a moment,\u201d she said. They went down to a discreet part of the corridor. Mrs Kearney asked him when was her daughter going to be paid. Mr Holohan said that Mr Fitzpatrick had charge of that. Mrs Kearney said that she didn\u2019t know anything about Mr Fitzpatrick. Her daughter had signed a contract for eight guineas and she would have to be paid. Mr Holohan said that it wasn\u2019t his business. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t it your business?\u201d asked Mrs Kearney. \u201cDidn\u2019t you yourself bring her the contract? Anyway, if it\u2019s not your business it\u2019s my business and I mean to see to it.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d better speak to Mr Fitzpatrick,\u201d said Mr Holohan distantly. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about Mr Fitzpatrick,\u201d repeated Mrs Kearney. \u201cI have my contract, and I intend to see that it is carried out.\u201d When she came back to the dressing-room her cheeks were slightly suffused. The room was lively. Two men in outdoor dress had taken possession of the fireplace and were chatting familiarly with Miss Healy and the baritone. They were the _Freeman_ man and Mr O\u2019Madden Burke. The _Freeman_ man had come in to say that he could not wait for the concert as he had to report the lecture which an American priest was giving in the Mansion House."], "Why does Farrington\u2019sboss yell at him at the beginning of \u201cCounterparts\u201d?": [" Farrington stood a drink in his turn. After a while O\u2019Halloran and Paddy Leonard came in and the story was repeated to them. O\u2019Halloran stood tailors of malt, hot, all round and told the story of the retort he had made to the chief clerk when he was in Callan\u2019s of Fownes\u2019s Street; but, as the retort was after the manner of the liberal shepherds in the eclogues, he had to admit that it was not as clever as Farrington\u2019s retort. At this Farrington told the boys to polish off that and have another. Just as they were naming their poisons who should come in but Higgins! Of course he had to join in with the others. The men asked him to give his version of it, and he did so with great vivacity for the sight of five small hot whiskies was very exhilarating. Everyone roared laughing when he showed the way in which Mr Alleyne shook his fist in Farrington\u2019s face. Then he imitated Farrington, saying, _\u201cAnd here was my nabs, as cool as you please,\u201d_ while Farrington looked at the company out of his heavy dirty eyes, smiling and at times drawing forth stray drops of liquor from his moustache with the aid of his lower lip. When that round was over there was a pause. O\u2019Halloran had money but neither of the other two seemed to have any; so the whole party left the shop somewhat regretfully. At the corner of Duke Street Higgins and Nosey Flynn bevelled off to the left while the other three turned back towards the city.", " Rain was drizzling down on the cold streets and, when they reached the Ballast Office, Farrington suggested the Scotch House. The bar was full of men and loud with the noise of tongues and glasses. The three men pushed past the whining match-sellers at the door and formed a little party at the corner of the counter. They began to exchange stories. Leonard introduced them to a young fellow named Weathers who was performing at the Tivoli as an acrobat and knockabout _artiste_. Farrington stood a drink all round. Weathers said he would take a small Irish and Apollinaris. Farrington, who had definite notions of what was what, asked the boys would they have an Apollinaris too; but the boys told Tim to make theirs hot. The talk became theatrical. O\u2019Halloran stood a round and then Farrington stood another round, Weathers protesting that the hospitality was too Irish. He promised to get them in behind the scenes and introduce them to some nice girls. O\u2019Halloran said that he and Leonard would go, but that Farrington wouldn\u2019t go because he was a married man; and Farrington\u2019s heavy dirty eyes leered at the company in token that he understood he was being chaffed. Weathers made them all have just one little tincture at his expense and promised to meet them later on at Mulligan\u2019s in Poolbeg Street. When the Scotch House closed they went round to Mulligan\u2019s. They went into the parlour at the back and O\u2019Halloran ordered small hot specials all round.", " They were all beginning to feel mellow. Farrington was just standing another round when Weathers came back. Much to Farrington\u2019s relief he drank a glass of bitter this time. Funds were getting low but they had enough to keep them going. Presently two young women with big hats and a young man in a check suit came in and sat at a table close by. Weathers saluted them and told the company that they were out of the Tivoli. Farrington\u2019s eyes wandered at every moment in the direction of one of the young women. There was something striking in her appearance. An immense scarf of peacock-blue muslin was wound round her hat and knotted in a great bow under her chin; and she wore bright yellow gloves, reaching to the elbow. Farrington gazed admiringly at the plump arm which she moved very often and with much grace; and when, after a little time, she answered his gaze he admired still more her large dark brown eyes. The oblique staring expression in them fascinated him. She glanced at him once or twice and, when the party was leaving the room, she brushed against his chair and said _\u201cO, pardon!\u201d_ in a London accent. He watched her leave the room in the hope that she would look back at him, but he was disappointed. He cursed his want of money and cursed all the rounds he had stood, particularly all the whiskies and Apollinaris which he had stood to Weathers. If there was one thing that he hated it was a sponge.", " He was so angry that he lost count of the conversation of his friends. When Paddy Leonard called him he found that they were talking about feats of strength. Weathers was showing his biceps muscle to the company and boasting so much that the other two had called on Farrington to uphold the national honour. Farrington pulled up his sleeve accordingly and showed his biceps muscle to the company. The two arms were examined and compared and finally it was agreed to have a trial of strength. The table was cleared and the two men rested their elbows on it, clasping hands. When Paddy Leonard said _\u201cGo!\u201d_ each was to try to bring down the other\u2019s hand on to the table. Farrington looked very serious and determined. The trial began. After about thirty seconds Weathers brought his opponent\u2019s hand slowly down on to the table. Farrington\u2019s dark wine-coloured face flushed darker still with anger and humiliation at having been defeated by such a stripling. \u201cYou\u2019re not to put the weight of your body behind it. Play fair,\u201d he said. \u201cWho\u2019s not playing fair?\u201d said the other. \u201cCome on again. The two best out of three.\u201d The trial began again. The veins stood out on Farrington\u2019s forehead, and the pallor of Weathers\u2019 complexion changed to peony. Their hands and arms trembled under the stress. After a long struggle Weathers again brought his opponent\u2019s hand slowly on to the table. There was a murmur of applause from the spectators."], "What does Gabriellook at outside of his hotel window in \u201cThe Dead\u201d?": [" \u201cI\u2019d love to see Galway again.\u201d \u201cYou can go if you like,\u201d said Gabriel coldly. She looked at him for a moment, then turned to Mrs Malins and said: \u201cThere\u2019s a nice husband for you, Mrs Malins.\u201d While she was threading her way back across the room Mrs Malins, without adverting to the interruption, went on to tell Gabriel what beautiful places there were in Scotland and beautiful scenery. Her son-in-law brought them every year to the lakes and they used to go fishing. Her son-in-law was a splendid fisher. One day he caught a beautiful big fish and the man in the hotel cooked it for their dinner. Gabriel hardly heard what she said. Now that supper was coming near he began to think again about his speech and about the quotation. When he saw Freddy Malins coming across the room to visit his mother Gabriel left the chair free for him and retired into the embrasure of the window. The room had already cleared and from the back room came the clatter of plates and knives. Those who still remained in the drawing-room seemed tired of dancing and were conversing quietly in little groups. Gabriel\u2019s warm trembling fingers tapped the cold pane of the window. How cool it must be outside! How pleasant it would be to walk out alone, first along by the river and then through the park! The snow would be lying on the branches of the trees and forming a bright cap on the top of the Wellington Monument.", " He was going to study singing only for his health. He had a very good voice, poor Michael Furey.\u201d \u201cWell; and then?\u201d asked Gabriel. \u201cAnd then when it came to the time for me to leave Galway and come up to the convent he was much worse and I wouldn\u2019t be let see him so I wrote him a letter saying I was going up to Dublin and would be back in the summer and hoping he would be better then.\u201d She paused for a moment to get her voice under control and then went on: \u201cThen the night before I left I was in my grandmother\u2019s house in Nuns\u2019 Island, packing up, and I heard gravel thrown up against the window. The window was so wet I couldn\u2019t see so I ran downstairs as I was and slipped out the back into the garden and there was the poor fellow at the end of the garden, shivering.\u201d \u201cAnd did you not tell him to go back?\u201d asked Gabriel. \u201cI implored of him to go home at once and told him he would get his death in the rain. But he said he did not want to live. I can see his eyes as well as well! He was standing at the end of the wall where there was a tree.\u201d \u201cAnd did he go home?\u201d asked Gabriel. \u201cYes, he went home. And when I was only a week in the convent he died and he was buried in Oughterard where his people came from. O, the day I heard that, that he was dead!\u201d She stopped, choking with sobs and, overcome by emotion, flung herself face downward on the bed, sobbing in the quilt. Gabriel held her hand for a moment longer, irresolutely, and then, shy of intruding on her grief, let it fall gently and walked quietly to the window.", " He longed to be alone with her. When the others had gone away, when he and she were in their room in the hotel, then they would be alone together. He would call her softly: \u201cGretta!\u201d Perhaps she would not hear at once: she would be undressing. Then something in his voice would strike her. She would turn and look at him.... At the corner of Winetavern Street they met a cab. He was glad of its rattling noise as it saved him from conversation. She was looking out of the window and seemed tired. The others spoke only a few words, pointing out some building or street. The horse galloped along wearily under the murky morning sky, dragging his old rattling box after his heels, and Gabriel was again in a cab with her, galloping to catch the boat, galloping to their honeymoon. As the cab drove across O\u2019Connell Bridge Miss O\u2019Callaghan said: \u201cThey say you never cross O\u2019Connell Bridge without seeing a white horse.\u201d \u201cI see a white man this time,\u201d said Gabriel. \u201cWhere?\u201d asked Mr Bartell D\u2019Arcy. Gabriel pointed to the statue, on which lay patches of snow. Then he nodded familiarly to it and waved his hand. \u201cGood-night, Dan,\u201d he said gaily. When the cab drew up before the hotel, Gabriel jumped out and, in spite of Mr Bartell D\u2019Arcy\u2019s protest, paid the driver. He gave the man a shilling over his fare. The man saluted and said: \u201cA prosperous New Year to you, sir.\u201d \u201cThe same to you,\u201d said Gabriel cordially.", " *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DUBLINERS *** Produced by David Reed, Karol Pietrzak, and David Widger cover DUBLINERS by James Joyce Contents The Sisters An Encounter Araby Eveline After the Race Two Gallants The Boarding House A Little Cloud Counterparts Clay A Painful Case Ivy Day in the Committee Room A Mother Grace The Dead THE SISTERS There was no hope for him this time: it was the third stroke. Night after night I had passed the house (it was vacation time) and studied the lighted square of window: and night after night I had found it lighted in the same way, faintly and evenly. If he was dead, I thought, I would see the reflection of candles on the darkened blind for I knew that two candles must be set at the head of a corpse. He had often said to me: \u201cI am not long for this world,\u201d and I had thought his words idle. Now I knew they were true. Every night as I gazed up at the window I said softly to myself the word paralysis. It had always sounded strangely in my ears, like the word gnomon in the Euclid and the word simony in the Catechism. But now it sounded to me like the name of some maleficent and sinful being. It filled me with fear, and yet I longed to be nearer to it and to look upon its deadly work. Old Cotter was sitting at the fire, smoking, when I came downstairs to supper. While my aunt was ladling out my stirabout he said, as if returning to some former remark of his: \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t say he was exactly ... but there was something queer ... there was something uncanny about him."], "What does Gabrieldo in \u201cThe Dead\u201d that no one else does during the party meal?": [" \u201cSit down, Joe,\u201d said Mr O\u2019Connor, \u201cwe\u2019re just talking about the Chief.\u201d \u201cAy, ay!\u201d said Mr Henchy. Mr Hynes sat on the side of the table near Mr Lyons but said nothing. \u201cThere\u2019s one of them, anyhow,\u201d said Mr Henchy, \u201cthat didn\u2019t renege him. By God, I\u2019ll say for you, Joe! No, by God, you stuck to him like a man!\u201d \u201cO, Joe,\u201d said Mr O\u2019Connor suddenly. \u201cGive us that thing you wrote\u2014do you remember?

Then amid the silence he took off his hat, laid it on the table and stood up. He seemed to be rehearsing the piece in his mind. After a rather long pause he announced: THE DEATH OF PARNELL 6_th October_ 1891 He cleared his throat once or twice and then began to recite: He is dead. Our Uncrowned King is dead. O, Erin, mourn with grief and woe For he lies dead whom the fell gang Of modern hypocrites laid low. He lies slain by the coward hounds He raised to glory from the mire; And Erin\u2019s hopes and Erin\u2019s dreams Perish upon her monarch\u2019s pyre.", " Then she had her plants in the conservatory and she liked looking after them. She had lovely ferns and wax-plants and, whenever anyone came to visit her, she always gave the visitor one or two slips from her conservatory. There was one thing she didn\u2019t like and that was the tracts on the walks; but the matron was such a nice person to deal with, so genteel. When the cook told her everything was ready she went into the women\u2019s room and began to pull the big bell. In a few minutes the women began to come in by twos and threes, wiping their steaming hands in their petticoats and pulling down the sleeves of their blouses over their red steaming arms. They settled down before their huge mugs which the cook and the dummy filled up with hot tea, already mixed with milk and sugar in huge tin cans. Maria superintended the distribution of the barmbrack and saw that every woman got her four slices. There was a great deal of laughing and joking during the meal. Lizzie Fleming said Maria was sure to get the ring and, though Fleming had said that for so many Hallow Eves, Maria had to laugh and say she didn\u2019t want any ring or man either; and when she laughed her grey-green eyes sparkled with disappointed shyness and the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of her chin. Then Ginger Mooney lifted up her mug of tea and proposed Maria\u2019s health while all the other women clattered with their mugs on the table, and said she was sorry she hadn\u2019t a sup of porter to drink it in.", " When I came downstairs again I found Mrs Mercer sitting at the fire. She was an old garrulous woman, a pawnbroker\u2019s widow, who collected used stamps for some pious purpose. I had to endure the gossip of the tea-table. The meal was prolonged beyond an hour and still my uncle did not come. Mrs Mercer stood up to go: she was sorry she couldn\u2019t wait any longer, but it was after eight o\u2019clock and she did not like to be out late as the night air was bad for her. When she had gone I began to walk up and down the room, clenching my fists. My aunt said: \u201cI\u2019m afraid you may put off your bazaar for this night of Our Lord.\u201d At nine o\u2019clock I heard my uncle\u2019s latchkey in the halldoor. I heard him talking to himself and heard the hallstand rocking when it had received the weight of his overcoat. I could interpret these signs. When he was midway through his dinner I asked him to give me the money to go to the bazaar. He had forgotten. \u201cThe people are in bed and after their first sleep now,\u201d he said. I did not smile. My aunt said to him energetically: \u201cCan\u2019t you give him the money and let him go? You\u2019ve kept him late enough as it is.\u201d My uncle said he was very sorry he had forgotten. He said he believed in the old saying: \u201cAll work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.\u201d He asked me where I was going and, when I had told him a second time he asked me did I know _The Arab\u2019s Farewell to his Steed_. When I left the kitchen he was about to recite the opening lines of the piece to my aunt.", " Rivi\u00e8re, not wholly ingenuously, undertook to explain to Jimmy the triumph of the French mechanicians. The resonant voice of the Hungarian was about to prevail in ridicule of the spurious lutes of the romantic painters when S\u00e9gouin shepherded his party into politics. Here was congenial ground for all. Jimmy, under generous influences, felt the buried zeal of his father wake to life within him: he aroused the torpid Routh at last. The room grew doubly hot and S\u00e9gouin\u2019s task grew harder each moment: there was even danger of personal spite. The alert host at an opportunity lifted his glass to Humanity and, when the toast had been drunk, he threw open a window significantly. That night the city wore the mask of a capital. The five young men strolled along Stephen\u2019s Green in a faint cloud of aromatic smoke. They talked loudly and gaily and their cloaks dangled from their shoulders. The people made way for them. At the corner of Grafton Street a short fat man was putting two handsome ladies on a car in charge of another fat man. The car drove off and the short fat man caught sight of the party. \u201cAndr\u00e9.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Farley!\u201d A torrent of talk followed. Farley was an American. No one knew very well what the talk was about. Villona and Rivi\u00e8re were the noisiest, but all the men were excited. They got up on a car, squeezing themselves together amid much laughter. They drove by the crowd, blended now into soft colours, to a music of merry bells."], "What is one ofthe words that the boy of \u201cThe Sisters\u201d thinks of when he looksthrough Father Flynn\u2019s window?": [" EVELINE She sat at the window watching the evening invade the avenue. Her head was leaned against the window curtains and in her nostrils was the odour of dusty cretonne. She was tired. Few people passed.

Ernest, however, never played: he was too grown up. Her father used often to hunt them in out of the field with his blackthorn stick; but usually little Keogh used to keep _nix_ and call out when he saw her father coming. Still they seemed to have been rather happy then. Her father was not so bad then; and besides, her mother was alive. That was a long time ago; she and her brothers and sisters were all grown up; her mother was dead. Tizzie Dunn was dead, too, and the Waters had gone back to England. Everything changes.

He had sailed through the Straits of Magellan and he told her stories of the terrible Patagonians. He had fallen on his feet in Buenos Ayres, he said, and had come over to the old country just for a holiday. Of course, her father had found out the affair and had forbidden her to have anything to say to him. \u201cI know these sailor chaps,\u201d he said. One day he had quarrelled with Frank and after that she had to meet her lover secretly. The evening deepened in the avenue. The white of two letters in her lap grew indistinct. One was to Harry; the other was to her father. Ernest had been her favourite but she liked Harry too. Her father was becoming old lately, she noticed; he would miss her. Sometimes he could be very nice. Not long before, when she had been laid up for a day, he had read her out a ghost story and made toast for her at the fire. Another day, when their mother was alive, they had all gone for a picnic to the Hill of Howth. She remembered her father putting on her mother\u2019s bonnet to make the children laugh. Her time was running out but she continued to sit by the window, leaning her head against the window curtain, inhaling the odour of dusty cretonne.

He might yet be able to settle down in some snug corner and live happily if he could only come across some good simple-minded girl with a little of the ready. He paid twopence halfpenny to the slatternly girl and went out of the shop to begin his wandering again. He went into Capel Street and walked along towards the City Hall. Then he turned into Dame Street. At the corner of George\u2019s Street he met two friends of his and stopped to converse with them. He was glad that he could rest from all his walking. His friends asked him had he seen Corley and what was the latest. He replied that he had spent the day with Corley. His friends talked very little. They looked vacantly after some figures in the crowd and sometimes made a critical remark. One said that he had seen Mac an hour before in Westmoreland Street. At this Lenehan said that he had been with Mac the night before in Egan\u2019s. The young man who had seen Mac in Westmoreland Street asked was it true that Mac had won a bit over a billiard match. Lenehan did not know: he said that Holohan had stood them drinks in Egan\u2019s.

On special Sundays, when Mr Kearney went with his family to the pro-cathedral, a little crowd of people would assemble after mass at the corner of Cathedral Street. They were all friends of the Kearneys\u2014musical friends or Nationalist friends; and, when they had played every little counter of gossip, they shook hands with one another all together, laughing at the crossing of so many hands, and said good-bye to one another in Irish. Soon the name of Miss Kathleen Kearney began to be heard often on people\u2019s lips. People said that she was very clever at music and a very nice girl and, moreover, that she was a believer in the language movement. Mrs Kearney was well content at this. Therefore she was not surprised when one day Mr Holohan came to her and proposed that her daughter should be the accompanist at a series of four grand concerts which his Society was going to give in the Antient Concert Rooms. She brought him into the drawing-room, made him sit down and brought out the decanter and the silver biscuit-barrel. She entered heart and soul into the details of the enterprise, advised and dissuaded; and finally a contract was drawn up by which Kathleen was to receive eight guineas for her services as accompanist at the four grand concerts. As Mr Holohan was a novice in such delicate matters as the wording of bills and the disposing of items for a programme, Mrs Kearney helped him.", " The dark damp night was coming and he longed to spend it in the bars, drinking with his friends amid the glare of gas and the clatter of glasses. He got out the Delacour correspondence and passed out of the office. He hoped Mr Alleyne would not discover that the last two letters were missing. The moist pungent perfume lay all the way up to Mr Alleyne\u2019s room. Miss Delacour was a middle-aged woman of Jewish appearance. Mr Alleyne was said to be sweet on her or on her money. She came to the office often and stayed a long time when she came. She was sitting beside his desk now in an aroma of perfumes, smoothing the handle of her umbrella and nodding the great black feather in her hat. Mr Alleyne had swivelled his chair round to face her and thrown his right foot jauntily upon his left knee. The man put the correspondence on the desk and bowed respectfully but neither Mr Alleyne nor Miss Delacour took any notice of his bow. Mr Alleyne tapped a finger on the correspondence and then flicked it towards him as if to say: _\u201cThat\u2019s all right: you can go.\u201d_ The man returned to the lower office and sat down again at his desk. He stared intently at the incomplete phrase: _In no case shall the said Bernard Bodley be_ ... and thought how strange it was that the last three words began with the same letter.

Her face was inundated with an angry colour and she looked as if she would attack someone with her hands. \u201cI\u2019m asking for my rights.\u201d she said. \u201cYou might have some sense of decency,\u201d said Mr Holohan. \u201cMight I, indeed?... And when I ask when my daughter is going to be paid I can\u2019t get a civil answer.\u201d She tossed her head and assumed a haughty voice: \u201cYou must speak to the secretary. It\u2019s not my business. I\u2019m a great fellow fol-the-diddle-I-do.\u201d \u201cI thought you were a lady,\u201d said Mr Holohan, walking away from her abruptly. After that Mrs Kearney\u2019s conduct was condemned on all hands: everyone approved of what the Committee had done. She stood at the door, haggard with rage, arguing with her husband and daughter, gesticulating with them. She waited until it was time for the second part to begin in the hope that the secretaries would approach her. But Miss Healy had kindly consented to play one or two accompaniments. Mrs Kearney had to stand aside to allow the baritone and his accompanist to pass up to the platform. She stood still for an instant like an angry stone image and, when the first notes of the song struck her ear, she caught up her daughter\u2019s cloak and said to her husband: \u201cGet a cab!\u201d He went out at once.", " Mrs Kearney brought her daughter over to them, and talked to them amiably. She wanted to be on good terms with them but, while she strove to be polite, her eyes followed Mr Holohan in his limping and devious courses. As soon as she could she excused herself and went out after him. \u201cMr Holohan, I want to speak to you for a moment,\u201d she said. They went down to a discreet part of the corridor. Mrs Kearney asked him when was her daughter going to be paid. Mr Holohan said that Mr Fitzpatrick had charge of that. Mrs Kearney said that she didn\u2019t know anything about Mr Fitzpatrick. Her daughter had signed a contract for eight guineas and she would have to be paid. Mr Holohan said that it wasn\u2019t his business. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t it your business?\u201d asked Mrs Kearney. \u201cDidn\u2019t you yourself bring her the contract? Anyway, if it\u2019s not your business it\u2019s my business and I mean to see to it.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d better speak to Mr Fitzpatrick,\u201d said Mr Holohan distantly. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about Mr Fitzpatrick,\u201d repeated Mrs Kearney. \u201cI have my contract, and I intend to see that it is carried out.\u201d When she came back to the dressing-room her cheeks were slightly suffused. The room was lively. Two men in outdoor dress had taken possession of the fireplace and were chatting familiarly with Miss Healy and the baritone. They were the _Freeman_ man and Mr O\u2019Madden Burke. The _Freeman_ man had come in to say that he could not wait for the concert as he had to report the lecture which an American priest was giving in the Mansion House.", " He appealed to Mr Kearney and to Kathleen. But Mr Kearney continued to stroke his beard and Kathleen looked down, moving the point of her new shoe: it was not her fault. Mrs Kearney repeated: \u201cShe won\u2019t go on without her money.\u201d After a swift struggle of tongues Mr Holohan hobbled out in haste. The room was silent. When the strain of the silence had become somewhat painful Miss Healy said to the baritone: \u201cHave you seen Mrs Pat Campbell this week?\u201d The baritone had not seen her but he had been told that she was very fine. The conversation went no further. The first tenor bent his head and began to count the links of the gold chain which was extended across his waist, smiling and humming random notes to observe the effect on the frontal sinus. From time to time everyone glanced at Mrs Kearney. The noise in the auditorium had risen to a clamour when Mr Fitzpatrick burst into the room, followed by Mr Holohan, who was panting. The clapping and stamping in the hall were punctuated by whistling. Mr Fitzpatrick held a few banknotes in his hand. He counted out four into Mrs Kearney\u2019s hand and said she would get the other half at the interval. Mrs Kearney said: \u201cThis is four shillings short.\u201d But Kathleen gathered in her skirt and said: _\u201cNow, Mr Bell,\u201d_ to the first item, who was shaking like an aspen. The singer and the accompanist went out together. The noise in hall died away. There was a pause of a few seconds: and then the piano was heard.", " She agreed. She respected her husband in the same way as she respected the General Post Office, as something large, secure and fixed; and though she knew the small number of his talents she appreciated his abstract value as a male. She was glad that he had suggested coming with her. She thought her plans over. The night of the grand concert came. Mrs Kearney, with her husband and daughter, arrived at the Antient Concert Rooms three-quarters of an hour before the time at which the concert was to begin. By ill luck it was a rainy evening. Mrs Kearney placed her daughter\u2019s clothes and music in charge of her husband and went all over the building looking for Mr Holohan or Mr Fitzpatrick. She could find neither. She asked the stewards was any member of the Committee in the hall and, after a great deal of trouble, a steward brought out a little woman named Miss Beirne to whom Mrs Kearney explained that she wanted to see one of the secretaries. Miss Beirne expected them any minute and asked could she do anything. Mrs Kearney looked searchingly at the oldish face which was screwed into an expression of trustfulness and enthusiasm and answered: \u201cNo, thank you!\u201d The little woman hoped they would have a good house. She looked out at the rain until the melancholy of the wet street effaced all the trustfulness and enthusiasm from her twisted features. Then she gave a little sigh and said: \u201cAh, well!"], "Which story shares the name of its protagonist?": [" The latter, a young man of about forty, was of Gabriel\u2019s size and build, with very round shoulders. His face was fleshy and pallid, touched with colour only at the thick hanging lobes of his ears and at the wide wings of his nose. He had coarse features, a blunt nose, a convex and receding brow, tumid and protruded lips. His heavy-lidded eyes and the disorder of his scanty hair made him look sleepy. He was laughing heartily in a high key at a story which he had been telling Gabriel on the stairs and at the same time rubbing the knuckles of his left fist backwards and forwards into his left eye. \u201cGood-evening, Freddy,\u201d said Aunt Julia. Freddy Malins bade the Misses Morkan good-evening in what seemed an offhand fashion by reason of the habitual catch in his voice and then, seeing that Mr Browne was grinning at him from the sideboard, crossed the room on rather shaky legs and began to repeat in an undertone the story he had just told to Gabriel. \u201cHe\u2019s not so bad, is he?\u201d said Aunt Kate to Gabriel. Gabriel\u2019s brows were dark but he raised them quickly and answered: \u201cO, no, hardly noticeable.\u201d \u201cNow, isn\u2019t he a terrible fellow!\u201d she said. \u201cAnd his poor mother made him take the pledge on New Year\u2019s Eve. But come on, Gabriel, into the drawing-room.\u201d Before leaving the room with Gabriel she signalled to Mr Browne by frowning and shaking her forefinger in warning to and fro. Mr Browne nodded in answer and, when she had gone, said to Freddy Malins: \u201cNow, then, Teddy, I\u2019m going to fill you out a good glass of lemonade just to buck you up.\u201d Freddy Malins, who was nearing the climax of his story, waved the offer aside impatiently but Mr Browne, having first called Freddy Malins\u2019 attention to a disarray in his dress, filled out and handed him a full glass of lemonade.", " \u201cIt\u2019s six of one and half-a-dozen of the other.

The two friends lit their cigars and puffed at them in silence until their drinks were served. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you my opinion,\u201d said Ignatius Gallaher, emerging after some time from the clouds of smoke in which he had taken refuge, \u201cit\u2019s a rum world. Talk of immorality! I\u2019ve heard of cases\u2014what am I saying?\u2014I\u2019ve known them: cases of ... immorality....\u201d Ignatius Gallaher puffed thoughtfully at his cigar and then, in a calm historian\u2019s tone, he proceeded to sketch for his friend some pictures of the corruption which was rife abroad. He summarised the vices of many capitals and seemed inclined to award the palm to Berlin. Some things he could not vouch for (his friends had told him), but of others he had had personal experience. He spared neither rank nor caste. He revealed many of the secrets of religious houses on the Continent and described some of the practices which were fashionable in high society and ended by telling, with details, a story about an English duchess\u2014a story which he knew to be true.", " Farrington stood a drink in his turn. After a while O\u2019Halloran and Paddy Leonard came in and the story was repeated to them. O\u2019Halloran stood tailors of malt, hot, all round and told the story of the retort he had made to the chief clerk when he was in Callan\u2019s of Fownes\u2019s Street; but, as the retort was after the manner of the liberal shepherds in the eclogues, he had to admit that it was not as clever as Farrington\u2019s retort. At this Farrington told the boys to polish off that and have another. Just as they were naming their poisons who should come in but Higgins! Of course he had to join in with the others. The men asked him to give his version of it, and he did so with great vivacity for the sight of five small hot whiskies was very exhilarating. Everyone roared laughing when he showed the way in which Mr Alleyne shook his fist in Farrington\u2019s face. Then he imitated Farrington, saying, _\u201cAnd here was my nabs, as cool as you please,\u201d_ while Farrington looked at the company out of his heavy dirty eyes, smiling and at times drawing forth stray drops of liquor from his moustache with the aid of his lower lip. When that round was over there was a pause. O\u2019Halloran had money but neither of the other two seemed to have any; so the whole party left the shop somewhat regretfully. At the corner of Duke Street Higgins and Nosey Flynn bevelled off to the left while the other three turned back towards the city.", " \u201cI remember now there was a policeman.

He was not straight-laced, but he could not forget that Mr M\u2019Coy had recently made a crusade in search of valises and portmanteaus to enable Mrs M\u2019Coy to fulfil imaginary engagements in the country. More than he resented the fact that he had been victimised he resented such low playing of the game. He answered the question, therefore, as if Mr Kernan had asked it. The narrative made Mr Kernan indignant. He was keenly conscious of his citizenship, wished to live with his city on terms mutually honourable and resented any affront put upon him by those whom he called country bumpkins. \u201cIs this what we pay rates for?\u201d he asked. \u201cTo feed and clothe these ignorant bostooms ... and they\u2019re nothing else.\u201d Mr Cunningham laughed. He was a Castle official only during office hours. \u201cHow could they be anything else, Tom?\u201d he said. He assumed a thick provincial accent and said in a tone of command: \u201c65, catch your cabbage!\u201d Everyone laughed. Mr M\u2019Coy, who wanted to enter the conversation by any door, pretended that he had never heard the story. Mr Cunningham said: \u201cIt is supposed\u2014they say, you know\u2014to take place in the depot where they get these thundering big country fellows, omadhauns, you know, to drill."], "Which story centers on the death of a priest?": [" The latter, a young man of about forty, was of Gabriel\u2019s size and build, with very round shoulders. His face was fleshy and pallid, touched with colour only at the thick hanging lobes of his ears and at the wide wings of his nose. He had coarse features, a blunt nose, a convex and receding brow, tumid and protruded lips. His heavy-lidded eyes and the disorder of his scanty hair made him look sleepy. He was laughing heartily in a high key at a story which he had been telling Gabriel on the stairs and at the same time rubbing the knuckles of his left fist backwards and forwards into his left eye. \u201cGood-evening, Freddy,\u201d said Aunt Julia. Freddy Malins bade the Misses Morkan good-evening in what seemed an offhand fashion by reason of the habitual catch in his voice and then, seeing that Mr Browne was grinning at him from the sideboard, crossed the room on rather shaky legs and began to repeat in an undertone the story he had just told to Gabriel. \u201cHe\u2019s not so bad, is he?\u201d said Aunt Kate to Gabriel.

The girl came over to him to ask was his dinner not properly cooked. He said it was very good and ate a few mouthfuls of it with difficulty. Then he paid his bill and went out. He walked along quickly through the November twilight, his stout hazel stick striking the ground regularly, the fringe of the buff _Mail_ peeping out of a side-pocket of his tight reefer overcoat. On the lonely road which leads from the Parkgate to Chapelizod he slackened his pace. His stick struck the ground less emphatically and his breath, issuing irregularly, almost with a sighing sound, condensed in the wintry air. When he reached his house he went up at once to his bedroom and, taking the paper from his pocket, read the paragraph again by the failing light of the window. He read it not aloud, but moving his lips as a priest does when he reads the prayers _Secreto_. This was the paragraph: DEATH OF A LADY AT SYDNEY PARADE A PAINFUL CASE Today at the City of Dublin Hospital the Deputy Coroner (in the absence of Mr Leverett) held an inquest on the body of Mrs Emily Sinico, aged forty-three years, who was killed at Sydney Parade Station yesterday evening. The evidence showed that the deceased lady, while attempting to cross the line, was knocked down by the engine of the ten o\u2019clock slow train from Kingstown, thereby sustaining injuries of the head and right side which led to her death.", " She was fast asleep. Gabriel, leaning on his elbow, looked for a few moments unresentfully on her tangled hair and half-open mouth, listening to her deep-drawn breath. So she had had that romance in her life: a man had died for her sake. It hardly pained him now to think how poor a part he, her husband, had played in her life. He watched her while she slept as though he and she had never lived together as man and wife. His curious eyes rested long upon her face and on her hair: and, as he thought of what she must have been then, in that time of her first girlish beauty, a strange, friendly pity for her entered his soul. He did not like to say even to himself that her face was no longer beautiful but he knew that it was no longer the face for which Michael Furey had braved death. Perhaps she had not told him all the story. His eyes moved to the chair over which she had thrown some of her clothes. A petticoat string dangled to the floor. One boot stood upright, its limp upper fallen down: the fellow of it lay upon its side. He wondered at his riot of emotions of an hour before. From what had it proceeded? From his aunt\u2019s supper, from his own foolish speech, from the wine and dancing, the merry-making when saying good-night in the hall, the pleasure of the walk along the river in the snow. Poor Aunt Julia! She, too, would soon be a shade with the shade of Patrick Morkan and his horse.", " \u201cIt\u2019s six of one and half-a-dozen of the other. You ask Hogan, my boy.

Mr Browne, whose face was once more wrinkling with mirth, poured out for himself a glass of whisky while Freddy Malins exploded, before he had well reached the climax of his story, in a kink of high-pitched bronchitic laughter and, setting down his untasted and overflowing glass, began to rub the knuckles of his left fist backwards and forwards into his left eye, repeating words of his last phrase as well as his fit of laughter would allow him. Gabriel could not listen while Mary Jane was playing her Academy piece, full of runs and difficult passages, to the hushed drawing-room. He liked music but the piece she was playing had no melody for him and he doubted whether it had any melody for the other listeners, though they had begged Mary Jane to play something. Four young men, who had come from the refreshment-room to stand in the doorway at the sound of the piano, had gone away quietly in couples after a few minutes. The only persons who seemed to follow the music were Mary Jane herself, her hands racing along the keyboard or lifted from it at the pauses like those of a priestess in momentary imprecation, and Aunt Kate standing at her elbow to turn the page.

I didn\u2019t think you were a West Briton.\u201d A look of perplexity appeared on Gabriel\u2019s face. It was true that he wrote a literary column every Wednesday in _The Daily Express_, for which he was paid fifteen shillings. But that did not make him a West Briton surely. The books he received for review were almost more welcome than the paltry cheque. He loved to feel the covers and turn over the pages of newly printed books. Nearly every day when his teaching in the college was ended he used to wander down the quays to the second-hand booksellers, to Hickey\u2019s on Bachelor\u2019s Walk, to Webb\u2019s or Massey\u2019s on Aston\u2019s Quay, or to O\u2019Clohissey\u2019s in the by-street. He did not know how to meet her charge. He wanted to say that literature was above politics. But they were friends of many years\u2019 standing and their careers had been parallel, first at the university and then as teachers: he could not risk a grandiose phrase with her. He continued blinking his eyes and trying to smile and murmured lamely that he saw nothing political in writing reviews of books. When their turn to cross had come he was still perplexed and inattentive. Miss Ivors promptly took his hand in a warm grasp and said in a soft friendly tone: \u201cOf course, I was only joking. Come, we cross now.\u201d When they were together again she spoke of the University question and Gabriel felt more at ease."], "Which story takes place at a party?": [" His breeches, his white rubber shoes and his jauntily slung waterproof expressed youth. But his figure fell into rotundity at the waist, his hair was scant and grey and his face, when the waves of expression had passed over it, had a ravaged look. When he was quite sure that the narrative had ended he laughed noiselessly for fully half a minute. Then he said: \u201cWell!... That takes the biscuit!\u201d His voice seemed winnowed of vigour; and to enforce his words he added with humour: \u201cThat takes the solitary, unique, and, if I may so call it, _recherch\u00e9_ biscuit!\u201d He became serious and silent when he had said this. His tongue was tired for he had been talking all the afternoon in a public-house in Dorset Street. Most people considered Lenehan a leech but, in spite of this reputation, his adroitness and eloquence had always prevented his friends from forming any general policy against him. He had a brave manner of coming up to a party of them in a bar and of holding himself nimbly at the borders of the company until he was included in a round. He was a sporting vagrant armed with a vast stock of stories, limericks and riddles. He was insensitive to all kinds of discourtesy. No one knew how he achieved the stern task of living, but his name was vaguely associated with racing tissues. \u201cAnd where did you pick her up, Corley?\u201d he asked. Corley ran his tongue swiftly along his upper lip. \u201cOne night, man,\u201d he said, \u201cI was going along Dame Street and I spotted a fine tart under Waterhouse\u2019s clock and said good-night, you know.", " The sergeant makes them stand in a row against the wall and hold up their plates.\u201d He illustrated the story by grotesque gestures. \u201cAt dinner, you know.

He takes up a wad of cabbage on the spoon and pegs it across the room and the poor devils have to try and catch it on their plates: 65, _catch your cabbage_.\u201d Everyone laughed again: but Mr Kernan was somewhat indignant still.

She declined it, saying she was ironing downstairs, and, after having exchanged a nod with Mr Cunningham behind Mr Power\u2019s back, prepared to leave the room. Her husband called out to her: \u201cAnd have you nothing for me, duckie?\u201d \u201cO, you! The back of my hand to you!\u201d said Mrs Kernan tartly. Her husband called after her: \u201cNothing for poor little hubby!\u201d He assumed such a comical face and voice that the distribution of the bottles of stout took place amid general merriment.", " Farrington stood a drink in his turn. After a while O\u2019Halloran and Paddy Leonard came in and the story was repeated to them. O\u2019Halloran stood tailors of malt, hot, all round and told the story of the retort he had made to the chief clerk when he was in Callan\u2019s of Fownes\u2019s Street; but, as the retort was after the manner of the liberal shepherds in the eclogues, he had to admit that it was not as clever as Farrington\u2019s retort. At this Farrington told the boys to polish off that and have another. Just as they were naming their poisons who should come in but Higgins! Of course he had to join in with the others. The men asked him to give his version of it, and he did so with great vivacity for the sight of five small hot whiskies was very exhilarating. Everyone roared laughing when he showed the way in which Mr Alleyne shook his fist in Farrington\u2019s face. Then he imitated Farrington, saying, _\u201cAnd here was my nabs, as cool as you please,\u201d_ while Farrington looked at the company out of his heavy dirty eyes, smiling and at times drawing forth stray drops of liquor from his moustache with the aid of his lower lip. When that round was over there was a pause. O\u2019Halloran had money but neither of the other two seemed to have any; so the whole party left the shop somewhat regretfully.

They must have gone home by another way. The paper of his cigarette broke and he flung it into the road with a curse. Suddenly he saw them coming towards him. He started with delight and, keeping close to his lamp-post, tried to read the result in their walk. They were walking quickly, the young woman taking quick short steps, while Corley kept beside her with his long stride. They did not seem to be speaking. An intimation of the result pricked him like the point of a sharp instrument. He knew Corley would fail; he knew it was no go. They turned down Baggot Street and he followed them at once, taking the other footpath. When they stopped he stopped too. They talked for a few moments and then the young woman went down the steps into the area of a house. Corley remained standing at the edge of the path, a little distance from the front steps. Some minutes passed. Then the hall-door was opened slowly and cautiously. A woman came running down the front steps and coughed. Corley turned and went towards her. His broad figure hid hers from view for a few seconds and then she reappeared running up the steps. The door closed on her and Corley began to walk swiftly towards Stephen\u2019s Green. Lenehan hurried on in the same direction. Some drops of light rain fell. He took them as a warning and, glancing back towards the house which the young woman had entered to see that he was not observed, he ran eagerly across the road.", " He told her the names of the ships he had been on and the names of the different services. He had sailed through the Straits of Magellan and he told her stories of the terrible Patagonians.

Of course, her father had found out the affair and had forbidden her to have anything to say to him. \u201cI know these sailor chaps,\u201d he said. One day he had quarrelled with Frank and after that she had to meet her lover secretly. The evening deepened in the avenue. The white of two letters in her lap grew indistinct. One was to Harry; the other was to her father. Ernest had been her favourite but she liked Harry too. Her father was becoming old lately, she noticed; he would miss her. Sometimes he could be very nice. Not long before, when she had been laid up for a day, he had read her out a ghost story and made toast for her at the fire. Another day, when their mother was alive, they had all gone for a picnic to the Hill of Howth. She remembered her father putting on her mother\u2019s bonnet to make the children laugh. Her time was running out but she continued to sit by the window, leaning her head against the window curtain, inhaling the odour of dusty cretonne. Down far in the avenue she could hear a street organ playing. She knew the air. Strange that it should come that very night to remind her of the promise to her mother, her promise to keep the home together as long as she could.", " He had caught that haggard look upon her face for a moment when she was singing _Arrayed for the Bridal_. Soon, perhaps, he would be sitting in that same drawing-room, dressed in black, his silk hat on his knees. The blinds would be drawn down and Aunt Kate would be sitting beside him, crying and blowing her nose and telling him how Julia had died. He would cast about in his mind for some words that might console her, and would find only lame and useless ones. Yes, yes: that would happen very soon. The air of the room chilled his shoulders. He stretched himself cautiously along under the sheets and lay down beside his wife. One by one they were all becoming shades. Better pass boldly into that other world, in the full glory of some passion, than fade and wither dismally with age. He thought of how she who lay beside him had locked in her heart for so many years that image of her lover\u2019s eyes when he had told her that he did not wish to live. Generous tears filled Gabriel\u2019s eyes. He had never felt like that himself towards any woman but he knew that such a feeling must be love. The tears gathered more thickly in his eyes and in the partial darkness he imagined he saw the form of a young man standing under a dripping tree. Other forms were near. His soul had approached that region where dwell the vast hosts of the dead.

The decisive expression of her great florid face satisfied her and she thought of some mothers she knew who could not get their daughters off their hands. Mr Doran was very anxious indeed this Sunday morning. He had made two attempts to shave but his hand had been so unsteady that he had been obliged to desist. Three days\u2019 reddish beard fringed his jaws and every two or three minutes a mist gathered on his glasses so that he had to take them off and polish them with his pocket-handkerchief. The recollection of his confession of the night before was a cause of acute pain to him; the priest had drawn out every ridiculous detail of the affair and in the end had so magnified his sin that he was almost thankful at being afforded a loophole of reparation. The harm was done. What could he do now but marry her or run away? He could not brazen it out. The affair would be sure to be talked of and his employer would be certain to hear of it. Dublin is such a small city: everyone knows everyone else\u2019s business. He felt his heart leap warmly in his throat as he heard in his excited imagination old Mr Leonard calling out in his rasping voice: \u201cSend Mr Doran here, please.\u201d All his long years of service gone for nothing! All his industry and diligence thrown away! As a young man he had sown his wild oats, of course; he had boasted of his free-thinking and denied the existence of God to his companions in public-houses.", " Things went on so for a long time and Mrs Mooney began to think of sending Polly back to typewriting when she noticed that something was going on between Polly and one of the young men. She watched the pair and kept her own counsel. Polly knew that she was being watched, but still her mother\u2019s persistent silence could not be misunderstood. There had been no open complicity between mother and daughter, no open understanding but, though people in the house began to talk of the affair, still Mrs Mooney did not intervene. Polly began to grow a little strange in her manner and the young man was evidently perturbed. At last, when she judged it to be the right moment, Mrs Mooney intervened. She dealt with moral problems as a cleaver deals with meat: and in this case she had made up her mind. It was a bright Sunday morning of early summer, promising heat, but with a fresh breeze blowing. All the windows of the boarding house were open and the lace curtains ballooned gently towards the street beneath the raised sashes. The belfry of George\u2019s Church sent out constant peals and worshippers, singly or in groups, traversed the little circus before the church, revealing their purpose by their self-contained demeanour no less than by the little volumes in their gloved hands. Breakfast was over in the boarding house and the table of the breakfast-room was covered with plates on which lay yellow streaks of eggs with morsels of bacon-fat and bacon-rind.", " One night he went for his wife with the cleaver and she had to sleep in a neighbour\u2019s house. After that they lived apart. She went to the priest and got a separation from him with care of the children. She would give him neither money nor food nor house-room; and so he was obliged to enlist himself as a sheriff\u2019s man. He was a shabby stooped little drunkard with a white face and a white moustache and white eyebrows, pencilled above his little eyes, which were pink-veined and raw; and all day long he sat in the bailiff\u2019s room, waiting to be put on a job. Mrs Mooney, who had taken what remained of her money out of the butcher business and set up a boarding house in Hardwicke Street, was a big imposing woman. Her house had a floating population made up of tourists from Liverpool and the Isle of Man and, occasionally, _artistes_ from the music-halls. Its resident population was made up of clerks from the city. She governed her house cunningly and firmly, knew when to give credit, when to be stern and when to let things pass. All the resident young men spoke of her as _The Madam_. Mrs Mooney\u2019s young men paid fifteen shillings a week for board and lodgings (beer or stout at dinner excluded). They shared in common tastes and occupations and for this reason they were very chummy with one another. They discussed with one another the chances of favourites and outsiders.

Mrs Kearney said that the Committee had treated her scandalously. She had spared neither trouble nor expense and this was how she was repaid. They thought they had only a girl to deal with and that, therefore, they could ride roughshod over her. But she would show them their mistake. They wouldn\u2019t have dared to have treated her like that if she had been a man. But she would see that her daughter got her rights: she wouldn\u2019t be fooled. If they didn\u2019t pay her to the last farthing she would make Dublin ring. Of course she was sorry for the sake of the _artistes_. But what else could she do? She appealed to the second tenor who said he thought she had not been well treated. Then she appealed to Miss Healy. Miss Healy wanted to join the other group but she did not like to do so because she was a great friend of Kathleen\u2019s and the Kearneys had often invited her to their house. As soon as the first part was ended Mr Fitzpatrick and Mr Holohan went over to Mrs Kearney and told her that the other four guineas would be paid after the Committee meeting on the following Tuesday and that, in case her daughter did not play for the second part, the Committee would consider the contract broken and would pay nothing.", " \u201cDid Mr Tierney say when he\u2019d be back?\u201d he asked in a husky falsetto. \u201cHe didn\u2019t say.\u201d Mr O\u2019Connor put his cigarette into his mouth and began to search his pockets.

Tierney, P.L.G., respectfully solicits the favour of your vote and influence at the coming election in the Royal Exchange Ward. Mr O\u2019Connor had been engaged by Tierney\u2019s agent to canvass one part of the ward but, as the weather was inclement and his boots let in the wet, he spent a great part of the day sitting by the fire in the Committee Room in Wicklow Street with Jack, the old caretaker. They had been sitting thus since the short day had grown dark. It was the sixth of October, dismal and cold out of doors. Mr O\u2019Connor tore a strip off the card and, lighting it, lit his cigarette. As he did so the flame lit up a leaf of dark glossy ivy in the lapel of his coat.

He began to doubt the reality of what memory told him. He halted under a tree and allowed the rhythm to die away. He could not feel her near him in the darkness nor her voice touch his ear. He waited for some minutes listening. He could hear nothing: the night was perfectly silent. He listened again: perfectly silent. He felt that he was alone. IVY DAY IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM Old Jack raked the cinders together with a piece of cardboard and spread them judiciously over the whitening dome of coals. When the dome was thinly covered his face lapsed into darkness but, as he set himself to fan the fire again, his crouching shadow ascended the opposite wall and his face slowly re-emerged into light. It was an old man\u2019s face, very bony and hairy. The moist blue eyes blinked at the fire and the moist mouth fell open at times, munching once or twice mechanically when it closed. When the cinders had caught he laid the piece of cardboard against the wall, sighed and said: \u201cThat\u2019s better now, Mr O\u2019Connor.\u201d Mr O\u2019Connor, a grey-haired young man, whose face was disfigured by many blotches and pimples, had just brought the tobacco for a cigarette into a shapely cylinder but when spoken to he undid his handiwork meditatively.

But, he told his hearers, the text had seemed to him specially adapted for the guidance of those whose lot it was to lead the life of the world and who yet wished to lead that life not in the manner of worldlings. It was a text for business men and professional men. Jesus Christ, with His divine understanding of every cranny of our human nature, understood that all men were not called to the religious life, that by far the vast majority were forced to live in the world and, to a certain extent, for the world: and in this sentence He designed to give them a word of counsel, setting before them as exemplars in the religious life those very worshippers of Mammon who were of all men the least solicitous in matters religious. He told his hearers that he was there that evening for no terrifying, no extravagant purpose; but as a man of the world speaking to his fellow-men. He came to speak to business men and he would speak to them in a businesslike way. If he might use the metaphor, he said, he was their spiritual accountant; and he wished each and every one of his hearers to open his books, the books of his spiritual life, and see if they tallied accurately with conscience. Jesus Christ was not a hard taskmaster. He understood our little failings, understood the weakness of our poor fallen nature, understood the temptations of this life.", " \u201cThat so, John?\u201d \u201cYes. I got him one or two sure things in Dawson Street, Crofton and myself. Between ourselves, you know, Crofton (he\u2019s a decent chap, of course), but he\u2019s not worth a damn as a canvasser. He hasn\u2019t a word to throw to a dog. He stands and looks at the people while I do the talking.\u201d Here two men entered the room. One of them was a very fat man whose blue serge clothes seemed to be in danger of falling from his sloping figure. He had a big face which resembled a young ox\u2019s face in expression, staring blue eyes and a grizzled moustache. The other man, who was much younger and frailer, had a thin, clean-shaven face. He wore a very high double collar and a wide-brimmed bowler hat. \u201cHello, Crofton!\u201d said Mr Henchy to the fat man. \u201cTalk of the devil....\u201d \u201cWhere did the boose come from?\u201d asked the young man. \u201cDid the cow calve?\u201d \u201cO, of course, Lyons spots the drink first thing!\u201d said Mr O\u2019Connor, laughing. \u201cIs that the way you chaps canvass,\u201d said Mr Lyons, \u201cand Crofton and I out in the cold and rain looking for votes?\u201d \u201cWhy, blast your soul,\u201d said Mr Henchy, \u201cI\u2019d get more votes in five minutes than you two\u2019d get in a week.\u201d \u201cOpen two bottles of stout, Jack,\u201d said Mr O\u2019Connor. \u201cHow can I?\u201d said the old man, \u201cwhen there\u2019s no corkscrew?\u201d \u201cWait now, wait now!\u201d said Mr Henchy, getting up quickly. \u201cDid you ever see this little trick?\u201d He took two bottles from the table and, carrying them to the fire, put them on the hob.", " He was fond of using soldiers\u2019 obscenities: usually he came home in the small hours. When he met his friends he had always a good one to tell them and he was always sure to be on to a good thing\u2014that is to say, a likely horse or a likely _artiste_. He was also handy with the mits and sang comic songs. On Sunday nights there would often be a reunion in Mrs Mooney\u2019s front drawing-room. The music-hall _artistes_ would oblige; and Sheridan played waltzes and polkas and vamped accompaniments. Polly Mooney, the Madam\u2019s daughter, would also sing. She sang: _I\u2019m a ... naughty girl. You needn\u2019t sham: You know I am._ Polly was a slim girl of nineteen; she had light soft hair and a small full mouth. Her eyes, which were grey with a shade of green through them, had a habit of glancing upwards when she spoke with anyone, which made her look like a little perverse madonna. Mrs Mooney had first sent her daughter to be a typist in a corn-factor\u2019s office but, as a disreputable sheriff\u2019s man used to come every other day to the office, asking to be allowed to say a word to his daughter, she had taken her daughter home again and set her to do housework. As Polly was very lively the intention was to give her the run of the young men. Besides, young men like to feel that there is a young woman not very far away. Polly, of course, flirted with the young men but Mrs Mooney, who was a shrewd judge, knew that the young men were only passing the time away: none of them meant business.", " Mrs Kearney wrapped the cloak round her daughter and followed him. As she passed through the doorway she stopped and glared into Mr Holohan\u2019s face. \u201cI\u2019m not done with you yet,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m done with you,\u201d said Mr Holohan.

They succeeded in turning him over. His hat had rolled a few yards away and his clothes were smeared with the filth and ooze of the floor on which he had lain, face downwards. His eyes were closed and he breathed with a grunting noise. A thin stream of blood trickled from the corner of his mouth. These two gentlemen and one of the curates carried him up the stairs and laid him down again on the floor of the bar. In two minutes he was surrounded by a ring of men. The manager of the bar asked everyone who he was and who was with him. No one knew who he was but one of the curates said he had served the gentleman with a small rum. \u201cWas he by himself?\u201d asked the manager. \u201cNo, sir.

Captain Sinico, of Leoville, Sydney Parade, husband of the deceased, also gave evidence. He stated that the deceased was his wife. He was not in Dublin at the time of the accident as he had arrived only that morning from Rotterdam. They had been married for twenty-two years and had lived happily until about two years ago when his wife began to be rather intemperate in her habits. Miss Mary Sinico said that of late her mother had been in the habit of going out at night to buy spirits. She, witness, had often tried to reason with her mother and had induced her to join a league. She was not at home until an hour after the accident. The jury returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence and exonerated Lennon from all blame. The Deputy Coroner said it was a most painful case, and expressed great sympathy with Captain Sinico and his daughter. He urged on the railway company to take strong measures to prevent the possibility of similar accidents in the future. No blame attached to anyone. Mr Duffy raised his eyes from the paper and gazed out of his window on the cheerless evening landscape. The river lay quiet beside the empty distillery and from time to time a light appeared in some house on the Lucan road.", " He had been a clerk in the Midland Railway, a canvasser for advertisements for _The Irish Times_ and for _The Freeman\u2019s Journal_, a town traveller for a coal firm on commission, a private inquiry agent, a clerk in the office of the Sub-Sheriff and he had recently become secretary to the City Coroner. His new office made him professionally interested in Mr Kernan\u2019s case. \u201cPain? Not much,\u201d answered Mr Kernan. \u201cBut it\u2019s so sickening. I feel as if I wanted to retch off.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the boose,\u201d said Mr Cunningham firmly. \u201cNo,\u201d said Mr Kernan. \u201cI think I caught a cold on the car.

When Mr Cunningham made that remark, people were silent. It was known that the speaker had secret sources of information. In this case the monosyllable had a moral intention.", " Then she played the prelude and said _\u201cNow, Maria!\u201d_ and Maria, blushing very much began to sing in a tiny quavering voice. She sang _I Dreamt that I Dwelt_, and when she came to the second verse she sang again: _I dreamt that I dwelt in marble halls With vassals and serfs at my side And of all who assembled within those walls That I was the hope and the pride. I had riches too great to count, could boast Of a high ancestral name, But I also dreamt, which pleased me most, That you loved me still the same._ But no one tried to show her her mistake; and when she had ended her song Joe was very much moved. He said that there was no time like the long ago and no music for him like poor old Balfe, whatever other people might say; and his eyes filled up so much with tears that he could not find what he was looking for and in the end he had to ask his wife to tell him where the corkscrew was. A PAINFUL CASE Mr James Duffy lived in Chapelizod because he wished to live as far as possible from the city of which he was a citizen and because he found all the other suburbs of Dublin mean, modern and pretentious. He lived in an old sombre house and from his windows he could look into the disused distillery or upwards along the shallow river on which Dublin is built. The lofty walls of his uncarpeted room were free from pictures. He had himself bought every article of furniture in the room: a black iron bedstead, an iron washstand, four cane chairs, a clothes-rack, a coal-scuttle, a fender and irons and a square table on which lay a double desk.", " He met her again a few weeks afterwards at a concert in Earlsfort Terrace and seized the moments when her daughter\u2019s attention was diverted to become intimate. She alluded once or twice to her husband but her tone was not such as to make the allusion a warning. Her name was Mrs Sinico. Her husband\u2019s great-great-grandfather had come from Leghorn. Her husband was captain of a mercantile boat plying between Dublin and Holland; and they had one child. Meeting her a third time by accident he found courage to make an appointment. She came. This was the first of many meetings; they met always in the evening and chose the most quiet quarters for their walks together. Mr Duffy, however, had a distaste for underhand ways and, finding that they were compelled to meet stealthily, he forced her to ask him to her house. Captain Sinico encouraged his visits, thinking that his daughter\u2019s hand was in question. He had dismissed his wife so sincerely from his gallery of pleasures that he did not suspect that anyone else would take an interest in her. As the husband was often away and the daughter out giving music lessons Mr Duffy had many opportunities of enjoying the lady\u2019s society. Neither he nor she had had any such adventure before and neither was conscious of any incongruity. Little by little he entangled his thoughts with hers. He lent her books, provided her with ideas, shared his intellectual life with her."], "Who is the antagonist of \u201cCounterparts,\u201d who exacerbates the main character\u2019s rage?": [" It never fell away.\u201d \u201cIs that so?\u201d asked Mr M\u2019Coy. \u201cThat\u2019s a fact,\u201d said Mr Cunningham. \u201cThat\u2019s history.\u201d \u201cLook at their church, too,\u201d said Mr Power. \u201cLook at the congregation they have.\u201d \u201cThe Jesuits cater for the upper classes,\u201d said Mr M\u2019Coy. \u201cOf course,\u201d said Mr Power. \u201cYes,\u201d said Mr Kernan. \u201cThat\u2019s why I have a feeling for them.

He did not know how he could begin. Was she annoyed, too, about something? If she would only turn to him or come to him of her own accord! To take her as she was would be brutal. No, he must see some ardour in her eyes first. He longed to be master of her strange mood. \u201cWhen did you lend him the pound?\u201d she asked, after a pause. Gabriel strove to restrain himself from breaking out into brutal language about the sottish Malins and his pound. He longed to cry to her from his soul, to crush her body against his, to overmaster her. But he said: \u201cO, at Christmas, when he opened that little Christmas-card shop in Henry Street.\u201d He was in such a fever of rage and desire that he did not hear her come from the window.", " He listened while the paroxysm of the child\u2019s sobbing grew less and less; and tears of remorse started to his eyes.

He went heavily upstairs until he came to the second landing, where a door bore a brass plate with the inscription _Mr Alleyne_. Here he halted, puffing with labour and vexation, and knocked. The shrill voice cried: \u201cCome in!\u201d The man entered Mr Alleyne\u2019s room. Simultaneously Mr Alleyne, a little man wearing gold-rimmed glasses on a clean-shaven face, shot his head up over a pile of documents. The head itself was so pink and hairless it seemed like a large egg reposing on the papers. Mr Alleyne did not lose a moment: \u201cFarrington? What is the meaning of this? Why have I always to complain of you? May I ask you why you haven\u2019t made a copy of that contract between Bodley and Kirwan?", " She had hard work to keep the house together and to see that the two young children who had been left to her charge went to school regularly and got their meals regularly. It was hard work\u2014a hard life\u2014but now that she was about to leave it she did not find it a wholly undesirable life. She was about to explore another life with Frank. Frank was very kind, manly, open-hearted. She was to go away with him by the night-boat to be his wife and to live with him in Buenos Ayres where he had a home waiting for her. How well she remembered the first time she had seen him; he was lodging in a house on the main road where she used to visit. It seemed a few weeks ago. He was standing at the gate, his peaked cap pushed back on his head and his hair tumbled forward over a face of bronze. Then they had come to know each other. He used to meet her outside the Stores every evening and see her home. He took her to see _The Bohemian Girl_ and she felt elated as she sat in an unaccustomed part of the theatre with him. He was awfully fond of music and sang a little. People knew that they were courting and, when he sang about the lass that loves a sailor, she always felt pleasantly confused. He used to call her Poppens out of fun. First of all it had been an excitement for her to have a fellow and then she had begun to like him. He had tales of distant countries. He had started as a deck boy at a pound a month on a ship of the Allan Line going out to Canada."], "Who is the only character in Dubliners to voice his unhappiness at living in Ireland?": [" But we are living in a sceptical and, if I may use the phrase, a thought-tormented age: and sometimes I fear that this new generation, educated or hypereducated as it is, will lack those qualities of humanity, of hospitality, of kindly humour which belonged to an older day. Listening tonight to the names of all those great singers of the past it seemed to me, I must confess, that we were living in a less spacious age. Those days might, without exaggeration, be called spacious days: and if they are gone beyond recall let us hope, at least, that in gatherings such as this we shall still speak of them with pride and affection, still cherish in our hearts the memory of those dead and gone great ones whose fame the world will not willingly let die.\u201d \u201cHear, hear!\u201d said Mr Browne loudly. \u201cBut yet,\u201d continued Gabriel, his voice falling into a softer inflection, \u201cthere are always in gatherings such as this sadder thoughts that will recur to our minds: thoughts of the past, of youth, of changes, of absent faces that we miss here tonight. Our path through life is strewn with many such sad memories: and were we to brood upon them always we could not find the heart to go on bravely with our work among the living. We have all of us living duties and living affections which claim, and rightly claim, our strenuous endeavours. \u201cTherefore, I will not linger on the past.

The dark discreet room, their isolation, the music that still vibrated in their ears united them. This union exalted him, wore away the rough edges of his character, emotionalised his mental life. Sometimes he caught himself listening to the sound of his own voice. He thought that in her eyes he would ascend to an angelical stature; and, as he attached the fervent nature of his companion more and more closely to him, he heard the strange impersonal voice which he recognised as his own, insisting on the soul\u2019s incurable loneliness. We cannot give ourselves, it said: we are our own. The end of these discourses was that one night during which she had shown every sign of unusual excitement, Mrs Sinico caught up his hand passionately and pressed it to her cheek. Mr Duffy was very much surprised. Her interpretation of his words disillusioned him. He did not visit her for a week, then he wrote to her asking her to meet him. As he did not wish their last interview to be troubled by the influence of their ruined confessional they met in a little cakeshop near the Parkgate. It was cold autumn weather but in spite of the cold they wandered up and down the roads of the Park for nearly three hours. They agreed to break off their intercourse: every bond, he said, is a bond to sorrow.

And now she had nobody to protect her. Ernest was dead and Harry, who was in the church decorating business, was nearly always down somewhere in the country. Besides, the invariable squabble for money on Saturday nights had begun to weary her unspeakably.

At the crest of the hill at Inchicore sightseers had gathered in clumps to watch the cars careering homeward and through this channel of poverty and inaction the Continent sped its wealth and industry. Now and again the clumps of people raised the cheer of the gratefully oppressed. Their sympathy, however, was for the blue cars\u2014the cars of their friends, the French.", " EVELINE She sat at the window watching the evening invade the avenue. Her head was leaned against the window curtains and in her nostrils was the odour of dusty cretonne. She was tired. Few people passed. The man out of the last house passed on his way home; she heard his footsteps clacking along the concrete pavement and afterwards crunching on the cinder path before the new red houses. One time there used to be a field there in which they used to play every evening with other people\u2019s children. Then a man from Belfast bought the field and built houses in it\u2014not like their little brown houses but bright brick houses with shining roofs. The children of the avenue used to play together in that field\u2014the Devines, the Waters, the Dunns, little Keogh the cripple, she and her brothers and sisters. Ernest, however, never played: he was too grown up. Her father used often to hunt them in out of the field with his blackthorn stick; but usually little Keogh used to keep _nix_ and call out when he saw her father coming. Still they seemed to have been rather happy then. Her father was not so bad then; and besides, her mother was alive. That was a long time ago; she and her brothers and sisters were all grown up; her mother was dead. Tizzie Dunn was dead, too, and the Waters had gone back to England. Everything changes. Now she was going to go away like the others, to leave her home. Home!"], "Which of Farrington\u2019s traits set him apart from other Dubliners characters?": [" Farrington stood a drink in his turn. After a while O\u2019Halloran and Paddy Leonard came in and the story was repeated to them. O\u2019Halloran stood tailors of malt, hot, all round and told the story of the retort he had made to the chief clerk when he was in Callan\u2019s of Fownes\u2019s Street; but, as the retort was after the manner of the liberal shepherds in the eclogues, he had to admit that it was not as clever as Farrington\u2019s retort. At this Farrington told the boys to polish off that and have another. Just as they were naming their poisons who should come in but Higgins! Of course he had to join in with the others. The men asked him to give his version of it, and he did so with great vivacity for the sight of five small hot whiskies was very exhilarating. Everyone roared laughing when he showed the way in which Mr Alleyne shook his fist in Farrington\u2019s face. Then he imitated Farrington, saying, _\u201cAnd here was my nabs, as cool as you please,\u201d_ while Farrington looked at the company out of his heavy dirty eyes, smiling and at times drawing forth stray drops of liquor from his moustache with the aid of his lower lip. When that round was over there was a pause. O\u2019Halloran had money but neither of the other two seemed to have any; so the whole party left the shop somewhat regretfully. At the corner of Duke Street Higgins and Nosey Flynn bevelled off to the left while the other three turned back towards the city.", " Rain was drizzling down on the cold streets and, when they reached the Ballast Office, Farrington suggested the Scotch House. The bar was full of men and loud with the noise of tongues and glasses. The three men pushed past the whining match-sellers at the door and formed a little party at the corner of the counter. They began to exchange stories. Leonard introduced them to a young fellow named Weathers who was performing at the Tivoli as an acrobat and knockabout _artiste_. Farrington stood a drink all round. Weathers said he would take a small Irish and Apollinaris. Farrington, who had definite notions of what was what, asked the boys would they have an Apollinaris too; but the boys told Tim to make theirs hot. The talk became theatrical. O\u2019Halloran stood a round and then Farrington stood another round, Weathers protesting that the hospitality was too Irish. He promised to get them in behind the scenes and introduce them to some nice girls. O\u2019Halloran said that he and Leonard would go, but that Farrington wouldn\u2019t go because he was a married man; and Farrington\u2019s heavy dirty eyes leered at the company in token that he understood he was being chaffed. Weathers made them all have just one little tincture at his expense and promised to meet them later on at Mulligan\u2019s in Poolbeg Street. When the Scotch House closed they went round to Mulligan\u2019s. They went into the parlour at the back and O\u2019Halloran ordered small hot specials all round.", " He was so angry that he lost count of the conversation of his friends. When Paddy Leonard called him he found that they were talking about feats of strength. Weathers was showing his biceps muscle to the company and boasting so much that the other two had called on Farrington to uphold the national honour. Farrington pulled up his sleeve accordingly and showed his biceps muscle to the company. The two arms were examined and compared and finally it was agreed to have a trial of strength. The table was cleared and the two men rested their elbows on it, clasping hands. When Paddy Leonard said _\u201cGo!\u201d_ each was to try to bring down the other\u2019s hand on to the table. Farrington looked very serious and determined. The trial began. After about thirty seconds Weathers brought his opponent\u2019s hand slowly down on to the table. Farrington\u2019s dark wine-coloured face flushed darker still with anger and humiliation at having been defeated by such a stripling. \u201cYou\u2019re not to put the weight of your body behind it. Play fair,\u201d he said. \u201cWho\u2019s not playing fair?\u201d said the other. \u201cCome on again. The two best out of three.\u201d The trial began again. The veins stood out on Farrington\u2019s forehead, and the pallor of Weathers\u2019 complexion changed to peony. Their hands and arms trembled under the stress. After a long struggle Weathers again brought his opponent\u2019s hand slowly on to the table. There was a murmur of applause from the spectators.", " They were all beginning to feel mellow. Farrington was just standing another round when Weathers came back. Much to Farrington\u2019s relief he drank a glass of bitter this time. Funds were getting low but they had enough to keep them going. Presently two young women with big hats and a young man in a check suit came in and sat at a table close by. Weathers saluted them and told the company that they were out of the Tivoli. Farrington\u2019s eyes wandered at every moment in the direction of one of the young women. There was something striking in her appearance. An immense scarf of peacock-blue muslin was wound round her hat and knotted in a great bow under her chin; and she wore bright yellow gloves, reaching to the elbow. Farrington gazed admiringly at the plump arm which she moved very often and with much grace; and when, after a little time, she answered his gaze he admired still more her large dark brown eyes. The oblique staring expression in them fascinated him. She glanced at him once or twice and, when the party was leaving the room, she brushed against his chair and said _\u201cO, pardon!\u201d_ in a London accent. He watched her leave the room in the hope that she would look back at him, but he was disappointed. He cursed his want of money and cursed all the rounds he had stood, particularly all the whiskies and Apollinaris which he had stood to Weathers. If there was one thing that he hated it was a sponge."], "Which character is so driven by a need for routine that he sacrifices love for familiarity?": [" She remembered the last night of her mother\u2019s illness; she was again in the close dark room at the other side of the hall and outside she heard a melancholy air of Italy. The organ-player had been ordered to go away and given sixpence. She remembered her father strutting back into the sickroom saying: \u201cDamned Italians! coming over here!\u201d As she mused the pitiful vision of her mother\u2019s life laid its spell on the very quick of her being\u2014that life of commonplace sacrifices closing in final craziness. She trembled as she heard again her mother\u2019s voice saying constantly with foolish insistence: \u201cDerevaun Seraun! Derevaun Seraun!\u201d She stood up in a sudden impulse of terror. Escape! She must escape! Frank would save her. He would give her life, perhaps love, too. But she wanted to live. Why should she be unhappy? She had a right to happiness. Frank would take her in his arms, fold her in his arms. He would save her. She stood among the swaying crowd in the station at the North Wall. He held her hand and she knew that he was speaking to her, saying something about the passage over and over again. The station was full of soldiers with brown baggages. Through the wide doors of the sheds she caught a glimpse of the black mass of the boat, lying in beside the quay wall, with illumined portholes. She answered nothing. She felt her cheek pale and cold and, out of a maze of distress, she prayed to God to direct her, to show her what was her duty.", " It never fell away.\u201d \u201cIs that so?\u201d asked Mr M\u2019Coy. \u201cThat\u2019s a fact,\u201d said Mr Cunningham. \u201cThat\u2019s history.\u201d \u201cLook at their church, too,\u201d said Mr Power. \u201cLook at the congregation they have.\u201d \u201cThe Jesuits cater for the upper classes,\u201d said Mr M\u2019Coy. \u201cOf course,\u201d said Mr Power. \u201cYes,\u201d said Mr Kernan. \u201cThat\u2019s why I have a feeling for them.

He was full of smouldering anger and revengefulness. He felt humiliated and discontented; he did not even feel drunk; and he had only twopence in his pocket. He cursed everything. He had done for himself in the office, pawned his watch, spent all his money; and he had not even got drunk. He began to feel thirsty again and he longed to be back again in the hot reeking public-house. He had lost his reputation as a strong man, having been defeated twice by a mere boy. His heart swelled with fury and, when he thought of the woman in the big hat who had brushed against him and said _Pardon!_ his fury nearly choked him. His tram let him down at Shelbourne Road and he steered his great body along in the shadow of the wall of the barracks. He loathed returning to his home. When he went in by the side-door he found the kitchen empty and the kitchen fire nearly out.", " O love!\u201d_ many times. At last she spoke to me. When she addressed the first words to me I was so confused that I did not know what to answer. She asked me was I going to _Araby_. I forgot whether I answered yes or no. It would be a splendid bazaar, she said; she would love to go. \u201cAnd why can\u2019t you?\u201d I asked. While she spoke she turned a silver bracelet round and round her wrist. She could not go, she said, because there would be a retreat that week in her convent. Her brother and two other boys were fighting for their caps and I was alone at the railings. She held one of the spikes, bowing her head towards me. The light from the lamp opposite our door caught the white curve of her neck, lit up her hair that rested there and, falling, lit up the hand upon the railing. It fell over one side of her dress and caught the white border of a petticoat, just visible as she stood at ease. \u201cIt\u2019s well for you,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I go,\u201d I said, \u201cI will bring you something.\u201d What innumerable follies laid waste my waking and sleeping thoughts after that evening! I wished to annihilate the tedious intervening days. I chafed against the work of school. At night in my bedroom and by day in the classroom her image came between me and the page I strove to read. The syllables of the word _Araby_ were called to me through the silence in which my soul luxuriated and cast an Eastern enchantment over me. I asked for leave to go to the bazaar on Saturday night."], "The narrator of \u201cAraby\u201d is caught on the threshold between ___ and ___.": [" What an end! The whole narrative of her death revolted him and it revolted him to think that he had ever spoken to her of what he held sacred. The threadbare phrases, the inane expressions of sympathy, the cautious words of a reporter won over to conceal the details of a commonplace vulgar death attacked his stomach. Not merely had she degraded herself; she had degraded him. He saw the squalid tract of her vice, miserable and malodorous. His soul\u2019s companion! He thought of the hobbling wretches whom he had seen carrying cans and bottles to be filled by the barman. Just God, what an end! Evidently she had been unfit to live, without any strength of purpose, an easy prey to habits, one of the wrecks on which civilisation has been reared. But that she could have sunk so low! Was it possible he had deceived himself so utterly about her? He remembered her outburst of that night and interpreted it in a harsher sense than he had ever done. He had no difficulty now in approving of the course he had taken. As the light failed and his memory began to wander he thought her hand touched his. The shock which had first attacked his stomach was now attacking his nerves. He put on his overcoat and hat quickly and went out. The cold air met him on the threshold; it crept into the sleeves of his coat. When he came to the public-house at Chapelizod Bridge he went in and ordered a hot punch. The proprietor served him obsequiously but did not venture to talk.", " And if a boy had a girl for a sweetheart and told lies about it then he would give him such a whipping as no boy ever got in this world. He said that there was nothing in this world he would like so well as that. He described to me how he would whip such a boy as if he were unfolding some elaborate mystery. He would love that, he said, better than anything in this world; and his voice, as he led me monotonously through the mystery, grew almost affectionate and seemed to plead with me that I should understand him. I waited till his monologue paused again. Then I stood up abruptly. Lest I should betray my agitation I delayed a few moments pretending to fix my shoe properly and then, saying that I was obliged to go, I bade him good-day. I went up the slope calmly but my heart was beating quickly with fear that he would seize me by the ankles. When I reached the top of the slope I turned round and, without looking at him, called loudly across the field: \u201cMurphy!\u201d My voice had an accent of forced bravery in it and I was ashamed of my paltry stratagem.

At last she spoke to me. When she addressed the first words to me I was so confused that I did not know what to answer. She asked me was I going to _Araby_. I forgot whether I answered yes or no. It would be a splendid bazaar, she said; she would love to go. \u201cAnd why can\u2019t you?\u201d I asked. While she spoke she turned a silver bracelet round and round her wrist. She could not go, she said, because there would be a retreat that week in her convent. Her brother and two other boys were fighting for their caps and I was alone at the railings. She held one of the spikes, bowing her head towards me. The light from the lamp opposite our door caught the white curve of her neck, lit up her hair that rested there and, falling, lit up the hand upon the railing.

She took out her purse with the silver clasps and read again the words _A Present from Belfast_. She was very fond of that purse because Joe had brought it to her five years before when he and Alphy had gone to Belfast on a Whit-Monday trip. In the purse were two half-crowns and some coppers. She would have five shillings clear after paying tram fare. What a nice evening they would have, all the children singing! Only she hoped that Joe wouldn\u2019t come in drunk.

She went into her little bedroom and, remembering that the next morning was a mass morning, changed the hand of the alarm from seven to six. Then she took off her working skirt and her house-boots and laid her best skirt out on the bed and her tiny dress-boots beside the foot of the bed. She changed her blouse too and, as she stood before the mirror, she thought of how she used to dress for mass on Sunday morning when she was a young girl; and she looked with quaint affection at the diminutive body which she had so often adorned. In spite of its years she found it a nice tidy little body. When she got outside the streets were shining with rain and she was glad of her old brown waterproof. The tram was full and she had to sit on the little stool at the end of the car, facing all the people, with her toes barely touching the floor.

The dark discreet room, their isolation, the music that still vibrated in their ears united them. This union exalted him, wore away the rough edges of his character, emotionalised his mental life. Sometimes he caught himself listening to the sound of his own voice. He thought that in her eyes he would ascend to an angelical stature; and, as he attached the fervent nature of his companion more and more closely to him, he heard the strange impersonal voice which he recognised as his own, insisting on the soul\u2019s incurable loneliness. We cannot give ourselves, it said: we are our own. The end of these discourses was that one night during which she had shown every sign of unusual excitement, Mrs Sinico caught up his hand passionately and pressed it to her cheek. Mr Duffy was very much surprised. Her interpretation of his words disillusioned him. He did not visit her for a week, then he wrote to her asking her to meet him. As he did not wish their last interview to be troubled by the influence of their ruined confessional they met in a little cakeshop near the Parkgate. It was cold autumn weather but in spite of the cold they wandered up and down the roads of the Park for nearly three hours.

He lived at a little distance from his body, regarding his own acts with doubtful side-glances. He had an odd autobiographical habit which led him to compose in his mind from time to time a short sentence about himself containing a subject in the third person and a predicate in the past tense.

Her head was leaned against the window curtains and in her nostrils was the odour of dusty cretonne. She was tired. Few people passed. The man out of the last house passed on his way home; she heard his footsteps clacking along the concrete pavement and afterwards crunching on the cinder path before the new red houses. One time there used to be a field there in which they used to play every evening with other people\u2019s children. Then a man from Belfast bought the field and built houses in it\u2014not like their little brown houses but bright brick houses with shining roofs. The children of the avenue used to play together in that field\u2014the Devines, the Waters, the Dunns, little Keogh the cripple, she and her brothers and sisters. Ernest, however, never played: he was too grown up. Her father used often to hunt them in out of the field with his blackthorn stick; but usually little Keogh used to keep _nix_ and call out when he saw her father coming. Still they seemed to have been rather happy then. Her father was not so bad then; and besides, her mother was alive. That was a long time ago; she and her brothers and sisters were all grown up; her mother was dead. Tizzie Dunn was dead, too, and the Waters had gone back to England. Everything changes.

The voice, made plaintive by distance and by the singer\u2019s hoarseness, faintly illuminated the cadence of the air with words expressing grief: O, the rain falls on my heavy locks And the dew wets my skin, My babe lies cold.... \u201cO,\u201d exclaimed Mary Jane.", " The man listened to the clicking of the machine for a few minutes and then set to work to finish his copy. But his head was not clear and his mind wandered away to the glare and rattle of the public-house. It was a night for hot punches. He struggled on with his copy, but when the clock struck five he had still fourteen pages to write. Blast it! He couldn\u2019t finish it in time. He longed to execrate aloud, to bring his fist down on something violently. He was so enraged that he wrote _Bernard Bernard_ instead of _Bernard Bodley_ and had to begin again on a clean sheet. He felt strong enough to clear out the whole office singlehanded. His body ached to do something, to rush out and revel in violence. All the indignities of his life enraged him.... Could he ask the cashier privately for an advance? No, the cashier was no good, no damn good: he wouldn\u2019t give an advance.... He knew where he would meet the boys: Leonard and O\u2019Halloran and Nosey Flynn. The barometer of his emotional nature was set for a spell of riot. His imagination had so abstracted him that his name was called twice before he answered. Mr Alleyne and Miss Delacour were standing outside the counter and all the clerks had turn round in anticipation of something. The man got up from his desk. Mr Alleyne began a tirade of abuse, saying that two letters were missing. The man answered that he knew nothing about them, that he had made a faithful copy.", " She listened to all. Sometimes in return for his theories she gave out some fact of her own life. With almost maternal solicitude she urged him to let his nature open to the full: she became his confessor. He told her that for some time he had assisted at the meetings of an Irish Socialist Party where he had felt himself a unique figure amidst a score of sober workmen in a garret lit by an inefficient oil-lamp. When the party had divided into three sections, each under its own leader and in its own garret, he had discontinued his attendances. The workmen\u2019s discussions, he said, were too timorous; the interest they took in the question of wages was inordinate. He felt that they were hard-featured realists and that they resented an exactitude which was the produce of a leisure not within their reach. No social revolution, he told her, would be likely to strike Dublin for some centuries. She asked him why did he not write out his thoughts. For what, he asked her, with careful scorn. To compete with phrasemongers, incapable of thinking consecutively for sixty seconds? To submit himself to the criticisms of an obtuse middle class which entrusted its morality to policemen and its fine arts to impresarios? He went often to her little cottage outside Dublin; often they spent their evenings alone. Little by little, as their thoughts entangled, they spoke of subjects less remote. Her companionship was like a warm soil about an exotic."], "At the start of \u201cThe Sisters,\u201d what is the protagonist watching for that will indicate Father Flynn\u2019s death?": [" EVELINE She sat at the window watching the evening invade the avenue.

She seemed to be near him in the darkness. At moments he seemed to feel her voice touch his ear, her hand touch his. He stood still to listen. Why had he withheld life from her? Why had he sentenced her to death? He felt his moral nature falling to pieces. When he gained the crest of the Magazine Hill he halted and looked along the river towards Dublin, the lights of which burned redly and hospitably in the cold night. He looked down the slope and, at the base, in the shadow of the wall of the Park, he saw some human figures lying. Those venal and furtive loves filled him with despair. He gnawed the rectitude of his life; he felt that he had been outcast from life\u2019s feast. One human being had seemed to love him and he had denied her life and happiness: he had sentenced her to ignominy, a death of shame. He knew that the prostrate creatures down by the wall were watching him and wished him gone. No one wanted him; he was outcast from life\u2019s feast. He turned his eyes to the grey gleaming river, winding along towards Dublin. Beyond the river he saw a goods train winding out of Kingsbridge Station, like a worm with a fiery head winding through the darkness, obstinately and laboriously. It passed slowly out of sight; but still he heard in his ears the laborious drone of the engine reiterating the syllables of her name.", " James Lennon, driver of the engine, stated that he had been in the employment of the railway company for fifteen years. On hearing the guard\u2019s whistle he set the train in motion and a second or two afterwards brought it to rest in response to loud cries. The train was going slowly. P. Dunne, railway porter, stated that as the train was about to start he observed a woman attempting to cross the lines. He ran towards her and shouted, but, before he could reach her, she was caught by the buffer of the engine and fell to the ground. _A juror_. \u201cYou saw the lady fall?\u201d _Witness_. \u201cYes.\u201d Police Sergeant Croly deposed that when he arrived he found the deceased lying on the platform apparently dead. He had the body taken to the waiting-room pending the arrival of the ambulance. Constable 57E corroborated. Dr Halpin, assistant house surgeon of the City of Dublin Hospital, stated that the deceased had two lower ribs fractured and had sustained severe contusions of the right shoulder. The right side of the head had been injured in the fall. The injuries were not sufficient to have caused death in a normal person. Death, in his opinion, had been probably due to shock and sudden failure of the heart\u2019s action. Mr H. B. Patterson Finlay, on behalf of the railway company, expressed his deep regret at the accident.

Home!", " However, when she drew near the limit and her friends began to loosen their tongues about her, she silenced them by marrying Mr Kearney, who was a bootmaker on Ormond Quay. He was much older than she. His conversation, which was serious, took place at intervals in his great brown beard. After the first year of married life, Mrs Kearney perceived that such a man would wear better than a romantic person, but she never put her own romantic ideas away. He was sober, thrifty and pious; he went to the altar every first Friday, sometimes with her, oftener by himself. But she never weakened in her religion and was a good wife to him. At some party in a strange house when she lifted her eyebrow ever so slightly he stood up to take his leave and, when his cough troubled him, she put the eider-down quilt over his feet and made a strong rum punch. For his part, he was a model father. By paying a small sum every week into a society, he ensured for both his daughters a dowry of one hundred pounds each when they came to the age of twenty-four. He sent the elder daughter, Kathleen, to a good convent, where she learned French and music, and afterward paid her fees at the Academy. Every year in the month of July Mrs Kearney found occasion to say to some friend: \u201cMy good man is packing us off to Skerries for a few weeks.\u201d If it was not Skerries it was Howth or Greystones. When the Irish Revival began to be appreciable Mrs Kearney determined to take advantage of her daughter\u2019s name and brought an Irish teacher to the house.", " He told her the names of the ships he had been on and the names of the different services. He had sailed through the Straits of Magellan and he told her stories of the terrible Patagonians. He had fallen on his feet in Buenos Ayres, he said, and had come over to the old country just for a holiday. Of course, her father had found out the affair and had forbidden her to have anything to say to him. \u201cI know these sailor chaps,\u201d he said. One day he had quarrelled with Frank and after that she had to meet her lover secretly. The evening deepened in the avenue. The white of two letters in her lap grew indistinct. One was to Harry; the other was to her father. Ernest had been her favourite but she liked Harry too. Her father was becoming old lately, she noticed; he would miss her. Sometimes he could be very nice. Not long before, when she had been laid up for a day, he had read her out a ghost story and made toast for her at the fire. Another day, when their mother was alive, they had all gone for a picnic to the Hill of Howth. She remembered her father putting on her mother\u2019s bonnet to make the children laugh. Her time was running out but she continued to sit by the window, leaning her head against the window curtain, inhaling the odour of dusty cretonne. Down far in the avenue she could hear a street organ playing. She knew the air. Strange that it should come that very night to remind her of the promise to her mother, her promise to keep the home together as long as she could."], "According to Eliza\u2019s recollection in \u201cThe Sisters\u201d, which action marked the beginning of Father Flynn\u2019s odd behavior?": [" Eliza took out her handkerchief and wiped her eyes with it. Then she put it back again in her pocket and gazed into the empty grate for some time without speaking. \u201cHe was too scrupulous always,\u201d she said. \u201cThe duties of the priesthood was too much for him. And then his life was, you might say, crossed.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said my aunt. \u201cHe was a disappointed man. You could see that.\u201d A silence took possession of the little room and, under cover of it, I approached the table and tasted my sherry and then returned quietly to my chair in the corner. Eliza seemed to have fallen into a deep revery. We waited respectfully for her to break the silence: and after a long pause she said slowly: \u201cIt was that chalice he broke.... That was the beginning of it. Of course, they say it was all right, that it contained nothing, I mean. But still.... They say it was the boy\u2019s fault. But poor James was so nervous, God be merciful to him!\u201d \u201cAnd was that it?\u201d said my aunt. \u201cI heard something....\u201d Eliza nodded. \u201cThat affected his mind,\u201d she said. \u201cAfter that he began to mope by himself, talking to no one and wandering about by himself. So one night he was wanted for to go on a call and they couldn\u2019t find him anywhere. They looked high up and low down; and still they couldn\u2019t see a sight of him anywhere. So then the clerk suggested to try the chapel. So then they got the keys and opened the chapel and the clerk and Father O\u2019Rourke and another priest that was there brought in a light for to look for him.... And what do you think but there he was, sitting up by himself in the dark in his confession-box, wide-awake and laughing-like softly to himself?\u201d She stopped suddenly as if to listen.", " \u201cThat\u2019s what the woman we had in to wash him said. She said he just looked as if he was asleep, he looked that peaceful and resigned. No one would think he\u2019d make such a beautiful corpse.\u201d \u201cYes, indeed,\u201d said my aunt. She sipped a little more from her glass and said: \u201cWell, Miss Flynn, at any rate it must be a great comfort for you to know that you did all you could for him. You were both very kind to him, I must say.\u201d Eliza smoothed her dress over her knees. \u201cAh, poor James!\u201d she said. \u201cGod knows we done all we could, as poor as we are\u2014we wouldn\u2019t see him want anything while he was in it.\u201d Nannie had leaned her head against the sofa-pillow and seemed about to fall asleep. \u201cThere\u2019s poor Nannie,\u201d said Eliza, looking at her, \u201cshe\u2019s wore out. All the work we had, she and me, getting in the woman to wash him and then laying him out and then the coffin and then arranging about the Mass in the chapel. Only for Father O\u2019Rourke I don\u2019t know what we\u2019d have done at all. It was him brought us all them flowers and them two candlesticks out of the chapel and wrote out the notice for the _Freeman\u2019s General_ and took charge of all the papers for the cemetery and poor James\u2019s insurance.\u201d \u201cWasn\u2019t that good of him?\u201d said my aunt. Eliza closed her eyes and shook her head slowly. \u201cAh, there\u2019s no friends like the old friends,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen all is said and done, no friends that a body can trust.\u201d \u201cIndeed, that\u2019s true,\u201d said my aunt.", " His face was very truculent, grey and massive, with black cavernous nostrils and circled by a scanty white fur. There was a heavy odour in the room\u2014the flowers. We blessed ourselves and came away. In the little room downstairs we found Eliza seated in his arm-chair in state. I groped my way towards my usual chair in the corner while Nannie went to the sideboard and brought out a decanter of sherry and some wine-glasses. She set these on the table and invited us to take a little glass of wine. Then, at her sister\u2019s bidding, she filled out the sherry into the glasses and passed them to us. She pressed me to take some cream crackers also but I declined because I thought I would make too much noise eating them. She seemed to be somewhat disappointed at my refusal and went over quietly to the sofa where she sat down behind her sister. No one spoke: we all gazed at the empty fireplace. My aunt waited until Eliza sighed and then said: \u201cAh, well, he\u2019s gone to a better world.\u201d Eliza sighed again and bowed her head in assent. My aunt fingered the stem of her wine-glass before sipping a little. \u201cDid he ... peacefully?\u201d she asked. \u201cOh, quite peacefully, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Eliza. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t tell when the breath went out of him. He had a beautiful death, God be praised.\u201d \u201cAnd everything...?\u201d \u201cFather O\u2019Rourke was in with him a Tuesday and anointed him and prepared him and all.\u201d \u201cHe knew then?\u201d \u201cHe was quite resigned.\u201d \u201cHe looks quite resigned,\u201d said my aunt.", " EVELINE She sat at the window watching the evening invade the avenue.

Her head was leaned against the window curtains and in her nostrils was the odour of dusty cretonne. She was tired. Few people passed. The man out of the last house passed on his way home; she heard his footsteps clacking along the concrete pavement and afterwards crunching on the cinder path before the new red houses. One time there used to be a field there in which they used to play every evening with other people\u2019s children. Then a man from Belfast bought the field and built houses in it\u2014not like their little brown houses but bright brick houses with shining roofs. The children of the avenue used to play together in that field\u2014the Devines, the Waters, the Dunns, little Keogh the cripple, she and her brothers and sisters. Ernest, however, never played: he was too grown up. Her father used often to hunt them in out of the field with his blackthorn stick; but usually little Keogh used to keep _nix_ and call out when he saw her father coming. Still they seemed to have been rather happy then. Her father was not so bad then; and besides, her mother was alive. That was a long time ago; she and her brothers and sisters were all grown up; her mother was dead. Tizzie Dunn was dead, too, and the Waters had gone back to England. Everything changes. Now she was going to go away like the others, to leave her home. Home!", " \u201cYes, but why?\u201d asked Mr Browne. Aunt Kate repeated that it was the rule, that was all. Mr Browne still seemed not to understand. Freddy Malins explained to him, as best he could, that the monks were trying to make up for the sins committed by all the sinners in the outside world. The explanation was not very clear for Mr Browne grinned and said: \u201cI like that idea very much but wouldn\u2019t a comfortable spring bed do them as well as a coffin?\u201d \u201cThe coffin,\u201d said Mary Jane, \u201cis to remind them of their last end.\u201d As the subject had grown lugubrious it was buried in a silence of the table during which Mrs Malins could be heard saying to her neighbour in an indistinct undertone: \u201cThey are very good men, the monks, very pious men.\u201d The raisins and almonds and figs and apples and oranges and chocolates and sweets were now passed about the table and Aunt Julia invited all the guests to have either port or sherry. At first Mr Bartell D\u2019Arcy refused to take either but one of his neighbours nudged him and whispered something to him upon which he allowed his glass to be filled. Gradually as the last glasses were being filled the conversation ceased. A pause followed, broken only by the noise of the wine and by unsettlings of chairs. The Misses Morkan, all three, looked down at the tablecloth. Someone coughed once or twice and then a few gentlemen patted the table gently as a signal for silence.", " It was after sunset; but the window-panes of the houses that looked to the west reflected the tawny gold of a great bank of clouds. Nannie received us in the hall; and, as it would have been unseemly to have shouted at her, my aunt shook hands with her for all. The old woman pointed upwards interrogatively and, on my aunt\u2019s nodding, proceeded to toil up the narrow staircase before us, her bowed head being scarcely above the level of the banister-rail. At the first landing she stopped and beckoned us forward encouragingly towards the open door of the dead-room. My aunt went in and the old woman, seeing that I hesitated to enter, began to beckon to me again repeatedly with her hand. I went in on tiptoe. The room through the lace end of the blind was suffused with dusky golden light amid which the candles looked like pale thin flames. He had been coffined. Nannie gave the lead and we three knelt down at the foot of the bed. I pretended to pray but I could not gather my thoughts because the old woman\u2019s mutterings distracted me. I noticed how clumsily her skirt was hooked at the back and how the heels of her cloth boots were trodden down all to one side. The fancy came to me that the old priest was smiling as he lay there in his coffin. But no. When we rose and went up to the head of the bed I saw that he was not smiling. There he lay, solemn and copious, vested as for the altar, his large hands loosely retaining a chalice."], "In \u201cAn Encounter,\u201d what do the boys surreptitiously bring to school to share with each other?": [" I could understand it if you were ...

When a boy was rough and unruly there was nothing would do him any good but a good sound whipping. A slap on the hand or a box on the ear was no good: what he wanted was to get a nice warm whipping.

At last she spoke to me. When she addressed the first words to me I was so confused that I did not know what to answer. She asked me was I going to _Araby_. I forgot whether I answered yes or no. It would be a splendid bazaar, she said; she would love to go. \u201cAnd why can\u2019t you?\u201d I asked. While she spoke she turned a silver bracelet round and round her wrist. She could not go, she said, because there would be a retreat that week in her convent. Her brother and two other boys were fighting for their caps and I was alone at the railings. She held one of the spikes, bowing her head towards me. The light from the lamp opposite our door caught the white curve of her neck, lit up her hair that rested there and, falling, lit up the hand upon the railing. It fell over one side of her dress and caught the white border of a petticoat, just visible as she stood at ease. \u201cIt\u2019s well for you,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I go,\u201d I said, \u201cI will bring you something.\u201d What innumerable follies laid waste my waking and sleeping thoughts after that evening! I wished to annihilate the tedious intervening days. I chafed against the work of school. At night in my bedroom and by day in the classroom her image came between me and the page I strove to read. The syllables of the word _Araby_ were called to me through the silence in which my soul luxuriated and cast an Eastern enchantment over me. I asked for leave to go to the bazaar on Saturday night.", " And if a boy had a girl for a sweetheart and told lies about it then he would give him such a whipping as no boy ever got in this world. He said that there was nothing in this world he would like so well as that. He described to me how he would whip such a boy as if he were unfolding some elaborate mystery. He would love that, he said, better than anything in this world; and his voice, as he led me monotonously through the mystery, grew almost affectionate and seemed to plead with me that I should understand him. I waited till his monologue paused again. Then I stood up abruptly. Lest I should betray my agitation I delayed a few moments pretending to fix my shoe properly and then, saying that I was obliged to go, I bade him good-day. I went up the slope calmly but my heart was beating quickly with fear that he would seize me by the ankles. When I reached the top of the slope I turned round and, without looking at him, called loudly across the field: \u201cMurphy!\u201d My voice had an accent of forced bravery in it and I was ashamed of my paltry stratagem. I had to call the name again before Mahony saw me and hallooed in answer. How my heart beat as he came running across the field to me! He ran as if to bring me aid.

So then, of course, when they saw that, that made them think that there was something gone wrong with him....\u201d AN ENCOUNTER It was Joe Dillon who introduced the Wild West to us. He had a little library made up of old numbers of _The Union Jack_, _Pluck_ and _The Halfpenny Marvel_. Every evening after school we met in his back garden and arranged Indian battles. He and his fat young brother Leo, the idler, held the loft of the stable while we tried to carry it by storm; or we fought a pitched battle on the grass. But, however well we fought, we never won siege or battle and all our bouts ended with Joe Dillon\u2019s war dance of victory. His parents went to eight-o\u2019clock mass every morning in Gardiner Street and the peaceful odour of Mrs Dillon was prevalent in the hall of the house. But he played too fiercely for us who were younger and more timid. He looked like some kind of an Indian when he capered round the garden, an old tea-cosy on his head, beating a tin with his fist and yelling: \u201cYa! yaka, yaka, yaka!\u201d Everyone was incredulous when it was reported that he had a vocation for the priesthood. Nevertheless it was true. A spirit of unruliness diffused itself among us and, under its influence, differences of culture and constitution were waived.", " The only sailor whose eyes could have been called green was a tall man who amused the crowd on the quay by calling out cheerfully every time the planks fell: \u201cAll right! All right!\u201d When we were tired of this sight we wandered slowly into Ringsend. The day had grown sultry, and in the windows of the grocers\u2019 shops musty biscuits lay bleaching. We bought some biscuits and chocolate which we ate sedulously as we wandered through the squalid streets where the families of the fishermen live. We could find no dairy and so we went into a huckster\u2019s shop and bought a bottle of raspberry lemonade each. Refreshed by this, Mahony chased a cat down a lane, but the cat escaped into a wide field. We both felt rather tired and when we reached the field we made at once for a sloping bank over the ridge of which we could see the Dodder. It was too late and we were too tired to carry out our project of visiting the Pigeon House. We had to be home before four o\u2019clock lest our adventure should be discovered. Mahony looked regretfully at his catapult and I had to suggest going home by train before he regained any cheerfulness. The sun went in behind some clouds and left us to our jaded thoughts and the crumbs of our provisions. There was nobody but ourselves in the field. When we had lain on the bank for some time without speaking I saw a man approaching from the far end of the field. I watched him lazily as I chewed one of those green stems on which girls tell fortunes."], "When the narrator of \u201cAn Encounter\u201d walks through North Dublin, he and Mahony are insulted by boys who think they\u2019re ___.": [" Now,\u201d he added, pointing to Mahony who was regarding us with open eyes, \u201che is different; he goes in for games.\u201d He said he had all Sir Walter Scott\u2019s works and all Lord Lytton\u2019s works at home and never tired of reading them. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said, \u201cthere were some of Lord Lytton\u2019s works which boys couldn\u2019t read.\u201d Mahony asked why couldn\u2019t boys read them\u2014a question which agitated and pained me because I was afraid the man would think I was as stupid as Mahony. The man, however, only smiled. I saw that he had great gaps in his mouth between his yellow teeth. Then he asked us which of us had the most sweethearts. Mahony mentioned lightly that he had three totties. The man asked me how many had I. I answered that I had none. He did not believe me and said he was sure I must have one. I was silent. \u201cTell us,\u201d said Mahony pertly to the man, \u201chow many have you yourself?\u201d The man smiled as before and said that when he was our age he had lots of sweethearts. \u201cEvery boy,\u201d he said, \u201chas a little sweetheart.\u201d His attitude on this point struck me as strangely liberal in a man of his age. In my heart I thought that what he said about boys and sweethearts was reasonable. But I disliked the words in his mouth and I wondered why he shivered once or twice as if he feared something or felt a sudden chill. As he proceeded I noticed that his accent was good. He began to speak to us about girls, saying what nice soft hair they had and how soft their hands were and how all girls were not so good as they seemed to be if one only knew.", " Mahony used slang freely, and spoke of Father Butler as Old Bunser. We waited on for a quarter of an hour more but still there was no sign of Leo Dillon. Mahony, at last, jumped down and said: \u201cCome along.

Mahony began to play the Indian as soon as we were out of public sight. He chased a crowd of ragged girls, brandishing his unloaded catapult and, when two ragged boys began, out of chivalry, to fling stones at us, he proposed that we should charge them. I objected that the boys were too small and so we walked on, the ragged troop screaming after us: _\u201cSwaddlers! Swaddlers!\u201d_ thinking that we were Protestants because Mahony, who was dark-complexioned, wore the silver badge of a cricket club in his cap. When we came to the Smoothing Iron we arranged a siege; but it was a failure because you must have at least three. We revenged ourselves on Leo Dillon by saying what a funk he was and guessing how many he would get at three o\u2019clock from Mr Ryan. We came then near the river. We spent a long time walking about the noisy streets flanked by high stone walls, watching the working of cranes and engines and often being shouted at for our immobility by the drivers of groaning carts.", " Hardly had he sat down when Mahony, catching sight of the cat which had escaped him, sprang up and pursued her across the field.

Two years ago, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Little Chandler blushed and smiled. \u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cI was married last May twelve months.\u201d \u201cI hope it\u2019s not too late in the day to offer my best wishes,\u201d said Ignatius Gallaher. \u201cI didn\u2019t know your address or I\u2019d have done so at the time.\u201d He extended his hand, which Little Chandler took. \u201cWell, Tommy,\u201d he said, \u201cI wish you and yours every joy in life, old chap, and tons of money, and may you never die till I shoot you. And that\u2019s the wish of a sincere friend, an old friend. You know that?\u201d \u201cI know that,\u201d said Little Chandler. \u201cAny youngsters?\u201d said Ignatius Gallaher. Little Chandler blushed again. \u201cWe have one child,\u201d he said. \u201cSon or daughter?\u201d \u201cA little boy.\u201d Ignatius Gallaher slapped his friend sonorously on the back. \u201cBravo,\u201d he said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t doubt you, Tommy.\u201d Little Chandler smiled, looked confusedly at his glass and bit his lower lip with three childishly white front teeth."], "What fake name does the narrator of \u201cAn Encounter\u201d use to call his friend at the end of the story?": [" \u201cIt\u2019s six of one and half-a-dozen of the other.

The two friends lit their cigars and puffed at them in silence until their drinks were served. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you my opinion,\u201d said Ignatius Gallaher, emerging after some time from the clouds of smoke in which he had taken refuge, \u201cit\u2019s a rum world. Talk of immorality! I\u2019ve heard of cases\u2014what am I saying?\u2014I\u2019ve known them: cases of ... immorality....\u201d Ignatius Gallaher puffed thoughtfully at his cigar and then, in a calm historian\u2019s tone, he proceeded to sketch for his friend some pictures of the corruption which was rife abroad. He summarised the vices of many capitals and seemed inclined to award the palm to Berlin. Some things he could not vouch for (his friends had told him), but of others he had had personal experience. He spared neither rank nor caste. He revealed many of the secrets of religious houses on the Continent and described some of the practices which were fashionable in high society and ended by telling, with details, a story about an English duchess\u2014a story which he knew to be true.", " The latter, a young man of about forty, was of Gabriel\u2019s size and build, with very round shoulders. His face was fleshy and pallid, touched with colour only at the thick hanging lobes of his ears and at the wide wings of his nose. He had coarse features, a blunt nose, a convex and receding brow, tumid and protruded lips. His heavy-lidded eyes and the disorder of his scanty hair made him look sleepy. He was laughing heartily in a high key at a story which he had been telling Gabriel on the stairs and at the same time rubbing the knuckles of his left fist backwards and forwards into his left eye. \u201cGood-evening, Freddy,\u201d said Aunt Julia. Freddy Malins bade the Misses Morkan good-evening in what seemed an offhand fashion by reason of the habitual catch in his voice and then, seeing that Mr Browne was grinning at him from the sideboard, crossed the room on rather shaky legs and began to repeat in an undertone the story he had just told to Gabriel. \u201cHe\u2019s not so bad, is he?\u201d said Aunt Kate to Gabriel. Gabriel\u2019s brows were dark but he raised them quickly and answered: \u201cO, no, hardly noticeable.\u201d \u201cNow, isn\u2019t he a terrible fellow!\u201d she said. \u201cAnd his poor mother made him take the pledge on New Year\u2019s Eve. But come on, Gabriel, into the drawing-room.\u201d Before leaving the room with Gabriel she signalled to Mr Browne by frowning and shaking her forefinger in warning to and fro. Mr Browne nodded in answer and, when she had gone, said to Freddy Malins: \u201cNow, then, Teddy, I\u2019m going to fill you out a good glass of lemonade just to buck you up.\u201d Freddy Malins, who was nearing the climax of his story, waved the offer aside impatiently but Mr Browne, having first called Freddy Malins\u2019 attention to a disarray in his dress, filled out and handed him a full glass of lemonade.", " He always stared straight before him as if he were on parade and, when he wished to gaze after someone in the street, it was necessary for him to move his body from the hips. At present he was about town. Whenever any job was vacant a friend was always ready to give him the hard word. He was often to be seen walking with policemen in plain clothes, talking earnestly. He knew the inner side of all affairs and was fond of delivering final judgments. He spoke without listening to the speech of his companions. His conversation was mainly about himself: what he had said to such a person and what such a person had said to him and what he had said to settle the matter. When he reported these dialogues he aspirated the first letter of his name after the manner of Florentines. Lenehan offered his friend a cigarette. As the two young men walked on through the crowd Corley occasionally turned to smile at some of the passing girls but Lenehan\u2019s gaze was fixed on the large faint moon circled with a double halo. He watched earnestly the passing of the grey web of twilight across its face. At length he said: \u201cWell ... tell me, Corley, I suppose you\u2019ll be able to pull it off all right, eh?\u201d Corley closed one eye expressively as an answer. \u201cIs she game for that?\u201d asked Lenehan dubiously. \u201cYou can never know women.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s all right,\u201d said Corley. \u201cI know the way to get around her, man. She\u2019s a bit gone on me.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re what I call a gay Lothario,\u201d said Lenehan.", " \u201cI remember now there was a policeman. Decent young fellow, he seemed. How did it happen at all?\u201d \u201cIt happened that you were peloothered, Tom,\u201d said Mr Cunningham gravely. \u201cTrue bill,\u201d said Mr Kernan, equally gravely. \u201cI suppose you squared the constable, Jack,\u201d said Mr M\u2019Coy. Mr Power did not relish the use of his Christian name. He was not straight-laced, but he could not forget that Mr M\u2019Coy had recently made a crusade in search of valises and portmanteaus to enable Mrs M\u2019Coy to fulfil imaginary engagements in the country. More than he resented the fact that he had been victimised he resented such low playing of the game. He answered the question, therefore, as if Mr Kernan had asked it. The narrative made Mr Kernan indignant. He was keenly conscious of his citizenship, wished to live with his city on terms mutually honourable and resented any affront put upon him by those whom he called country bumpkins. \u201cIs this what we pay rates for?\u201d he asked. \u201cTo feed and clothe these ignorant bostooms ... and they\u2019re nothing else.\u201d Mr Cunningham laughed. He was a Castle official only during office hours. \u201cHow could they be anything else, Tom?\u201d he said. He assumed a thick provincial accent and said in a tone of command: \u201c65, catch your cabbage!\u201d Everyone laughed. Mr M\u2019Coy, who wanted to enter the conversation by any door, pretended that he had never heard the story. Mr Cunningham said: \u201cIt is supposed\u2014they say, you know\u2014to take place in the depot where they get these thundering big country fellows, omadhauns, you know, to drill."], "Who died in the house where the narrator of \u201cAraby\u201d now lives?": [" An uninhabited house of two storeys stood at the blind end, detached from its neighbours in a square ground. The other houses of the street, conscious of decent lives within them, gazed at one another with brown imperturbable faces. The former tenant of our house, a priest, had died in the back drawing-room. Air, musty from having been long enclosed, hung in all the rooms, and the waste room behind the kitchen was littered with old useless papers. Among these I found a few paper-covered books, the pages of which were curled and damp: _The Abbot_, by Walter Scott, _The Devout Communicant_ and _The Memoirs of Vidocq_. I liked the last best because its leaves were yellow. The wild garden behind the house contained a central apple-tree and a few straggling bushes under one of which I found the late tenant\u2019s rusty bicycle-pump. He had been a very charitable priest; in his will he had left all his money to institutions and the furniture of his house to his sister. When the short days of winter came dusk fell before we had well eaten our dinners. When we met in the street the houses had grown sombre. The space of sky above us was the colour of ever-changing violet and towards it the lamps of the street lifted their feeble lanterns. The cold air stung us and we played till our bodies glowed. Our shouts echoed in the silent street. The career of our play brought us through the dark muddy lanes behind the houses where we ran the gauntlet of the rough tribes from the cottages, to the back doors of the dark dripping gardens where odours arose from the ashpits, to the dark odorous stables where a coachman smoothed and combed the horse or shook music from the buckled harness.", " *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DUBLINERS *** Produced by David Reed, Karol Pietrzak, and David Widger cover DUBLINERS by James Joyce Contents The Sisters An Encounter Araby Eveline After the Race Two Gallants The Boarding House A Little Cloud Counterparts Clay A Painful Case Ivy Day in the Committee Room A Mother Grace The Dead THE SISTERS There was no hope for him this time: it was the third stroke.

After that they lived apart. She went to the priest and got a separation from him with care of the children. She would give him neither money nor food nor house-room; and so he was obliged to enlist himself as a sheriff\u2019s man. He was a shabby stooped little drunkard with a white face and a white moustache and white eyebrows, pencilled above his little eyes, which were pink-veined and raw; and all day long he sat in the bailiff\u2019s room, waiting to be put on a job. Mrs Mooney, who had taken what remained of her money out of the butcher business and set up a boarding house in Hardwicke Street, was a big imposing woman. Her house had a floating population made up of tourists from Liverpool and the Isle of Man and, occasionally, _artistes_ from the music-halls. Its resident population was made up of clerks from the city. She governed her house cunningly and firmly, knew when to give credit, when to be stern and when to let things pass. All the resident young men spoke of her as _The Madam_. Mrs Mooney\u2019s young men paid fifteen shillings a week for board and lodgings (beer or stout at dinner excluded). They shared in common tastes and occupations and for this reason they were very chummy with one another. They discussed with one another the chances of favourites and outsiders.

She said she would do without any tea but when it came near the time at which the shop at the corner closed she decided to go out herself for a quarter of a pound of tea and two pounds of sugar. She put the sleeping child deftly in his arms and said: \u201cHere. Don\u2019t waken him.\u201d A little lamp with a white china shade stood upon the table and its light fell over a photograph which was enclosed in a frame of crumpled horn. It was Annie\u2019s photograph. Little Chandler looked at it, pausing at the thin tight lips. She wore the pale blue summer blouse which he had brought her home as a present one Saturday. It had cost him ten and elevenpence; but what an agony of nervousness it had cost him! How he had suffered that day, waiting at the shop door until the shop was empty, standing at the counter and trying to appear at his ease while the girl piled ladies\u2019 blouses before him, paying at the desk and forgetting to take up the odd penny of his change, being called back by the cashier, and finally, striving to hide his blushes as he left the shop by examining the parcel to see if it was securely tied."], "What does the narrator of \u201cAraby\u201d buy for Mangan\u2019s sister at the end of the story?": [" They were always falling out now but when they were boys together they used to be the best of friends: but such was life. She got out of her tram at the Pillar and ferreted her way quickly among the crowds. She went into Downes\u2019s cake-shop but the shop was so full of people that it was a long time before she could get herself attended to. She bought a dozen of mixed penny cakes, and at last came out of the shop laden with a big bag. Then she thought what else would she buy: she wanted to buy something really nice. They would be sure to have plenty of apples and nuts. It was hard to know what to buy and all she could think of was cake. She decided to buy some plumcake but Downes\u2019s plumcake had not enough almond icing on top of it so she went over to a shop in Henry Street. Here she was a long time in suiting herself and the stylish young lady behind the counter, who was evidently a little annoyed by her, asked her was it wedding-cake she wanted to buy. That made Maria blush and smile at the young lady; but the young lady took it all very seriously and finally cut a thick slice of plumcake, parcelled it up and said: \u201cTwo-and-four, please.\u201d She thought she would have to stand in the Drumcondra tram because none of the young men seemed to notice her but an elderly gentleman made room for her. He was a stout gentleman and he wore a brown hard hat; he had a square red face and a greyish moustache.", " When we returned to the street light from the kitchen windows had filled the areas. If my uncle was seen turning the corner we hid in the shadow until we had seen him safely housed. Or if Mangan\u2019s sister came out on the doorstep to call her brother in to his tea we watched her from our shadow peer up and down the street. We waited to see whether she would remain or go in and, if she remained, we left our shadow and walked up to Mangan\u2019s steps resignedly. She was waiting for us, her figure defined by the light from the half-opened door. Her brother always teased her before he obeyed and I stood by the railings looking at her. Her dress swung as she moved her body and the soft rope of her hair tossed from side to side. Every morning I lay on the floor in the front parlour watching her door. The blind was pulled down to within an inch of the sash so that I could not be seen. When she came out on the doorstep my heart leaped. I ran to the hall, seized my books and followed her. I kept her brown figure always in my eye and, when we came near the point at which our ways diverged, I quickened my pace and passed her. This happened morning after morning. I had never spoken to her, except for a few casual words, and yet her name was like a summons to all my foolish blood. Her image accompanied me even in places the most hostile to romance. On Saturday evenings when my aunt went marketing I had to go to carry some of the parcels.", " The latter, a young man of about forty, was of Gabriel\u2019s size and build, with very round shoulders. His face was fleshy and pallid, touched with colour only at the thick hanging lobes of his ears and at the wide wings of his nose. He had coarse features, a blunt nose, a convex and receding brow, tumid and protruded lips. His heavy-lidded eyes and the disorder of his scanty hair made him look sleepy. He was laughing heartily in a high key at a story which he had been telling Gabriel on the stairs and at the same time rubbing the knuckles of his left fist backwards and forwards into his left eye. \u201cGood-evening, Freddy,\u201d said Aunt Julia. Freddy Malins bade the Misses Morkan good-evening in what seemed an offhand fashion by reason of the habitual catch in his voice and then, seeing that Mr Browne was grinning at him from the sideboard, crossed the room on rather shaky legs and began to repeat in an undertone the story he had just told to Gabriel. \u201cHe\u2019s not so bad, is he?\u201d said Aunt Kate to Gabriel. Gabriel\u2019s brows were dark but he raised them quickly and answered: \u201cO, no, hardly noticeable.\u201d \u201cNow, isn\u2019t he a terrible fellow!\u201d she said. \u201cAnd his poor mother made him take the pledge on New Year\u2019s Eve. But come on, Gabriel, into the drawing-room.\u201d Before leaving the room with Gabriel she signalled to Mr Browne by frowning and shaking her forefinger in warning to and fro. Mr Browne nodded in answer and, when she had gone, said to Freddy Malins: \u201cNow, then, Teddy, I\u2019m going to fill you out a good glass of lemonade just to buck you up.\u201d Freddy Malins, who was nearing the climax of his story, waved the offer aside impatiently but Mr Browne, having first called Freddy Malins\u2019 attention to a disarray in his dress, filled out and handed him a full glass of lemonade.", " \u201cIt\u2019s six of one and half-a-dozen of the other. You ask Hogan, my boy. I showed him a bit about London when he was over there. He\u2019d open your eye....

He summarised the vices of many capitals and seemed inclined to award the palm to Berlin. Some things he could not vouch for (his friends had told him), but of others he had had personal experience. He spared neither rank nor caste. He revealed many of the secrets of religious houses on the Continent and described some of the practices which were fashionable in high society and ended by telling, with details, a story about an English duchess\u2014a story which he knew to be true."], "What is the profession of Eveline\u2019s lover?": [" He had caught that haggard look upon her face for a moment when she was singing _Arrayed for the Bridal_. Soon, perhaps, he would be sitting in that same drawing-room, dressed in black, his silk hat on his knees. The blinds would be drawn down and Aunt Kate would be sitting beside him, crying and blowing her nose and telling him how Julia had died. He would cast about in his mind for some words that might console her, and would find only lame and useless ones. Yes, yes: that would happen very soon. The air of the room chilled his shoulders. He stretched himself cautiously along under the sheets and lay down beside his wife. One by one they were all becoming shades. Better pass boldly into that other world, in the full glory of some passion, than fade and wither dismally with age. He thought of how she who lay beside him had locked in her heart for so many years that image of her lover\u2019s eyes when he had told her that he did not wish to live. Generous tears filled Gabriel\u2019s eyes. He had never felt like that himself towards any woman but he knew that such a feeling must be love. The tears gathered more thickly in his eyes and in the partial darkness he imagined he saw the form of a young man standing under a dripping tree. Other forms were near. His soul had approached that region where dwell the vast hosts of the dead. He was conscious of, but could not apprehend, their wayward and flickering existence.", " He told her the names of the ships he had been on and the names of the different services. He had sailed through the Straits of Magellan and he told her stories of the terrible Patagonians. He had fallen on his feet in Buenos Ayres, he said, and had come over to the old country just for a holiday. Of course, her father had found out the affair and had forbidden her to have anything to say to him. \u201cI know these sailor chaps,\u201d he said. One day he had quarrelled with Frank and after that she had to meet her lover secretly. The evening deepened in the avenue. The white of two letters in her lap grew indistinct.

Another day, when their mother was alive, they had all gone for a picnic to the Hill of Howth. She remembered her father putting on her mother\u2019s bonnet to make the children laugh. Her time was running out but she continued to sit by the window, leaning her head against the window curtain, inhaling the odour of dusty cretonne.

He stood up to put on his coat and waistcoat, more helpless than ever. When he was dressed he went over to her to comfort her. It would be all right, never fear. He left her crying on the bed and moaning softly: _\u201cO my God!\u201d_ Going down the stairs his glasses became so dimmed with moisture that he had to take them off and polish them. He longed to ascend through the roof and fly away to another country where he would never hear again of his trouble, and yet a force pushed him downstairs step by step. The implacable faces of his employer and of the Madam stared upon his discomfiture. On the last flight of stairs he passed Jack Mooney who was coming up from the pantry nursing two bottles of _Bass_. They saluted coldly; and the lover\u2019s eyes rested for a second or two on a thick bulldog face and a pair of thick short arms. When he reached the foot of the staircase he glanced up and saw Jack regarding him from the door of the return-room. Suddenly he remembered the night when one of the music-hall _artistes_, a little blond Londoner, had made a rather free allusion to Polly. The reunion had been almost broken up on account of Jack\u2019s violence. Everyone tried to quiet him. The music-hall _artiste_, a little paler than usual, kept smiling and saying that there was no harm meant: but Jack kept shouting at him that if any fellow tried that sort of a game on with _his_ sister he\u2019d bloody well put his teeth down his throat, so he would.", " Then she would be married\u2014she, Eveline.

He had often said to me: \u201cI am not long for this world,\u201d and I had thought his words idle. Now I knew they were true.

Then a man from Belfast bought the field and built houses in it\u2014not like their little brown houses but bright brick houses with shining roofs. The children of the avenue used to play together in that field\u2014the Devines, the Waters, the Dunns, little Keogh the cripple, she and her brothers and sisters. Ernest, however, never played: he was too grown up. Her father used often to hunt them in out of the field with his blackthorn stick; but usually little Keogh used to keep _nix_ and call out when he saw her father coming. Still they seemed to have been rather happy then. Her father was not so bad then; and besides, her mother was alive. That was a long time ago; she and her brothers and sisters were all grown up; her mother was dead. Tizzie Dunn was dead, too, and the Waters had gone back to England. Everything changes. Now she was going to go away like the others, to leave her home. Home!", " Mrs Kearney brought her daughter over to them, and talked to them amiably. She wanted to be on good terms with them but, while she strove to be polite, her eyes followed Mr Holohan in his limping and devious courses. As soon as she could she excused herself and went out after him. \u201cMr Holohan, I want to speak to you for a moment,\u201d she said. They went down to a discreet part of the corridor. Mrs Kearney asked him when was her daughter going to be paid. Mr Holohan said that Mr Fitzpatrick had charge of that. Mrs Kearney said that she didn\u2019t know anything about Mr Fitzpatrick. Her daughter had signed a contract for eight guineas and she would have to be paid. Mr Holohan said that it wasn\u2019t his business. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t it your business?\u201d asked Mrs Kearney. \u201cDidn\u2019t you yourself bring her the contract? Anyway, if it\u2019s not your business it\u2019s my business and I mean to see to it.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d better speak to Mr Fitzpatrick,\u201d said Mr Holohan distantly. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about Mr Fitzpatrick,\u201d repeated Mrs Kearney. \u201cI have my contract, and I intend to see that it is carried out.\u201d When she came back to the dressing-room her cheeks were slightly suffused. The room was lively. Two men in outdoor dress had taken possession of the fireplace and were chatting familiarly with Miss Healy and the baritone. They were the _Freeman_ man and Mr O\u2019Madden Burke. The _Freeman_ man had come in to say that he could not wait for the concert as he had to report the lecture which an American priest was giving in the Mansion House.", " The boat blew a long mournful whistle into the mist. If she went, tomorrow she would be on the sea with Frank, steaming towards Buenos Ayres. Their passage had been booked. Could she still draw back after all he had done for her? Her distress awoke a nausea in her body and she kept moving her lips in silent fervent prayer. A bell clanged upon her heart. She felt him seize her hand: \u201cCome!\u201d All the seas of the world tumbled about her heart. He was drawing her into them: he would drown her. She gripped with both hands at the iron railing. \u201cCome!\u201d No! No! No! It was impossible. Her hands clutched the iron in frenzy. Amid the seas she sent a cry of anguish! \u201cEveline! Evvy!\u201d He rushed beyond the barrier and called to her to follow. He was shouted at to go on but he still called to her. She set her white face to him, passive, like a helpless animal. Her eyes gave him no sign of love or farewell or recognition. AFTER THE RACE The cars came scudding in towards Dublin, running evenly like pellets in the groove of the Naas Road. At the crest of the hill at Inchicore sightseers had gathered in clumps to watch the cars careering homeward and through this channel of poverty and inaction the Continent sped its wealth and industry. Now and again the clumps of people raised the cheer of the gratefully oppressed. Their sympathy, however, was for the blue cars\u2014the cars of their friends, the French.", " He had caught that haggard look upon her face for a moment when she was singing _Arrayed for the Bridal_. Soon, perhaps, he would be sitting in that same drawing-room, dressed in black, his silk hat on his knees. The blinds would be drawn down and Aunt Kate would be sitting beside him, crying and blowing her nose and telling him how Julia had died. He would cast about in his mind for some words that might console her, and would find only lame and useless ones. Yes, yes: that would happen very soon. The air of the room chilled his shoulders. He stretched himself cautiously along under the sheets and lay down beside his wife. One by one they were all becoming shades. Better pass boldly into that other world, in the full glory of some passion, than fade and wither dismally with age. He thought of how she who lay beside him had locked in her heart for so many years that image of her lover\u2019s eyes when he had told her that he did not wish to live. Generous tears filled Gabriel\u2019s eyes. He had never felt like that himself towards any woman but he knew that such a feeling must be love. The tears gathered more thickly in his eyes and in the partial darkness he imagined he saw the form of a young man standing under a dripping tree. Other forms were near. His soul had approached that region where dwell the vast hosts of the dead. He was conscious of, but could not apprehend, their wayward and flickering existence."], "In \u201cAfter the Race,\u201d where did Jimmy originally meet his friend S\u00e9gouin?": [" It was a serious thing for him.

He had also been fortunate enough to secure some of the police contracts and in the end he had become rich enough to be alluded to in the Dublin newspapers as a merchant prince. He had sent his son to England to be educated in a big Catholic college and had afterwards sent him to Dublin University to study law.

The lamps were still burning redly in the murky air and, across the river, the palace of the Four Courts stood out menacingly against the heavy sky. She was walking on before him with Mr Bartell D\u2019Arcy, her shoes in a brown parcel tucked under one arm and her hands holding her skirt up from the slush. She had no longer any grace of attitude but Gabriel\u2019s eyes were still bright with happiness. The blood went bounding along his veins; and the thoughts went rioting through his brain, proud, joyful, tender, valorous. She was walking on before him so lightly and so erect that he longed to run after her noiselessly, catch her by the shoulders and say something foolish and affectionate into her ear. She seemed to him so frail that he longed to defend her against something and then to be alone with her. Moments of their secret life together burst like stars upon his memory.", " When it had ceased all the auditors drank from their bottles in silence. Pok! The cork flew out of Mr Hynes\u2019 bottle, but Mr Hynes remained sitting flushed and bareheaded on the table. He did not seem to have heard the invitation. \u201cGood man, Joe!\u201d said Mr O\u2019Connor, taking out his cigarette papers and pouch the better to hide his emotion. \u201cWhat do you think of that, Crofton?\u201d cried Mr Henchy. \u201cIsn\u2019t that fine? What?\u201d Mr Crofton said that it was a very fine piece of writing. A MOTHER Mr Holohan, assistant secretary of the _Eire Abu_ Society, had been walking up and down Dublin for nearly a month, with his hands and pockets full of dirty pieces of paper, arranging about the series of concerts. He had a game leg and for this his friends called him Hoppy Holohan. He walked up and down constantly, stood by the hour at street corners arguing the point and made notes; but in the end it was Mrs Kearney who arranged everything. Miss Devlin had become Mrs Kearney out of spite. She had been educated in a high-class convent, where she had learned French and music. As she was naturally pale and unbending in manner she made few friends at school. When she came to the age of marriage she was sent out to many houses where her playing and ivory manners were much admired. She sat amid the chilly circle of her accomplishments, waiting for some suitor to brave it and offer her a brilliant life. But the young men whom she met were ordinary and she gave them no encouragement, trying to console her romantic desires by eating a great deal of Turkish Delight in secret.", " \u201cAnd the proper kind of a Lothario, too!\u201d A shade of mockery relieved the servility of his manner.

His bulk, his easy pace, and the solid sound of his boots had something of the conqueror in them. He approached the young woman and, without saluting, began at once to converse with her. She swung her umbrella more quickly and executed half turns on her heels. Once or twice when he spoke to her at close quarters she laughed and bent her head. Lenehan observed them for a few minutes. Then he walked rapidly along beside the chains at some distance and crossed the road obliquely. As he approached Hume Street corner he found the air heavily scented and his eyes made a swift anxious scrutiny of the young woman\u2019s appearance. She had her Sunday finery on. Her blue serge skirt was held at the waist by a belt of black leather. The great silver buckle of her belt seemed to depress the centre of her body, catching the light stuff of her white blouse like a clip. She wore a short black jacket with mother-of-pearl buttons and a ragged black boa. The ends of her tulle collarette had been carefully disordered and a big bunch of red flowers was pinned in her bosom, stems upwards."], "In \u201cTwo Gallants,\u201d Corley wistfully recalls a former lover who is now ___.": [" \u201cThere was others at her before me,\u201d said Corley philosophically.

The crowd of girls and young men had thinned and on his way up the street he heard many groups and couples bidding one another good-night. He went as far as the clock of the College of Surgeons: it was on the stroke of ten. He set off briskly along the northern side of the Green hurrying for fear Corley should return too soon. When he reached the corner of Merrion Street he took his stand in the shadow of a lamp and brought out one of the cigarettes which he had reserved and lit it. He leaned against the lamp-post and kept his gaze fixed on the part from which he expected to see Corley and the young woman return. His mind became active again. He wondered had Corley managed it successfully. He wondered if he had asked her yet or if he would leave it to the last. He suffered all the pangs and thrills of his friend\u2019s situation as well as those of his own. But the memory of Corley\u2019s slowly revolving head calmed him somewhat: he was sure Corley would pull it off all right. All at once the idea struck him that perhaps Corley had seen her home by another way and given him the slip. His eyes searched the street: there was no sign of them. Yet it was surely half-an-hour since he had seen the clock of the College of Surgeons. Would Corley do a thing like that? He lit his last cigarette and began to smoke it nervously.", " Anxiety and his swift run made him pant. He called out: \u201cHallo, Corley!\u201d Corley turned his head to see who had called him, and then continued walking as before. Lenehan ran after him, settling the waterproof on his shoulders with one hand. \u201cHallo, Corley!\u201d he cried again. He came level with his friend and looked keenly in his face. He could see nothing there. \u201cWell?\u201d he said. \u201cDid it come off?\u201d They had reached the corner of Ely Place. Still without answering, Corley swerved to the left and went up the side street. His features were composed in stern calm. Lenehan kept up with his friend, breathing uneasily. He was baffled and a note of menace pierced through his voice. \u201cCan\u2019t you tell us?\u201d he said. \u201cDid you try her?\u201d Corley halted at the first lamp and stared grimly before him. Then with a grave gesture he extended a hand towards the light and, smiling, opened it slowly to the gaze of his disciple. A small gold coin shone in the palm. THE BOARDING HOUSE Mrs Mooney was a butcher\u2019s daughter. She was a woman who was quite able to keep things to herself: a determined woman. She had married her father\u2019s foreman and opened a butcher\u2019s shop near Spring Gardens. But as soon as his father-in-law was dead Mr Mooney began to go to the devil. He drank, plundered the till, ran headlong into debt. It was no use making him take the pledge: he was sure to break out again a few days after. By fighting his wife in the presence of customers and by buying bad meat he ruined his business.", " He strained his eyes as each tram stopped at the far corner of the square. They must have gone home by another way. The paper of his cigarette broke and he flung it into the road with a curse. Suddenly he saw them coming towards him. He started with delight and, keeping close to his lamp-post, tried to read the result in their walk. They were walking quickly, the young woman taking quick short steps, while Corley kept beside her with his long stride. They did not seem to be speaking. An intimation of the result pricked him like the point of a sharp instrument. He knew Corley would fail; he knew it was no go. They turned down Baggot Street and he followed them at once, taking the other footpath. When they stopped he stopped too. They talked for a few moments and then the young woman went down the steps into the area of a house. Corley remained standing at the edge of the path, a little distance from the front steps. Some minutes passed. Then the hall-door was opened slowly and cautiously. A woman came running down the front steps and coughed. Corley turned and went towards her. His broad figure hid hers from view for a few seconds and then she reappeared running up the steps. The door closed on her and Corley began to walk swiftly towards Stephen\u2019s Green. Lenehan hurried on in the same direction. Some drops of light rain fell. He took them as a warning and, glancing back towards the house which the young woman had entered to see that he was not observed, he ran eagerly across the road."], "What is Corley\u2019s lady friend wearing when Lenehan first encounters her?": [" \u201cThere was others at her before me,\u201d said Corley philosophically.

Then he added: \u201cShe\u2019s on the turf now. I saw her driving down Earl Street one night with two fellows with her on a car.\u201d \u201cI suppose that\u2019s your doing,\u201d said Lenehan.", " Not far from the porch of the club a harpist stood in the roadway, playing to a little ring of listeners. He plucked at the wires heedlessly, glancing quickly from time to time at the face of each new-comer and from time to time, wearily also, at the sky. His harp, too, heedless that her coverings had fallen about her knees, seemed weary alike of the eyes of strangers and of her master\u2019s hands. One hand played in the bass the melody of _Silent, O Moyle_, while the other hand careered in the treble after each group of notes. The notes of the air sounded deep and full. The two young men walked up the street without speaking, the mournful music following them. When they reached Stephen\u2019s Green they crossed the road. Here the noise of trams, the lights and the crowd released them from their silence. \u201cThere she is!\u201d said Corley. At the corner of Hume Street a young woman was standing. She wore a blue dress and a white sailor hat. She stood on the curbstone, swinging a sunshade in one hand. Lenehan grew lively. \u201cLet\u2019s have a look at her, Corley,\u201d he said. Corley glanced sideways at his friend and an unpleasant grin appeared on his face. \u201cAre you trying to get inside me?\u201d he asked. \u201cDamn it!\u201d said Lenehan boldly, \u201cI don\u2019t want an introduction. All I want is to have a look at her. I\u2019m not going to eat her.\u201d \u201cO.... A look at her?\u201d said Corley, more amiably. \u201cWell ... I\u2019ll tell you what."], "What object does Corley show Lenehan at the end of the story?": [" \u201cThere was others at her before me,\u201d said Corley philosophically. This time Lenehan was inclined to disbelieve. He shook his head to and fro and smiled. \u201cYou know you can\u2019t kid me, Corley,\u201d he said. \u201cHonest to God!\u201d said Corley. \u201cDidn\u2019t she tell me herself?\u201d Lenehan made a tragic gesture. \u201cBase betrayer!\u201d he said. As they passed along the railings of Trinity College, Lenehan skipped out into the road and peered up at the clock. \u201cTwenty after,\u201d he said. \u201cTime enough,\u201d said Corley. \u201cShe\u2019ll be there all right. I always let her wait a bit.\u201d Lenehan laughed quietly. \u201cEcod! Corley, you know how to take them,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m up to all their little tricks,\u201d Corley confessed. \u201cBut tell me,\u201d said Lenehan again, \u201care you sure you can bring it off all right? You know it\u2019s a ticklish job. They\u2019re damn close on that point. Eh?... What?\u201d His bright, small eyes searched his companion\u2019s face for reassurance. Corley swung his head to and fro as if to toss aside an insistent insect, and his brows gathered. \u201cI\u2019ll pull it off,\u201d he said. \u201cLeave it to me, can\u2019t you?\u201d Lenehan said no more. He did not wish to ruffle his friend\u2019s temper, to be sent to the devil and told that his advice was not wanted. A little tact was necessary. But Corley\u2019s brow was soon smooth again. His thoughts were running another way. \u201cShe\u2019s a fine decent tart,\u201d he said, with appreciation; \u201cthat\u2019s what she is.\u201d They walked along Nassau Street and then turned into Kildare Street.", " He always stared straight before him as if he were on parade and, when he wished to gaze after someone in the street, it was necessary for him to move his body from the hips. At present he was about town. Whenever any job was vacant a friend was always ready to give him the hard word. He was often to be seen walking with policemen in plain clothes, talking earnestly. He knew the inner side of all affairs and was fond of delivering final judgments. He spoke without listening to the speech of his companions. His conversation was mainly about himself: what he had said to such a person and what such a person had said to him and what he had said to settle the matter. When he reported these dialogues he aspirated the first letter of his name after the manner of Florentines. Lenehan offered his friend a cigarette. As the two young men walked on through the crowd Corley occasionally turned to smile at some of the passing girls but Lenehan\u2019s gaze was fixed on the large faint moon circled with a double halo. He watched earnestly the passing of the grey web of twilight across its face.

Lenehan ran after him, settling the waterproof on his shoulders with one hand. \u201cHallo, Corley!\u201d he cried again. He came level with his friend and looked keenly in his face. He could see nothing there. \u201cWell?\u201d he said. \u201cDid it come off?\u201d They had reached the corner of Ely Place. Still without answering, Corley swerved to the left and went up the side street. His features were composed in stern calm. Lenehan kept up with his friend, breathing uneasily.

She watched the pair and kept her own counsel. Polly knew that she was being watched, but still her mother\u2019s persistent silence could not be misunderstood. There had been no open complicity between mother and daughter, no open understanding but, though people in the house began to talk of the affair, still Mrs Mooney did not intervene. Polly began to grow a little strange in her manner and the young man was evidently perturbed. At last, when she judged it to be the right moment, Mrs Mooney intervened. She dealt with moral problems as a cleaver deals with meat: and in this case she had made up her mind. It was a bright Sunday morning of early summer, promising heat, but with a fresh breeze blowing. All the windows of the boarding house were open and the lace curtains ballooned gently towards the street beneath the raised sashes. The belfry of George\u2019s Church sent out constant peals and worshippers, singly or in groups, traversed the little circus before the church, revealing their purpose by their self-contained demeanour no less than by the little volumes in their gloved hands. Breakfast was over in the boarding house and the table of the breakfast-room was covered with plates on which lay yellow streaks of eggs with morsels of bacon-fat and bacon-rind.", " One night he went for his wife with the cleaver and she had to sleep in a neighbour\u2019s house. After that they lived apart. She went to the priest and got a separation from him with care of the children. She would give him neither money nor food nor house-room; and so he was obliged to enlist himself as a sheriff\u2019s man. He was a shabby stooped little drunkard with a white face and a white moustache and white eyebrows, pencilled above his little eyes, which were pink-veined and raw; and all day long he sat in the bailiff\u2019s room, waiting to be put on a job. Mrs Mooney, who had taken what remained of her money out of the butcher business and set up a boarding house in Hardwicke Street, was a big imposing woman. Her house had a floating population made up of tourists from Liverpool and the Isle of Man and, occasionally, _artistes_ from the music-halls. Its resident population was made up of clerks from the city. She governed her house cunningly and firmly, knew when to give credit, when to be stern and when to let things pass. All the resident young men spoke of her as _The Madam_. Mrs Mooney\u2019s young men paid fifteen shillings a week for board and lodgings (beer or stout at dinner excluded). They shared in common tastes and occupations and for this reason they were very chummy with one another. They discussed with one another the chances of favourites and outsiders. Jack Mooney, the Madam\u2019s son, who was clerk to a commission agent in Fleet Street, had the reputation of being a hard case.", " He was fond of using soldiers\u2019 obscenities: usually he came home in the small hours. When he met his friends he had always a good one to tell them and he was always sure to be on to a good thing\u2014that is to say, a likely horse or a likely _artiste_. He was also handy with the mits and sang comic songs. On Sunday nights there would often be a reunion in Mrs Mooney\u2019s front drawing-room. The music-hall _artistes_ would oblige; and Sheridan played waltzes and polkas and vamped accompaniments. Polly Mooney, the Madam\u2019s daughter, would also sing.

Her eyes, which were grey with a shade of green through them, had a habit of glancing upwards when she spoke with anyone, which made her look like a little perverse madonna. Mrs Mooney had first sent her daughter to be a typist in a corn-factor\u2019s office but, as a disreputable sheriff\u2019s man used to come every other day to the office, asking to be allowed to say a word to his daughter, she had taken her daughter home again and set her to do housework. As Polly was very lively the intention was to give her the run of the young men. Besides, young men like to feel that there is a young woman not very far away. Polly, of course, flirted with the young men but Mrs Mooney, who was a shrewd judge, knew that the young men were only passing the time away: none of them meant business.", " Anxiety and his swift run made him pant.

She stood up and surveyed herself in the pier-glass. The decisive expression of her great florid face satisfied her and she thought of some mothers she knew who could not get their daughters off their hands. Mr Doran was very anxious indeed this Sunday morning. He had made two attempts to shave but his hand had been so unsteady that he had been obliged to desist. Three days\u2019 reddish beard fringed his jaws and every two or three minutes a mist gathered on his glasses so that he had to take them off and polish them with his pocket-handkerchief. The recollection of his confession of the night before was a cause of acute pain to him; the priest had drawn out every ridiculous detail of the affair and in the end had so magnified his sin that he was almost thankful at being afforded a loophole of reparation. The harm was done. What could he do now but marry her or run away? He could not brazen it out. The affair would be sure to be talked of and his employer would be certain to hear of it. Dublin is such a small city: everyone knows everyone else\u2019s business. He felt his heart leap warmly in his throat as he heard in his excited imagination old Mr Leonard calling out in his rasping voice: \u201cSend Mr Doran here, please.\u201d All his long years of service gone for nothing! All his industry and diligence thrown away! As a young man he had sown his wild oats, of course; he had boasted of his free-thinking and denied the existence of God to his companions in public-houses.", " It never fell away.\u201d \u201cIs that so?\u201d asked Mr M\u2019Coy. \u201cThat\u2019s a fact,\u201d said Mr Cunningham. \u201cThat\u2019s history.\u201d \u201cLook at their church, too,\u201d said Mr Power. \u201cLook at the congregation they have.\u201d \u201cThe Jesuits cater for the upper classes,\u201d said Mr M\u2019Coy. \u201cOf course,\u201d said Mr Power. \u201cYes,\u201d said Mr Kernan. \u201cThat\u2019s why I have a feeling for them.

Mr Kernan seemed to be weighing something in his mind. He was impressed. He had a high opinion of Mr Cunningham as a judge of character and as a reader of faces. He asked for particulars. \u201cO, it\u2019s just a retreat, you know,\u201d said Mr Cunningham. \u201cFather Purdon is giving it. It\u2019s for business men, you know.\u201d \u201cHe won\u2019t be too hard on us, Tom,\u201d said Mr Power persuasively. \u201cFather Purdon?

None of your modern trumpery....\u201d \u201cQuite right,\u201d said Mr Power. \u201cNo superfluities,\u201d said Mr Fogarty.

Things were as she had suspected: she had been frank in her questions and Polly had been frank in her answers. Both had been somewhat awkward, of course. She had been made awkward by her not wishing to receive the news in too cavalier a fashion or to seem to have connived and Polly had been made awkward not merely because allusions of that kind always made her awkward but also because she did not wish it to be thought that in her wise innocence she had divined the intention behind her mother\u2019s tolerance. Mrs Mooney glanced instinctively at the little gilt clock on the mantelpiece as soon as she had become aware through her revery that the bells of George\u2019s Church had stopped ringing. It was seventeen minutes past eleven: she would have lots of time to have the matter out with Mr Doran and then catch short twelve at Marlborough Street. She was sure she would win. To begin with she had all the weight of social opinion on her side: she was an outraged mother. She had allowed him to live beneath her roof, assuming that he was a man of honour, and he had simply abused her hospitality.", " Polly sat for a little time on the side of the bed, crying. Then she dried her eyes and went over to the looking-glass. She dipped the end of the towel in the water-jug and refreshed her eyes with the cool water. She looked at herself in profile and readjusted a hairpin above her ear. Then she went back to the bed again and sat at the foot. She regarded the pillows for a long time and the sight of them awakened in her mind secret amiable memories. She rested the nape of her neck against the cool iron bed-rail and fell into a revery. There was no longer any perturbation visible on her face. She waited on patiently, almost cheerfully, without alarm, her memories gradually giving place to hopes and visions of the future. Her hopes and visions were so intricate that she no longer saw the white pillows on which her gaze was fixed or remembered that she was waiting for anything. At last she heard her mother calling. She started to her feet and ran to the banisters. \u201cPolly! Polly!\u201d \u201cYes, mamma?\u201d \u201cCome down, dear. Mr Doran wants to speak to you.\u201d Then she remembered what she had been waiting for. A LITTLE CLOUD Eight years before he had seen his friend off at the North Wall and wished him godspeed. Gallaher had got on. You could tell that at once by his travelled air, his well-cut tweed suit, and fearless accent.

He was also handy with the mits and sang comic songs. On Sunday nights there would often be a reunion in Mrs Mooney\u2019s front drawing-room. The music-hall _artistes_ would oblige; and Sheridan played waltzes and polkas and vamped accompaniments. Polly Mooney, the Madam\u2019s daughter, would also sing. She sang: _I\u2019m a ... naughty girl. You needn\u2019t sham: You know I am._ Polly was a slim girl of nineteen; she had light soft hair and a small full mouth.

And, after all, it\u2019s the old country, as they say, isn\u2019t it? You can\u2019t help having a certain feeling for it. That\u2019s human nature.... But tell me something about yourself. Hogan told me you had ... tasted the joys of connubial bliss.

The adventure of meeting Gallaher after eight years, of finding himself with Gallaher in Corless\u2019s surrounded by lights and noise, of listening to Gallaher\u2019s stories and of sharing for a brief space Gallaher\u2019s vagrant and triumphant life, upset the equipoise of his sensitive nature. He felt acutely the contrast between his own life and his friend\u2019s and it seemed to him unjust. Gallaher was his inferior in birth and education. He was sure that he could do something better than his friend had ever done, or could ever do, something higher than mere tawdry journalism if he only got the chance. What was it that stood in his way? His unfortunate timidity! He wished to vindicate himself in some way, to assert his manhood. He saw behind Gallaher\u2019s refusal of his invitation. Gallaher was only patronising him by his friendliness just as he was patronising Ireland by his visit. The barman brought their drinks. Little Chandler pushed one glass towards his friend and took up the other boldly. \u201cWho knows?\u201d he said, as they lifted their glasses. \u201cWhen you come next year I may have the pleasure of wishing long life and happiness to Mr and Mrs Ignatius Gallaher.\u201d Ignatius Gallaher in the act of drinking closed one eye expressively over the rim of his glass. When he had drunk he smacked his lips decisively, set down his glass and said: \u201cNo blooming fear of that, my boy.", " He was beginning to feel somewhat disillusioned. Gallaher\u2019s accent and way of expressing himself did not please him. There was something vulgar in his friend which he had not observed before. But perhaps it was only the result of living in London amid the bustle and competition of the Press. The old personal charm was still there under this new gaudy manner. And, after all, Gallaher had lived, he had seen the world. Little Chandler looked at his friend enviously. \u201cEverything in Paris is gay,\u201d said Ignatius Gallaher. \u201cThey believe in enjoying life\u2014and don\u2019t you think they\u2019re right? If you want to enjoy yourself properly you must go to Paris. And, mind you, they\u2019ve a great feeling for the Irish there. When they heard I was from Ireland they were ready to eat me, man.\u201d Little Chandler took four or five sips from his glass. \u201cTell me,\u201d he said, \u201cis it true that Paris is so ... immoral as they say?\u201d Ignatius Gallaher made a catholic gesture with his right arm. \u201cEvery place is immoral,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course you do find spicy bits in Paris. Go to one of the students\u2019 balls, for instance. That\u2019s lively, if you like, when the _cocottes_ begin to let themselves loose. You know what they are, I suppose?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve heard of them,\u201d said Little Chandler. Ignatius Gallaher drank off his whisky and shook his head. \u201cAh,\u201d he said, \u201cyou may say what you like. There\u2019s no woman like the Parisienne\u2014for style, for go.\u201d \u201cThen it is an immoral city,\u201d said Little Chandler, with timid insistence\u2014\u201cI mean, compared with London or Dublin?\u201d \u201cLondon!\u201d said Ignatius Gallaher.", " Boose, I suppose?\u201d \u201cOther things, too,\u201d said Little Chandler shortly.

The blush which had risen to his face a few moments before was establishing itself. A trifle made him blush at any time: and now he felt warm and excited."], "What is Farrington\u2019s occupation in \u201cCounterparts\u201d?": [" Farrington stood a drink in his turn. After a while O\u2019Halloran and Paddy Leonard came in and the story was repeated to them. O\u2019Halloran stood tailors of malt, hot, all round and told the story of the retort he had made to the chief clerk when he was in Callan\u2019s of Fownes\u2019s Street; but, as the retort was after the manner of the liberal shepherds in the eclogues, he had to admit that it was not as clever as Farrington\u2019s retort. At this Farrington told the boys to polish off that and have another. Just as they were naming their poisons who should come in but Higgins! Of course he had to join in with the others. The men asked him to give his version of it, and he did so with great vivacity for the sight of five small hot whiskies was very exhilarating. Everyone roared laughing when he showed the way in which Mr Alleyne shook his fist in Farrington\u2019s face. Then he imitated Farrington, saying, _\u201cAnd here was my nabs, as cool as you please,\u201d_ while Farrington looked at the company out of his heavy dirty eyes, smiling and at times drawing forth stray drops of liquor from his moustache with the aid of his lower lip. When that round was over there was a pause. O\u2019Halloran had money but neither of the other two seemed to have any; so the whole party left the shop somewhat regretfully. At the corner of Duke Street Higgins and Nosey Flynn bevelled off to the left while the other three turned back towards the city.", " Rain was drizzling down on the cold streets and, when they reached the Ballast Office, Farrington suggested the Scotch House. The bar was full of men and loud with the noise of tongues and glasses. The three men pushed past the whining match-sellers at the door and formed a little party at the corner of the counter. They began to exchange stories. Leonard introduced them to a young fellow named Weathers who was performing at the Tivoli as an acrobat and knockabout _artiste_. Farrington stood a drink all round. Weathers said he would take a small Irish and Apollinaris. Farrington, who had definite notions of what was what, asked the boys would they have an Apollinaris too; but the boys told Tim to make theirs hot. The talk became theatrical. O\u2019Halloran stood a round and then Farrington stood another round, Weathers protesting that the hospitality was too Irish. He promised to get them in behind the scenes and introduce them to some nice girls. O\u2019Halloran said that he and Leonard would go, but that Farrington wouldn\u2019t go because he was a married man; and Farrington\u2019s heavy dirty eyes leered at the company in token that he understood he was being chaffed. Weathers made them all have just one little tincture at his expense and promised to meet them later on at Mulligan\u2019s in Poolbeg Street. When the Scotch House closed they went round to Mulligan\u2019s. They went into the parlour at the back and O\u2019Halloran ordered small hot specials all round.", " He was so angry that he lost count of the conversation of his friends. When Paddy Leonard called him he found that they were talking about feats of strength. Weathers was showing his biceps muscle to the company and boasting so much that the other two had called on Farrington to uphold the national honour. Farrington pulled up his sleeve accordingly and showed his biceps muscle to the company. The two arms were examined and compared and finally it was agreed to have a trial of strength. The table was cleared and the two men rested their elbows on it, clasping hands. When Paddy Leonard said _\u201cGo!\u201d_ each was to try to bring down the other\u2019s hand on to the table. Farrington looked very serious and determined. The trial began. After about thirty seconds Weathers brought his opponent\u2019s hand slowly down on to the table. Farrington\u2019s dark wine-coloured face flushed darker still with anger and humiliation at having been defeated by such a stripling. \u201cYou\u2019re not to put the weight of your body behind it. Play fair,\u201d he said. \u201cWho\u2019s not playing fair?\u201d said the other. \u201cCome on again. The two best out of three.\u201d The trial began again. The veins stood out on Farrington\u2019s forehead, and the pallor of Weathers\u2019 complexion changed to peony. Their hands and arms trembled under the stress. After a long struggle Weathers again brought his opponent\u2019s hand slowly on to the table. There was a murmur of applause from the spectators.", " They were all beginning to feel mellow. Farrington was just standing another round when Weathers came back. Much to Farrington\u2019s relief he drank a glass of bitter this time. Funds were getting low but they had enough to keep them going. Presently two young women with big hats and a young man in a check suit came in and sat at a table close by. Weathers saluted them and told the company that they were out of the Tivoli. Farrington\u2019s eyes wandered at every moment in the direction of one of the young women. There was something striking in her appearance. An immense scarf of peacock-blue muslin was wound round her hat and knotted in a great bow under her chin; and she wore bright yellow gloves, reaching to the elbow. Farrington gazed admiringly at the plump arm which she moved very often and with much grace; and when, after a little time, she answered his gaze he admired still more her large dark brown eyes. The oblique staring expression in them fascinated him. She glanced at him once or twice and, when the party was leaving the room, she brushed against his chair and said _\u201cO, pardon!\u201d_ in a London accent. He watched her leave the room in the hope that she would look back at him, but he was disappointed. He cursed his want of money and cursed all the rounds he had stood, particularly all the whiskies and Apollinaris which he had stood to Weathers. If there was one thing that he hated it was a sponge."], "Who is Miss Delacour?": [" The dark damp night was coming and he longed to spend it in the bars, drinking with his friends amid the glare of gas and the clatter of glasses. He got out the Delacour correspondence and passed out of the office. He hoped Mr Alleyne would not discover that the last two letters were missing. The moist pungent perfume lay all the way up to Mr Alleyne\u2019s room. Miss Delacour was a middle-aged woman of Jewish appearance. Mr Alleyne was said to be sweet on her or on her money. She came to the office often and stayed a long time when she came. She was sitting beside his desk now in an aroma of perfumes, smoothing the handle of her umbrella and nodding the great black feather in her hat. Mr Alleyne had swivelled his chair round to face her and thrown his right foot jauntily upon his left knee. The man put the correspondence on the desk and bowed respectfully but neither Mr Alleyne nor Miss Delacour took any notice of his bow. Mr Alleyne tapped a finger on the correspondence and then flicked it towards him as if to say: _\u201cThat\u2019s all right: you can go.\u201d_ The man returned to the lower office and sat down again at his desk. He stared intently at the incomplete phrase: _In no case shall the said Bernard Bodley be_ ... and thought how strange it was that the last three words began with the same letter. The chief clerk began to hurry Miss Parker, saying she would never have the letters typed in time for post.", " He was now safe in the dark snug of O\u2019Neill\u2019s shop, and filling up the little window that looked into the bar with his inflamed face, the colour of dark wine or dark meat, he called out: \u201cHere, Pat, give us a g.p., like a good fellow.\u201d The curate brought him a glass of plain porter. The man drank it at a gulp and asked for a caraway seed. He put his penny on the counter and, leaving the curate to grope for it in the gloom, retreated out of the snug as furtively as he had entered it. Darkness, accompanied by a thick fog, was gaining upon the dusk of February and the lamps in Eustace Street had been lit. The man went up by the houses until he reached the door of the office, wondering whether he could finish his copy in time. On the stairs a moist pungent odour of perfumes saluted his nose: evidently Miss Delacour had come while he was out in O\u2019Neill\u2019s. He crammed his cap back again into his pocket and re-entered the office, assuming an air of absent-mindedness. \u201cMr Alleyne has been calling for you,\u201d said the chief clerk severely. \u201cWhere were you?\u201d The man glanced at the two clients who were standing at the counter as if to intimate that their presence prevented him from answering. As the clients were both male the chief clerk allowed himself a laugh. \u201cI know that game,\u201d he said. \u201cFive times in one day is a little bit.... Well, you better look sharp and get a copy of our correspondence in the Delacour case for Mr Alleyne.\u201d This address in the presence of the public, his run upstairs and the porter he had gulped down so hastily confused the man and, as he sat down at his desk to get what was required, he realised how hopeless was the task of finishing his copy of the contract before half past five.", " \u201cNow, I ask you,\u201d she said almost testily, \u201cwhere is Julia going? Julia! Julia! Where are you going?\u201d Julia, who had gone half way down one flight, came back and announced blandly: \u201cHere\u2019s Freddy.\u201d At the same moment a clapping of hands and a final flourish of the pianist told that the waltz had ended. The drawing-room door was opened from within and some couples came out. Aunt Kate drew Gabriel aside hurriedly and whispered into his ear: \u201cSlip down, Gabriel, like a good fellow and see if he\u2019s all right, and don\u2019t let him up if he\u2019s screwed. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s screwed. I\u2019m sure he is.\u201d Gabriel went to the stairs and listened over the banisters. He could hear two persons talking in the pantry. Then he recognised Freddy Malins\u2019 laugh. He went down the stairs noisily. \u201cIt\u2019s such a relief,\u201d said Aunt Kate to Mrs Conroy, \u201cthat Gabriel is here. I always feel easier in my mind when he\u2019s here.... Julia, there\u2019s Miss Daly and Miss Power will take some refreshment. Thanks for your beautiful waltz, Miss Daly. It made lovely time.\u201d A tall wizen-faced man, with a stiff grizzled moustache and swarthy skin, who was passing out with his partner said: \u201cAnd may we have some refreshment, too, Miss Morkan?\u201d \u201cJulia,\u201d said Aunt Kate summarily, \u201cand here\u2019s Mr Browne and Miss Furlong. Take them in, Julia, with Miss Daly and Miss Power.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m the man for the ladies,\u201d said Mr Browne, pursing his lips until his moustache bristled and smiling in all his wrinkles.", " Miss Furlong, who was one of Mary Jane\u2019s pupils, asked Miss Daly what was the name of the pretty waltz she had played; and Mr Browne, seeing that he was ignored, turned promptly to the two young men who were more appreciative. A red-faced young woman, dressed in pansy, came into the room, excitedly clapping her hands and crying: \u201cQuadrilles! Quadrilles!\u201d Close on her heels came Aunt Kate, crying: \u201cTwo gentlemen and three ladies, Mary Jane!\u201d \u201cO, here\u2019s Mr Bergin and Mr Kerrigan,\u201d said Mary Jane. \u201cMr Kerrigan, will you take Miss Power? Miss Furlong, may I get you a partner, Mr Bergin. O, that\u2019ll just do now.\u201d \u201cThree ladies, Mary Jane,\u201d said Aunt Kate. The two young gentlemen asked the ladies if they might have the pleasure, and Mary Jane turned to Miss Daly. \u201cO, Miss Daly, you\u2019re really awfully good, after playing for the last two dances, but really we\u2019re so short of ladies tonight.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t mind in the least, Miss Morkan.\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019ve a nice partner for you, Mr Bartell D\u2019Arcy, the tenor. I\u2019ll get him to sing later on. All Dublin is raving about him.\u201d \u201cLovely voice, lovely voice!\u201d said Aunt Kate. As the piano had twice begun the prelude to the first figure Mary Jane led her recruits quickly from the room. They had hardly gone when Aunt Julia wandered slowly into the room, looking behind her at something. \u201cWhat is the matter, Julia?\u201d asked Aunt Kate anxiously. \u201cWho is it?\u201d Julia, who was carrying in a column of table-napkins, turned to her sister and said, simply, as if the question had surprised her: \u201cIt\u2019s only Freddy, Kate, and Gabriel with him.\u201d In fact right behind her Gabriel could be seen piloting Freddy Malins across the landing."], "What is the name of the acrobat Farrington meets at a pub?": [" Rain was drizzling down on the cold streets and, when they reached the Ballast Office, Farrington suggested the Scotch House. The bar was full of men and loud with the noise of tongues and glasses. The three men pushed past the whining match-sellers at the door and formed a little party at the corner of the counter. They began to exchange stories. Leonard introduced them to a young fellow named Weathers who was performing at the Tivoli as an acrobat and knockabout _artiste_. Farrington stood a drink all round. Weathers said he would take a small Irish and Apollinaris. Farrington, who had definite notions of what was what, asked the boys would they have an Apollinaris too; but the boys told Tim to make theirs hot. The talk became theatrical. O\u2019Halloran stood a round and then Farrington stood another round, Weathers protesting that the hospitality was too Irish. He promised to get them in behind the scenes and introduce them to some nice girls. O\u2019Halloran said that he and Leonard would go, but that Farrington wouldn\u2019t go because he was a married man; and Farrington\u2019s heavy dirty eyes leered at the company in token that he understood he was being chaffed. Weathers made them all have just one little tincture at his expense and promised to meet them later on at Mulligan\u2019s in Poolbeg Street. When the Scotch House closed they went round to Mulligan\u2019s. They went into the parlour at the back and O\u2019Halloran ordered small hot specials all round.", " Farrington stood a drink in his turn. After a while O\u2019Halloran and Paddy Leonard came in and the story was repeated to them. O\u2019Halloran stood tailors of malt, hot, all round and told the story of the retort he had made to the chief clerk when he was in Callan\u2019s of Fownes\u2019s Street; but, as the retort was after the manner of the liberal shepherds in the eclogues, he had to admit that it was not as clever as Farrington\u2019s retort. At this Farrington told the boys to polish off that and have another. Just as they were naming their poisons who should come in but Higgins! Of course he had to join in with the others. The men asked him to give his version of it, and he did so with great vivacity for the sight of five small hot whiskies was very exhilarating.

Then he imitated Farrington, saying, _\u201cAnd here was my nabs, as cool as you please,\u201d_ while Farrington looked at the company out of his heavy dirty eyes, smiling and at times drawing forth stray drops of liquor from his moustache with the aid of his lower lip.

She moved her hand about here and there in the air and descended on one of the saucers. She felt a soft wet substance with her fingers and was surprised that nobody spoke or took off her bandage. There was a pause for a few seconds; and then a great deal of scuffling and whispering. Somebody said something about the garden, and at last Mrs Donnelly said something very cross to one of the next-door girls and told her to throw it out at once: that was no play. Maria understood that it was wrong that time and so she had to do it over again: and this time she got the prayer-book. After that Mrs Donnelly played Miss McCloud\u2019s Reel for the children and Joe made Maria take a glass of wine. Soon they were all quite merry again and Mrs Donnelly said Maria would enter a convent before the year was out because she had got the prayer-book. Maria had never seen Joe so nice to her as he was that night, so full of pleasant talk and reminiscences. She said they were all very good to her. At last the children grew tired and sleepy and Joe asked Maria would she not sing some little song before she went, one of the old songs. Mrs Donnelly said _\u201cDo, please, Maria!\u201d_ and so Maria had to get up and stand beside the piano. Mrs Donnelly bade the children be quiet and listen to Maria\u2019s song.", " Then Joe asked would she take a bottle of stout and Mrs Donnelly said there was port wine too in the house if she would prefer that. Maria said she would rather they didn\u2019t ask her to take anything: but Joe insisted. So Maria let him have his way and they sat by the fire talking over old times and Maria thought she would put in a good word for Alphy. But Joe cried that God might strike him stone dead if ever he spoke a word to his brother again and Maria said she was sorry she had mentioned the matter. Mrs Donnelly told her husband it was a great shame for him to speak that way of his own flesh and blood but Joe said that Alphy was no brother of his and there was nearly being a row on the head of it. But Joe said he would not lose his temper on account of the night it was and asked his wife to open some more stout. The two next-door girls had arranged some Hallow Eve games and soon everything was merry again. Maria was delighted to see the children so merry and Joe and his wife in such good spirits. The next-door girls put some saucers on the table and then led the children up to the table, blindfold. One got the prayer-book and the other three got the water; and when one of the next-door girls got the ring Mrs Donnelly shook her finger at the blushing girl as much as to say: _O, I know all about it!_ They insisted then on blindfolding Maria and leading her up to the table to see what she would get; and, while they were putting on the bandage, Maria laughed and laughed again till the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of her chin.", " Maria thought he was a colonel-looking gentleman and she reflected how much more polite he was than the young men who simply stared straight before them. The gentleman began to chat with her about Hallow Eve and the rainy weather. He supposed the bag was full of good things for the little ones and said it was only right that the youngsters should enjoy themselves while they were young. Maria agreed with him and favoured him with demure nods and hems. He was very nice with her, and when she was getting out at the Canal Bridge she thanked him and bowed, and he bowed to her and raised his hat and smiled agreeably, and while she was going up along the terrace, bending her tiny head under the rain, she thought how easy it was to know a gentleman even when he has a drop taken. Everybody said: _\u201cO, here\u2019s Maria!\u201d_ when she came to Joe\u2019s house. Joe was there, having come home from business, and all the children had their Sunday dresses on. There were two big girls in from next door and games were going on. Maria gave the bag of cakes to the eldest boy, Alphy, to divide and Mrs Donnelly said it was too good of her to bring such a big bag of cakes and made all the children say: \u201cThanks, Maria.\u201d But Maria said she had brought something special for papa and mamma, something they would be sure to like, and she began to look for her plumcake. She tried in Downes\u2019s bag and then in the pockets of her waterproof and then on the hallstand but nowhere could she find it.", " \u201cNow, you\u2019ll let the fire out the next time!\u201d said the man striking at him vigorously with the stick. \u201cTake that, you little whelp!\u201d The boy uttered a squeal of pain as the stick cut his thigh. He clasped his hands together in the air and his voice shook with fright. \u201cO, pa!\u201d he cried. \u201cDon\u2019t beat me, pa! And I\u2019ll ... I\u2019ll say a _Hail Mary_ for you.... I\u2019ll say a _Hail Mary_ for you, pa, if you don\u2019t beat me.... I\u2019ll say a _Hail Mary_....\u201d CLAY The matron had given her leave to go out as soon as the women\u2019s tea was over and Maria looked forward to her evening out. The kitchen was spick and span: the cook said you could see yourself in the big copper boilers. The fire was nice and bright and on one of the side-tables were four very big barmbracks. These barmbracks seemed uncut; but if you went closer you would see that they had been cut into long thick even slices and were ready to be handed round at tea. Maria had cut them herself. Maria was a very, very small person indeed but she had a very long nose and a very long chin. She talked a little through her nose, always soothingly: _\u201cYes, my dear,\u201d_ and _\u201cNo, my dear.\u201d_ She was always sent for when the women quarrelled over their tubs and always succeeded in making peace. One day the matron had said to her: \u201cMaria, you are a veritable peace-maker!\u201d And the sub-matron and two of the Board ladies had heard the compliment. And Ginger Mooney was always saying what she wouldn\u2019t do to the dummy who had charge of the irons if it wasn\u2019t for Maria."], "What is barmbrack?": [" Then she had her plants in the conservatory and she liked looking after them. She had lovely ferns and wax-plants and, whenever anyone came to visit her, she always gave the visitor one or two slips from her conservatory. There was one thing she didn\u2019t like and that was the tracts on the walks; but the matron was such a nice person to deal with, so genteel. When the cook told her everything was ready she went into the women\u2019s room and began to pull the big bell. In a few minutes the women began to come in by twos and threes, wiping their steaming hands in their petticoats and pulling down the sleeves of their blouses over their red steaming arms. They settled down before their huge mugs which the cook and the dummy filled up with hot tea, already mixed with milk and sugar in huge tin cans. Maria superintended the distribution of the barmbrack and saw that every woman got her four slices. There was a great deal of laughing and joking during the meal. Lizzie Fleming said Maria was sure to get the ring and, though Fleming had said that for so many Hallow Eves, Maria had to laugh and say she didn\u2019t want any ring or man either; and when she laughed her grey-green eyes sparkled with disappointed shyness and the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of her chin. Then Ginger Mooney lifted up her mug of tea and proposed Maria\u2019s health while all the other women clattered with their mugs on the table, and said she was sorry she hadn\u2019t a sup of porter to drink it in."], "Where does Joe suggest Maria probably lost the plum cake?": [" Then Joe asked would she take a bottle of stout and Mrs Donnelly said there was port wine too in the house if she would prefer that. Maria said she would rather they didn\u2019t ask her to take anything: but Joe insisted. So Maria let him have his way and they sat by the fire talking over old times and Maria thought she would put in a good word for Alphy. But Joe cried that God might strike him stone dead if ever he spoke a word to his brother again and Maria said she was sorry she had mentioned the matter. Mrs Donnelly told her husband it was a great shame for him to speak that way of his own flesh and blood but Joe said that Alphy was no brother of his and there was nearly being a row on the head of it. But Joe said he would not lose his temper on account of the night it was and asked his wife to open some more stout. The two next-door girls had arranged some Hallow Eve games and soon everything was merry again. Maria was delighted to see the children so merry and Joe and his wife in such good spirits. The next-door girls put some saucers on the table and then led the children up to the table, blindfold. One got the prayer-book and the other three got the water; and when one of the next-door girls got the ring Mrs Donnelly shook her finger at the blushing girl as much as to say: _O, I know all about it!_ They insisted then on blindfolding Maria and leading her up to the table to see what she would get; and, while they were putting on the bandage, Maria laughed and laughed again till the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of her chin.", " They led her up to the table amid laughing and joking and she put her hand out in the air as she was told to do. She moved her hand about here and there in the air and descended on one of the saucers. She felt a soft wet substance with her fingers and was surprised that nobody spoke or took off her bandage. There was a pause for a few seconds; and then a great deal of scuffling and whispering. Somebody said something about the garden, and at last Mrs Donnelly said something very cross to one of the next-door girls and told her to throw it out at once: that was no play. Maria understood that it was wrong that time and so she had to do it over again: and this time she got the prayer-book. After that Mrs Donnelly played Miss McCloud\u2019s Reel for the children and Joe made Maria take a glass of wine. Soon they were all quite merry again and Mrs Donnelly said Maria would enter a convent before the year was out because she had got the prayer-book. Maria had never seen Joe so nice to her as he was that night, so full of pleasant talk and reminiscences. She said they were all very good to her. At last the children grew tired and sleepy and Joe asked Maria would she not sing some little song before she went, one of the old songs. Mrs Donnelly said _\u201cDo, please, Maria!\u201d_ and so Maria had to get up and stand beside the piano. Mrs Donnelly bade the children be quiet and listen to Maria\u2019s song.", " Then she asked all the children had any of them eaten it\u2014by mistake, of course\u2014but the children all said no and looked as if they did not like to eat cakes if they were to be accused of stealing. Everybody had a solution for the mystery and Mrs Donnelly said it was plain that Maria had left it behind her in the tram. Maria, remembering how confused the gentleman with the greyish moustache had made her, coloured with shame and vexation and disappointment. At the thought of the failure of her little surprise and of the two and fourpence she had thrown away for nothing she nearly cried outright. But Joe said it didn\u2019t matter and made her sit down by the fire. He was very nice with her. He told her all that went on in his office, repeating for her a smart answer which he had made to the manager. Maria did not understand why Joe laughed so much over the answer he had made but she said that the manager must have been a very overbearing person to deal with. Joe said he wasn\u2019t so bad when you knew how to take him, that he was a decent sort so long as you didn\u2019t rub him the wrong way. Mrs Donnelly played the piano for the children and they danced and sang. Then the two next-door girls handed round the nuts. Nobody could find the nutcrackers and Joe was nearly getting cross over it and asked how did they expect Maria to crack nuts without a nutcracker. But Maria said she didn\u2019t like nuts and that they weren\u2019t to bother about her.", " Maria thought he was a colonel-looking gentleman and she reflected how much more polite he was than the young men who simply stared straight before them. The gentleman began to chat with her about Hallow Eve and the rainy weather. He supposed the bag was full of good things for the little ones and said it was only right that the youngsters should enjoy themselves while they were young. Maria agreed with him and favoured him with demure nods and hems. He was very nice with her, and when she was getting out at the Canal Bridge she thanked him and bowed, and he bowed to her and raised his hat and smiled agreeably, and while she was going up along the terrace, bending her tiny head under the rain, she thought how easy it was to know a gentleman even when he has a drop taken. Everybody said: _\u201cO, here\u2019s Maria!\u201d_ when she came to Joe\u2019s house. Joe was there, having come home from business, and all the children had their Sunday dresses on.

From Ballsbridge to the Pillar, twenty minutes; from the Pillar to Drumcondra, twenty minutes; and twenty minutes to buy the things. She would be there before eight. She took out her purse with the silver clasps and read again the words _A Present from Belfast_. She was very fond of that purse because Joe had brought it to her five years before when he and Alphy had gone to Belfast on a Whit-Monday trip. In the purse were two half-crowns and some coppers. She would have five shillings clear after paying tram fare. What a nice evening they would have, all the children singing! Only she hoped that Joe wouldn\u2019t come in drunk. He was so different when he took any drink. Often he had wanted her to go and live with them; but she would have felt herself in the way (though Joe\u2019s wife was ever so nice with her) and she had become accustomed to the life of the laundry. Joe was a good fellow. She had nursed him and Alphy too; and Joe used often say: \u201cMamma is mamma but Maria is my proper mother.\u201d After the break-up at home the boys had got her that position in the _Dublin by Lamplight_ laundry, and she liked it. She used to have such a bad opinion of Protestants but now she thought they were very nice people, a little quiet and serious, but still very nice people to live with.", " \u201cTell me,\u201d he said across the fire, \u201cwhat brings our friend in here?

He\u2019s a spy of Colgan\u2019s, if you ask me. Just go round and try and find out how they\u2019re getting on. They won\u2019t suspect you.

Then amid the silence he took off his hat, laid it on the table and stood up. He seemed to be rehearsing the piece in his mind. After a rather long pause he announced: THE DEATH OF PARNELL 6_th October_ 1891 He cleared his throat once or twice and then began to recite: He is dead. Our Uncrowned King is dead. O, Erin, mourn with grief and woe For he lies dead whom the fell gang Of modern hypocrites laid low.

Captain Sinico, of Leoville, Sydney Parade, husband of the deceased, also gave evidence. He stated that the deceased was his wife. He was not in Dublin at the time of the accident as he had arrived only that morning from Rotterdam. They had been married for twenty-two years and had lived happily until about two years ago when his wife began to be rather intemperate in her habits. Miss Mary Sinico said that of late her mother had been in the habit of going out at night to buy spirits. She, witness, had often tried to reason with her mother and had induced her to join a league. She was not at home until an hour after the accident. The jury returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence and exonerated Lennon from all blame. The Deputy Coroner said it was a most painful case, and expressed great sympathy with Captain Sinico and his daughter. He urged on the railway company to take strong measures to prevent the possibility of similar accidents in the future. No blame attached to anyone. Mr Duffy raised his eyes from the paper and gazed out of his window on the cheerless evening landscape. The river lay quiet beside the empty distillery and from time to time a light appeared in some house on the Lucan road.", " He had been a clerk in the Midland Railway, a canvasser for advertisements for _The Irish Times_ and for _The Freeman\u2019s Journal_, a town traveller for a coal firm on commission, a private inquiry agent, a clerk in the office of the Sub-Sheriff and he had recently become secretary to the City Coroner. His new office made him professionally interested in Mr Kernan\u2019s case. \u201cPain? Not much,\u201d answered Mr Kernan. \u201cBut it\u2019s so sickening. I feel as if I wanted to retch off.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the boose,\u201d said Mr Cunningham firmly. \u201cNo,\u201d said Mr Kernan. \u201cI think I caught a cold on the car. There\u2019s something keeps coming into my throat, phlegm or\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cMucus.\u201d said Mr M\u2019Coy. \u201cIt keeps coming like from down in my throat; sickening thing.\u201d \u201cYes, yes,\u201d said Mr M\u2019Coy, \u201cthat\u2019s the thorax.\u201d He looked at Mr Cunningham and Mr Power at the same time with an air of challenge. Mr Cunningham nodded his head rapidly and Mr Power said: \u201cAh, well, all\u2019s well that ends well.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very much obliged to you, old man,\u201d said the invalid. Mr Power waved his hand. \u201cThose other two fellows I was with\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cWho were you with?\u201d asked Mr Cunningham. \u201cA chap. I don\u2019t know his name.

When Mr Cunningham made that remark, people were silent. It was known that the speaker had secret sources of information. In this case the monosyllable had a moral intention.", " Then she played the prelude and said _\u201cNow, Maria!\u201d_ and Maria, blushing very much began to sing in a tiny quavering voice. She sang _I Dreamt that I Dwelt_, and when she came to the second verse she sang again: _I dreamt that I dwelt in marble halls With vassals and serfs at my side And of all who assembled within those walls That I was the hope and the pride. I had riches too great to count, could boast Of a high ancestral name, But I also dreamt, which pleased me most, That you loved me still the same._ But no one tried to show her her mistake; and when she had ended her song Joe was very much moved. He said that there was no time like the long ago and no music for him like poor old Balfe, whatever other people might say; and his eyes filled up so much with tears that he could not find what he was looking for and in the end he had to ask his wife to tell him where the corkscrew was. A PAINFUL CASE Mr James Duffy lived in Chapelizod because he wished to live as far as possible from the city of which he was a citizen and because he found all the other suburbs of Dublin mean, modern and pretentious. He lived in an old sombre house and from his windows he could look into the disused distillery or upwards along the shallow river on which Dublin is built. The lofty walls of his uncarpeted room were free from pictures. He had himself bought every article of furniture in the room: a black iron bedstead, an iron washstand, four cane chairs, a clothes-rack, a coal-scuttle, a fender and irons and a square table on which lay a double desk.", " He met her again a few weeks afterwards at a concert in Earlsfort Terrace and seized the moments when her daughter\u2019s attention was diverted to become intimate. She alluded once or twice to her husband but her tone was not such as to make the allusion a warning. Her name was Mrs Sinico. Her husband\u2019s great-great-grandfather had come from Leghorn. Her husband was captain of a mercantile boat plying between Dublin and Holland; and they had one child. Meeting her a third time by accident he found courage to make an appointment. She came. This was the first of many meetings; they met always in the evening and chose the most quiet quarters for their walks together. Mr Duffy, however, had a distaste for underhand ways and, finding that they were compelled to meet stealthily, he forced her to ask him to her house. Captain Sinico encouraged his visits, thinking that his daughter\u2019s hand was in question. He had dismissed his wife so sincerely from his gallery of pleasures that he did not suspect that anyone else would take an interest in her. As the husband was often away and the daughter out giving music lessons Mr Duffy had many opportunities of enjoying the lady\u2019s society. Neither he nor she had had any such adventure before and neither was conscious of any incongruity. Little by little he entangled his thoughts with hers.

They had been married for twenty-two years and had lived happily until about two years ago when his wife began to be rather intemperate in her habits. Miss Mary Sinico said that of late her mother had been in the habit of going out at night to buy spirits. She, witness, had often tried to reason with her mother and had induced her to join a league. She was not at home until an hour after the accident. The jury returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence and exonerated Lennon from all blame.

She respected her husband in the same way as she respected the General Post Office, as something large, secure and fixed; and though she knew the small number of his talents she appreciated his abstract value as a male. She was glad that he had suggested coming with her. She thought her plans over. The night of the grand concert came. Mrs Kearney, with her husband and daughter, arrived at the Antient Concert Rooms three-quarters of an hour before the time at which the concert was to begin. By ill luck it was a rainy evening. Mrs Kearney placed her daughter\u2019s clothes and music in charge of her husband and went all over the building looking for Mr Holohan or Mr Fitzpatrick. She could find neither. She asked the stewards was any member of the Committee in the hall and, after a great deal of trouble, a steward brought out a little woman named Miss Beirne to whom Mrs Kearney explained that she wanted to see one of the secretaries. Miss Beirne expected them any minute and asked could she do anything. Mrs Kearney looked searchingly at the oldish face which was screwed into an expression of trustfulness and enthusiasm and answered: \u201cNo, thank you!\u201d The little woman hoped they would have a good house. She looked out at the rain until the melancholy of the wet street effaced all the trustfulness and enthusiasm from her twisted features. Then she gave a little sigh and said: \u201cAh, well!", " \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any Committee,\u201d said Mrs Kearney angrily. \u201cMy daughter has her contract. She will get four pounds eight into her hand or a foot she won\u2019t put on that platform.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m surprised at you, Mrs Kearney,\u201d said Mr Holohan. \u201cI never thought you would treat us this way.\u201d \u201cAnd what way did you treat me?\u201d asked Mrs Kearney. Her face was inundated with an angry colour and she looked as if she would attack someone with her hands. \u201cI\u2019m asking for my rights.\u201d she said. \u201cYou might have some sense of decency,\u201d said Mr Holohan. \u201cMight I, indeed?... And when I ask when my daughter is going to be paid I can\u2019t get a civil answer.\u201d She tossed her head and assumed a haughty voice: \u201cYou must speak to the secretary. It\u2019s not my business. I\u2019m a great fellow fol-the-diddle-I-do.\u201d \u201cI thought you were a lady,\u201d said Mr Holohan, walking away from her abruptly. After that Mrs Kearney\u2019s conduct was condemned on all hands: everyone approved of what the Committee had done. She stood at the door, haggard with rage, arguing with her husband and daughter, gesticulating with them. She waited until it was time for the second part to begin in the hope that the secretaries would approach her. But Miss Healy had kindly consented to play one or two accompaniments. Mrs Kearney had to stand aside to allow the baritone and his accompanist to pass up to the platform. She stood still for an instant like an angry stone image and, when the first notes of the song struck her ear, she caught up her daughter\u2019s cloak and said to her husband: \u201cGet a cab!\u201d He went out at once."], "Where does the final meeting between Mrs. Sinico and Mr. Duffy take place?": [" He met her again a few weeks afterwards at a concert in Earlsfort Terrace and seized the moments when her daughter\u2019s attention was diverted to become intimate.

As soon as she could she excused herself and went out after him. \u201cMr Holohan, I want to speak to you for a moment,\u201d she said. They went down to a discreet part of the corridor. Mrs Kearney asked him when was her daughter going to be paid. Mr Holohan said that Mr Fitzpatrick had charge of that. Mrs Kearney said that she didn\u2019t know anything about Mr Fitzpatrick. Her daughter had signed a contract for eight guineas and she would have to be paid. Mr Holohan said that it wasn\u2019t his business. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t it your business?\u201d asked Mrs Kearney. \u201cDidn\u2019t you yourself bring her the contract?

The room was lively. Two men in outdoor dress had taken possession of the fireplace and were chatting familiarly with Miss Healy and the baritone. They were the _Freeman_ man and Mr O\u2019Madden Burke. The _Freeman_ man had come in to say that he could not wait for the concert as he had to report the lecture which an American priest was giving in the Mansion House.", " Many times she allowed the dark to fall upon them, refraining from lighting the lamp.

His stick struck the ground less emphatically and his breath, issuing irregularly, almost with a sighing sound, condensed in the wintry air.

It is all very well for the man: he can go his ways as if nothing had happened, having had his moment of pleasure, but the girl has to bear the brunt. Some mothers would be content to patch up such an affair for a sum of money; she had known cases of it. But she would not do so.

Every night as I gazed up at the window I said softly to myself the word paralysis. It had always sounded strangely in my ears, like the word gnomon in the Euclid and the word simony in the Catechism. But now it sounded to me like the name of some maleficent and sinful being. It filled me with fear, and yet I longed to be nearer to it and to look upon its deadly work. Old Cotter was sitting at the fire, smoking, when I came downstairs to supper.

Mr M\u2019Coy had tried unsuccessfully to find a place in the bench with the others and, when the party had settled down in the form of a quincunx, he had tried unsuccessfully to make comic remarks. As these had not been well received he had desisted. Even he was sensible of the decorous atmosphere and even he began to respond to the religious stimulus. In a whisper Mr Cunningham drew Mr Kernan\u2019s attention to Mr Harford, the moneylender, who sat some distance off, and to Mr Fanning, the registration agent and mayor maker of the city, who was sitting immediately under the pulpit beside one of the newly elected councillors of the ward. To the right sat old Michael Grimes, the owner of three pawnbroker\u2019s shops, and Dan Hogan\u2019s nephew, who was up for the job in the Town Clerk\u2019s office. Farther in front sat Mr Hendrick, the chief reporter of _The Freeman\u2019s Journal_, and poor O\u2019Carroll, an old friend of Mr Kernan\u2019s, who had been at one time a considerable commercial figure. Gradually, as he recognised familiar faces, Mr Kernan began to feel more at home.", " Now,\u201d he added, pointing to Mahony who was regarding us with open eyes, \u201che is different; he goes in for games.\u201d He said he had all Sir Walter Scott\u2019s works and all Lord Lytton\u2019s works at home and never tired of reading them. \u201cOf course,\u201d he said, \u201cthere were some of Lord Lytton\u2019s works which boys couldn\u2019t read.\u201d Mahony asked why couldn\u2019t boys read them\u2014a question which agitated and pained me because I was afraid the man would think I was as stupid as Mahony. The man, however, only smiled. I saw that he had great gaps in his mouth between his yellow teeth. Then he asked us which of us had the most sweethearts. Mahony mentioned lightly that he had three totties. The man asked me how many had I. I answered that I had none. He did not believe me and said he was sure I must have one. I was silent. \u201cTell us,\u201d said Mahony pertly to the man, \u201chow many have you yourself?\u201d The man smiled as before and said that when he was our age he had lots of sweethearts. \u201cEvery boy,\u201d he said, \u201chas a little sweetheart.\u201d His attitude on this point struck me as strangely liberal in a man of his age. In my heart I thought that what he said about boys and sweethearts was reasonable. But I disliked the words in his mouth and I wondered why he shivered once or twice as if he feared something or felt a sudden chill. As he proceeded I noticed that his accent was good. He began to speak to us about girls, saying what nice soft hair they had and how soft their hands were and how all girls were not so good as they seemed to be if one only knew.", " I was talking one day to old Keegan, the porter. \u2018And how do you like your new master, Pat?\u2019 says I to him. \u2018You haven\u2019t much entertaining now,\u2019 says I. \u2018Entertaining!\u2019 says he. \u2018He\u2019d live on the smell of an oil-rag.\u2019 And do you know what he told me? Now, I declare to God I didn\u2019t believe him.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d said Mr Henchy and Mr O\u2019Connor. \u201cHe told me: \u2018What do you think of a Lord Mayor of Dublin sending out for a pound of chops for his dinner? How\u2019s that for high living?\u2019 says he. \u2018Wisha! wisha,\u2019 says I. \u2018A pound of chops,\u2019 says he, \u2018coming into the Mansion House.\u2019 \u2018Wisha!\u2019 says I, \u2018what kind of people is going at all now?\u2019\u201d At this point there was a knock at the door, and a boy put in his head. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d said the old man. \u201cFrom the _Black Eagle_,\u201d said the boy, walking in sideways and depositing a basket on the floor with a noise of shaken bottles. The old man helped the boy to transfer the bottles from the basket to the table and counted the full tally. After the transfer the boy put his basket on his arm and asked: \u201cAny bottles?\u201d \u201cWhat bottles?\u201d said the old man. \u201cWon\u2019t you let us drink them first?\u201d said Mr Henchy. \u201cI was told to ask for the bottles.\u201d \u201cCome back tomorrow,\u201d said the old man. \u201cHere, boy!\u201d said Mr Henchy, \u201cwill you run over to O\u2019Farrell\u2019s and ask him to lend us a corkscrew\u2014for Mr Henchy, say. Tell him we won\u2019t keep it a minute. Leave the basket there.\u201d The boy went out and Mr Henchy began to rub his hands cheerfully, saying: \u201cAh, well, he\u2019s not so bad after all."], "What is the name of the party that supports an independent Ireland?": [" And Maria laughed again till the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of her chin and till her minute body nearly shook itself asunder because she knew that Mooney meant well though, of course, she had the notions of a common woman. But wasn\u2019t Maria glad when the women had finished their tea and the cook and the dummy had begun to clear away the tea-things! She went into her little bedroom and, remembering that the next morning was a mass morning, changed the hand of the alarm from seven to six. Then she took off her working skirt and her house-boots and laid her best skirt out on the bed and her tiny dress-boots beside the foot of the bed. She changed her blouse too and, as she stood before the mirror, she thought of how she used to dress for mass on Sunday morning when she was a young girl; and she looked with quaint affection at the diminutive body which she had so often adorned. In spite of its years she found it a nice tidy little body. When she got outside the streets were shining with rain and she was glad of her old brown waterproof. The tram was full and she had to sit on the little stool at the end of the car, facing all the people, with her toes barely touching the floor. She arranged in her mind all she was going to do and thought how much better it was to be independent and to have your own money in your pocket. She hoped they would have a nice evening. She was sure they would but she could not help thinking what a pity it was Alphy and Joe were not speaking.", " She listened to all. Sometimes in return for his theories she gave out some fact of her own life. With almost maternal solicitude she urged him to let his nature open to the full: she became his confessor. He told her that for some time he had assisted at the meetings of an Irish Socialist Party where he had felt himself a unique figure amidst a score of sober workmen in a garret lit by an inefficient oil-lamp. When the party had divided into three sections, each under its own leader and in its own garret, he had discontinued his attendances. The workmen\u2019s discussions, he said, were too timorous; the interest they took in the question of wages was inordinate. He felt that they were hard-featured realists and that they resented an exactitude which was the produce of a leisure not within their reach. No social revolution, he told her, would be likely to strike Dublin for some centuries. She asked him why did he not write out his thoughts. For what, he asked her, with careful scorn. To compete with phrasemongers, incapable of thinking consecutively for sixty seconds? To submit himself to the criticisms of an obtuse middle class which entrusted its morality to policemen and its fine arts to impresarios? He went often to her little cottage outside Dublin; often they spent their evenings alone. Little by little, as their thoughts entangled, they spoke of subjects less remote. Her companionship was like a warm soil about an exotic.", " Rivi\u00e8re, not wholly ingenuously, undertook to explain to Jimmy the triumph of the French mechanicians. The resonant voice of the Hungarian was about to prevail in ridicule of the spurious lutes of the romantic painters when S\u00e9gouin shepherded his party into politics. Here was congenial ground for all. Jimmy, under generous influences, felt the buried zeal of his father wake to life within him: he aroused the torpid Routh at last. The room grew doubly hot and S\u00e9gouin\u2019s task grew harder each moment: there was even danger of personal spite. The alert host at an opportunity lifted his glass to Humanity and, when the toast had been drunk, he threw open a window significantly. That night the city wore the mask of a capital. The five young men strolled along Stephen\u2019s Green in a faint cloud of aromatic smoke. They talked loudly and gaily and their cloaks dangled from their shoulders. The people made way for them. At the corner of Grafton Street a short fat man was putting two handsome ladies on a car in charge of another fat man. The car drove off and the short fat man caught sight of the party. \u201cAndr\u00e9.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Farley!\u201d A torrent of talk followed. Farley was an American. No one knew very well what the talk was about. Villona and Rivi\u00e8re were the noisiest, but all the men were excited. They got up on a car, squeezing themselves together amid much laughter. They drove by the crowd, blended now into soft colours, to a music of merry bells.", " The French, moreover, were virtual victors. Their team had finished solidly; they had been placed second and third and the driver of the winning German car was reported a Belgian. Each blue car, therefore, received a double measure of welcome as it topped the crest of the hill and each cheer of welcome was acknowledged with smiles and nods by those in the car. In one of these trimly built cars was a party of four young men whose spirits seemed to be at present well above the level of successful Gallicism: in fact, these four young men were almost hilarious. They were Charles S\u00e9gouin, the owner of the car; Andr\u00e9 Rivi\u00e8re, a young electrician of Canadian birth; a huge Hungarian named Villona and a neatly groomed young man named Doyle. S\u00e9gouin was in good humour because he had unexpectedly received some orders in advance (he was about to start a motor establishment in Paris) and Rivi\u00e8re was in good humour because he was to be appointed manager of the establishment; these two young men (who were cousins) were also in good humour because of the success of the French cars. Villona was in good humour because he had had a very satisfactory luncheon; and besides he was an optimist by nature. The fourth member of the party, however, was too excited to be genuinely happy.

O, the heart\u2019s blood of a patriot! That\u2019s a fellow now that\u2019d sell his country for fourpence\u2014ay\u2014and go down on his bended knees and thank the Almighty Christ he had a country to sell.\u201d There was a knock at the door. \u201cCome in!\u201d said Mr Henchy. A person resembling a poor clergyman or a poor actor appeared in the doorway. His black clothes were tightly buttoned on his short body and it was impossible to say whether he wore a clergyman\u2019s collar or a layman\u2019s, because the collar of his shabby frock-coat, the uncovered buttons of which reflected the candlelight, was turned up about his neck. He wore a round hat of hard black felt. His face, shining with raindrops, had the appearance of damp yellow cheese save where two rosy spots indicated the cheekbones. He opened his very long mouth suddenly to express disappointment and at the same time opened wide his very bright blue eyes to express pleasure and surprise. \u201cO Father Keon!\u201d said Mr Henchy, jumping up from his chair. \u201cIs that you?", " No, it was not the moment yet. \u201cYou looked tired,\u201d he said. \u201cI am a little,\u201d she answered. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel ill or weak?\u201d \u201cNo, tired: that\u2019s all.\u201d She went on to the window and stood there, looking out. Gabriel waited again and then, fearing that diffidence was about to conquer him, he said abruptly: \u201cBy the way, Gretta!\u201d \u201cWhat is it?\u201d \u201cYou know that poor fellow Malins?\u201d he said quickly. \u201cYes. What about him?\u201d \u201cWell, poor fellow, he\u2019s a decent sort of chap after all,\u201d continued Gabriel in a false voice. \u201cHe gave me back that sovereign I lent him, and I didn\u2019t expect it, really. It\u2019s a pity he wouldn\u2019t keep away from that Browne, because he\u2019s not a bad fellow, really.\u201d He was trembling now with annoyance. Why did she seem so abstracted? He did not know how he could begin. Was she annoyed, too, about something? If she would only turn to him or come to him of her own accord! To take her as she was would be brutal. No, he must see some ardour in her eyes first. He longed to be master of her strange mood. \u201cWhen did you lend him the pound?\u201d she asked, after a pause. Gabriel strove to restrain himself from breaking out into brutal language about the sottish Malins and his pound. He longed to cry to her from his soul, to crush her body against his, to overmaster her. But he said: \u201cO, at Christmas, when he opened that little Christmas-card shop in Henry Street.\u201d He was in such a fever of rage and desire that he did not hear her come from the window.", " The French, moreover, were virtual victors.

She got out of her tram at the Pillar and ferreted her way quickly among the crowds. She went into Downes\u2019s cake-shop but the shop was so full of people that it was a long time before she could get herself attended to. She bought a dozen of mixed penny cakes, and at last came out of the shop laden with a big bag. Then she thought what else would she buy: she wanted to buy something really nice. They would be sure to have plenty of apples and nuts. It was hard to know what to buy and all she could think of was cake. She decided to buy some plumcake but Downes\u2019s plumcake had not enough almond icing on top of it so she went over to a shop in Henry Street. Here she was a long time in suiting herself and the stylish young lady behind the counter, who was evidently a little annoyed by her, asked her was it wedding-cake she wanted to buy. That made Maria blush and smile at the young lady; but the young lady took it all very seriously and finally cut a thick slice of plumcake, parcelled it up and said: \u201cTwo-and-four, please.\u201d She thought she would have to stand in the Drumcondra tram because none of the young men seemed to notice her but an elderly gentleman made room for her.

A volume of Byron\u2019s poems lay before him on the table. He opened it cautiously with his left hand lest he should waken the child and began to read the first poem in the book: _Hushed are the winds and still the evening gloom, Not e\u2019en a Zephyr wanders through the grove, Whilst I return to view my Margaret\u2019s tomb And scatter flowers on the dust I love._ He paused. He felt the rhythm of the verse about him in the room. How melancholy it was! Could he, too, write like that, express the melancholy of his soul in verse? There were so many things he wanted to describe: his sensation of a few hours before on Grattan Bridge, for example. If he could get back again into that mood.... The child awoke and began to cry. He turned from the page and tried to hush it: but it would not be hushed. He began to rock it to and fro in his arms but its wailing cry grew keener. He rocked it faster while his eyes began to read the second stanza: _Within this narrow cell reclines her clay, That clay where once...._ It was useless. He couldn\u2019t read. He couldn\u2019t do anything. The wailing of the child pierced the drum of his ear. It was useless, useless! He was a prisoner for life. His arms trembled with anger and suddenly bending to the child\u2019s face he shouted: \u201cStop!\u201d The child stopped for an instant, had a spasm of fright and began to scream.", " A few days later he received a parcel containing his books and music. Four years passed. Mr Duffy returned to his even way of life. His room still bore witness of the orderliness of his mind. Some new pieces of music encumbered the music-stand in the lower room and on his shelves stood two volumes by Nietzsche: _Thus Spake Zarathustra_ and _The Gay Science_. He wrote seldom in the sheaf of papers which lay in his desk. One of his sentences, written two months after his last interview with Mrs Sinico, read: Love between man and man is impossible because there must not be sexual intercourse and friendship between man and woman is impossible because there must be sexual intercourse. He kept away from concerts lest he should meet her. His father died; the junior partner of the bank retired. And still every morning he went into the city by tram and every evening walked home from the city after having dined moderately in George\u2019s Street and read the evening paper for dessert. One evening as he was about to put a morsel of corned beef and cabbage into his mouth his hand stopped. His eyes fixed themselves on a paragraph in the evening paper which he had propped against the water-carafe. He replaced the morsel of food on his plate and read the paragraph attentively. Then he drank a glass of water, pushed his plate to one side, doubled the paper down before him between his elbows and read the paragraph over and over again.", " It was a text which might seem to the casual observer at variance with the lofty morality elsewhere preached by Jesus Christ. But, he told his hearers, the text had seemed to him specially adapted for the guidance of those whose lot it was to lead the life of the world and who yet wished to lead that life not in the manner of worldlings. It was a text for business men and professional men. Jesus Christ, with His divine understanding of every cranny of our human nature, understood that all men were not called to the religious life, that by far the vast majority were forced to live in the world and, to a certain extent, for the world: and in this sentence He designed to give them a word of counsel, setting before them as exemplars in the religious life those very worshippers of Mammon who were of all men the least solicitous in matters religious. He told his hearers that he was there that evening for no terrifying, no extravagant purpose; but as a man of the world speaking to his fellow-men. He came to speak to business men and he would speak to them in a businesslike way. If he might use the metaphor, he said, he was their spiritual accountant; and he wished each and every one of his hearers to open his books, the books of his spiritual life, and see if they tallied accurately with conscience. Jesus Christ was not a hard taskmaster. He understood our little failings, understood the weakness of our poor fallen nature, understood the temptations of this life.", " Even when he was out at elbows and at his wits\u2019 end for money he kept up a bold face. Little Chandler remembered (and the remembrance brought a slight flush of pride to his cheek) one of Ignatius Gallaher\u2019s sayings when he was in a tight corner: \u201cHalf time now, boys,\u201d he used to say light-heartedly. \u201cWhere\u2019s my considering cap?\u201d That was Ignatius Gallaher all out; and, damn it, you couldn\u2019t but admire him for it. Little Chandler quickened his pace. For the first time in his life he felt himself superior to the people he passed. For the first time his soul revolted against the dull inelegance of Capel Street. There was no doubt about it: if you wanted to succeed you had to go away. You could do nothing in Dublin. As he crossed Grattan Bridge he looked down the river towards the lower quays and pitied the poor stunted houses. They seemed to him a band of tramps, huddled together along the riverbanks, their old coats covered with dust and soot, stupefied by the panorama of sunset and waiting for the first chill of night bid them arise, shake themselves and begone. He wondered whether he could write a poem to express his idea. Perhaps Gallaher might be able to get it into some London paper for him. Could he write something original? He was not sure what idea he wished to express but the thought that a poetic moment had touched him took life within him like an infant hope. He stepped onward bravely."], "In \u201cA Mother,\u201d what is the meaning of Eire Abu?": [" But that was all passed and done with ... nearly. He still bought a copy of _Reynolds\u2019s Newspaper_ every week but he attended to his religious duties and for nine-tenths of the year lived a regular life. He had money enough to settle down on; it was not that. But the family would look down on her. First of all there was her disreputable father and then her mother\u2019s boarding house was beginning to get a certain fame. He had a notion that he was being had. He could imagine his friends talking of the affair and laughing. She _was_ a little vulgar; sometimes she said \u201cI seen\u201d and \u201cIf I had\u2019ve known.\u201d But what would grammar matter if he really loved her? He could not make up his mind whether to like her or despise her for what she had done. Of course he had done it too. His instinct urged him to remain free, not to marry. Once you are married you are done for, it said. While he was sitting helplessly on the side of the bed in shirt and trousers she tapped lightly at his door and entered. She told him all, that she had made a clean breast of it to her mother and that her mother would speak with him that morning. She cried and threw her arms round his neck, saying: \u201cO Bob! Bob! What am I to do? What am I to do at all?\u201d She would put an end to herself, she said. He comforted her feebly, telling her not to cry, that it would be all right, never fear. He felt against his shirt the agitation of her bosom.", " He told her the names of the ships he had been on and the names of the different services. He had sailed through the Straits of Magellan and he told her stories of the terrible Patagonians. He had fallen on his feet in Buenos Ayres, he said, and had come over to the old country just for a holiday. Of course, her father had found out the affair and had forbidden her to have anything to say to him. \u201cI know these sailor chaps,\u201d he said. One day he had quarrelled with Frank and after that she had to meet her lover secretly. The evening deepened in the avenue. The white of two letters in her lap grew indistinct. One was to Harry; the other was to her father. Ernest had been her favourite but she liked Harry too. Her father was becoming old lately, she noticed; he would miss her. Sometimes he could be very nice. Not long before, when she had been laid up for a day, he had read her out a ghost story and made toast for her at the fire. Another day, when their mother was alive, they had all gone for a picnic to the Hill of Howth. She remembered her father putting on her mother\u2019s bonnet to make the children laugh. Her time was running out but she continued to sit by the window, leaning her head against the window curtain, inhaling the odour of dusty cretonne. Down far in the avenue she could hear a street organ playing. She knew the air. Strange that it should come that very night to remind her of the promise to her mother, her promise to keep the home together as long as she could.", " She remembered the last night of her mother\u2019s illness; she was again in the close dark room at the other side of the hall and outside she heard a melancholy air of Italy. The organ-player had been ordered to go away and given sixpence. She remembered her father strutting back into the sickroom saying: \u201cDamned Italians! coming over here!\u201d As she mused the pitiful vision of her mother\u2019s life laid its spell on the very quick of her being\u2014that life of commonplace sacrifices closing in final craziness. She trembled as she heard again her mother\u2019s voice saying constantly with foolish insistence: \u201cDerevaun Seraun! Derevaun Seraun!\u201d She stood up in a sudden impulse of terror. Escape! She must escape! Frank would save her. He would give her life, perhaps love, too. But she wanted to live. Why should she be unhappy? She had a right to happiness. Frank would take her in his arms, fold her in his arms. He would save her. She stood among the swaying crowd in the station at the North Wall. He held her hand and she knew that he was speaking to her, saying something about the passage over and over again. The station was full of soldiers with brown baggages. Through the wide doors of the sheds she caught a glimpse of the black mass of the boat, lying in beside the quay wall, with illumined portholes. She answered nothing. She felt her cheek pale and cold and, out of a maze of distress, she prayed to God to direct her, to show her what was her duty.", " \u201cPerhaps that was why you wanted to go to Galway with that Ivors girl?\u201d he said coldly. She looked at him and asked in surprise: \u201cWhat for?\u201d Her eyes made Gabriel feel awkward. He shrugged his shoulders and said: \u201cHow do I know? To see him, perhaps.\u201d She looked away from him along the shaft of light towards the window in silence. \u201cHe is dead,\u201d she said at length. \u201cHe died when he was only seventeen. Isn\u2019t it a terrible thing to die so young as that?\u201d \u201cWhat was he?\u201d asked Gabriel, still ironically. \u201cHe was in the gasworks,\u201d she said. Gabriel felt humiliated by the failure of his irony and by the evocation of this figure from the dead, a boy in the gasworks. While he had been full of memories of their secret life together, full of tenderness and joy and desire, she had been comparing him in her mind with another. A shameful consciousness of his own person assailed him. He saw himself as a ludicrous figure, acting as a pennyboy for his aunts, a nervous, well-meaning sentimentalist, orating to vulgarians and idealising his own clownish lusts, the pitiable fatuous fellow he had caught a glimpse of in the mirror. Instinctively he turned his back more to the light lest she might see the shame that burned upon his forehead. He tried to keep up his tone of cold interrogation, but his voice when he spoke was humble and indifferent. \u201cI suppose you were in love with this Michael Furey, Gretta,\u201d he said."], "What instrument does Mrs. Kearney\u2019s daughter play?": [" \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any Committee,\u201d said Mrs Kearney angrily. \u201cMy daughter has her contract.

Her face was inundated with an angry colour and she looked as if she would attack someone with her hands. \u201cI\u2019m asking for my rights.\u201d she said. \u201cYou might have some sense of decency,\u201d said Mr Holohan. \u201cMight I, indeed?... And when I ask when my daughter is going to be paid I can\u2019t get a civil answer.\u201d She tossed her head and assumed a haughty voice: \u201cYou must speak to the secretary.

Mr Fitzpatrick, who did not catch the point at issue very quickly, seemed unable to resolve the difficulty and said that he would bring the matter before the Committee.

On special Sundays, when Mr Kearney went with his family to the pro-cathedral, a little crowd of people would assemble after mass at the corner of Cathedral Street. They were all friends of the Kearneys\u2014musical friends or Nationalist friends; and, when they had played every little counter of gossip, they shook hands with one another all together, laughing at the crossing of so many hands, and said good-bye to one another in Irish. Soon the name of Miss Kathleen Kearney began to be heard often on people\u2019s lips. People said that she was very clever at music and a very nice girl and, moreover, that she was a believer in the language movement. Mrs Kearney was well content at this. Therefore she was not surprised when one day Mr Holohan came to her and proposed that her daughter should be the accompanist at a series of four grand concerts which his Society was going to give in the Antient Concert Rooms. She brought him into the drawing-room, made him sit down and brought out the decanter and the silver biscuit-barrel. She entered heart and soul into the details of the enterprise, advised and dissuaded; and finally a contract was drawn up by which Kathleen was to receive eight guineas for her services as accompanist at the four grand concerts. As Mr Holohan was a novice in such delicate matters as the wording of bills and the disposing of items for a programme, Mrs Kearney helped him."], "What does Mrs. Kearney angrily demand before her daughter plays?": [" \u201cI haven\u2019t seen any Committee,\u201d said Mrs Kearney angrily. \u201cMy daughter has her contract.

Then she gave a little sigh and said: \u201cAh, well!"], "At the beginning of \u201cGrace,\u201d what has just happened to Mr. Kernan?": [" Mr Kernan was huddled together with cold. His friend asked him to tell how the accident had happened. \u201cI \u2019an\u2019t, \u2019an,\u201d he answered, \u201c\u2019y \u2019ongue is hurt.\u201d \u201cShow.\u201d The other leaned over the well of the car and peered into Mr Kernan\u2019s mouth but he could not see. He struck a match and, sheltering it in the shell of his hands, peered again into the mouth which Mr Kernan opened obediently. The swaying movement of the car brought the match to and from the opened mouth. The lower teeth and gums were covered with clotted blood and a minute piece of the tongue seemed to have been bitten off. The match was blown out. \u201cThat\u2019s ugly,\u201d said Mr Power. \u201cSha, \u2019s nothing,\u201d said Mr Kernan, closing his mouth and pulling the collar of his filthy coat across his neck. Mr Kernan was a commercial traveller of the old school which believed in the dignity of its calling. He had never been seen in the city without a silk hat of some decency and a pair of gaiters. By grace of these two articles of clothing, he said, a man could always pass muster. He carried on the tradition of his Napoleon, the great Blackwhite, whose memory he evoked at times by legend and mimicry. Modern business methods had spared him only so far as to allow him a little office in Crowe Street on the window blind of which was written the name of his firm with the address\u2014London, E.C. On the mantelpiece of this little office a little leaden battalion of canisters was drawn up and on the table before the window stood four or five china bowls which were usually half full of a black liquid.", " \u201cI often told you that?\u201d Mrs Kernan nodded. \u201cIt was at the unveiling of Sir John Gray\u2019s statue. Edmund Dwyer Gray was speaking, blathering away, and here was this old fellow, crabbed-looking old chap, looking at him from under his bushy eyebrows.\u201d Mr Kernan knitted his brows and, lowering his head like an angry bull, glared at his wife. \u201cGod!\u201d he exclaimed, resuming his natural face, \u201cI never saw such an eye in a man\u2019s head. It was as much as to say: _I have you properly taped, my lad_. He had an eye like a hawk.\u201d \u201cNone of the Grays was any good,\u201d said Mr Power. There was a pause again. Mr Power turned to Mrs Kernan and said with abrupt joviality: \u201cWell, Mrs Kernan, we\u2019re going to make your man here a good holy pious and God-fearing Roman Catholic.\u201d He swept his arm round the company inclusively. \u201cWe\u2019re all going to make a retreat together and confess our sins\u2014and God knows we want it badly.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t mind,\u201d said Mr Kernan, smiling a little nervously. Mrs Kernan thought it would be wiser to conceal her satisfaction. So she said: \u201cI pity the poor priest that has to listen to your tale.\u201d Mr Kernan\u2019s expression changed. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t like it,\u201d he said bluntly, \u201che can ... do the other thing. I\u2019ll just tell him my little tale of woe. I\u2019m not such a bad fellow\u2014\u2014\u201d Mr Cunningham intervened promptly. \u201cWe\u2019ll all renounce the devil,\u201d he said, \u201ctogether, not forgetting his works and pomps.\u201d \u201cGet behind me, Satan!\u201d said Mr Fogarty, laughing and looking at the others.", " From these bowls Mr Kernan tasted tea. He took a mouthful, drew it up, saturated his palate with it and then spat it forth into the grate. Then he paused to judge. Mr Power, a much younger man, was employed in the Royal Irish Constabulary Office in Dublin Castle. The arc of his social rise intersected the arc of his friend\u2019s decline, but Mr Kernan\u2019s decline was mitigated by the fact that certain of those friends who had known him at his highest point of success still esteemed him as a character. Mr Power was one of these friends. His inexplicable debts were a byword in his circle; he was a debonair young man. The car halted before a small house on the Glasnevin road and Mr Kernan was helped into the house. His wife put him to bed while Mr Power sat downstairs in the kitchen asking the children where they went to school and what book they were in. The children\u2014two girls and a boy, conscious of their father\u2019s helplessness and of their mother\u2019s absence, began some horseplay with him. He was surprised at their manners and at their accents, and his brow grew thoughtful. After a while Mrs Kernan entered the kitchen, exclaiming: \u201cSuch a sight!

He was not straight-laced, but he could not forget that Mr M\u2019Coy had recently made a crusade in search of valises and portmanteaus to enable Mrs M\u2019Coy to fulfil imaginary engagements in the country. More than he resented the fact that he had been victimised he resented such low playing of the game. He answered the question, therefore, as if Mr Kernan had asked it. The narrative made Mr Kernan indignant. He was keenly conscious of his citizenship, wished to live with his city on terms mutually honourable and resented any affront put upon him by those whom he called country bumpkins. \u201cIs this what we pay rates for?\u201d he asked. \u201cTo feed and clothe these ignorant bostooms ... and they\u2019re nothing else.\u201d Mr Cunningham laughed.

He takes up a wad of cabbage on the spoon and pegs it across the room and the poor devils have to try and catch it on their plates: 65, _catch your cabbage_.\u201d Everyone laughed again: but Mr Kernan was somewhat indignant still.

She was tempted to see a curious appropriateness in his accident and, but that she did not wish to seem bloody-minded, she would have told the gentlemen that Mr Kernan\u2019s tongue would not suffer by being shortened. However, Mr Cunningham was a capable man; and religion was religion. The scheme might do good and, at least, it could do no harm. Her beliefs were not extravagant. She believed steadily in the Sacred Heart as the most generally useful of all Catholic devotions and approved of the sacraments. Her faith was bounded by her kitchen but, if she was put to it, she could believe also in the banshee and in the Holy Ghost. The gentlemen began to talk of the accident. Mr Cunningham said that he had once known a similar case. A man of seventy had bitten off a piece of his tongue during an epileptic fit and the tongue had filled in again so that no one could see a trace of the bite. \u201cWell, I\u2019m not seventy,\u201d said the invalid. \u201cGod forbid,\u201d said Mr Cunningham. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t pain you now?\u201d asked Mr M\u2019Coy. Mr M\u2019Coy had been at one time a tenor of some reputation. His wife, who had been a soprano, still taught young children to play the piano at low terms. His line of life had not been the shortest distance between two points and for short periods he had been driven to live by his wits.", " _Kernan_, he said, _we worship at different altars_, he said, _but our belief is the same_. Struck me as very well put.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a good deal in that,\u201d said Mr Power. \u201cThere used always to be crowds of Protestants in the chapel where Father Tom was preaching.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s not much difference between us,\u201d said Mr M\u2019Coy. \u201cWe both believe in\u2014\u2014\u201d He hesitated for a moment. \u201c... in the Redeemer.

The arch of its fair trailing moustache was repeated in the fair eyebrows looped above pleasantly astonished eyes. Mr Fogarty was a modest grocer. He had failed in business in a licensed house in the city because his financial condition had constrained him to tie himself to second-class distillers and brewers. He had opened a small shop on Glasnevin Road where, he flattered himself, his manners would ingratiate him with the housewives of the district. He bore himself with a certain grace, complimented little children and spoke with a neat enunciation. He was not without culture. Mr Fogarty brought a gift with him, a half-pint of special whisky.", " \u201cI often told you that?\u201d Mrs Kernan nodded. \u201cIt was at the unveiling of Sir John Gray\u2019s statue.

Mrs Kearney was now beginning to be alarmed. She called Mr Fitzpatrick away from his screen and told him that her daughter had signed for four concerts and that, of course, according to the terms of the contract, she should receive the sum originally stipulated for, whether the society gave the four concerts or not. Mr Fitzpatrick, who did not catch the point at issue very quickly, seemed unable to resolve the difficulty and said that he would bring the matter before the Committee.

Little boys were sent out into the principal streets of Dublin early on Friday morning with bundles of handbills. Special puffs appeared in all the evening papers, reminding the music-loving public of the treat which was in store for it on the following evening. Mrs Kearney was somewhat reassured, but she thought well to tell her husband part of her suspicions. He listened carefully and said that perhaps it would be better if he went with her on Saturday night.", " There were five or six workingmen in the shop discussing the value of a gentleman\u2019s estate in County Kildare. They drank at intervals from their huge pint tumblers and smoked, spitting often on the floor and sometimes dragging the sawdust over their spits with their heavy boots. Mr Duffy sat on his stool and gazed at them, without seeing or hearing them. After a while they went out and he called for another punch. He sat a long time over it. The shop was very quiet. The proprietor sprawled on the counter reading the _Herald_ and yawning. Now and again a tram was heard swishing along the lonely road outside. As he sat there, living over his life with her and evoking alternately the two images in which he now conceived her, he realised that she was dead, that she had ceased to exist, that she had become a memory. He began to feel ill at ease. He asked himself what else could he have done. He could not have carried on a comedy of deception with her; he could not have lived with her openly. He had done what seemed to him best. How was he to blame? Now that she was gone he understood how lonely her life must have been, sitting night after night alone in that room. His life would be lonely too until he, too, died, ceased to exist, became a memory\u2014if anyone remembered him. It was after nine o\u2019clock when he left the shop. The night was cold and gloomy. He entered the Park by the first gate and walked along under the gaunt trees.", " What an end! The whole narrative of her death revolted him and it revolted him to think that he had ever spoken to her of what he held sacred. The threadbare phrases, the inane expressions of sympathy, the cautious words of a reporter won over to conceal the details of a commonplace vulgar death attacked his stomach. Not merely had she degraded herself; she had degraded him. He saw the squalid tract of her vice, miserable and malodorous. His soul\u2019s companion! He thought of the hobbling wretches whom he had seen carrying cans and bottles to be filled by the barman. Just God, what an end! Evidently she had been unfit to live, without any strength of purpose, an easy prey to habits, one of the wrecks on which civilisation has been reared. But that she could have sunk so low! Was it possible he had deceived himself so utterly about her? He remembered her outburst of that night and interpreted it in a harsher sense than he had ever done. He had no difficulty now in approving of the course he had taken. As the light failed and his memory began to wander he thought her hand touched his. The shock which had first attacked his stomach was now attacking his nerves. He put on his overcoat and hat quickly and went out. The cold air met him on the threshold; it crept into the sleeves of his coat. When he came to the public-house at Chapelizod Bridge he went in and ordered a hot punch. The proprietor served him obsequiously but did not venture to talk."], "What part of the church service does Mr. Kernan decline to participate in?": [" From these bowls Mr Kernan tasted tea.

But a pleased expression flickered across his face. \u201cAll we have to do,\u201d said Mr Cunningham, \u201cis to stand up with lighted candles in our hands and renew our baptismal vows.\u201d \u201cO, don\u2019t forget the candle, Tom,\u201d said Mr M\u2019Coy, \u201cwhatever you do.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d said Mr Kernan. \u201cMust I have a candle?\u201d \u201cO yes,\u201d said Mr Cunningham. \u201cNo, damn it all,\u201d said Mr Kernan sensibly, \u201cI draw the line there. I\u2019ll do the job right enough. I\u2019ll do the retreat business and confession, and ... all that business. But ... no candles! No, damn it all, I bar the candles!\u201d He shook his head with farcical gravity. \u201cListen to that!\u201d said his wife. \u201cI bar the candles,\u201d said Mr Kernan, conscious of having created an effect on his audience and continuing to shake his head to and fro. \u201cI bar the magic-lantern business.\u201d Everyone laughed heartily. \u201cThere\u2019s a nice Catholic for you!\u201d said his wife. \u201cNo candles!\u201d repeated Mr Kernan obdurately. \u201cThat\u2019s off!\u201d The transept of the Jesuit Church in Gardiner Street was almost full; and still at every moment gentlemen entered from the side door and, directed by the lay-brother, walked on tiptoe along the aisles until they found seating accommodation. The gentlemen were all well dressed and orderly. The light of the lamps of the church fell upon an assembly of black clothes and white collars, relieved here and there by tweeds, on dark mottled pillars of green marble and on lugubrious canvases."], "In what month does \u201cThe Dead\u201d take place?": [" However, when she drew near the limit and her friends began to loosen their tongues about her, she silenced them by marrying Mr Kearney, who was a bootmaker on Ormond Quay. He was much older than she. His conversation, which was serious, took place at intervals in his great brown beard. After the first year of married life, Mrs Kearney perceived that such a man would wear better than a romantic person, but she never put her own romantic ideas away. He was sober, thrifty and pious; he went to the altar every first Friday, sometimes with her, oftener by himself. But she never weakened in her religion and was a good wife to him. At some party in a strange house when she lifted her eyebrow ever so slightly he stood up to take his leave and, when his cough troubled him, she put the eider-down quilt over his feet and made a strong rum punch. For his part, he was a model father. By paying a small sum every week into a society, he ensured for both his daughters a dowry of one hundred pounds each when they came to the age of twenty-four. He sent the elder daughter, Kathleen, to a good convent, where she learned French and music, and afterward paid her fees at the Academy. Every year in the month of July Mrs Kearney found occasion to say to some friend: \u201cMy good man is packing us off to Skerries for a few weeks.\u201d If it was not Skerries it was Howth or Greystones. When the Irish Revival began to be appreciable Mrs Kearney determined to take advantage of her daughter\u2019s name and brought an Irish teacher to the house.", " Anxiety and his swift run made him pant. He called out: \u201cHallo, Corley!\u201d Corley turned his head to see who had called him, and then continued walking as before. Lenehan ran after him, settling the waterproof on his shoulders with one hand. \u201cHallo, Corley!\u201d he cried again. He came level with his friend and looked keenly in his face. He could see nothing there. \u201cWell?\u201d he said. \u201cDid it come off?\u201d They had reached the corner of Ely Place. Still without answering, Corley swerved to the left and went up the side street. His features were composed in stern calm. Lenehan kept up with his friend, breathing uneasily. He was baffled and a note of menace pierced through his voice. \u201cCan\u2019t you tell us?\u201d he said. \u201cDid you try her?\u201d Corley halted at the first lamp and stared grimly before him. Then with a grave gesture he extended a hand towards the light and, smiling, opened it slowly to the gaze of his disciple. A small gold coin shone in the palm. THE BOARDING HOUSE Mrs Mooney was a butcher\u2019s daughter. She was a woman who was quite able to keep things to herself: a determined woman. She had married her father\u2019s foreman and opened a butcher\u2019s shop near Spring Gardens. But as soon as his father-in-law was dead Mr Mooney began to go to the devil. He drank, plundered the till, ran headlong into debt. It was no use making him take the pledge: he was sure to break out again a few days after. By fighting his wife in the presence of customers and by buying bad meat he ruined his business.", " \u201cSit down, Joe,\u201d said Mr O\u2019Connor, \u201cwe\u2019re just talking about the Chief.\u201d \u201cAy, ay!\u201d said Mr Henchy. Mr Hynes sat on the side of the table near Mr Lyons but said nothing. \u201cThere\u2019s one of them, anyhow,\u201d said Mr Henchy, \u201cthat didn\u2019t renege him. By God, I\u2019ll say for you, Joe! No, by God, you stuck to him like a man!\u201d \u201cO, Joe,\u201d said Mr O\u2019Connor suddenly. \u201cGive us that thing you wrote\u2014do you remember? Have you got it on you?\u201d \u201cO, ay!\u201d said Mr Henchy. \u201cGive us that. Did you ever hear that, Crofton? Listen to this now: splendid thing.\u201d \u201cGo on,\u201d said Mr O\u2019Connor. \u201cFire away, Joe.\u201d Mr Hynes did not seem to remember at once the piece to which they were alluding but, after reflecting a while, he said: \u201cO, that thing is it.... Sure, that\u2019s old now.\u201d \u201cOut with it, man!\u201d said Mr O\u2019Connor. \u201c\u2019Sh, \u2019sh,\u201d said Mr Henchy. \u201cNow, Joe!\u201d Mr Hynes hesitated a little longer. Then amid the silence he took off his hat, laid it on the table and stood up. He seemed to be rehearsing the piece in his mind. After a rather long pause he announced: THE DEATH OF PARNELL 6_th October_ 1891 He cleared his throat once or twice and then began to recite: He is dead. Our Uncrowned King is dead. O, Erin, mourn with grief and woe For he lies dead whom the fell gang Of modern hypocrites laid low. He lies slain by the coward hounds He raised to glory from the mire; And Erin\u2019s hopes and Erin\u2019s dreams Perish upon her monarch\u2019s pyre.", " \u201cPerhaps that was why you wanted to go to Galway with that Ivors girl?\u201d he said coldly. She looked at him and asked in surprise: \u201cWhat for?\u201d Her eyes made Gabriel feel awkward. He shrugged his shoulders and said: \u201cHow do I know? To see him, perhaps.\u201d She looked away from him along the shaft of light towards the window in silence. \u201cHe is dead,\u201d she said at length. \u201cHe died when he was only seventeen. Isn\u2019t it a terrible thing to die so young as that?\u201d \u201cWhat was he?\u201d asked Gabriel, still ironically. \u201cHe was in the gasworks,\u201d she said. Gabriel felt humiliated by the failure of his irony and by the evocation of this figure from the dead, a boy in the gasworks. While he had been full of memories of their secret life together, full of tenderness and joy and desire, she had been comparing him in her mind with another. A shameful consciousness of his own person assailed him. He saw himself as a ludicrous figure, acting as a pennyboy for his aunts, a nervous, well-meaning sentimentalist, orating to vulgarians and idealising his own clownish lusts, the pitiable fatuous fellow he had caught a glimpse of in the mirror. Instinctively he turned his back more to the light lest she might see the shame that burned upon his forehead. He tried to keep up his tone of cold interrogation, but his voice when he spoke was humble and indifferent. \u201cI suppose you were in love with this Michael Furey, Gretta,\u201d he said."], "What does Gretta tease Gabriel about, to his annoyance?": [" The smile soon faded from Aunt Julia\u2019s face and her mirthless eyes were directed towards her nephew\u2019s face. After a pause she asked: \u201cAnd what are goloshes, Gabriel?\u201d \u201cGoloshes, Julia!\u201d exclaimed her sister \u201cGoodness me, don\u2019t you know what goloshes are? You wear them over your ... over your boots, Gretta, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Mrs Conroy. \u201cGuttapercha things. We both have a pair now. Gabriel says everyone wears them on the continent.\u201d \u201cO, on the continent,\u201d murmured Aunt Julia, nodding her head slowly. Gabriel knitted his brows and said, as if he were slightly angered: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing very wonderful but Gretta thinks it very funny because she says the word reminds her of Christy Minstrels.\u201d \u201cBut tell me, Gabriel,\u201d said Aunt Kate, with brisk tact. \u201cOf course, you\u2019ve seen about the room. Gretta was saying....\u201d \u201cO, the room is all right,\u201d replied Gabriel. \u201cI\u2019ve taken one in the Gresham.\u201d \u201cTo be sure,\u201d said Aunt Kate, \u201cby far the best thing to do. And the children, Gretta, you\u2019re not anxious about them?\u201d \u201cO, for one night,\u201d said Mrs Conroy. \u201cBesides, Bessie will look after them.\u201d \u201cTo be sure,\u201d said Aunt Kate again. \u201cWhat a comfort it is to have a girl like that, one you can depend on! There\u2019s that Lily, I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know what has come over her lately. She\u2019s not the girl she was at all.\u201d Gabriel was about to ask his aunt some questions on this point but she broke off suddenly to gaze after her sister who had wandered down the stairs and was craning her neck over the banisters.", " \u201cGretta tells me you\u2019re not going to take a cab back to Monkstown tonight, Gabriel,\u201d said Aunt Kate. \u201cNo,\u201d said Gabriel, turning to his wife, \u201cwe had quite enough of that last year, hadn\u2019t we? Don\u2019t you remember, Aunt Kate, what a cold Gretta got out of it? Cab windows rattling all the way, and the east wind blowing in after we passed Merrion. Very jolly it was. Gretta caught a dreadful cold.\u201d Aunt Kate frowned severely and nodded her head at every word. \u201cQuite right, Gabriel, quite right,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t be too careful.\u201d \u201cBut as for Gretta there,\u201d said Gabriel, \u201cshe\u2019d walk home in the snow if she were let.\u201d Mrs Conroy laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t mind him, Aunt Kate,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s really an awful bother, what with green shades for Tom\u2019s eyes at night and making him do the dumb-bells, and forcing Eva to eat the stirabout. The poor child! And she simply hates the sight of it!... O, but you\u2019ll never guess what he makes me wear now!\u201d She broke out into a peal of laughter and glanced at her husband, whose admiring and happy eyes had been wandering from her dress to her face and hair. The two aunts laughed heartily too, for Gabriel\u2019s solicitude was a standing joke with them. \u201cGoloshes!\u201d said Mrs Conroy. \u201cThat\u2019s the latest. Whenever it\u2019s wet underfoot I must put on my goloshes. Tonight even he wanted me to put them on, but I wouldn\u2019t. The next thing he\u2019ll buy me will be a diving suit.\u201d Gabriel laughed nervously and patted his tie reassuringly while Aunt Kate nearly doubled herself, so heartily did she enjoy the joke.", " No, it was not the moment yet. \u201cYou looked tired,\u201d he said. \u201cI am a little,\u201d she answered. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel ill or weak?\u201d \u201cNo, tired: that\u2019s all.\u201d She went on to the window and stood there, looking out. Gabriel waited again and then, fearing that diffidence was about to conquer him, he said abruptly: \u201cBy the way, Gretta!\u201d \u201cWhat is it?\u201d \u201cYou know that poor fellow Malins?\u201d he said quickly. \u201cYes. What about him?\u201d \u201cWell, poor fellow, he\u2019s a decent sort of chap after all,\u201d continued Gabriel in a false voice. \u201cHe gave me back that sovereign I lent him, and I didn\u2019t expect it, really. It\u2019s a pity he wouldn\u2019t keep away from that Browne, because he\u2019s not a bad fellow, really.\u201d He was trembling now with annoyance. Why did she seem so abstracted? He did not know how he could begin. Was she annoyed, too, about something? If she would only turn to him or come to him of her own accord! To take her as she was would be brutal. No, he must see some ardour in her eyes first. He longed to be master of her strange mood. \u201cWhen did you lend him the pound?\u201d she asked, after a pause. Gabriel strove to restrain himself from breaking out into brutal language about the sottish Malins and his pound. He longed to cry to her from his soul, to crush her body against his, to overmaster her. But he said: \u201cO, at Christmas, when he opened that little Christmas-card shop in Henry Street.\u201d He was in such a fever of rage and desire that he did not hear her come from the window.", " They halted too on the steps below him. In the silence Gabriel could hear the falling of the molten wax into the tray and the thumping of his own heart against his ribs. The porter led them along a corridor and opened a door. Then he set his unstable candle down on a toilet-table and asked at what hour they were to be called in the morning. \u201cEight,\u201d said Gabriel. The porter pointed to the tap of the electric-light and began a muttered apology but Gabriel cut him short. \u201cWe don\u2019t want any light. We have light enough from the street. And I say,\u201d he added, pointing to the candle, \u201cyou might remove that handsome article, like a good man.\u201d The porter took up his candle again, but slowly for he was surprised by such a novel idea. Then he mumbled good-night and went out. Gabriel shot the lock to. A ghostly light from the street lamp lay in a long shaft from one window to the door. Gabriel threw his overcoat and hat on a couch and crossed the room towards the window. He looked down into the street in order that his emotion might calm a little. Then he turned and leaned against a chest of drawers with his back to the light. She had taken off her hat and cloak and was standing before a large swinging mirror, unhooking her waist. Gabriel paused for a few moments, watching her, and then said: \u201cGretta!\u201d She turned away from the mirror slowly and walked along the shaft of light towards him. Her face looked so serious and weary that the words would not pass Gabriel\u2019s lips."], "Where does Miss Ivors invite Gabriel to visit during the summer?": [" \u201cAnd haven\u2019t you your own land to visit,\u201d continued Miss Ivors, \u201cthat you know nothing of, your own people, and your own country?\u201d \u201cO, to tell you the truth,\u201d retorted Gabriel suddenly, \u201cI\u2019m sick of my own country, sick of it!\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d asked Miss Ivors. Gabriel did not answer for his retort had heated him. \u201cWhy?\u201d repeated Miss Ivors. They had to go visiting together and, as he had not answered her, Miss Ivors said warmly: \u201cOf course, you\u2019ve no answer.\u201d Gabriel tried to cover his agitation by taking part in the dance with great energy. He avoided her eyes for he had seen a sour expression on her face. But when they met in the long chain he was surprised to feel his hand firmly pressed. She looked at him from under her brows for a moment quizzically until he smiled. Then, just as the chain was about to start again, she stood on tiptoe and whispered into his ear: \u201cWest Briton!\u201d When the lancers were over Gabriel went away to a remote corner of the room where Freddy Malins\u2019 mother was sitting. She was a stout feeble old woman with white hair. Her voice had a catch in it like her son\u2019s and she stuttered slightly. She had been told that Freddy had come and that he was nearly all right. Gabriel asked her whether she had had a good crossing. She lived with her married daughter in Glasgow and came to Dublin on a visit once a year. She answered placidly that she had had a beautiful crossing and that the captain had been most attentive to her.", " A friend of hers had shown her his review of Browning\u2019s poems. That was how she had found out the secret: but she liked the review immensely. Then she said suddenly: \u201cO, Mr Conroy, will you come for an excursion to the Aran Isles this summer? We\u2019re going to stay there a whole month. It will be splendid out in the Atlantic. You ought to come. Mr Clancy is coming, and Mr Kilkelly and Kathleen Kearney. It would be splendid for Gretta too if she\u2019d come. She\u2019s from Connacht, isn\u2019t she?\u201d \u201cHer people are,\u201d said Gabriel shortly. \u201cBut you will come, won\u2019t you?\u201d said Miss Ivors, laying her warm hand eagerly on his arm. \u201cThe fact is,\u201d said Gabriel, \u201cI have just arranged to go\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cGo where?\u201d asked Miss Ivors. \u201cWell, you know, every year I go for a cycling tour with some fellows and so\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cBut where?\u201d asked Miss Ivors. \u201cWell, we usually go to France or Belgium or perhaps Germany,\u201d said Gabriel awkwardly. \u201cAnd why do you go to France and Belgium,\u201d said Miss Ivors, \u201cinstead of visiting your own land?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Gabriel, \u201cit\u2019s partly to keep in touch with the languages and partly for a change.\u201d \u201cAnd haven\u2019t you your own language to keep in touch with\u2014Irish?\u201d asked Miss Ivors. \u201cWell,\u201d said Gabriel, \u201cif it comes to that, you know, Irish is not my language.\u201d Their neighbours had turned to listen to the cross-examination. Gabriel glanced right and left nervously and tried to keep his good humour under the ordeal which was making a blush invade his forehead.", " But Miss Ivors, who had put on her hat and was buttoning her cloak, would not stay. She did not feel in the least hungry and she had already overstayed her time. \u201cBut only for ten minutes, Molly,\u201d said Mrs Conroy. \u201cThat won\u2019t delay you.\u201d \u201cTo take a pick itself,\u201d said Mary Jane, \u201cafter all your dancing.\u201d \u201cI really couldn\u2019t,\u201d said Miss Ivors. \u201cI am afraid you didn\u2019t enjoy yourself at all,\u201d said Mary Jane hopelessly. \u201cEver so much, I assure you,\u201d said Miss Ivors, \u201cbut you really must let me run off now.\u201d \u201cBut how can you get home?\u201d asked Mrs Conroy. \u201cO, it\u2019s only two steps up the quay.\u201d Gabriel hesitated a moment and said: \u201cIf you will allow me, Miss Ivors, I\u2019ll see you home if you are really obliged to go.\u201d But Miss Ivors broke away from them. \u201cI won\u2019t hear of it,\u201d she cried. \u201cFor goodness\u2019 sake go in to your suppers and don\u2019t mind me.

Mary Jane gazed after her, a moody puzzled expression on her face, while Mrs Conroy leaned over the banisters to listen for the hall-door. Gabriel asked himself was he the cause of her abrupt departure. But she did not seem to be in ill humour: she had gone away laughing. He stared blankly down the staircase. At the moment Aunt Kate came toddling out of the supper-room, almost wringing her hands in despair.", " She spoke also of the beautiful house her daughter kept in Glasgow, and of all the friends they had there.

Of course the girl or woman, or whatever she was, was an enthusiast but there was a time for all things. Perhaps he ought not to have answered her like that.

Her face looked so serious and weary that the words would not pass Gabriel\u2019s lips.", " The latter, a young man of about forty, was of Gabriel\u2019s size and build, with very round shoulders. His face was fleshy and pallid, touched with colour only at the thick hanging lobes of his ears and at the wide wings of his nose. He had coarse features, a blunt nose, a convex and receding brow, tumid and protruded lips. His heavy-lidded eyes and the disorder of his scanty hair made him look sleepy. He was laughing heartily in a high key at a story which he had been telling Gabriel on the stairs and at the same time rubbing the knuckles of his left fist backwards and forwards into his left eye. \u201cGood-evening, Freddy,\u201d said Aunt Julia. Freddy Malins bade the Misses Morkan good-evening in what seemed an offhand fashion by reason of the habitual catch in his voice and then, seeing that Mr Browne was grinning at him from the sideboard, crossed the room on rather shaky legs and began to repeat in an undertone the story he had just told to Gabriel. \u201cHe\u2019s not so bad, is he?\u201d said Aunt Kate to Gabriel. Gabriel\u2019s brows were dark but he raised them quickly and answered: \u201cO, no, hardly noticeable.\u201d \u201cNow, isn\u2019t he a terrible fellow!\u201d she said. \u201cAnd his poor mother made him take the pledge on New Year\u2019s Eve. But come on, Gabriel, into the drawing-room.\u201d Before leaving the room with Gabriel she signalled to Mr Browne by frowning and shaking her forefinger in warning to and fro. Mr Browne nodded in answer and, when she had gone, said to Freddy Malins: \u201cNow, then, Teddy, I\u2019m going to fill you out a good glass of lemonade just to buck you up.\u201d Freddy Malins, who was nearing the climax of his story, waved the offer aside impatiently but Mr Browne, having first called Freddy Malins\u2019 attention to a disarray in his dress, filled out and handed him a full glass of lemonade."], "Who is Michael Furey?": [" She was fast asleep. Gabriel, leaning on his elbow, looked for a few moments unresentfully on her tangled hair and half-open mouth, listening to her deep-drawn breath. So she had had that romance in her life: a man had died for her sake. It hardly pained him now to think how poor a part he, her husband, had played in her life. He watched her while she slept as though he and she had never lived together as man and wife. His curious eyes rested long upon her face and on her hair: and, as he thought of what she must have been then, in that time of her first girlish beauty, a strange, friendly pity for her entered his soul. He did not like to say even to himself that her face was no longer beautiful but he knew that it was no longer the face for which Michael Furey had braved death. Perhaps she had not told him all the story. His eyes moved to the chair over which she had thrown some of her clothes. A petticoat string dangled to the floor. One boot stood upright, its limp upper fallen down: the fellow of it lay upon its side. He wondered at his riot of emotions of an hour before. From what had it proceeded? From his aunt\u2019s supper, from his own foolish speech, from the wine and dancing, the merry-making when saying good-night in the hall, the pleasure of the walk along the river in the snow. Poor Aunt Julia! She, too, would soon be a shade with the shade of Patrick Morkan and his horse.", " \u201cPerhaps that was why you wanted to go to Galway with that Ivors girl?\u201d he said coldly. She looked at him and asked in surprise: \u201cWhat for?\u201d Her eyes made Gabriel feel awkward. He shrugged his shoulders and said: \u201cHow do I know? To see him, perhaps.\u201d She looked away from him along the shaft of light towards the window in silence. \u201cHe is dead,\u201d she said at length. \u201cHe died when he was only seventeen. Isn\u2019t it a terrible thing to die so young as that?\u201d \u201cWhat was he?\u201d asked Gabriel, still ironically. \u201cHe was in the gasworks,\u201d she said. Gabriel felt humiliated by the failure of his irony and by the evocation of this figure from the dead, a boy in the gasworks. While he had been full of memories of their secret life together, full of tenderness and joy and desire, she had been comparing him in her mind with another. A shameful consciousness of his own person assailed him. He saw himself as a ludicrous figure, acting as a pennyboy for his aunts, a nervous, well-meaning sentimentalist, orating to vulgarians and idealising his own clownish lusts, the pitiable fatuous fellow he had caught a glimpse of in the mirror. Instinctively he turned his back more to the light lest she might see the shame that burned upon his forehead. He tried to keep up his tone of cold interrogation, but his voice when he spoke was humble and indifferent. \u201cI suppose you were in love with this Michael Furey, Gretta,\u201d he said.", " He was going to study singing only for his health. He had a very good voice, poor Michael Furey.\u201d \u201cWell; and then?\u201d asked Gabriel. \u201cAnd then when it came to the time for me to leave Galway and come up to the convent he was much worse and I wouldn\u2019t be let see him so I wrote him a letter saying I was going up to Dublin and would be back in the summer and hoping he would be better then.\u201d She paused for a moment to get her voice under control and then went on: \u201cThen the night before I left I was in my grandmother\u2019s house in Nuns\u2019 Island, packing up, and I heard gravel thrown up against the window. The window was so wet I couldn\u2019t see so I ran downstairs as I was and slipped out the back into the garden and there was the poor fellow at the end of the garden, shivering.\u201d \u201cAnd did you not tell him to go back?\u201d asked Gabriel. \u201cI implored of him to go home at once and told him he would get his death in the rain. But he said he did not want to live. I can see his eyes as well as well! He was standing at the end of the wall where there was a tree.\u201d \u201cAnd did he go home?\u201d asked Gabriel. \u201cYes, he went home. And when I was only a week in the convent he died and he was buried in Oughterard where his people came from. O, the day I heard that, that he was dead!\u201d She stopped, choking with sobs and, overcome by emotion, flung herself face downward on the bed, sobbing in the quilt. Gabriel held her hand for a moment longer, irresolutely, and then, shy of intruding on her grief, let it fall gently and walked quietly to the window.", " As he passed in the way of the cheval-glass he caught sight of himself in full length, his broad, well-filled shirt-front, the face whose expression always puzzled him when he saw it in a mirror and his glimmering gilt-rimmed eyeglasses. He halted a few paces from her and said: \u201cWhat about the song? Why does that make you cry?\u201d She raised her head from her arms and dried her eyes with the back of her hand like a child. A kinder note than he had intended went into his voice. \u201cWhy, Gretta?\u201d he asked. \u201cI am thinking about a person long ago who used to sing that song.\u201d \u201cAnd who was the person long ago?\u201d asked Gabriel, smiling. \u201cIt was a person I used to know in Galway when I was living with my grandmother,\u201d she said. The smile passed away from Gabriel\u2019s face. A dull anger began to gather again at the back of his mind and the dull fires of his lust began to glow angrily in his veins. \u201cSomeone you were in love with?\u201d he asked ironically. \u201cIt was a young boy I used to know,\u201d she answered, \u201cnamed Michael Furey. He used to sing that song, _The Lass of Aughrim_. He was very delicate.\u201d Gabriel was silent. He did not wish her to think that he was interested in this delicate boy. \u201cI can see him so plainly,\u201d she said after a moment. \u201cSuch eyes as he had: big, dark eyes! And such an expression in them\u2014an expression!\u201d \u201cO then, you were in love with him?\u201d said Gabriel. \u201cI used to go out walking with him,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen I was in Galway.\u201d A thought flew across Gabriel\u2019s mind."]}
