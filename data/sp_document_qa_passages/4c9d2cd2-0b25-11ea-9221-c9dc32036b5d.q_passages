{"Who is the Knightof the White Moon?": [" The viceroy upon this, seeing that the pair of them were evidently preparing to come to the charge, put himself between them, asking them what it was that led them to engage in combat all of a sudden in this way. The Knight of the White Moon replied that it was a question of precedence of beauty; and briefly told him what he had said to Don Quixote, and how the conditions of the defiance agreed upon on both sides had been accepted. The viceroy went over to Don Antonio, and asked in a low voice did he know who the Knight of the White Moon was, or was it some joke they were playing on Don Quixote. Don Antonio replied that he neither knew who he was nor whether the defiance was in joke or in earnest. This answer left the viceroy in a state of perplexity, not knowing whether he ought to let the combat go on or not; but unable to persuade himself that it was anything but a joke he fell back, saying, \u201cIf there be no other way out of it, gallant knights, except to confess or die, and Don Quixote is inflexible, and your worship of the White Moon still more so, in God\u2019s hand be it, and fall on.\u201d He of the White Moon thanked the viceroy in courteous and well-chosen words for the permission he gave them, and so did Don Quixote, who then, commending himself with all his heart to heaven and to his Dulcinea, as was his custom on the eve of any combat that awaited him, proceeded to take a little more distance, as he saw his antagonist was doing the same; then, without blast of trumpet or other warlike instrument to give them the signal to charge, both at the same instant wheeled their horses; and he of the White Moon, being the swifter, met Don Quixote after having traversed two-thirds of the course, and there encountered him with such violence that, without touching him with his lance (for he held it high, to all appearance purposely), he hurled Don Quixote and Rocinante to the earth, a perilous fall.", " Consider which will be thy best course, and give me thy answer speedily, for this day is all the time I have for the despatch of this business.\u201d Don Quixote was amazed and astonished, as well at the Knight of the White Moon\u2019s arrogance, as at his reason for delivering the defiance, and with calm dignity he answered him, \u201cKnight of the White Moon, of whose achievements I have never heard until now, I will venture to swear you have never seen the illustrious Dulcinea; for had you seen her I know you would have taken care not to venture yourself upon this issue, because the sight would have removed all doubt from your mind that there ever has been or can be a beauty to be compared with hers; and so, not saying you lie, but merely that you are not correct in what you state, I accept your challenge, with the conditions you have proposed, and at once, that the day you have fixed may not expire; and from your conditions I except only that of the renown of your achievements being transferred to me, for I know not of what sort they are nor what they may amount to; I am satisfied with my own, such as they be. Take, therefore, the side of the field you choose, and I will do the same; and to whom God shall give it may Saint Peter add his blessing.\u201d The Knight of the White Moon had been seen from the city, and it was told the viceroy how he was in conversation with Don Quixote. The viceroy, fancying it must be some fresh adventure got up by Don Antonio Moreno or some other gentleman of the city, hurried out at once to the beach accompanied by Don Antonio and several other gentlemen, just as Don Quixote was wheeling Rocinante round in order to take up the necessary distance.", " p64b.jpg (344K) Full Size Rocinante from the mere hard measure he had received lay unable to stir for the present. Sancho, wholly dejected and woebegone, knew not what to say or do. He fancied that all was a dream, that the whole business was a piece of enchantment. Here was his master defeated, and bound not to take up arms for a year. He saw the light of the glory of his achievements obscured; the hopes of the promises lately made him swept away like smoke before the wind; Rocinante, he feared, was crippled for life, and his master\u2019s bones out of joint; for if he were only shaken out of his madness it would be no small luck. In the end they carried him into the city in a hand-chair which the viceroy sent for, and thither the viceroy himself returned, eager to ascertain who this Knight of the White Moon was who had left Don Quixote in such a sad plight. p64e.jpg (44K) Full Size CHAPTER LXV. WHEREIN IS MADE KNOWN WHO THE KNIGHT OF THE WHITE MOON WAS; LIKEWISE DON GREGORIO\u2019S RELEASE, AND OTHER EVENTS p65a.jpg (149K) Full Size Don Antonio Moreno followed the Knight of the White Moon, and a number of boys followed him too, nay pursued him, until they had him fairly housed in a hostel in the heart of the city. Don Antonio, eager to make his acquaintance, entered also; a squire came out to meet him and remove his armour, and he shut himself into a lower room, still attended by Don Antonio, whose bread would not bake until he had found out who he was.", " He sprang upon him at once, and placing the lance over his visor said to him, \u201cYou are vanquished, sir knight, nay dead unless you admit the conditions of our defiance.\u201d Don Quixote, bruised and stupefied, without raising his visor said in a weak feeble voice as if he were speaking out of a tomb, \u201cDulcinea del Toboso is the fairest woman in the world, and I the most unfortunate knight on earth; it is not fitting that this truth should suffer by my feebleness; drive your lance home, sir knight, and take my life, since you have taken away my honour.\u201d \u201cThat will I not, in sooth,\u201d said he of the White Moon; \u201clive the fame of the lady Dulcinea\u2019s beauty undimmed as ever; all I require is that the great Don Quixote retire to his own home for a year, or for so long a time as shall by me be enjoined upon him, as we agreed before engaging in this combat.\u201d The viceroy, Don Antonio, and several others who were present heard all this, and heard too how Don Quixote replied that so long as nothing in prejudice of Dulcinea was demanded of him, he would observe all the rest like a true and loyal knight. The engagement given, he of the White Moon wheeled about, and making obeisance to the viceroy with a movement of the head, rode away into the city at a half gallop. The viceroy bade Don Antonio hasten after him, and by some means or other find out who he was. They raised Don Quixote up and uncovered his face, and found him pale and bathed with sweat."], "How many expeditionsdoes Don Quixote make without Sancho Panza?": [" Sancho was the first to come to, and finding himself close to his master he called to him in a weak and doleful voice, \u201cSe\u00f1or Don Quixote, ah, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote!\u201d \u201cWhat wouldst thou, brother Sancho?\u201d answered Don Quixote in the same feeble suffering tone as Sancho. \u201cI would like, if it were possible,\u201d answered Sancho Panza, \u201cyour worship to give me a couple of sups of that potion of the fiery Blas, if it be that you have any to hand there; perhaps it will serve for broken bones as well as for wounds.\u201d \u201cIf I only had it here, wretch that I am, what more should we want?\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cbut I swear to thee, Sancho Panza, on the faith of a knight-errant, ere two days are over, unless fortune orders otherwise, I mean to have it in my possession, or my hand will have lost its cunning.\u201d \u201cBut in how many does your worship think we shall have the use of our feet?\u201d answered Sancho Panza. \u201cFor myself I must say I cannot guess how many,\u201d said the battered knight Don Quixote; \u201cbut I take all the blame upon myself, for I had no business to put hand to sword against men who where not dubbed knights like myself, and so I believe that in punishment for having transgressed the laws of chivalry the God of battles has permitted this chastisement to be administered to me; for which reason, brother Sancho, it is well thou shouldst receive a hint on the matter which I am now about to mention to thee, for it is of much importance to the welfare of both of us.", " \u201cWho should it be,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cbut Don Quixote of La Mancha himself, who will make good all he has said and all he will say; for pledges don\u2019t trouble a good payer.\u201d Sancho had hardly uttered these words when two gentlemen, for such they seemed to be, entered the room, and one of them, throwing his arms round Don Quixote\u2019s neck, said to him, \u201cYour appearance cannot leave any question as to your name, nor can your name fail to identify your appearance; unquestionably, se\u00f1or, you are the real Don Quixote of La Mancha, cynosure and morning star of knight-errantry, despite and in defiance of him who has sought to usurp your name and bring to naught your achievements, as the author of this book which I here present to you has done;\u201d and with this he put a book which his companion carried into the hands of Don Quixote, who took it, and without replying began to run his eye over it; but he presently returned it saying, \u201cIn the little I have seen I have discovered three things in this author that deserve to be censured. The first is some words that I have read in the preface; the next that the language is Aragonese, for sometimes he writes without articles; and the third, which above all stamps him as ignorant, is that he goes wrong and departs from the truth in the most important part of the history, for here he says that my squire Sancho Panza\u2019s wife is called Mari Gutierrez, when she is called nothing of the sort, but Teresa Panza; and when a man errs on such an important point as this there is good reason to fear that he is in error on every other point in the history.\u201d \u201cA nice sort of historian, indeed!\u201d exclaimed Sancho at this; \u201che must know a deal about our affairs when he calls my wife Teresa Panza, Mari Gutierrez; take the book again, se\u00f1or, and see if I am in it and if he has changed my name.\u201d \u201cFrom your talk, friend,\u201d said Don Jeronimo, \u201cno doubt you are Sancho Panza, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote\u2019s squire.\u201d \u201cYes, I am,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cand I\u2019m proud of it.\u201d \u201cFaith, then,\u201d said the gentleman, \u201cthis new author does not handle you with the decency that displays itself in your person; he makes you out a heavy feeder and a fool, and not in the least droll, and a very different being from the Sancho described in the First Part of your master\u2019s history.\u201d \u201cGod forgive him,\u201d said Sancho; \u201che might have left me in my corner without troubling his head about me; \u2018let him who knows how ring the bells; \u2018Saint Peter is very well in Rome.\u2019\u201d The two gentlemen pressed Don Quixote to come into their room and have supper with them, as they knew very well there was nothing in that inn fit for one of his sort.", " It was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and projections, and that each of them had left its mark. \u201cPray, se\u00f1ora,\u201d he added, \u201cmanage to save some tow, as there will be no want of someone to use it, for my loins too are rather sore.\u201d \u201cThen you must have fallen too,\u201d said the hostess. \u201cI did not fall,\u201d said Sancho Panza, \u201cbut from the shock I got at seeing my master fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a thousand thwacks.\u201d \u201cThat may well be,\u201d said the young girl, \u201cfor it has many a time happened to me to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never coming to the ground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as weak and shaken as if I had really fallen.\u201d \u201cThere is the point, se\u00f1ora,\u201d replied Sancho Panza, \u201cthat I without dreaming at all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with scarcely less wheals than my master, Don Quixote.\u201d \u201cHow is the gentleman called?\u201d asked Maritornes the Asturian. \u201cDon Quixote of La Mancha,\u201d answered Sancho Panza, \u201cand he is a knight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen in the world this long time past.\u201d \u201cWhat is a knight-adventurer?\u201d said the lass. \u201cAre you so new in the world as not to know?\u201d answered Sancho Panza. \u201cWell, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing that in two words is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most miserable and needy being in the world, and to-morrow will have two or three crowns of kingdoms to give his squire.\u201d \u201cThen how is it,\u201d said the hostess, \u201cthat belonging to so good a master as this, you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a county?\u201d \u201cIt is too soon yet,\u201d answered Sancho, \u201cfor we have only been a month going in quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that can be called one, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for another thing is found; however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of this wound, or fall, and I am left none the worse of it, I would not change my hopes for the best title in Spain.\u201d To all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively, and sitting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by the hand he said to her, \u201cBelieve me, fair lady, you may call yourself fortunate in having in this castle of yours sheltered my person, which is such that if I do not myself praise it, it is because of what is commonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will inform you who I am.", " \u201cNay, nay,\u201d said the barber, \u201cif you don\u2019t tell us where he is, Sancho Panza, we will suspect as we suspect already, that you have murdered and robbed him, for here you are mounted on his horse; in fact, you must produce the master of the hack, or else take the consequences.\u201d \u201cThere is no need of threats with me,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cfor I am not a man to rob or murder anybody; let his own fate, or God who made him, kill each one; my master is engaged very much to his taste doing penance in the midst of these mountains;\u201d and then, offhand and without stopping, he told them how he had left him, what adventures had befallen him, and how he was carrying a letter to the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, the daughter of Lorenzo Corchuelo, with whom he was over head and ears in love. They were both amazed at what Sancho Panza told them; for though they were aware of Don Quixote\u2019s madness and the nature of it, each time they heard of it they were filled with fresh wonder. They then asked Sancho Panza to show them the letter he was carrying to the lady Dulcinea del Toboso. He said it was written in a notebook, and that his master\u2019s directions were that he should have it copied on paper at the first village he came to. On this the curate said if he showed it to him, he himself would make a fair copy of it. Sancho put his hand into his bosom in search of the notebook but could not find it, nor, if he had been searching until now, could he have found it, for Don Quixote had kept it, and had never given it to him, nor had he himself thought of asking for it."], "Why does Don Quixotereturn home in a cage after his second expedition?": [" It is to be observed, that on coming to this passage, the author of this veracious history breaks out into exclamations. \u201cO doughty Don Quixote! high-mettled past extolling! Mirror, wherein all the heroes of the world may see themselves! Second modern Don Manuel de Leon, once the glory and honour of Spanish knighthood! In what words shall I describe this dread exploit, by what language shall I make it credible to ages to come, what eulogies are there unmeet for thee, though they be hyperboles piled on hyperboles! On foot, alone, undaunted, high-souled, with but a simple sword, and that no trenchant blade of the Perrillo brand, a shield, but no bright polished steel one, there stoodst thou, biding and awaiting the two fiercest lions that Africa\u2019s forests ever bred! Thy own deeds be thy praise, valiant Manchegan, and here I leave them as they stand, wanting the words wherewith to glorify them!\u201d p17b.jpg (352K) Full Size Here the author\u2019s outburst came to an end, and he proceeded to take up the thread of his story, saying that the keeper, seeing that Don Quixote had taken up his position, and that it was impossible for him to avoid letting out the male without incurring the enmity of the fiery and daring knight, flung open the doors of the first cage, containing, as has been said, the lion, which was now seen to be of enormous size, and grim and hideous mien. The first thing he did was to turn round in the cage in which he lay, and protrude his claws, and stretch himself thoroughly; he next opened his mouth, and yawned very leisurely, and with near two palms\u2019 length of tongue that he had thrust forth, he licked the dust out of his eyes and washed his face; having done this, he put his head out of the cage and looked all round with eyes like glowing coals, a spectacle and demeanour to strike terror into temerity itself.", " Approaching a cage in which there was a furious madman, though just at that moment calm and quiet, the licentiate said to him, \u2018Brother, think if you have any commands for me, for I am going home, as God has been pleased, in his infinite goodness and mercy, without any merit of mine, to restore me my reason. I am now cured and in my senses, for with God\u2019s power nothing is impossible. Have strong hope and trust in him, for as he has restored me to my original condition, so likewise he will restore you if you trust in him. I will take care to send you some good things to eat; and be sure you eat them; for I would have you know I am convinced, as one who has gone through it, that all this madness of ours comes of having the stomach empty and the brains full of wind. Take courage! take courage! for despondency in misfortune breaks down health and brings on death.\u2019 \u201cTo all these words of the licentiate another madman in a cage opposite that of the furious one was listening; and raising himself up from an old mat on which he lay stark naked, he asked in a loud voice who it was that was going away cured and in his senses. The licentiate answered, \u2018It is I, brother, who am going; I have now no need to remain here any longer, for which I return infinite thanks to Heaven that has had so great mercy upon me.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Mind what you are saying, licentiate; don\u2019t let the devil deceive you,\u2019 replied the madman.", " I know and feel that I am enchanted, and that is enough to ease my conscience; for it would weigh heavily on it if I thought that I was not enchanted, and that in a faint-hearted and cowardly way I allowed myself to lie in this cage, defrauding multitudes of the succour I might afford to those in need and distress, who at this very moment may be in sore want of my aid and protection.\u201d \u201cStill for all that,\u201d replied Sancho, \u201cI say that, for your greater and fuller satisfaction, it would be well if your worship were to try to get out of this prison (and I promise to do all in my power to help, and even to take you out of it), and see if you could once more mount your good Rocinante, who seems to be enchanted too, he is so melancholy and dejected; and then we might try our chance in looking for adventures again; and if we have no luck there will be time enough to go back to the cage; in which, on the faith of a good and loyal squire, I promise to shut myself up along with your worship, if so be you are so unfortunate, or I so stupid, as not to be able to carry out my plan.\u201d \u201cI am content to do as thou sayest, brother Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand when thou seest an opportunity for effecting my release I will obey thee absolutely; but thou wilt see, Sancho, how mistaken thou art in thy conception of my misfortune.\u201d The knight-errant and the ill-errant squire kept up their conversation till they reached the place where the curate, the canon, and the barber, who had already dismounted, were waiting for them.", " The carter at once unyoked the oxen and left them to roam at large about the pleasant green spot, the freshness of which seemed to invite, not enchanted people like Don Quixote, but wide-awake, sensible folk like his squire, who begged the curate to allow his master to leave the cage for a little; for if they did not let him out, the prison might not be as clean as the propriety of such a gentleman as his master required. The curate understood him, and said he would very gladly comply with his request, only that he feared his master, finding himself at liberty, would take to his old courses and make off where nobody could ever find him again. \u201cI will answer for his not running away,\u201d said Sancho. \u201cAnd I also,\u201d said the canon, \u201cespecially if he gives me his word as a knight not to leave us without our consent.\u201d Don Quixote, who was listening to all this, said, \u201cI give it;\u2014moreover one who is enchanted as I am cannot do as he likes with himself; for he who had enchanted him could prevent his moving from one place for three ages, and if he attempted to escape would bring him back flying.\u201d\u2014And that being so, they might as well release him, particularly as it would be to the advantage of all; for, if they did not let him out, he protested he would be unable to avoid offending their nostrils unless they kept their distance. The canon took his hand, tied together as they both were, and on his word and promise they unbound him, and rejoiced beyond measure he was to find himself out of the cage."], "Where does DonQuixote meet the enchanted Dulcinea for the second time, after meetingher once on the road to El Toboso?": [" \u201cMany,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cbut few they who deserve the name of knights.\u201d With these, and other discussions of the same sort, they passed that night and the following day, without anything worth mention happening to them, whereat Don Quixote was not a little dejected; but at length the next day, at daybreak, they descried the great city of El Toboso, at the sight of which Don Quixote\u2019s spirits rose and Sancho\u2019s fell, for he did not know Dulcinea\u2019s house, nor in all his life had he ever seen her, any more than his master; so that they were both uneasy, the one to see her, the other at not having seen her, and Sancho was at a loss to know what he was to do when his master sent him to El Toboso. In the end, Don Quixote made up his mind to enter the city at nightfall, and they waited until the time came among some oak trees that were near El Toboso; and when the moment they had agreed upon arrived, they made their entrance into the city, where something happened them that may fairly be called something. p08e.jpg (49K) Full Size CHAPTER IX.

The town was in deep silence, for all the inhabitants were asleep, and stretched on the broad of their backs, as the saying is. The night was darkish, though Sancho would have been glad had it been quite dark, so as to find in the darkness an excuse for his blundering.", " And it seems to me that, in governments, to make a beginning is everything; and maybe, after having been governor a fortnight, I\u2019ll take kindly to the work and know more about it than the field labour I have been brought up to.\u201d \u201cYou are right, Sancho,\u201d said the duchess, \u201cfor no one is born ready taught, and the bishops are made out of men and not out of stones. But to return to the subject we were discussing just now, the enchantment of the lady Dulcinea, I look upon it as certain, and something more than evident, that Sancho\u2019s idea of practising a deception upon his master, making him believe that the peasant girl was Dulcinea and that if he did not recognise her it must be because she was enchanted, was all a device of one of the enchanters that persecute Don Quixote. For in truth and earnest, I know from good authority that the coarse country wench who jumped up on the ass was and is Dulcinea del Toboso, and that worthy Sancho, though he fancies himself the deceiver, is the one that is deceived; and that there is no more reason to doubt the truth of this, than of anything else we never saw. Se\u00f1or Sancho Panza must know that we too have enchanters here that are well disposed to us, and tell us what goes on in the world, plainly and distinctly, without subterfuge or deception; and believe me, Sancho, that agile country lass was and is Dulcinea del Toboso, who is as much enchanted as the mother that bore her; and when we least expect it, we shall see her in her own proper form, and then Sancho will be disabused of the error he is under at present.\u201d \u201cAll that\u2019s very possible,\u201d said Sancho Panza; \u201cand now I\u2019m willing to believe what my master says about what he saw in the cave of Montesinos, where he says he saw the lady Dulcinea del Toboso in the very same dress and apparel that I said I had seen her in when I enchanted her all to please myself.", " But one thing, se\u00f1or, troubles me more than all the rest, and that is thinking what is to be done when your worship conquers some giant, or some other knight, and orders him to go and present himself before the beauty of the lady Dulcinea. Where is this poor giant, or this poor wretch of a vanquished knight, to find her? I think I can see them wandering all over El Toboso, looking like noddies, and asking for my lady Dulcinea; and even if they meet her in the middle of the street they won\u2019t know her any more than they would my father.\u201d \u201cPerhaps, Sancho,\u201d returned Don Quixote, \u201cthe enchantment does not go so far as to deprive conquered and presented giants and knights of the power of recognising Dulcinea; we will try by experiment with one or two of the first I vanquish and send to her, whether they see her or not, by commanding them to return and give me an account of what happened to them in this respect.\u201d \u201cI declare, I think what your worship has proposed is excellent,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cand that by this plan we shall find out what we want to know; and if it be that it is only from your worship she is hidden, the misfortune will be more yours than hers; but so long as the lady Dulcinea is well and happy, we on our part will make the best of it, and get on as well as we can, seeking our adventures, and leaving Time to take his own course; for he is the best physician for these and greater ailments.\u201d Don Quixote was about to reply to Sancho Panza, but he was prevented by a cart crossing the road full of the most diverse and strange personages and figures that could be imagined.", " Why, even if he wished it he has not had time to imagine and put together such a host of lies.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe my master lies,\u201d said Sancho. \u201cIf not, what dost thou believe?\u201d asked Don Quixote. \u201cI believe,\u201d replied Sancho, \u201cthat this Merlin, or those enchanters who enchanted the whole crew your worship says you saw and discoursed with down there, stuffed your imagination or your mind with all this rigmarole you have been treating us to, and all that is still to come.\u201d \u201cAll that might be, Sancho,\u201d replied Don Quixote; \u201cbut it is not so, for everything that I have told you I saw with my own eyes, and touched with my own hands. But what will you say when I tell you now how, among the countless other marvellous things Montesinos showed me (of which at leisure and at the proper time I will give thee an account in the course of our journey, for they would not be all in place here), he showed me three country girls who went skipping and capering like goats over the pleasant fields there, and the instant I beheld them I knew one to be the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, and the other two those same country girls that were with her and that we spoke to on the road from El Toboso! I asked Montesinos if he knew them, and he told me he did not, but he thought they must be some enchanted ladies of distinction, for it was only a few days before that they had made their appearance in those meadows; but I was not to be surprised at that, because there were a great many other ladies there of times past and present, enchanted in various strange shapes, and among them he had recognised Queen Guinevere and her dame Quinta\u00f1ona, she who poured out the wine for Lancelot when he came from Britain.\u201d When Sancho Panza heard his master say this he was ready to take leave of his senses, or die with laughter; for, as he knew the real truth about the pretended enchantment of Dulcinea, in which he himself had been the enchanter and concocter of all the evidence, he made up his mind at last that, beyond all doubt, his master was out of his wits and stark mad, so he said to him, \u201cIt was an evil hour, a worse season, and a sorrowful day, when your worship, dear master mine, went down to the other world, and an unlucky moment when you met with Se\u00f1or Montesinos, who has sent you back to us like this."], "How does the Duchessknow who Don Quixote and Sancho Panza are?": [" Sancho was the first to come to, and finding himself close to his master he called to him in a weak and doleful voice, \u201cSe\u00f1or Don Quixote, ah, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote!\u201d \u201cWhat wouldst thou, brother Sancho?\u201d answered Don Quixote in the same feeble suffering tone as Sancho. \u201cI would like, if it were possible,\u201d answered Sancho Panza, \u201cyour worship to give me a couple of sups of that potion of the fiery Blas, if it be that you have any to hand there; perhaps it will serve for broken bones as well as for wounds.\u201d \u201cIf I only had it here, wretch that I am, what more should we want?\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cbut I swear to thee, Sancho Panza, on the faith of a knight-errant, ere two days are over, unless fortune orders otherwise, I mean to have it in my possession, or my hand will have lost its cunning.\u201d \u201cBut in how many does your worship think we shall have the use of our feet?\u201d answered Sancho Panza. \u201cFor myself I must say I cannot guess how many,\u201d said the battered knight Don Quixote; \u201cbut I take all the blame upon myself, for I had no business to put hand to sword against men who where not dubbed knights like myself, and so I believe that in punishment for having transgressed the laws of chivalry the God of battles has permitted this chastisement to be administered to me; for which reason, brother Sancho, it is well thou shouldst receive a hint on the matter which I am now about to mention to thee, for it is of much importance to the welfare of both of us.", " \u201cWho should it be,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cbut Don Quixote of La Mancha himself, who will make good all he has said and all he will say; for pledges don\u2019t trouble a good payer.\u201d Sancho had hardly uttered these words when two gentlemen, for such they seemed to be, entered the room, and one of them, throwing his arms round Don Quixote\u2019s neck, said to him, \u201cYour appearance cannot leave any question as to your name, nor can your name fail to identify your appearance; unquestionably, se\u00f1or, you are the real Don Quixote of La Mancha, cynosure and morning star of knight-errantry, despite and in defiance of him who has sought to usurp your name and bring to naught your achievements, as the author of this book which I here present to you has done;\u201d and with this he put a book which his companion carried into the hands of Don Quixote, who took it, and without replying began to run his eye over it; but he presently returned it saying, \u201cIn the little I have seen I have discovered three things in this author that deserve to be censured. The first is some words that I have read in the preface; the next that the language is Aragonese, for sometimes he writes without articles; and the third, which above all stamps him as ignorant, is that he goes wrong and departs from the truth in the most important part of the history, for here he says that my squire Sancho Panza\u2019s wife is called Mari Gutierrez, when she is called nothing of the sort, but Teresa Panza; and when a man errs on such an important point as this there is good reason to fear that he is in error on every other point in the history.\u201d \u201cA nice sort of historian, indeed!\u201d exclaimed Sancho at this; \u201che must know a deal about our affairs when he calls my wife Teresa Panza, Mari Gutierrez; take the book again, se\u00f1or, and see if I am in it and if he has changed my name.\u201d \u201cFrom your talk, friend,\u201d said Don Jeronimo, \u201cno doubt you are Sancho Panza, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote\u2019s squire.\u201d \u201cYes, I am,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cand I\u2019m proud of it.\u201d \u201cFaith, then,\u201d said the gentleman, \u201cthis new author does not handle you with the decency that displays itself in your person; he makes you out a heavy feeder and a fool, and not in the least droll, and a very different being from the Sancho described in the First Part of your master\u2019s history.\u201d \u201cGod forgive him,\u201d said Sancho; \u201che might have left me in my corner without troubling his head about me; \u2018let him who knows how ring the bells; \u2018Saint Peter is very well in Rome.\u2019\u201d The two gentlemen pressed Don Quixote to come into their room and have supper with them, as they knew very well there was nothing in that inn fit for one of his sort.", " Nor needst thou count this wonderful, for things and chances fall to the lot of such knights in ways so unexampled and unexpected that I might easily give thee even more than I promise thee.\u201d \u201cIn that case,\u201d said Sancho Panza, \u201cif I should become a king by one of those miracles your worship speaks of, even Juana Gutierrez, my old woman, would come to be queen and my children infantes.\u201d \u201cWell, who doubts it?\u201d said Don Quixote. \u201cI doubt it,\u201d replied Sancho Panza, \u201cbecause for my part I am persuaded that though God should shower down kingdoms upon earth, not one of them would fit the head of Mari Gutierrez. Let me tell you, se\u00f1or, she is not worth two maravedis for a queen; countess will fit her better, and that only with God\u2019s help.\u201d \u201cLeave it to God, Sancho,\u201d returned Don Quixote, \u201cfor he will give her what suits her best; but do not undervalue thyself so much as to come to be content with anything less than being governor of a province.\u201d \u201cI will not, se\u00f1or,\u201d answered Sancho, \u201cspecially as I have a man of such quality for a master in your worship, who will know how to give me all that will be suitable for me and that I can bear.\u201d c07e.jpg (70K) CHAPTER VIII. OF THE GOOD FORTUNE WHICH THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE HAD IN THE TERRIBLE AND UNDREAMT-OF ADVENTURE OF THE WINDMILLS, WITH OTHER OCCURRENCES WORTHY TO BE FITLY RECORDED c08a.jpg (142K) Full Size At this point they came in sight of thirty or forty windmills that there are on that plain, and as soon as Don Quixote saw them he said to his squire, \u201cFortune is arranging matters for us better than we could have shaped our desires ourselves, for look there, friend Sancho Panza, where thirty or more monstrous giants present themselves, all of whom I mean to engage in battle and slay, and with whose spoils we shall begin to make our fortunes; for this is righteous warfare, and it is God\u2019s good service to sweep so evil a breed from off the face of the earth.\u201d \u201cWhat giants?\u201d said Sancho Panza.", " \u201cNay, nay,\u201d said the barber, \u201cif you don\u2019t tell us where he is, Sancho Panza, we will suspect as we suspect already, that you have murdered and robbed him, for here you are mounted on his horse; in fact, you must produce the master of the hack, or else take the consequences.\u201d \u201cThere is no need of threats with me,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cfor I am not a man to rob or murder anybody; let his own fate, or God who made him, kill each one; my master is engaged very much to his taste doing penance in the midst of these mountains;\u201d and then, offhand and without stopping, he told them how he had left him, what adventures had befallen him, and how he was carrying a letter to the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, the daughter of Lorenzo Corchuelo, with whom he was over head and ears in love. They were both amazed at what Sancho Panza told them; for though they were aware of Don Quixote\u2019s madness and the nature of it, each time they heard of it they were filled with fresh wonder. They then asked Sancho Panza to show them the letter he was carrying to the lady Dulcinea del Toboso. He said it was written in a notebook, and that his master\u2019s directions were that he should have it copied on paper at the first village he came to. On this the curate said if he showed it to him, he himself would make a fair copy of it. Sancho put his hand into his bosom in search of the notebook but could not find it, nor, if he had been searching until now, could he have found it, for Don Quixote had kept it, and had never given it to him, nor had he himself thought of asking for it."], "Why does Don Quixotedo penance in the Sierra Morena?": [" He asked us what part of this sierra was the most rugged and retired; we told him that it was where we now are; and so in truth it is, for if you push on half a league farther, perhaps you will not be able to find your way out; and I am wondering how you have managed to come here, for there is no road or path that leads to this spot. I say, then, that on hearing our answer the youth turned about and made for the place we pointed out to him, leaving us all charmed with his good looks, and wondering at his question and the haste with which we saw him depart in the direction of the sierra; and after that we saw him no more, until some days afterwards he crossed the path of one of our shepherds, and without saying a word to him, came up to him and gave him several cuffs and kicks, and then turned to the ass with our provisions and took all the bread and cheese it carried, and having done this made off back again into the sierra with extraordinary swiftness. When some of us goatherds learned this we went in search of him for about two days through the most remote portion of this sierra, at the end of which we found him lodged in the hollow of a large thick cork tree. He came out to meet us with great gentleness, with his dress now torn and his face so disfigured and burned by the sun, that we hardly recognised him but that his clothes, though torn, convinced us, from the recollection we had of them, that he was the person we were looking for.", " \u201cQuite the contrary,\u201d said the bachelor; \u201cfor, as _stultorum infinitum est numerus_, innumerable are those who have relished the said history; but some have brought a charge against the author\u2019s memory, inasmuch as he forgot to say who the thief was who stole Sancho\u2019s Dapple; for it is not stated there, but only to be inferred from what is set down, that he was stolen, and a little farther on we see Sancho mounted on the same ass, without any reappearance of it. They say, too, that he forgot to state what Sancho did with those hundred crowns that he found in the valise in the Sierra Morena, as he never alludes to them again, and there are many who would be glad to know what he did with them, or what he spent them on, for it is one of the serious omissions of the work.\u201d \u201cSe\u00f1or Samson, I am not in a humour now for going into accounts or explanations,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cfor there\u2019s a sinking of the stomach come over me, and unless I doctor it with a couple of sups of the old stuff it will put me on the thorn of Santa Lucia. I have it at home, and my old woman is waiting for me; after dinner I\u2019ll come back, and will answer you and all the world every question you may choose to ask, as well about the loss of the ass as about the spending of the hundred crowns;\u201d and without another word or waiting for a reply he made off home. Don Quixote begged and entreated the bachelor to stay and do penance with him.", " The other, whom we may call the Ragged One of the Sorry Countenance, as Don Quixote was of the Rueful, after submitting to the embrace pushed him back a little and, placing his hands on Don Quixote\u2019s shoulders, stood gazing at him as if seeking to see whether he knew him, not less amazed, perhaps, at the sight of the face, figure, and armour of Don Quixote than Don Quixote was at the sight of him. To be brief, the first to speak after embracing was the Ragged One, and he said what will be told farther on. c23i.jpg (53K) Full Size CHAPTER XXIV. IN WHICH IS CONTINUED THE ADVENTURE OF THE SIERRA MORENA c24a.jpg (151K) Full Size The history relates that it was with the greatest attention Don Quixote listened to the ragged knight of the Sierra, who began by saying: \u201cOf a surety, se\u00f1or, whoever you are, for I know you not, I thank you for the proofs of kindness and courtesy you have shown me, and would I were in a condition to requite with something more than good-will that which you have displayed towards me in the cordial reception you have given me; but my fate does not afford me any other means of returning kindnesses done me save the hearty desire to repay them.\u201d \u201cMine,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cis to be of service to you, so much so that I had resolved not to quit these mountains until I had found you, and learned of you whether there is any kind of relief to be found for that sorrow under which from the strangeness of your life you seem to labour; and to search for you with all possible diligence, if search had been necessary.", " OF WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE IN THE SIERRA MORENA, WHICH WAS ONE OF THE RAREST ADVENTURES RELATED IN THIS VERACIOUS HISTORY c23a.jpg (148K) Full Size Seeing himself served in this way, Don Quixote said to his squire, \u201cI have always heard it said, Sancho, that to do good to boors is to throw water into the sea. If I had believed thy words, I should have avoided this trouble; but it is done now, it is only to have patience and take warning for the future.\u201d c23b.jpg (318K) Full Size \u201cYour worship will take warning as much as I am a Turk,\u201d returned Sancho; \u201cbut, as you say this mischief might have been avoided if you had believed me, believe me now, and a still greater one will be avoided; for I tell you chivalry is of no account with the Holy Brotherhood, and they don\u2019t care two maravedis for all the knights-errant in the world; and I can tell you I fancy I hear their arrows whistling past my ears this minute.\u201d \u201cThou art a coward by nature, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cbut lest thou shouldst say I am obstinate, and that I never do as thou dost advise, this once I will take thy advice, and withdraw out of reach of that fury thou so dreadest; but it must be on one condition, that never, in life or in death, thou art to say to anyone that I retired or withdrew from this danger out of fear, but only in compliance with thy entreaties; for if thou sayest otherwise thou wilt lie therein, and from this time to that, and from that to this, I give thee lie, and say thou liest and wilt lie every time thou thinkest or sayest it; and answer me not again; for at the mere thought that I am withdrawing or retiring from any danger, above all from this, which does seem to carry some little shadow of fear with it, I am ready to take my stand here and await alone, not only that Holy Brotherhood you talk of and dread, but the brothers of the twelve tribes of Israel, and the Seven Maccabees, and Castor and Pollux, and all the brothers and brotherhoods in the world.\u201d \u201cSe\u00f1or,\u201d replied Sancho, \u201cto retire is not to flee, and there is no wisdom in waiting when danger outweighs hope, and it is the part of wise men to preserve themselves to-day for to-morrow, and not risk all in one day; and let me tell you, though I am a clown and a boor, I have got some notion of what they call safe conduct; so repent not of having taken my advice, but mount Rocinante if you can, and if not I will help you; and follow me, for my mother-wit tells me we have more need of legs than hands just now.\u201d Don Quixote mounted without replying, and, Sancho leading the way on his ass, they entered the side of the Sierra Morena, which was close by, as it was Sancho\u2019s design to cross it entirely and come out again at El Viso or Almod\u00f3var del Campo, and hide for some days among its crags so as to escape the search of the Brotherhood should they come to look for them."], "What does Anselmoask his best friend, Lothario, to do for him?": [" IN WHICH IS RELATED THE NOVEL OF \u201cTHE ILL-ADVISED CURIOSITY\u201d In Florence, a rich and famous city of Italy in the province called Tuscany, there lived two gentlemen of wealth and quality, Anselmo and Lothario, such great friends that by way of distinction they were called by all that knew them \u201cThe Two Friends.\u201d They were unmarried, young, of the same age and of the same tastes, which was enough to account for the reciprocal friendship between them. Anselmo, it is true, was somewhat more inclined to seek pleasure in love than Lothario, for whom the pleasures of the chase had more attraction; but on occasion Anselmo would forego his own tastes to yield to those of Lothario, and Lothario would surrender his to fall in with those of Anselmo, and in this way their inclinations kept pace one with the other with a concord so perfect that the best regulated clock could not surpass it. Anselmo was deep in love with a high-born and beautiful maiden of the same city, the daughter of parents so estimable, and so estimable herself, that he resolved, with the approval of his friend Lothario, without whom he did nothing, to ask her of them in marriage, and did so, Lothario being the bearer of the demand, and conducting the negotiation so much to the satisfaction of his friend that in a short time he was in possession of the object of his desires, and Camilla so happy in having won Anselmo for her husband, that she gave thanks unceasingly to heaven and to Lothario, by whose means such good fortune had fallen to her.", " Camilla begged him not to go, and Lothario offered to accompany him, but nothing could persuade Anselmo, who on the contrary pressed Lothario to remain waiting for him as he had a matter of great importance to discuss with him. At the same time he bade Camilla not to leave Lothario alone until he came back. In short he contrived to put so good a face on the reason, or the folly, of his absence that no one could have suspected it was a pretence. Anselmo took his departure, and Camilla and Lothario were left alone at the table, for the rest of the household had gone to dinner. Lothario saw himself in the lists according to his friend\u2019s wish, and facing an enemy that could by her beauty alone vanquish a squadron of armed knights; judge whether he had good reason to fear; but what he did was to lean his elbow on the arm of the chair, and his cheek upon his hand, and, asking Camilla\u2019s pardon for his ill manners, he said he wished to take a little sleep until Anselmo returned. Camilla in reply said he could repose more at his ease in the reception-room than in his chair, and begged of him to go in and sleep there; but Lothario declined, and there he remained asleep until the return of Anselmo, who finding Camilla in her own room, and Lothario asleep, imagined that he had stayed away so long as to have afforded them time enough for conversation and even for sleep, and was all impatience until Lothario should wake up, that he might go out with him and question him as to his success.", " To all this and much more that Anselmo said to Lothario to persuade him to come to his house as he had been in the habit of doing, Lothario replied with so much prudence, sense, and judgment, that Anselmo was satisfied of his friend\u2019s good intentions, and it was agreed that on two days in the week, and on holidays, Lothario should come to dine with him; but though this arrangement was made between them Lothario resolved to observe it no further than he considered to be in accordance with the honour of his friend, whose good name was more to him than his own. He said, and justly, that a married man upon whom heaven had bestowed a beautiful wife should consider as carefully what friends he brought to his house as what female friends his wife associated with, for what cannot be done or arranged in the market-place, in church, at public festivals or at stations (opportunities that husbands cannot always deny their wives), may be easily managed in the house of the female friend or relative in whom most confidence is reposed. Lothario said, too, that every married man should have some friend who would point out to him any negligence he might be guilty of in his conduct, for it will sometimes happen that owing to the deep affection the husband bears his wife either he does not caution her, or, not to vex her, refrains from telling her to do or not to do certain things, doing or avoiding which may be a matter of honour or reproach to him; and errors of this kind he could easily correct if warned by a friend.", " But where is such a friend to be found as Lothario would have, so judicious, so loyal, and so true? Of a truth I know not; Lothario alone was such a one, for with the utmost care and vigilance he watched over the honour of his friend, and strove to diminish, cut down, and reduce the number of days for going to his house according to their agreement, lest the visits of a young man, wealthy, high-born, and with the attractions he was conscious of possessing, at the house of a woman so beautiful as Camilla, should be regarded with suspicion by the inquisitive and malicious eyes of the idle public. For though his integrity and reputation might bridle slanderous tongues, still he was unwilling to hazard either his own good name or that of his friend; and for this reason most of the days agreed upon he devoted to some other business which he pretended was unavoidable; so that a great portion of the day was taken up with complaints on one side and excuses on the other. It happened, however, that on one occasion when the two were strolling together outside the city, Anselmo addressed the following words to Lothario. \u201cThou mayest suppose, Lothario my friend, that I am unable to give sufficient thanks for the favours God has rendered me in making me the son of such parents as mine were, and bestowing upon me with no niggard hand what are called the gifts of nature as well as those of fortune, and above all for what he has done in giving me thee for a friend and Camilla for a wife\u2014two treasures that I value, if not as highly as I ought, at least as highly as I am able."], "When he sees them,what does Don Quixote think the fulling mills are?": [" WHICH TREATS OF THE EXALTED ADVENTURE AND RICH PRIZE OF MAMBRINO\u2019S HELMET, TOGETHER WITH OTHER THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO OUR INVINCIBLE KNIGHT c20a.jpg (73K) Full Size It now began to rain a little, and Sancho was for going into the fulling mills, but Don Quixote had taken such an abhorrence to them on account of the late joke that he would not enter them on any account; so turning aside to right they came upon another road, different from that which they had taken the night before. Shortly afterwards Don Quixote perceived a man on horseback who wore on his head something that shone like gold, and the moment he saw him he turned to Sancho and said: \u201cI think, Sancho, there is no proverb that is not true, all being maxims drawn from experience itself, the mother of all the sciences, especially that one that says, \u2018Where one door shuts, another opens.\u2019 I say so because if last night fortune shut the door of the adventure we were looking for against us, cheating us with the fulling mills, it now opens wide another one for another better and more certain adventure, and if I do not contrive to enter it, it will be my own fault, and I cannot lay it to my ignorance of fulling mills, or the darkness of the night. I say this because, if I mistake not, there comes towards us one who wears on his head the helmet of Mambrino, concerning which I took the oath thou rememberest.\u201d \u201cMind what you say, your worship, and still more what you do,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cfor I don\u2019t want any more fulling mills to finish off fulling and knocking our senses out.\u201d \u201cThe devil take thee, man,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cwhat has a helmet to do with fulling mills?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d replied Sancho, \u201cbut, faith, if I might speak as I used, perhaps I could give such reasons that your worship would see you were mistaken in what you say.\u201d \u201cHow can I be mistaken in what I say, unbelieving traitor?\u201d returned Don Quixote; \u201ctell me, seest thou not yonder knight coming towards us on a dappled grey steed, who has upon his head a helmet of gold?\u201d \u201cWhat I see and make out,\u201d answered Sancho, \u201cis only a man on a grey ass like my own, who has something that shines on his head.\u201d \u201cWell, that is the helmet of Mambrino,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cstand to one side and leave me alone with him; thou shalt see how, without saying a word, to save time, I shall bring this adventure to an issue and possess myself of the helmet I have so longed for.\u201d \u201cI will take care to stand aside,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cbut God grant, I say once more, that it may be marjoram and not fulling mills.\u201d \u201cI have told thee, brother, on no account to mention those fulling mills to me again,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cor I vow\u2014and I say no more\u2014I\u2019ll full the soul out of you.\u201d Sancho held his peace in dread lest his master should carry out the vow he had hurled like a bowl at him.", " Four times he stopped, and as many times did his laughter break out afresh with the same violence as at first, whereat Don Quixote grew furious, above all when he heard him say mockingly, \u201cThou must know, friend Sancho, that of Heaven\u2019s will I was born in this our iron age to revive in it the golden or age of gold; I am he for whom are reserved perils, mighty achievements, valiant deeds;\u201d and here he went on repeating the words that Don Quixote uttered the first time they heard the awful strokes. Don Quixote, then, seeing that Sancho was turning him into ridicule, was so mortified and vexed that he lifted up his pike and smote him two such blows that if, instead of catching them on his shoulders, he had caught them on his head there would have been no wages to pay, unless indeed to his heirs. Sancho seeing that he was getting an awkward return in earnest for his jest, and fearing his master might carry it still further, said to him very humbly, \u201cCalm yourself, sir, for by God I am only joking.\u201d \u201cWell, then, if you are joking I am not,\u201d replied Don Quixote. \u201cLook here, my lively gentleman, if these, instead of being fulling hammers, had been some perilous adventure, have I not, think you, shown the courage required for the attempt and achievement? Am I, perchance, being, as I am, a gentleman, bound to know and distinguish sounds and tell whether they come from fulling mills or not; and that, when perhaps, as is the case, I have never in my life seen any as you have, low boor as you are, that have been born and bred among them?", " But again I tell thee, feel and hunt, for I am certain thou art cleaner than a sheet of smooth white paper.\u201d Sancho felt, and passing his hand gently and carefully down to the hollow of his left knee, he looked up at his master and said, \u201cEither the test is a false one, or we have not come to where your worship says, nor within many leagues of it.\u201d \u201cWhy, how so?\u201d asked Don Quixote; \u201chast thou come upon aught?\u201d \u201cAy, and aughts,\u201d replied Sancho; and shaking his fingers he washed his whole hand in the river along which the boat was quietly gliding in midstream, not moved by any occult intelligence or invisible enchanter, but simply by the current, just there smooth and gentle. They now came in sight of some large water mills that stood in the middle of the river, and the instant Don Quixote saw them he cried out, \u201cSeest thou there, my friend? there stands the castle or fortress, where there is, no doubt, some knight in durance, or ill-used queen, or infanta, or princess, in whose aid I am brought hither.\u201d \u201cWhat the devil city, fortress, or castle is your worship talking about, se\u00f1or?\u201d said Sancho; \u201cdon\u2019t you see that those are mills that stand in the river to grind corn?\u201d \u201cHold thy peace, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cthough they look like mills they are not so; I have already told thee that enchantments transform things and change their proper shapes; I do not mean to say they really change them from one form into another, but that it seems as though they did, as experience proved in the transformation of Dulcinea, sole refuge of my hopes.\u201d By this time, the boat, having reached the middle of the stream, began to move less slowly than hitherto.", " You, gentlemen, place yourselves in safety before I open, for I know they will do me no harm.\u201d Once more the gentleman strove to persuade Don Quixote not to do such a mad thing, as it was tempting God to engage in such a piece of folly. To this, Don Quixote replied that he knew what he was about. The gentleman in return entreated him to reflect, for he knew he was under a delusion. \u201cWell, se\u00f1or,\u201d answered Don Quixote, \u201cif you do not like to be a spectator of this tragedy, as in your opinion it will be, spur your flea-bitten mare, and place yourself in safety.\u201d Hearing this, Sancho with tears in his eyes entreated him to give up an enterprise compared with which the one of the windmills, and the awful one of the fulling mills, and, in fact, all the feats he had attempted in the whole course of his life, were cakes and fancy bread. \u201cLook ye, se\u00f1or,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cthere\u2019s no enchantment here, nor anything of the sort, for between the bars and chinks of the cage I have seen the paw of a real lion, and judging by that I reckon the lion such a paw could belong to must be bigger than a mountain.\u201d \u201cFear at any rate,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cwill make him look bigger to thee than half the world. Retire, Sancho, and leave me; and if I die here thou knowest our old compact; thou wilt repair to Dulcinea\u2014I say no more.\u201d To these he added some further words that banished all hope of his giving up his insane project."], "Who is Cide HameteBenengeli?": [" p74b.jpg (391K) Full Size At last Don Quixote\u2019s end came, after he had received all the sacraments, and had in full and forcible terms expressed his detestation of books of chivalry. The notary was there at the time, and he said that in no book of chivalry had he ever read of any knight-errant dying in his bed so calmly and so like a Christian as Don Quixote, who amid the tears and lamentations of all present yielded up his spirit, that is to say died. On perceiving it the curate begged the notary to bear witness that Alonso Quixano the Good, commonly called Don Quixote of La Mancha, had passed away from this present life, and died naturally; and said he desired this testimony in order to remove the possibility of any other author save Cide Hamete Benengeli bringing him to life again falsely and making interminable stories out of his achievements. Such was the end of the Ingenious Gentleman of La Mancha, whose village Cide Hamete would not indicate precisely, in order to leave all the towns and villages of La Mancha to contend among themselves for the right to adopt him and claim him as a son, as the seven cities of Greece contended for Homer. The lamentations of Sancho and the niece and housekeeper are omitted here, as well as the new epitaphs upon his tomb; Samson Carrasco, however, put the following lines: A doughty gentleman lies here; A stranger all his life to fear; Nor in his death could Death prevail, In that last hour, to make him quail.", " p26e.jpg (34K) CHAPTER XXVII. WHEREIN IT IS SHOWN WHO MASTER PEDRO AND HIS APE WERE, TOGETHER WITH THE MISHAP DON QUIXOTE HAD IN THE BRAYING ADVENTURE, WHICH HE DID NOT CONCLUDE AS HE WOULD HAVE LIKED OR AS HE HAD EXPECTED p27a.jpg (135K) Full Size Cide Hamete, the chronicler of this great history, begins this chapter with these words, \u201cI swear as a Catholic Christian;\u201d with regard to which his translator says that Cide Hamete\u2019s swearing as a Catholic Christian, he being\u2014as no doubt he was\u2014a Moor, only meant that, just as a Catholic Christian taking an oath swears, or ought to swear, what is true, and tell the truth in what he avers, so he was telling the truth, as much as if he swore as a Catholic Christian, in all he chose to write about Quixote, especially in declaring who Master Pedro was and what was the divining ape that astonished all the villages with his divinations. He says, then, that he who has read the First Part of this history will remember well enough the Gines de Pasamonte whom, with other galley slaves, Don Quixote set free in the Sierra Morena: a kindness for which he afterwards got poor thanks and worse payment from that evil-minded, ill-conditioned set. This Gines de Pasamonte\u2014Don Ginesillo de Parapilla, Don Quixote called him\u2014it was that stole Dapple from Sancho Panza; which, because by the fault of the printers neither the how nor the when was stated in the First Part, has been a puzzle to a good many people, who attribute to the bad memory of the author what was the error of the press.", " Sancho having finished his supper, and left the landlord in the X condition, repaired to the room where his master was, and as he came in said, \u201cMay I die, sirs, if the author of this book your worships have got has any mind that we should agree; as he calls me glutton (according to what your worships say) I wish he may not call me drunkard too.\u201d \u201cBut he does,\u201d said Don Jeronimo; \u201cI cannot remember, however, in what way, though I know his words are offensive, and what is more, lying, as I can see plainly by the physiognomy of the worthy Sancho before me.\u201d \u201cBelieve me,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cthe Sancho and the Don Quixote of this history must be different persons from those that appear in the one Cide Hamete Benengeli wrote, who are ourselves; my master valiant, wise, and true in love, and I simple, droll, and neither glutton nor drunkard.\u201d \u201cI believe it,\u201d said Don Juan; \u201cand were it possible, an order should be issued that no one should have the presumption to deal with anything relating to Don Quixote, save his original author Cide Hamete; just as Alexander commanded that no one should presume to paint his portrait save Apelles.\u201d p60b.jpg (336K) Full Size \u201cLet him who will paint me,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cbut let him not abuse me; for patience will often break down when they heap insults upon it.\u201d \u201cNone can be offered to Se\u00f1or Don Quixote,\u201d said Don Juan, \u201cthat he himself will not be able to avenge, if he does not ward it off with the shield of his patience, which, I take it, is great and strong.\u201d A considerable portion of the night passed in conversation of this sort, and though Don Juan wished Don Quixote to read more of the book to see what it was all about, he was not to be prevailed upon, saying that he treated it as read and pronounced it utterly silly; and, if by any chance it should come to its author\u2019s ears that he had it in his hand, he did not want him to flatter himself with the idea that he had read it; for our thoughts, and still more our eyes, should keep themselves aloof from what is obscene and filthy.", " To one of them, a brand-new, well-bound one, they gave such a stroke that they knocked the guts out of it and scattered the leaves about. \u2018Look what book that is,\u2019 said one devil to another, and the other replied, \u2018It is the \u201cSecond Part of the History of Don Quixote of La Mancha,\u201d not by Cide Hamete, the original author, but by an Aragonese who by his own account is of Tordesillas.\u2019 \u2018Out of this with it,\u2019 said the first, \u2018and into the depths of hell with it out of my sight.\u2019 \u2018Is it so bad?\u2019 said the other. \u2018So bad is it,\u2019 said the first, \u2018that if I had set myself deliberately to make a worse, I could not have done it.\u2019 They then went on with their game, knocking other books about; and I, having heard them mention the name of Don Quixote whom I love and adore so, took care to retain this vision in my memory.\u201d \u201cA vision it must have been, no doubt,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cfor there is no other I in the world; this history has been going about here for some time from hand to hand, but it does not stay long in any, for everybody gives it a taste of his foot. I am not disturbed by hearing that I am wandering in a fantastic shape in the darkness of the pit or in the daylight above, for I am not the one that history treats of. If it should be good, faithful, and true, it will have ages of life; but if it should be bad, from its birth to its burial will not be a very long journey.\u201d Altisidora was about to proceed with her complaint against Don Quixote, when he said to her, \u201cI have several times told you, se\u00f1ora that it grieves me you should have set your affections upon me, as from mine they can only receive gratitude, but no return."], "What does theDuke give Sancho Panza?": [" Sancho was the first to come to, and finding himself close to his master he called to him in a weak and doleful voice, \u201cSe\u00f1or Don Quixote, ah, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote!\u201d \u201cWhat wouldst thou, brother Sancho?\u201d answered Don Quixote in the same feeble suffering tone as Sancho. \u201cI would like, if it were possible,\u201d answered Sancho Panza, \u201cyour worship to give me a couple of sups of that potion of the fiery Blas, if it be that you have any to hand there; perhaps it will serve for broken bones as well as for wounds.\u201d \u201cIf I only had it here, wretch that I am, what more should we want?\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cbut I swear to thee, Sancho Panza, on the faith of a knight-errant, ere two days are over, unless fortune orders otherwise, I mean to have it in my possession, or my hand will have lost its cunning.\u201d \u201cBut in how many does your worship think we shall have the use of our feet?\u201d answered Sancho Panza. \u201cFor myself I must say I cannot guess how many,\u201d said the battered knight Don Quixote; \u201cbut I take all the blame upon myself, for I had no business to put hand to sword against men who where not dubbed knights like myself, and so I believe that in punishment for having transgressed the laws of chivalry the God of battles has permitted this chastisement to be administered to me; for which reason, brother Sancho, it is well thou shouldst receive a hint on the matter which I am now about to mention to thee, for it is of much importance to the welfare of both of us.", " Nor needst thou count this wonderful, for things and chances fall to the lot of such knights in ways so unexampled and unexpected that I might easily give thee even more than I promise thee.\u201d \u201cIn that case,\u201d said Sancho Panza, \u201cif I should become a king by one of those miracles your worship speaks of, even Juana Gutierrez, my old woman, would come to be queen and my children infantes.\u201d \u201cWell, who doubts it?\u201d said Don Quixote. \u201cI doubt it,\u201d replied Sancho Panza, \u201cbecause for my part I am persuaded that though God should shower down kingdoms upon earth, not one of them would fit the head of Mari Gutierrez. Let me tell you, se\u00f1or, she is not worth two maravedis for a queen; countess will fit her better, and that only with God\u2019s help.\u201d \u201cLeave it to God, Sancho,\u201d returned Don Quixote, \u201cfor he will give her what suits her best; but do not undervalue thyself so much as to come to be content with anything less than being governor of a province.\u201d \u201cI will not, se\u00f1or,\u201d answered Sancho, \u201cspecially as I have a man of such quality for a master in your worship, who will know how to give me all that will be suitable for me and that I can bear.\u201d c07e.jpg (70K) CHAPTER VIII. OF THE GOOD FORTUNE WHICH THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE HAD IN THE TERRIBLE AND UNDREAMT-OF ADVENTURE OF THE WINDMILLS, WITH OTHER OCCURRENCES WORTHY TO BE FITLY RECORDED c08a.jpg (142K) Full Size At this point they came in sight of thirty or forty windmills that there are on that plain, and as soon as Don Quixote saw them he said to his squire, \u201cFortune is arranging matters for us better than we could have shaped our desires ourselves, for look there, friend Sancho Panza, where thirty or more monstrous giants present themselves, all of whom I mean to engage in battle and slay, and with whose spoils we shall begin to make our fortunes; for this is righteous warfare, and it is God\u2019s good service to sweep so evil a breed from off the face of the earth.\u201d \u201cWhat giants?\u201d said Sancho Panza.", " Finally, leading him out of the church they carried him to the judgment seat and seated him on it, and the duke\u2019s majordomo said to him, \u201cIt is an ancient custom in this island, se\u00f1or governor, that he who comes to take possession of this famous island is bound to answer a question which shall be put to him, and which must be a somewhat knotty and difficult one; and by his answer the people take the measure of their new governor\u2019s wit, and hail with joy or deplore his arrival accordingly.\u201d While the majordomo was making this speech Sancho was gazing at several large letters inscribed on the wall opposite his seat, and as he could not read he asked what that was that was painted on the wall. The answer was, \u201cSe\u00f1or, there is written and recorded the day on which your lordship took possession of this island, and the inscription says, \u2018This day, the so-and-so of such-and-such a month and year, Se\u00f1or Don Sancho Panza took possession of this island; many years may he enjoy it.\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd whom do they call Don Sancho Panza?\u201d asked Sancho. \u201cYour lordship,\u201d replied the majordomo; \u201cfor no other Panza but the one who is now seated in that chair has ever entered this island.\u201d \u201cWell then, let me tell you, brother,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cI haven\u2019t got the \u2018Don,\u2019 nor has anyone of my family ever had it; my name is plain Sancho Panza, and Sancho was my father\u2019s name, and Sancho was my grandfather\u2019s and they were all Panzas, without any Dons or Do\u00f1as tacked on; I suspect that in this island there are more Dons than stones; but never mind; God knows what I mean, and maybe if my government lasts four days I\u2019ll weed out these Dons that no doubt are as great a nuisance as the midges, they\u2019re so plenty.", " \u201cNay, nay,\u201d said the barber, \u201cif you don\u2019t tell us where he is, Sancho Panza, we will suspect as we suspect already, that you have murdered and robbed him, for here you are mounted on his horse; in fact, you must produce the master of the hack, or else take the consequences.\u201d \u201cThere is no need of threats with me,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cfor I am not a man to rob or murder anybody; let his own fate, or God who made him, kill each one; my master is engaged very much to his taste doing penance in the midst of these mountains;\u201d and then, offhand and without stopping, he told them how he had left him, what adventures had befallen him, and how he was carrying a letter to the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, the daughter of Lorenzo Corchuelo, with whom he was over head and ears in love. They were both amazed at what Sancho Panza told them; for though they were aware of Don Quixote\u2019s madness and the nature of it, each time they heard of it they were filled with fresh wonder. They then asked Sancho Panza to show them the letter he was carrying to the lady Dulcinea del Toboso. He said it was written in a notebook, and that his master\u2019s directions were that he should have it copied on paper at the first village he came to. On this the curate said if he showed it to him, he himself would make a fair copy of it. Sancho put his hand into his bosom in search of the notebook but could not find it, nor, if he had been searching until now, could he have found it, for Don Quixote had kept it, and had never given it to him, nor had he himself thought of asking for it."], "How, accordingto Merlin, can Dulcinea be released from her enchantment?": [" I\u2019m now ready to burst with grief at seeing my green coat torn, and they come to ask me to whip myself of my own free will, I having as little fancy for it as for turning cacique.\u201d \u201cWell then, the fact is, friend Sancho,\u201d said the duke, \u201cthat unless you become softer than a ripe fig, you shall not get hold of the government. It would be a nice thing for me to send my islanders a cruel governor with flinty bowels, who won\u2019t yield to the tears of afflicted damsels or to the prayers of wise, magisterial, ancient enchanters and sages. In short, Sancho, either you must be whipped by yourself, or they must whip you, or you shan\u2019t be governor.\u201d \u201cSe\u00f1or,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cwon\u2019t two days\u2019 grace be given me in which to consider what is best for me?\u201d \u201cNo, certainly not,\u201d said Merlin; \u201chere, this minute, and on the spot, the matter must be settled; either Dulcinea will return to the cave of Montesinos and to her former condition of peasant wench, or else in her present form shall be carried to the Elysian fields, where she will remain waiting until the number of stripes is completed.\u201d \u201cNow then, Sancho!\u201d said the duchess, \u201cshow courage, and gratitude for your master Don Quixote\u2019s bread that you have eaten; we are all bound to oblige and please him for his benevolent disposition and lofty chivalry. Consent to this whipping, my son; to the devil with the devil, and leave fear to milksops, for \u2018a stout heart breaks bad luck,\u2019 as you very well know.\u201d To this Sancho replied with an irrelevant remark, which, addressing Merlin, he made to him, \u201cWill your worship tell me, Se\u00f1or Merlin\u2014when that courier devil came up he gave my master a message from Se\u00f1or Montesinos, charging him to wait for him here, as he was coming to arrange how the lady Do\u00f1a Dulcinea del Toboso was to be disenchanted; but up to the present we have not seen Montesinos, nor anything like him.\u201d To which Merlin made answer, \u201cThe devil, Sancho, is a blockhead and a great scoundrel; I sent him to look for your master, but not with a message from Montesinos but from myself; for Montesinos is in his cave expecting, or more properly speaking, waiting for his disenchantment; for there\u2019s the tail to be skinned yet for him; if he owes you anything, or you have any business to transact with him, I\u2019ll bring him to you and put him where you choose; but for the present make up your mind to consent to this penance, and believe me it will be very good for you, for soul as well for body\u2014for your soul because of the charity with which you perform it, for your body because I know that you are of a sanguine habit and it will do you no harm to draw a little blood.\u201d \u201cThere are a great many doctors in the world; even the enchanters are doctors,\u201d said Sancho; \u201chowever, as everybody tells me the same thing\u2014though I can\u2019t see it myself\u2014I say I am willing to give myself the three thousand three hundred lashes, provided I am to lay them on whenever I like, without any fixing of days or times; and I\u2019ll try and get out of debt as quickly as I can, that the world may enjoy the beauty of the lady Dulcinea del Toboso; as it seems, contrary to what I thought, that she is beautiful after all.", " In this short interval Don Quixote told him of his unfortunate defeat, and of Dulcinea\u2019s enchantment and the remedy, all which threw Don \u00c1lvaro into fresh amazement, and embracing Don Quixote and Sancho, he went his way, and Don Quixote went his. That night he passed among trees again in order to give Sancho an opportunity of working out his penance, which he did in the same fashion as the night before, at the expense of the bark of the beech trees much more than of his back, of which he took such good care that the lashes would not have knocked off a fly had there been one there. The duped Don Quixote did not miss a single stroke of the count, and he found that together with those of the night before they made up three thousand and twenty-nine. The sun apparently had got up early to witness the sacrifice, and with his light they resumed their journey, discussing the deception practised on Don \u00c1lvaro, and saying how well done it was to have taken his declaration before a magistrate in such an unimpeachable form. That day and night they travelled on, nor did anything worth mention happen to them, unless it was that in the course of the night Sancho finished off his task, whereat Don Quixote was beyond measure joyful. He watched for daylight, to see if along the road he should fall in with his already disenchanted lady Dulcinea; and as he pursued his journey there was no woman he met that he did not go up to, to see if she was Dulcinea del Toboso, as he held it absolutely certain that Merlin\u2019s promises could not lie.", " Don Quixote, who was always polite, yielded to their request and supped with them. Sancho stayed behind with the stew. and invested with plenary delegated authority seated himself at the head of the table, and the landlord sat down with him, for he was no less fond of cow-heel and calves\u2019 feet than Sancho was. While at supper Don Juan asked Don Quixote what news he had of the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, was she married, had she been brought to bed, or was she with child, or did she in maidenhood, still preserving her modesty and delicacy, cherish the remembrance of the tender passion of Se\u00f1or Don Quixote? To this he replied, \u201cDulcinea is a maiden still, and my passion more firmly rooted than ever, our intercourse unsatisfactory as before, and her beauty transformed into that of a foul country wench;\u201d and then he proceeded to give them a full and particular account of the enchantment of Dulcinea, and of what had happened him in the cave of Montesinos, together with what the sage Merlin had prescribed for her disenchantment, namely the scourging of Sancho. Exceedingly great was the amusement the two gentlemen derived from hearing Don Quixote recount the strange incidents of his history; and if they were amazed by his absurdities they were equally amazed by the elegant style in which he delivered them. On the one hand they regarded him as a man of wit and sense, and on the other he seemed to them a maundering blockhead, and they could not make up their minds whereabouts between wisdom and folly they ought to place him.", " Thus have the authors of her woe resolved. And this is, gentles, wherefore I have come. \u201cBy all that\u2019s good,\u201d exclaimed Sancho at this, \u201cI\u2019ll just as soon give myself three stabs with a dagger as three, not to say three thousand, lashes. The devil take such a way of disenchanting! I don\u2019t see what my backside has got to do with enchantments. By God, if Se\u00f1or Merlin has not found out some other way of disenchanting the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, she may go to her grave enchanted.\u201d \u201cBut I\u2019ll take you, Don Clown stuffed with garlic,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand tie you to a tree as naked as when your mother brought you forth, and give you, not to say three thousand three hundred, but six thousand six hundred lashes, and so well laid on that they won\u2019t be got rid of if you try three thousand three hundred times; don\u2019t answer me a word or I\u2019ll tear your soul out.\u201d On hearing this Merlin said, \u201cThat will not do, for the lashes worthy Sancho has to receive must be given of his own free will and not by force, and at whatever time he pleases, for there is no fixed limit assigned to him; but it is permitted him, if he likes to commute by half the pain of this whipping, to let them be given by the hand of another, though it may be somewhat weighty.\u201d \u201cNot a hand, my own or anybody else\u2019s, weighty or weighable, shall touch me,\u201d said Sancho. \u201cWas it I that gave birth to the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, that my backside is to pay for the sins of her eyes?"], "Why do the officersof the Holy Brotherhood want to arrest Don Quixote?": [" Sancho followed him at his ass\u2019s best trot, but Rocinante stepped out so that, seeing himself left behind, he was forced to call to his master to wait for him. Don Quixote did so, reining in Rocinante until his weary squire came up, who on reaching him said, \u201cIt seems to me, se\u00f1or, it would be prudent in us to go and take refuge in some church, for, seeing how mauled he with whom you fought has been left, it will be no wonder if they give information of the affair to the Holy Brotherhood and arrest us, and, faith, if they do, before we come out of gaol we shall have to sweat for it.\u201d \u201cPeace,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cwhere hast thou ever seen or heard that a knight-errant has been arraigned before a court of justice, however many homicides he may have committed?\u201d \u201cI know nothing about omecils,\u201d answered Sancho, \u201cnor in my life have had anything to do with one; I only know that the Holy Brotherhood looks after those who fight in the fields, and in that other matter I do not meddle.\u201d \u201cThen thou needst have no uneasiness, my friend,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cfor I will deliver thee out of the hands of the Chaldeans, much more out of those of the Brotherhood. But tell me, as thou livest, hast thou seen a more valiant knight than I in all the known world; hast thou read in history of any who has or had higher mettle in attack, more spirit in maintaining it, more dexterity in wounding or skill in overthrowing?\u201d \u201cThe truth is,\u201d answered Sancho, \u201cthat I have never read any history, for I can neither read nor write, but what I will venture to bet is that a more daring master than your worship I have never served in all the days of my life, and God grant that this daring be not paid for where I have said; what I beg of your worship is to dress your wound, for a great deal of blood flows from that ear, and I have here some lint and a little white ointment in the alforjas.\u201d \u201cAll that might be well dispensed with,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cif I had remembered to make a vial of the balsam of Fierabras, for time and medicine are saved by one single drop.\u201d \u201cWhat vial and what balsam is that?\u201d said Sancho Panza.", " What damsel was not enamoured of him and did not yield herself up wholly to his will and pleasure? And, lastly, what knight-errant has there been, is there, or will there ever be in the world, not bold enough to give, single-handed, four hundred cudgellings to four hundred officers of the Holy Brotherhood if they come in his way?\u201d CHAPTER XLVI. OF THE END OF THE NOTABLE ADVENTURE OF THE OFFICERS OF THE HOLY BROTHERHOOD; AND OF THE GREAT FEROCITY OF OUR WORTHY KNIGHT, DON QUIXOTE c46a.jpg (163K) Full Size While Don Quixote was talking in this strain, the curate was endeavouring to persuade the officers that he was out of his senses, as they might perceive by his deeds and his words, and that they need not press the matter any further, for even if they arrested him and carried him off, they would have to release him by-and-by as a madman; to which the holder of the warrant replied that he had nothing to do with inquiring into Don Quixote\u2019s madness, but only to execute his superior\u2019s orders, and that once taken they might let him go three hundred times if they liked. \u201cFor all that,\u201d said the curate, \u201cyou must not take him away this time, nor will he, it is my opinion, let himself be taken away.\u201d In short, the curate used such arguments, and Don Quixote did such mad things, that the officers would have been more mad than he was if they had not perceived his want of wits, and so they thought it best to allow themselves to be pacified, and even to act as peacemakers between the barber and Sancho Panza, who still continued their altercation with much bitterness.", " Thus by the authority of Agramante and the wisdom of King Sobrino all this complication of disputes was arranged; but the enemy of concord and hater of peace, feeling himself slighted and made a fool of, and seeing how little he had gained after having involved them all in such an elaborate entanglement, resolved to try his hand once more by stirring up fresh quarrels and disturbances. It came about in this wise: the officers were pacified on learning the rank of those with whom they had been engaged, and withdrew from the contest, considering that whatever the result might be they were likely to get the worst of the battle; but one of them, the one who had been thrashed and kicked by Don Fernando, recollected that among some warrants he carried for the arrest of certain delinquents, he had one against Don Quixote, whom the Holy Brotherhood had ordered to be arrested for setting the galley slaves free, as Sancho had, with very good reason, apprehended. Suspecting how it was, then, he wished to satisfy himself as to whether Don Quixote\u2019s features corresponded; and taking a parchment out of his bosom he lit upon what he was in search of, and setting himself to read it deliberately, for he was not a quick reader, as he made out each word he fixed his eyes on Don Quixote, and went on comparing the description in the warrant with his face, and discovered that beyond all doubt he was the person described in it.", " Don Quixote was unable to shield himself so well but that more pebbles than I could count struck him full on the body with such force that they brought him to the ground; and the instant he fell the student pounced upon him, snatched the basin from his head, and with it struck three or four blows on his shoulders, and as many more on the ground, knocking it almost to pieces. They then stripped him of a jacket that he wore over his armour, and they would have stripped off his stockings if his greaves had not prevented them. From Sancho they took his coat, leaving him in his shirt-sleeves; and dividing among themselves the remaining spoils of the battle, they went each one his own way, more solicitous about keeping clear of the Holy Brotherhood they dreaded, than about burdening themselves with the chain, or going to present themselves before the lady Dulcinea del Toboso. The ass and Rocinante, Sancho and Don Quixote, were all that were left upon the spot; the ass with drooping head, serious, shaking his ears from time to time as if he thought the storm of stones that assailed them was not yet over; Rocinante stretched beside his master, for he too had been brought to the ground by a stone; Sancho stripped, and trembling with fear of the Holy Brotherhood; and Don Quixote fuming to find himself so served by the very persons for whom he had done so much. c22e.jpg (44K) CHAPTER XXIII."], "Who is Cardenio?": [" The gentleman grasped her firmly by the shoulders, and being so fully occupied with holding her back, he was unable to put a hand to his veil which was falling off, as it did at length entirely, and Dorothea, who was holding the lady in her arms, raising her eyes saw that he who likewise held her was her husband, Don Fernando. The instant she recognised him, with a prolonged plaintive cry drawn from the depths of her heart, she fell backwards fainting, and but for the barber being close by to catch her in his arms, she would have fallen completely to the ground. The curate at once hastened to uncover her face and throw water on it, and as he did so Don Fernando, for he it was who held the other in his arms, recognised her and stood as if death-stricken by the sight; not, however, relaxing his grasp of Luscinda, for it was she that was struggling to release herself from his hold, having recognised Cardenio by his voice, as he had recognised her. Cardenio also heard Dorothea\u2019s cry as she fell fainting, and imagining that it came from his Luscinda burst forth in terror from the room, and the first thing he saw was Don Fernando with Luscinda in his arms. Don Fernando, too, knew Cardenio at once; and all three, Luscinda, Cardenio, and Dorothea, stood in silent amazement scarcely knowing what had happened to them. They gazed at one another without speaking, Dorothea at Don Fernando, Don Fernando at Cardenio, Cardenio at Luscinda, and Luscinda at Cardenio.", " Not so Luscinda, and Cardenio, and almost all the others, for they shed so many tears, some in their own happiness, some at that of the others, that one would have supposed a heavy calamity had fallen upon them all. Even Sancho Panza was weeping; though afterwards he said he only wept because he saw that Dorothea was not as he fancied the queen Micomicona, of whom he expected such great favours. Their wonder as well as their weeping lasted some time, and then Cardenio and Luscinda went and fell on their knees before Don Fernando, returning him thanks for the favour he had rendered them in language so grateful that he knew not how to answer them, and raising them up embraced them with every mark of affection and courtesy. He then asked Dorothea how she had managed to reach a place so far removed from her own home, and she in a few fitting words told all that she had previously related to Cardenio, with which Don Fernando and his companions were so delighted that they wished the story had been longer; so charmingly did Dorothea describe her misadventures. When she had finished Don Fernando recounted what had befallen him in the city after he had found in Luscinda\u2019s bosom the paper in which she declared that she was Cardenio\u2019s wife, and never could be his. He said he meant to kill her, and would have done so had he not been prevented by her parents, and that he quitted the house full of rage and shame, and resolved to avenge himself when a more convenient opportunity should offer.", " And as we have this consolation springing from no very visionary hope or wild fancy, I entreat you, se\u00f1ora, to form new resolutions in your better mind, as I mean to do in mine, preparing yourself to look forward to happier fortunes; for I swear to you by the faith of a gentleman and a Christian not to desert you until I see you in possession of Don Fernando, and if I cannot by words induce him to recognise his obligation to you, in that case to avail myself of the right which my rank as a gentleman gives me, and with just cause challenge him on account of the injury he has done you, not regarding my own wrongs, which I shall leave to Heaven to avenge, while I on earth devote myself to yours.\u201d Cardenio\u2019s words completed the astonishment of Dorothea, and not knowing how to return thanks for such an offer, she attempted to kiss his feet; but Cardenio would not permit it, and the licentiate replied for both, commended the sound reasoning of Cardenio, and lastly, begged, advised, and urged them to come with him to his village, where they might furnish themselves with what they needed, and take measures to discover Don Fernando, or restore Dorothea to her parents, or do what seemed to them most advisable. Cardenio and Dorothea thanked him, and accepted the kind offer he made them; and the barber, who had been listening to all attentively and in silence, on his part some kindly words also, and with no less good-will than the curate offered his services in any way that might be of use to them.", " Cardenio then bade Dorothea return to her room, as he would endeavour to make the whole matter right, and they did as he desired. All the four who had come in quest of Don Luis had now come into the inn and surrounded him, urging him to return and console his father at once and without a moment\u2019s delay. He replied that he could not do so on any account until he had concluded some business in which his life, honour, and heart were at stake. The servants pressed him, saying that most certainly they would not return without him, and that they would take him away whether he liked it or not. \u201cYou shall not do that,\u201d replied Don Luis, \u201cunless you take me dead; though however you take me, it will be without life.\u201d By this time most of those in the inn had been attracted by the dispute, but particularly Cardenio, Don Fernando, his companions, the Judge, the curate, the barber, and Don Quixote; for he now considered there was no necessity for mounting guard over the castle any longer. Cardenio being already acquainted with the young man\u2019s story, asked the men who wanted to take him away, what object they had in seeking to carry off this youth against his will. \u201cOur object,\u201d said one of the four, \u201cis to save the life of his father, who is in danger of losing it through this gentleman\u2019s disappearance.\u201d Upon this Don Luis exclaimed, \u201cThere is no need to make my affairs public here; I am free, and I will return if I please; and if not, none of you shall compel me.\u201d \u201cReason will compel your worship,\u201d said the man, \u201cand if it has no power over you, it has power over us, to make us do what we came for, and what it is our duty to do.\u201d \u201cLet us hear what the whole affair is about,\u201d said the Judge at this; but the man, who knew him as a neighbour of theirs, replied, \u201cDo you not know this gentleman, Se\u00f1or Judge?"], "What does CountessTrifaldi have that she does not want?": [" \u201cAnd an unfortunate one,\u201d replied Gines, \u201cfor misfortune always persecutes good wit.\u201d \u201cIt persecutes rogues,\u201d said the commissary. \u201cI told you already to go gently, master commissary,\u201d said Pasamonte; \u201ctheir lordships yonder never gave you that staff to ill-treat us wretches here, but to conduct and take us where his majesty orders you; if not, by the life of-never mind\u2014; it may be that some day the stains made in the inn will come out in the scouring; let everyone hold his tongue and behave well and speak better; and now let us march on, for we have had quite enough of this entertainment.\u201d The commissary lifted his staff to strike Pasamonte in return for his threats, but Don Quixote came between them, and begged him not to ill-use him, as it was not too much to allow one who had his hands tied to have his tongue a trifle free; and turning to the whole chain of them he said: \u201cFrom all you have told me, dear brethren, make out clearly that though they have punished you for your faults, the punishments you are about to endure do not give you much pleasure, and that you go to them very much against the grain and against your will, and that perhaps this one\u2019s want of courage under torture, that one\u2019s want of money, the other\u2019s want of advocacy, and lastly the perverted judgment of the judge may have been the cause of your ruin and of your failure to obtain the justice you had on your side.", " Hence the cogitation and abstraction you found me in, and reason enough, what you have heard from me.\u201d Hearing this, my friend, giving himself a slap on the forehead and breaking into a hearty laugh, exclaimed, \u201cBefore God, Brother, now am I disabused of an error in which I have been living all this long time I have known you, all through which I have taken you to be shrewd and sensible in all you do; but now I see you are as far from that as the heaven is from the earth. It is possible that things of so little moment and so easy to set right can occupy and perplex a ripe wit like yours, fit to break through and crush far greater obstacles? By my faith, this comes, not of any want of ability, but of too much indolence and too little knowledge of life. Do you want to know if I am telling the truth? Well, then, attend to me, and you will see how, in the opening and shutting of an eye, I sweep away all your difficulties, and supply all those deficiencies which you say check and discourage you from bringing before the world the story of your famous Don Quixote, the light and mirror of all knight-errantry.\u201d \u201cSay on,\u201d said I, listening to his talk; \u201chow do you propose to make up for my diffidence, and reduce to order this chaos of perplexity I am in?\u201d To which he made answer, \u201cYour first difficulty about the sonnets, epigrams, or complimentary verses which you want for the beginning, and which ought to be by persons of importance and rank, can be removed if you yourself take a little trouble to make them; you can afterwards baptise them, and put any name you like to them, fathering them on Prester John of the Indies or the Emperor of Trebizond, who, to my knowledge, were said to have been famous poets: and even if they were not, and any pedants or bachelors should attack you and question the fact, never care two maravedis for that, for even if they prove a lie against you they cannot cut off the hand you wrote it with.", " Come to the point without all this beating about the bush, and all these scraps and additions.\u201d \u201cI want your worship, se\u00f1or,\u201d said the farmer, \u201cto do me the favour of giving me a letter of recommendation to the girl\u2019s father, begging him to be so good as to let this marriage take place, as we are not ill-matched either in the gifts of fortune or of nature; for to tell the truth, se\u00f1or governor, my son is possessed of a devil, and there is not a day but the evil spirits torment him three or four times; and from having once fallen into the fire, he has his face puckered up like a piece of parchment, and his eyes watery and always running; but he has the disposition of an angel, and if it was not for belabouring and pummelling himself he\u2019d be a saint.\u201d \u201cIs there anything else you want, good man?\u201d said Sancho. \u201cThere\u2019s another thing I\u2019d like,\u201d said the farmer, \u201cbut I\u2019m afraid to mention it; however, out it must; for after all I can\u2019t let it be rotting in my breast, come what may. I mean, se\u00f1or, that I\u2019d like your worship to give me three hundred or six hundred ducats as a help to my bachelor\u2019s portion, to help him in setting up house; for they must, in short, live by themselves, without being subject to the interferences of their fathers-in-law.\u201d \u201cJust see if there\u2019s anything else you\u2019d like,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cand don\u2019t hold back from mentioning it out of bashfulness or modesty.\u201d \u201cNo, indeed there is not,\u201d said the farmer.", " The first that he opened he found to be \u201cDon Cirongilio of Thrace,\u201d and the second \u201cDon Felixmarte of Hircania,\u201d and the other the \u201cHistory of the Great Captain Gonzalo Hernandez de Cordova, with the Life of Diego Garc\u00eda de Paredes.\u201d When the curate read the two first titles he looked over at the barber and said, \u201cWe want my friend\u2019s housekeeper and niece here now.\u201d \u201cNay,\u201d said the barber, \u201cI can do just as well to carry them to the yard or to the hearth, and there is a very good fire there.\u201d \u201cWhat! your worship would burn my books!\u201d said the landlord. \u201cOnly these two,\u201d said the curate, \u201cDon Cirongilio, and Felixmarte.\u201d \u201cAre my books, then, heretics or phlegmatics that you want to burn them?\u201d said the landlord. \u201cSchismatics you mean, friend,\u201d said the barber, \u201cnot phlegmatics.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d said the landlord; \u201cbut if you want to burn any, let it be that about the Great Captain and that Diego Garc\u00eda; for I would rather have a child of mine burnt than either of the others.\u201d \u201cBrother,\u201d said the curate, \u201cthose two books are made up of lies, and are full of folly and nonsense; but this of the Great Captain is a true history, and contains the deeds of Gonzalo Hernandez of Cordova, who by his many and great achievements earned the title all over the world of the Great Captain, a famous and illustrious name, and deserved by him alone; and this Diego Garc\u00eda de Paredes was a distinguished knight of the city of Trujillo in Estremadura, a most gallant soldier, and of such bodily strength that with one finger he stopped a mill-wheel in full motion; and posted with a two-handed sword at the foot of a bridge he kept the whole of an immense army from passing over it, and achieved such other exploits that if, instead of his relating them himself with the modesty of a knight and of one writing his own history, some free and unbiased writer had recorded them, they would have thrown into the shade all the deeds of the Hectors, Achilleses, and Rolands.\u201d c32b.jpg (395K) Full Size \u201cTell that to my father,\u201d said the landlord."], "Who pretendsto be Princess Micomicona?": [" And the best of it is that this king, or prince, or whatever he is, is engaged in a very bitter war with another as powerful as himself, and the stranger knight, after having been some days at his court, requests leave from him to go and serve him in the said war. The king will grant it very readily, and the knight will courteously kiss his hands for the favour done to him; and that night he will take leave of his lady the princess at the grating of the chamber where she sleeps, which looks upon a garden, and at which he has already many times conversed with her, the go-between and confidante in the matter being a damsel much trusted by the princess. He will sigh, she will swoon, the damsel will fetch water, much distressed because morning approaches, and for the honour of her lady he would not that they were discovered; at last the princess will come to herself and will present her white hands through the grating to the knight, who will kiss them a thousand and a thousand times, bathing them with his tears. It will be arranged between them how they are to inform each other of their good or evil fortunes, and the princess will entreat him to make his absence as short as possible, which he will promise to do with many oaths; once more he kisses her hands, and takes his leave in such grief that he is well-nigh ready to die. He betakes him thence to his chamber, flings himself on his bed, cannot sleep for sorrow at parting, rises early in the morning, goes to take leave of the king, queen, and princess, and, as he takes his leave of the pair, it is told him that the princess is indisposed and cannot receive a visit; the knight thinks it is from grief at his departure, his heart is pierced, and he is hardly able to keep from showing his pain.", " IN WHICH IS CONTINUED THE STORY OF THE FAMOUS PRINCESS MICOMICONA, WITH OTHER DROLL ADVENTURES c37a.jpg (159K) Full Size To all this Sancho listened with no little sorrow at heart to see how his hopes of dignity were fading away and vanishing in smoke, and how the fair Princess Micomicona had turned into Dorothea, and the giant into Don Fernando, while his master was sleeping tranquilly, totally unconscious of all that had come to pass. Dorothea was unable to persuade herself that her present happiness was not all a dream; Cardenio was in a similar state of mind, and Luscinda\u2019s thoughts ran in the same direction. Don Fernando gave thanks to Heaven for the favour shown to him and for having been rescued from the intricate labyrinth in which he had been brought so near the destruction of his good name and of his soul; and in short everybody in the inn was full of contentment and satisfaction at the happy issue of such a complicated and hopeless business. The curate as a sensible man made sound reflections upon the whole affair, and congratulated each upon his good fortune; but the one that was in the highest spirits and good humour was the landlady, because of the promise Cardenio and the curate had given her to pay for all the losses and damage she had sustained through Don Quixote\u2019s means. Sancho, as has been already said, was the only one who was distressed, unhappy, and dejected; and so with a long face he went in to his master, who had just awoke, and said to him: \u201cSir Rueful Countenance, your worship may as well sleep on as much as you like, without troubling yourself about killing any giant or restoring her kingdom to the princess; for that is all over and settled now.\u201d \u201cI should think it was,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cfor I have had the most prodigious and stupendous battle with the giant that I ever remember having had all the days of my life; and with one back-stroke\u2014swish!\u2014I brought his head tumbling to the ground, and so much blood gushed forth from him that it ran in rivulets over the earth like water.\u201d \u201cLike red wine, your worship had better say,\u201d replied Sancho; \u201cfor I would have you know, if you don\u2019t know it, that the dead giant is a hacked wine-skin, and the blood four-and-twenty gallons of red wine that it had in its belly, and the cut-off head is the bitch that bore me; and the devil take it all.\u201d \u201cWhat art thou talking about, fool?\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cart thou in thy senses?\u201d \u201cLet your worship get up,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cand you will see the nice business you have made of it, and what we have to pay; and you will see the queen turned into a private lady called Dorothea, and other things that will astonish you, if you understand them.\u201d \u201cI shall not be surprised at anything of the kind,\u201d returned Don Quixote; \u201cfor if thou dost remember the last time we were here I told thee that everything that happened here was a matter of enchantment, and it would be no wonder if it were the same now.\u201d \u201cI could believe all that,\u201d replied Sancho, \u201cif my blanketing was the same sort of thing also; only it wasn\u2019t, but real and genuine; for I saw the landlord, who is here to-day, holding one end of the blanket and jerking me up to the skies very neatly and smartly, and with as much laughter as strength; and when it comes to be a case of knowing people, I hold for my part, simple and sinner as I am, that there is no enchantment about it at all, but a great deal of bruising and bad luck.\u201d \u201cWell, well, God will give a remedy,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201chand me my clothes and let me go out, for I want to see these transformations and things thou speakest of.\u201d Sancho fetched him his clothes; and while he was dressing, the curate gave Don Fernando and the others present an account of Don Quixote\u2019s madness and of the stratagem they had made use of to withdraw him from that Pena Pobre where he fancied himself stationed because of his lady\u2019s scorn.", " But one thing among others I would beg of you, se\u00f1or licentiate, which is, that, to prevent my master taking a fancy to be an archbishop, for that is what I\u2019m afraid of, your worship would recommend him to marry this princess at once; for in this way he will be disabled from taking archbishop\u2019s orders, and will easily come into his empire, and I to the end of my desires; I have been thinking over the matter carefully, and by what I can make out I find it will not do for me that my master should become an archbishop, because I am no good for the Church, as I am married; and for me now, having as I have a wife and children, to set about obtaining dispensations to enable me to hold a place of profit under the Church, would be endless work; so that, se\u00f1or, it all turns on my master marrying this lady at once\u2014for as yet I do not know her grace, and so I cannot call her by her name.\u201d \u201cShe is called the Princess Micomicona,\u201d said the curate; \u201cfor as her kingdom is Micomicon, it is clear that must be her name.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt of that,\u201d replied Sancho, \u201cfor I have known many to take their name and title from the place where they were born and call themselves Pedro of Alcal\u00e1, Juan of \u00dabeda, and Diego of Valladolid; and it may be that over there in Guinea queens have the same way of taking the names of their kingdoms.\u201d \u201cSo it may,\u201d said the curate; \u201cand as for your master\u2019s marrying, I will do all in my power towards it:\u201d with which Sancho was as much pleased as the curate was amazed at his simplicity and at seeing what a hold the absurdities of his master had taken of his fancy, for he had evidently persuaded himself that he was going to be an emperor.", " Dost thou not hear what that clown is singing?\u201d \u201cI do,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cbut what has Roncesvalles chase to do with what we have in hand? He might just as well be singing the ballad of Calainos, for any good or ill that can come to us in our business.\u201d By this time the labourer had come up, and Don Quixote asked him, \u201cCan you tell me, worthy friend, and God speed you, whereabouts here is the palace of the peerless princess Do\u00f1a Dulcinea del Toboso?\u201d \u201cSe\u00f1or,\u201d replied the lad, \u201cI am a stranger, and I have been only a few days in the town, doing farm work for a rich farmer. In that house opposite there live the curate of the village and the sacristan, and both or either of them will be able to give your worship some account of this lady princess, for they have a list of all the people of El Toboso; though it is my belief there is not a princess living in the whole of it; many ladies there are, of quality, and in her own house each of them may be a princess.\u201d \u201cWell, then, she I am inquiring for will be one of these, my friend,\u201d said Don Quixote. \u201cMay be so,\u201d replied the lad; \u201cGod be with you, for here comes the daylight;\u201d and without waiting for any more of his questions, he whipped on his mules. Sancho, seeing his master downcast and somewhat dissatisfied, said to him, \u201cSe\u00f1or, daylight will be here before long, and it will not do for us to let the sun find us in the street; it will be better for us to quit the city, and for your worship to hide in some forest in the neighbourhood, and I will come back in the daytime, and I won\u2019t leave a nook or corner of the whole village that I won\u2019t search for the house, castle, or palace, of my lady, and it will be hard luck for me if I don\u2019t find it; and as soon as I have found it I will speak to her grace, and tell her where and how your worship is waiting for her to arrange some plan for you to see her without any damage to her honour and reputation.\u201d \u201cSancho,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cthou hast delivered a thousand sentences condensed in the compass of a few words; I thank thee for the advice thou hast given me, and take it most gladly."], "How does Sanchoprove that Don Quixote is not actually enchanted in the cage?": [" I know and feel that I am enchanted, and that is enough to ease my conscience; for it would weigh heavily on it if I thought that I was not enchanted, and that in a faint-hearted and cowardly way I allowed myself to lie in this cage, defrauding multitudes of the succour I might afford to those in need and distress, who at this very moment may be in sore want of my aid and protection.\u201d \u201cStill for all that,\u201d replied Sancho, \u201cI say that, for your greater and fuller satisfaction, it would be well if your worship were to try to get out of this prison (and I promise to do all in my power to help, and even to take you out of it), and see if you could once more mount your good Rocinante, who seems to be enchanted too, he is so melancholy and dejected; and then we might try our chance in looking for adventures again; and if we have no luck there will be time enough to go back to the cage; in which, on the faith of a good and loyal squire, I promise to shut myself up along with your worship, if so be you are so unfortunate, or I so stupid, as not to be able to carry out my plan.\u201d \u201cI am content to do as thou sayest, brother Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand when thou seest an opportunity for effecting my release I will obey thee absolutely; but thou wilt see, Sancho, how mistaken thou art in thy conception of my misfortune.\u201d The knight-errant and the ill-errant squire kept up their conversation till they reached the place where the curate, the canon, and the barber, who had already dismounted, were waiting for them.", " The carter at once unyoked the oxen and left them to roam at large about the pleasant green spot, the freshness of which seemed to invite, not enchanted people like Don Quixote, but wide-awake, sensible folk like his squire, who begged the curate to allow his master to leave the cage for a little; for if they did not let him out, the prison might not be as clean as the propriety of such a gentleman as his master required. The curate understood him, and said he would very gladly comply with his request, only that he feared his master, finding himself at liberty, would take to his old courses and make off where nobody could ever find him again. \u201cI will answer for his not running away,\u201d said Sancho. \u201cAnd I also,\u201d said the canon, \u201cespecially if he gives me his word as a knight not to leave us without our consent.\u201d Don Quixote, who was listening to all this, said, \u201cI give it;\u2014moreover one who is enchanted as I am cannot do as he likes with himself; for he who had enchanted him could prevent his moving from one place for three ages, and if he attempted to escape would bring him back flying.\u201d\u2014And that being so, they might as well release him, particularly as it would be to the advantage of all; for, if they did not let him out, he protested he would be unable to avoid offending their nostrils unless they kept their distance. The canon took his hand, tied together as they both were, and on his word and promise they unbound him, and rejoiced beyond measure he was to find himself out of the cage.", " \u201cIn that case,\u201d said the canon, \u201ctake all the beasts there, and bring the sumpter mule back.\u201d While this was going on, Sancho, perceiving that he could speak to his master without having the curate and the barber, of whom he had his suspicions, present all the time, approached the cage in which Don Quixote was placed, and said, \u201cSe\u00f1or, to ease my conscience I want to tell you the state of the case as to your enchantment, and that is that these two here, with their faces covered, are the curate of our village and the barber; and I suspect they have hit upon this plan of carrying you off in this fashion, out of pure envy because your worship surpasses them in doing famous deeds; and if this be the truth it follows that you are not enchanted, but hoodwinked and made a fool of. And to prove this I want to ask you one thing; and if you answer me as I believe you will answer, you will be able to lay your finger on the trick, and you will see that you are not enchanted but gone wrong in your wits.\u201d \u201cAsk what thou wilt, Sancho my son,\u201d returned Don Quixote, \u201cfor I will satisfy thee and answer all thou requirest. As to what thou sayest, that these who accompany us yonder are the curate and the barber, our neighbours and acquaintances, it is very possible that they may seem to be those same persons; but that they are so in reality and in fact, believe it not on any account; what thou art to believe and think is that, if they look like them, as thou sayest, it must be that those who have enchanted me have taken this shape and likeness; for it is easy for enchanters to take any form they please, and they may have taken those of our friends in order to make thee think as thou dost, and lead thee into a labyrinth of fancies from which thou wilt find no escape though thou hadst the cord of Theseus; and they may also have done it to make me uncertain in my mind, and unable to conjecture whence this evil comes to me; for if on the one hand thou dost tell me that the barber and curate of our village are here in company with us, and on the other I find myself shut up in a cage, and know in my heart that no power on earth that was not supernatural would have been able to shut me in, what wouldst thou have me say or think, but that my enchantment is of a sort that transcends all I have ever read of in all the histories that deal with knights-errant that have been enchanted?", " I have said all this, se\u00f1or curate, only to urge your paternity to lay to your conscience your ill-treatment of my master; and have a care that God does not call you to account in another life for making a prisoner of him in this way, and charge against you all the succours and good deeds that my lord Don Quixote leaves undone while he is shut up. \u201cTrim those lamps there!\u201d exclaimed the barber at this; \u201cso you are of the same fraternity as your master, too, Sancho? By God, I begin to see that you will have to keep him company in the cage, and be enchanted like him for having caught some of his humour and chivalry. It was an evil hour when you let yourself be got with child by his promises, and that island you long so much for found its way into your head.\u201d \u201cI am not with child by anyone,\u201d returned Sancho, \u201cnor am I a man to let myself be got with child, if it was by the King himself. Though I am poor I am an old Christian, and I owe nothing to nobody, and if I long for an island, other people long for worse. Each of us is the son of his own works; and being a man I may come to be pope, not to say governor of an island, especially as my master may win so many that he will not know whom to give them to. Mind how you talk, master barber; for shaving is not everything, and there is some difference between Peter and Peter. I say this because we all know one another, and it will not do to throw false dice with me; and as to the enchantment of my master, God knows the truth; leave it as it is; it only makes it worse to stir it.\u201d The barber did not care to answer Sancho lest by his plain speaking he should disclose what the curate and he himself were trying so hard to conceal; and under the same apprehension the curate had asked the canon to ride on a little in advance, so that he might tell him the mystery of this man in the cage, and other things that would amuse him."], "Who wrote thefalse Second Part of Don Quixote, in which DonAlvaro brings Don Quixote to be cured?": [" Supper-time having come, then, Don Quixote betook himself to his room, the landlord brought in the stew-pan just as it was, and he sat himself down to sup very resolutely. It seems that in another room, which was next to Don Quixote\u2019s, with nothing but a thin partition to separate it, he overheard these words, \u201cAs you live, Se\u00f1or Don Jeronimo, while they are bringing supper, let us read another chapter of the Second Part of \u2018Don Quixote of La Mancha.\u2019\u201d The instant Don Quixote heard his own name he started to his feet and listened with open ears to catch what they said about him, and heard the Don Jeronimo who had been addressed say in reply, \u201cWhy would you have us read that absurd stuff, Don Juan, when it is impossible for anyone who has read the First Part of the history of \u2018Don Quixote of La Mancha\u2019 to take any pleasure in reading this Second Part?\u201d \u201cFor all that,\u201d said he who was addressed as Don Juan, \u201cwe shall do well to read it, for there is no book so bad but it has something good in it. What displeases me most in it is that it represents Don Quixote as now cured of his love for Dulcinea del Toboso.\u201d On hearing this Don Quixote, full of wrath and indignation, lifted up his voice and said, \u201cWhoever he may be who says that Don Quixote of La Mancha has forgotten or can forget Dulcinea del Toboso, I will teach him with equal arms that what he says is very far from the truth; for neither can the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso be forgotten, nor can forgetfulness have a place in Don Quixote; his motto is constancy, and his profession to maintain the same with his life and never wrong it.\u201d \u201cWho is this that answers us?\u201d said they in the next room.", " Let each look to himself and not try to make out white black, and black white; for each of us is as God made him, aye, and often worse.\u201d \u201cI will take care,\u201d said Carrasco, \u201cto impress upon the author of the history that, if he prints it again, he must not forget what worthy Sancho has said, for it will raise it a good span higher.\u201d \u201cIs there anything else to correct in the history, se\u00f1or bachelor?\u201d asked Don Quixote. \u201cNo doubt there is,\u201d replied he; \u201cbut not anything that will be of the same importance as those I have mentioned.\u201d \u201cDoes the author promise a second part at all?\u201d said Don Quixote. \u201cHe does promise one,\u201d replied Samson; \u201cbut he says he has not found it, nor does he know who has got it; and we cannot say whether it will appear or not; and so, on that head, as some say that no second part has ever been good, and others that enough has been already written about Don Quixote, it is thought there will be no second part; though some, who are jovial rather than saturnine, say, \u2018Let us have more Quixotades, let Don Quixote charge and Sancho chatter, and no matter what it may turn out, we shall be satisfied with that.\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd what does the author mean to do?\u201d said Don Quixote. \u201cWhat?\u201d replied Samson; \u201cwhy, as soon as he has found the history which he is now searching for with extraordinary diligence, he will at once give it to the press, moved more by the profit that may accrue to him from doing so than by any thought of praise.\u201d Whereat Sancho observed, \u201cThe author looks for money and profit, does he?", " Approaching a cage in which there was a furious madman, though just at that moment calm and quiet, the licentiate said to him, \u2018Brother, think if you have any commands for me, for I am going home, as God has been pleased, in his infinite goodness and mercy, without any merit of mine, to restore me my reason. I am now cured and in my senses, for with God\u2019s power nothing is impossible. Have strong hope and trust in him, for as he has restored me to my original condition, so likewise he will restore you if you trust in him. I will take care to send you some good things to eat; and be sure you eat them; for I would have you know I am convinced, as one who has gone through it, that all this madness of ours comes of having the stomach empty and the brains full of wind. Take courage! take courage! for despondency in misfortune breaks down health and brings on death.\u2019 \u201cTo all these words of the licentiate another madman in a cage opposite that of the furious one was listening; and raising himself up from an old mat on which he lay stark naked, he asked in a loud voice who it was that was going away cured and in his senses. The licentiate answered, \u2018It is I, brother, who am going; I have now no need to remain here any longer, for which I return infinite thanks to Heaven that has had so great mercy upon me.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Mind what you are saying, licentiate; don\u2019t let the devil deceive you,\u2019 replied the madman.", " \u2018Keep quiet, stay where you are, and you will save yourself the trouble of coming back.\u2019 \u201c\u2018I know I am cured,\u2019 returned the licentiate, \u2018and that I shall not have to go stations again.\u2019 \u201c\u2018You cured!\u2019 said the madman; \u2018well, we shall see; God be with you; but I swear to you by Jupiter, whose majesty I represent on earth, that for this crime alone, which Seville is committing to-day in releasing you from this house, and treating you as if you were in your senses, I shall have to inflict such a punishment on it as will be remembered for ages and ages, amen. Dost thou not know, thou miserable little licentiate, that I can do it, being, as I say, Jupiter the Thunderer, who hold in my hands the fiery bolts with which I am able and am wont to threaten and lay waste the world? But in one way only will I punish this ignorant town, and that is by not raining upon it, nor on any part of its district or territory, for three whole years, to be reckoned from the day and moment when this threat is pronounced. Thou free, thou cured, thou in thy senses! and I mad, I disordered, I bound! I will as soon think of sending rain as of hanging myself. \u201cThose present stood listening to the words and exclamations of the madman; but our licentiate, turning to the chaplain and seizing him by the hands, said to him, \u2018Be not uneasy, se\u00f1or; attach no importance to what this madman has said; for if he is Jupiter and will not send rain, I, who am Neptune, the father and god of the waters, will rain as often as it pleases me and may be needful.\u2019 \u201cThe governor and the bystanders laughed, and at their laughter the chaplain was half ashamed, and he replied, \u2018For all that, Se\u00f1or Neptune, it will not do to vex Se\u00f1or Jupiter; remain where you are, and some other day, when there is a better opportunity and more time, we will come back for you.\u2019 So they stripped the licentiate, and he was left where he was; and that\u2019s the end of the story.\u201d \u201cSo that\u2019s the story, master barber,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cwhich came in so pat to the purpose that you could not help telling it?"], "How does DonQuixote die?": [" Out of pure vexation he remained without eating, and out of pure politeness Sancho did not venture to touch a morsel of what was before him, but waited for his master to act as taster. Seeing, however, that, absorbed in thought, he was forgetting to carry the bread to his mouth, he said never a word, and trampling every sort of good breeding under foot, began to stow away in his paunch the bread and cheese that came to his hand. p59b.jpg (370K) Full Size \u201cEat, Sancho my friend,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201csupport life, which is of more consequence to thee than to me, and leave me to die under the pain of my thoughts and pressure of my misfortunes. I was born, Sancho, to live dying, and thou to die eating; and to prove the truth of what I say, look at me, printed in histories, famed in arms, courteous in behaviour, honoured by princes, courted by maidens; and after all, when I looked forward to palms, triumphs, and crowns, won and earned by my valiant deeds, I have this morning seen myself trampled on, kicked, and crushed by the feet of unclean and filthy animals. This thought blunts my teeth, paralyses my jaws, cramps my hands, and robs me of all appetite for food; so much so that I have a mind to let myself die of hunger, the cruelest death of all deaths.\u201d \u201cSo then,\u201d said Sancho, munching hard all the time, \u201cyour worship does not agree with the proverb that says, \u2018Let Martha die, but let her die with a full belly.\u2019 I, at any rate, have no mind to kill myself; so far from that, I mean to do as the cobbler does, who stretches the leather with his teeth until he makes it reach as far as he wants.", " The judges held a consultation over the oath, and they said, \u2018If we let this man pass free he has sworn falsely, and by the law he ought to die; but if we hang him, as he swore he was going to die on that gallows, and therefore swore the truth, by the same law he ought to go free.\u2019 It is asked of your worship, se\u00f1or governor, what are the judges to do with this man? For they are still in doubt and perplexity; and having heard of your worship\u2019s acute and exalted intellect, they have sent me to entreat your worship on their behalf to give your opinion on this very intricate and puzzling case.\u201d To this Sancho made answer, \u201cIndeed those gentlemen the judges that send you to me might have spared themselves the trouble, for I have more of the obtuse than the acute in me; but repeat the case over again, so that I may understand it, and then perhaps I may be able to hit the point.\u201d The querist repeated again and again what he had said before, and then Sancho said, \u201cIt seems to me I can set the matter right in a moment, and in this way; the man swears that he is going to die upon the gallows; but if he dies upon it, he has sworn the truth, and by the law enacted deserves to go free and pass over the bridge; but if they don\u2019t hang him, then he has sworn falsely, and by the same law deserves to be hanged.\u201d \u201cIt is as the se\u00f1or governor says,\u201d said the messenger; \u201cand as regards a complete comprehension of the case, there is nothing left to desire or hesitate about.\u201d \u201cWell then I say,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cthat of this man they should let pass the part that has sworn truly, and hang the part that has lied; and in this way the conditions of the passage will be fully complied with.\u201d \u201cBut then, se\u00f1or governor,\u201d replied the querist, \u201cthe man will have to be divided into two parts; and if he is divided of course he will die; and so none of the requirements of the law will be carried out, and it is absolutely necessary to comply with it.\u201d \u201cLook here, my good sir,\u201d said Sancho; \u201ceither I\u2019m a numskull or else there is the same reason for this passenger dying as for his living and passing over the bridge; for if the truth saves him the falsehood equally condemns him; and that being the case it is my opinion you should say to the gentlemen who sent you to me that as the arguments for condemning him and for absolving him are exactly balanced, they should let him pass freely, as it is always more praiseworthy to do good than to do evil; this I would give signed with my name if I knew how to sign; and what I have said in this case is not out of my own head, but one of the many precepts my master Don Quixote gave me the night before I left to become governor of this island, that came into my mind, and it was this, that when there was any doubt about the justice of a case I should lean to mercy; and it is God\u2019s will that I should recollect it now, for it fits this case as if it was made for it.\u201d \u201cThat is true,\u201d said the majordomo; \u201cand I maintain that Lycurgus himself, who gave laws to the Lacedemonians, could not have pronounced a better decision than the great Panza has given; let the morning\u2019s audience close with this, and I will see that the se\u00f1or governor has dinner entirely to his liking.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s all I ask for\u2014fair play,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cgive me my dinner, and then let it rain cases and questions on me, and I\u2019ll despatch them in a twinkling.\u201d The majordomo kept his word, for he felt it against his conscience to kill so wise a governor by hunger; particularly as he intended to have done with him that same night, playing off the last joke he was commissioned to practise upon him.", " \u201cAlas,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cwhat unexpected accidents happen at every step to those who live in this miserable world! Who would have said that one who saw himself yesterday sitting on a throne, governor of an island, giving orders to his servants and his vassals, would see himself to-day buried in a pit without a soul to help him, or servant or vassal to come to his relief? Here must we perish with hunger, my ass and myself, if indeed we don\u2019t die first, he of his bruises and injuries, and I of grief and sorrow. At any rate I\u2019ll not be as lucky as my master Don Quixote of La Mancha, when he went down into the cave of that enchanted Montesinos, where he found people to make more of him than if he had been in his own house; for it seems he came in for a table laid out and a bed ready made. There he saw fair and pleasant visions, but here I\u2019ll see, I imagine, toads and adders. Unlucky wretch that I am, what an end my follies and fancies have come to! They\u2019ll take up my bones out of this, when it is heaven\u2019s will that I\u2019m found, picked clean, white and polished, and my good Dapple\u2019s with them, and by that, perhaps, it will be found out who we are, at least by such as have heard that Sancho Panza never separated from his ass, nor his ass from Sancho Panza. Unlucky wretches, I say again, that our hard fate should not let us die in our own country and among our own people, where if there was no help for our misfortune, at any rate there would be someone to grieve for it and to close our eyes as we passed away!", " Nay, tell me, how many histories are there filled with these marvels? If only (in an evil hour for me: I don\u2019t speak for anyone else) the famous Don Belianis were alive now, or anyone of the innumerable progeny of Amadis of Gaul! If any these were alive to-day, and were to come face to face with the Turk, by my faith, I would not give much for the Turk\u2019s chance. But God will have regard for his people, and will provide someone, who, if not so valiant as the knights-errant of yore, at least will not be inferior to them in spirit; but God knows what I mean, and I say no more.\u201d \u201cAlas!\u201d exclaimed the niece at this, \u201cmay I die if my master does not want to turn knight-errant again;\u201d to which Don Quixote replied, \u201cA knight-errant I shall die, and let the Turk come down or go up when he likes, and in as strong force as he can, once more I say, God knows what I mean.\u201d But here the barber said, \u201cI ask your worships to give me leave to tell a short story of something that happened in Seville, which comes so pat to the purpose just now that I should like greatly to tell it.\u201d Don Quixote gave him leave, and the rest prepared to listen, and he began thus: \u201cIn the madhouse at Seville there was a man whom his relations had placed there as being out of his mind. He was a graduate of Osuna in canon law; but even if he had been of Salamanca, it was the opinion of most people that he would have been mad all the same."], "Why does Sanchowhip the trees?": [" p60c.jpg (250K) Full Size Sancho rose and removed some distance from the spot, but as he was about to place himself leaning against another tree he felt something touch his head, and putting up his hands encountered somebody\u2019s two feet with shoes and stockings on them. He trembled with fear and made for another tree, where the very same thing happened to him, and he fell a-shouting, calling upon Don Quixote to come and protect him. Don Quixote did so, and asked him what had happened to him, and what he was afraid of. Sancho replied that all the trees were full of men\u2019s feet and legs. Don Quixote felt them, and guessed at once what it was, and said to Sancho, \u201cThou hast nothing to be afraid of, for these feet and legs that thou feelest but canst not see belong no doubt to some outlaws and freebooters that have been hanged on these trees; for the authorities in these parts are wont to hang them up by twenties and thirties when they catch them; whereby I conjecture that I must be near Barcelona;\u201d and it was, in fact, as he supposed; with the first light they looked up and saw that the fruit hanging on those trees were freebooters\u2019 bodies. And now day dawned; and if the dead freebooters had scared them, their hearts were no less troubled by upwards of forty living ones, who all of a sudden surrounded them, and in the Catalan tongue bade them stand and wait until their captain came up.", " And if this be true, as it is, why should I now take the trouble to strip stark naked, or do mischief to these trees which have done me no harm, or why am I to disturb the clear waters of these brooks which will give me to drink whenever I have a mind? Long live the memory of Amadis and let him be imitated so far as is possible by Don Quixote of La Mancha, of whom it will be said, as was said of the other, that if he did not achieve great things, he died in attempting them; and if I am not repulsed or rejected by my Dulcinea, it is enough for me, as I have said, to be absent from her. And so, now to business; come to my memory ye deeds of Amadis, and show me how I am to begin to imitate you. I know already that what he chiefly did was to pray and commend himself to God; but what am I to do for a rosary, for I have not got one?\u201d And then it occurred to him how he might make one, and that was by tearing a great strip off the tail of his shirt which hung down, and making eleven knots on it, one bigger than the rest, and this served him for a rosary all the time he was there, during which he repeated countless ave-marias. But what distressed him greatly was not having another hermit there to confess him and receive consolation from; and so he solaced himself with pacing up and down the little meadow, and writing and carving on the bark of the trees and on the fine sand a multitude of verses all in harmony with his sadness, and some in praise of Dulcinea; but, when he was found there afterwards, the only ones completely legible that could be discovered were those that follow here: Ye on the mountainside that grow, Ye green things all, trees, shrubs, and bushes, Are ye aweary of the woe That this poor aching bosom crushes?", " These I will stop out of what I have belonging to your worship, and I\u2019ll return home rich and content, though well whipped, for \u2018there\u2019s no taking trout\u2019\u2014but I say no more.\u201d \u201cO blessed Sancho! O dear Sancho!\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201chow we shall be bound to serve thee, Dulcinea and I, all the days of our lives that heaven may grant us! If she returns to her lost shape (and it cannot be but that she will) her misfortune will have been good fortune, and my defeat a most happy triumph. But look here, Sancho; when wilt thou begin the scourging? For if thou wilt make short work of it, I will give thee a hundred reals over and above.\u201d \u201cWhen?\u201d said Sancho; \u201cthis night without fail. Let your worship order it so that we pass it out of doors and in the open air, and I\u2019ll scarify myself.\u201d Night, longed for by Don Quixote with the greatest anxiety in the world, came at last, though it seemed to him that the wheels of Apollo\u2019s car had broken down, and that the day was drawing itself out longer than usual, just as is the case with lovers, who never make the reckoning of their desires agree with time. They made their way at length in among some pleasant trees that stood a little distance from the road, and there vacating Rocinante\u2019s saddle and Dapple\u2019s pack-saddle, they stretched themselves on the green grass and made their supper off Sancho\u2019s stores, and he making a powerful and flexible whip out of Dapple\u2019s halter and headstall retreated about twenty paces from his master among some beech trees.", " In this short interval Don Quixote told him of his unfortunate defeat, and of Dulcinea\u2019s enchantment and the remedy, all which threw Don \u00c1lvaro into fresh amazement, and embracing Don Quixote and Sancho, he went his way, and Don Quixote went his. That night he passed among trees again in order to give Sancho an opportunity of working out his penance, which he did in the same fashion as the night before, at the expense of the bark of the beech trees much more than of his back, of which he took such good care that the lashes would not have knocked off a fly had there been one there. The duped Don Quixote did not miss a single stroke of the count, and he found that together with those of the night before they made up three thousand and twenty-nine. The sun apparently had got up early to witness the sacrifice, and with his light they resumed their journey, discussing the deception practised on Don \u00c1lvaro, and saying how well done it was to have taken his declaration before a magistrate in such an unimpeachable form. That day and night they travelled on, nor did anything worth mention happen to them, unless it was that in the course of the night Sancho finished off his task, whereat Don Quixote was beyond measure joyful. He watched for daylight, to see if along the road he should fall in with his already disenchanted lady Dulcinea; and as he pursued his journey there was no woman he met that he did not go up to, to see if she was Dulcinea del Toboso, as he held it absolutely certain that Merlin\u2019s promises could not lie."], "Why does Cervantesend the First Part?": [" He is a much more important and prominent figure in the Second Part than in the First; indeed, it is his matchless mendacity about Dulcinea that to a great extent supplies the action of the story. His development in this respect is as remarkable as in any other. In the First Part he displays a great natural gift of lying. His lies are not of the highly imaginative sort that liars in fiction commonly indulge in; like Falstaff\u2019s, they resemble the father that begets them; they are simple, homely, plump lies; plain working lies, in short. But in the service of such a master as Don Quixote he develops rapidly, as we see when he comes to palm off the three country wenches as Dulcinea and her ladies in waiting. It is worth noticing how, flushed by his success in this instance, he is tempted afterwards to try a flight beyond his powers in his account of the journey on Clavile\u00f1o. In the Second Part it is the spirit rather than the incidents of the chivalry romances that is the subject of the burlesque. Enchantments of the sort travestied in those of Dulcinea and the Trifaldi and the cave of Montesinos play a leading part in the later and inferior romances, and another distinguishing feature is caricatured in Don Quixote\u2019s blind adoration of Dulcinea. In the romances of chivalry love is either a mere animalism or a fantastic idolatry. Only a coarse-minded man would care to make merry with the former, but to one of Cervantes\u2019 humour the latter was naturally an attractive subject for ridicule.", " To himself, too, his creations had become realities, and he had become proud of them, especially of Sancho. He began the Second Part, therefore, under very different conditions, and the difference makes itself manifest at once. Even in translation the style will be seen to be far easier, more flowing, more natural, and more like that of a man sure of himself and of his audience. Don Quixote and Sancho undergo a change also. In the First Part, Don Quixote has no character or individuality whatever. He is nothing more than a crazy representative of the sentiments of the chivalry romances. In all that he says and does he is simply repeating the lesson he has learned from his books; and therefore, it is absurd to speak of him in the gushing strain of the sentimental critics when they dilate upon his nobleness, disinterestedness, dauntless courage, and so forth. It was the business of a knight-errant to right wrongs, redress injuries, and succour the distressed, and this, as a matter of course, he makes his business when he takes up the part; a knight-errant was bound to be intrepid, and so he feels bound to cast fear aside. Of all Byron\u2019s melodious nonsense about Don Quixote, the most nonsensical statement is that \u201c\u2019tis his virtue makes him mad!\u201d The exact opposite is the truth; it is his madness makes him virtuous. In the Second Part, Cervantes repeatedly reminds the reader, as if it was a point upon which he was anxious there should be no mistake, that his hero\u2019s madness is strictly confined to delusions on the subject of chivalry, and that on every other subject he is discreto, one, in fact, whose faculty of discernment is in perfect order.", " Nay, it may well be that on those journeys into remote regions he came across now and then a specimen of the pauper gentleman, with his lean hack and his greyhound and his books of chivalry, dreaming away his life in happy ignorance that the world had changed since his great-grandfather\u2019s old helmet was new. But it was in Seville that he found out his true vocation, though he himself would not by any means have admitted it to be so. It was there, in Triana, that he was first tempted to try his hand at drawing from life, and first brought his humour into play in the exquisite little sketch of \u201cRinconete y Cortadillo,\u201d the germ, in more ways than one, of \u201cDon Quixote.\u201d Where and when that was written, we cannot tell. After his imprisonment all trace of Cervantes in his official capacity disappears, from which it may be inferred that he was not reinstated. That he was still in Seville in November 1598 appears from a satirical sonnet of his on the elaborate catafalque erected to testify the grief of the city at the death of Philip II, but from this up to 1603 we have no clue to his movements. The words in the preface to the First Part of \u201cDon Quixote\u201d are generally held to be conclusive that he conceived the idea of the book, and wrote the beginning of it at least, in a prison, and that he may have done so is extremely likely. There is a tradition that Cervantes read some portions of his work to a select audience at the Duke of Bejar\u2019s, which may have helped to make the book known; but the obvious conclusion is that the First Part of \u201cDon Quixote\u201d lay on his hands some time before he could find a publisher bold enough to undertake a venture of so novel a character; and so little faith in it had Francisco Robles of Madrid, to whom at last he sold it, that he did not care to incur the expense of securing the copyright for Aragon or Portugal, contenting himself with that for Castile.", " Supper-time having come, then, Don Quixote betook himself to his room, the landlord brought in the stew-pan just as it was, and he sat himself down to sup very resolutely. It seems that in another room, which was next to Don Quixote\u2019s, with nothing but a thin partition to separate it, he overheard these words, \u201cAs you live, Se\u00f1or Don Jeronimo, while they are bringing supper, let us read another chapter of the Second Part of \u2018Don Quixote of La Mancha.\u2019\u201d The instant Don Quixote heard his own name he started to his feet and listened with open ears to catch what they said about him, and heard the Don Jeronimo who had been addressed say in reply, \u201cWhy would you have us read that absurd stuff, Don Juan, when it is impossible for anyone who has read the First Part of the history of \u2018Don Quixote of La Mancha\u2019 to take any pleasure in reading this Second Part?\u201d \u201cFor all that,\u201d said he who was addressed as Don Juan, \u201cwe shall do well to read it, for there is no book so bad but it has something good in it. What displeases me most in it is that it represents Don Quixote as now cured of his love for Dulcinea del Toboso.\u201d On hearing this Don Quixote, full of wrath and indignation, lifted up his voice and said, \u201cWhoever he may be who says that Don Quixote of La Mancha has forgotten or can forget Dulcinea del Toboso, I will teach him with equal arms that what he says is very far from the truth; for neither can the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso be forgotten, nor can forgetfulness have a place in Don Quixote; his motto is constancy, and his profession to maintain the same with his life and never wrong it.\u201d \u201cWho is this that answers us?\u201d said they in the next room."], "Why does Sancho not takeDon Quixote to Dulcinea\u2019s house at the beginning of the Second Part?": [" Let each look to himself and not try to make out white black, and black white; for each of us is as God made him, aye, and often worse.\u201d \u201cI will take care,\u201d said Carrasco, \u201cto impress upon the author of the history that, if he prints it again, he must not forget what worthy Sancho has said, for it will raise it a good span higher.\u201d \u201cIs there anything else to correct in the history, se\u00f1or bachelor?\u201d asked Don Quixote. \u201cNo doubt there is,\u201d replied he; \u201cbut not anything that will be of the same importance as those I have mentioned.\u201d \u201cDoes the author promise a second part at all?\u201d said Don Quixote. \u201cHe does promise one,\u201d replied Samson; \u201cbut he says he has not found it, nor does he know who has got it; and we cannot say whether it will appear or not; and so, on that head, as some say that no second part has ever been good, and others that enough has been already written about Don Quixote, it is thought there will be no second part; though some, who are jovial rather than saturnine, say, \u2018Let us have more Quixotades, let Don Quixote charge and Sancho chatter, and no matter what it may turn out, we shall be satisfied with that.\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd what does the author mean to do?\u201d said Don Quixote. \u201cWhat?\u201d replied Samson; \u201cwhy, as soon as he has found the history which he is now searching for with extraordinary diligence, he will at once give it to the press, moved more by the profit that may accrue to him from doing so than by any thought of praise.\u201d Whereat Sancho observed, \u201cThe author looks for money and profit, does he?", " Supper-time having come, then, Don Quixote betook himself to his room, the landlord brought in the stew-pan just as it was, and he sat himself down to sup very resolutely.

But to return to the subject we were discussing just now, the enchantment of the lady Dulcinea, I look upon it as certain, and something more than evident, that Sancho\u2019s idea of practising a deception upon his master, making him believe that the peasant girl was Dulcinea and that if he did not recognise her it must be because she was enchanted, was all a device of one of the enchanters that persecute Don Quixote. For in truth and earnest, I know from good authority that the coarse country wench who jumped up on the ass was and is Dulcinea del Toboso, and that worthy Sancho, though he fancies himself the deceiver, is the one that is deceived; and that there is no more reason to doubt the truth of this, than of anything else we never saw. Se\u00f1or Sancho Panza must know that we too have enchanters here that are well disposed to us, and tell us what goes on in the world, plainly and distinctly, without subterfuge or deception; and believe me, Sancho, that agile country lass was and is Dulcinea del Toboso, who is as much enchanted as the mother that bore her; and when we least expect it, we shall see her in her own proper form, and then Sancho will be disabused of the error he is under at present.\u201d \u201cAll that\u2019s very possible,\u201d said Sancho Panza; \u201cand now I\u2019m willing to believe what my master says about what he saw in the cave of Montesinos, where he says he saw the lady Dulcinea del Toboso in the very same dress and apparel that I said I had seen her in when I enchanted her all to please myself."], "When duringthe novel does Don Quixote see Dulcinea for the first time?": [" The landlord was carrying away the valise and the books, but the curate said to him, \u201cWait; I want to see what those papers are that are written in such a good hand.\u201d The landlord taking them out handed them to him to read, and he perceived they were a work of about eight sheets of manuscript, with, in large letters at the beginning, the title of \u201cNovel of the Ill-advised Curiosity.\u201d The curate read three or four lines to himself, and said, \u201cI must say the title of this novel does not seem to me a bad one, and I feel an inclination to read it all.\u201d To which the landlord replied, \u201cThen your reverence will do well to read it, for I can tell you that some guests who have read it here have been much pleased with it, and have begged it of me very earnestly; but I would not give it, meaning to return it to the person who forgot the valise, books, and papers here, for maybe he will return here some time or other; and though I know I shall miss the books, faith I mean to return them; for though I am an innkeeper, still I am a Christian.\u201d \u201cYou are very right, friend,\u201d said the curate; \u201cbut for all that, if the novel pleases me you must let me copy it.\u201d \u201cWith all my heart,\u201d replied the host. While they were talking Cardenio had taken up the novel and begun to read it, and forming the same opinion of it as the curate, he begged him to read it so that they might all hear it. \u201cI would read it,\u201d said the curate, \u201cif the time would not be better spent in sleeping.\u201d \u201cIt will be rest enough for me,\u201d said Dorothea, \u201cto while away the time by listening to some tale, for my spirits are not yet tranquil enough to let me sleep when it would be seasonable.\u201d \u201cWell then, in that case,\u201d said the curate, \u201cI will read it, if it were only out of curiosity; perhaps it may contain something pleasant.\u201d Master Nicholas added his entreaties to the same effect, and Sancho too; seeing which, and considering that he would give pleasure to all, and receive it himself, the curate said, \u201cWell then, attend to me everyone, for the novel begins thus.\u201d c32e.jpg (11K) CHAPTER XXXIII.", " They all embraced one another, and promised to let each other know how things went with them, and Don Fernando directed the curate where to write to him, to tell him what became of Don Quixote, assuring him that there was nothing that could give him more pleasure than to hear of it, and that he too, on his part, would send him word of everything he thought he would like to know, about his marriage, Zoraida\u2019s baptism, Don Luis\u2019s affair, and Luscinda\u2019s return to her home. The curate promised to comply with his request carefully, and they embraced once more, and renewed their promises. The landlord approached the curate and handed him some papers, saying he had discovered them in the lining of the valise in which the novel of \u201cThe Ill-advised Curiosity\u201d had been found, and that he might take them all away with him as their owner had not since returned; for, as he could not read, he did not want them himself. The curate thanked him, and opening them he saw at the beginning of the manuscript the words, \u201cNovel of Rinconete and Cortadillo,\u201d by which he perceived that it was a novel, and as that of \u201cThe Ill-advised Curiosity\u201d had been good he concluded this would be so too, as they were both probably by the same author; so he kept it, intending to read it when he had an opportunity. He then mounted and his friend the barber did the same, both masked, so as not to be recognised by Don Quixote, and set out following in the rear of the cart.", " Lothario commended his purpose, and promised on his own part to aid him in raising a monument so glorious. And so Anselmo was left the most charmingly hoodwinked man there could be in the world. He himself, persuaded he was conducting the instrument of his glory, led home by the hand of him who had been the utter destruction of his good name; whom Camilla received with averted countenance, though with smiles in her heart. The deception was carried on for some time, until at the end of a few months Fortune turned her wheel and the guilt which had been until then so skilfully concealed was published abroad, and Anselmo paid with his life the penalty of his ill-advised curiosity. CHAPTER XXXV. WHICH TREATS OF THE HEROIC AND PRODIGIOUS BATTLE DON QUIXOTE HAD WITH CERTAIN SKINS OF RED WINE, AND BRINGS THE NOVEL OF \u201cTHE ILL-ADVISED CURIOSITY\u201d TO A CLOSE There remained but little more of the novel to be read, when Sancho Panza burst forth in wild excitement from the garret where Don Quixote was lying, shouting, \u201cRun, sirs! quick; and help my master, who is in the thick of the toughest and stiffest battle I ever laid eyes on. By the living God he has given the giant, the enemy of my lady the Princess Micomicona, such a slash that he has sliced his head clean off as if it were a turnip.\u201d \u201cWhat are you talking about, brother?\u201d said the curate, pausing as he was about to read the remainder of the novel.", " But one thing, se\u00f1or, troubles me more than all the rest, and that is thinking what is to be done when your worship conquers some giant, or some other knight, and orders him to go and present himself before the beauty of the lady Dulcinea. Where is this poor giant, or this poor wretch of a vanquished knight, to find her? I think I can see them wandering all over El Toboso, looking like noddies, and asking for my lady Dulcinea; and even if they meet her in the middle of the street they won\u2019t know her any more than they would my father.\u201d \u201cPerhaps, Sancho,\u201d returned Don Quixote, \u201cthe enchantment does not go so far as to deprive conquered and presented giants and knights of the power of recognising Dulcinea; we will try by experiment with one or two of the first I vanquish and send to her, whether they see her or not, by commanding them to return and give me an account of what happened to them in this respect.\u201d \u201cI declare, I think what your worship has proposed is excellent,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cand that by this plan we shall find out what we want to know; and if it be that it is only from your worship she is hidden, the misfortune will be more yours than hers; but so long as the lady Dulcinea is well and happy, we on our part will make the best of it, and get on as well as we can, seeking our adventures, and leaving Time to take his own course; for he is the best physician for these and greater ailments.\u201d Don Quixote was about to reply to Sancho Panza, but he was prevented by a cart crossing the road full of the most diverse and strange personages and figures that could be imagined."], "What does DonQuixote decide to do during his retirement?": [" Don Antonio reported to the viceroy what Carrasco told him, and the viceroy was not very well pleased to hear it, for with Don Quixote\u2019s retirement there was an end to the amusement of all who knew anything of his mad doings. Six days did Don Quixote keep his bed, dejected, melancholy, moody and out of sorts, brooding over the unhappy event of his defeat. Sancho strove to comfort him, and among other things he said to him, \u201cHold up your head, se\u00f1or, and be of good cheer if you can, and give thanks to heaven that if you have had a tumble to the ground you have not come off with a broken rib; and, as you know that \u2018where they give they take,\u2019 and that \u2018there are not always fletches where there are pegs,\u2019 a fig for the doctor, for there\u2019s no need of him to cure this ailment. Let us go home, and give over going about in search of adventures in strange lands and places; rightly looked at, it is I that am the greater loser, though it is your worship that has had the worse usage. With the government I gave up all wish to be a governor again, but I did not give up all longing to be a count; and that will never come to pass if your worship gives up becoming a king by renouncing the calling of chivalry; and so my hopes are going to turn into smoke.\u201d \u201cPeace, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cthou seest my suspension and retirement is not to exceed a year; I shall soon return to my honoured calling, and I shall not be at a loss for a kingdom to win and a county to bestow on thee.\u201d \u201cMay God hear it and sin be deaf,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cI have always heard say that \u2018a good hope is better than a bad holding.\u201d As they were talking Don Antonio came in looking extremely pleased and exclaiming, \u201cReward me for my good news, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote!", " He was deeply in love with a peasant girl, a vassal of his father\u2019s, the daughter of wealthy parents, and herself so beautiful, modest, discreet, and virtuous, that no one who knew her was able to decide in which of these respects she was most highly gifted or most excelled. The attractions of the fair peasant raised the passion of Don Fernando to such a point that, in order to gain his object and overcome her virtuous resolutions, he determined to pledge his word to her to become her husband, for to attempt it in any other way was to attempt an impossibility. Bound to him as I was by friendship, I strove by the best arguments and the most forcible examples I could think of to restrain and dissuade him from such a course; but perceiving I produced no effect I resolved to make the Duke Ricardo, his father, acquainted with the matter; but Don Fernando, being sharp-witted and shrewd, foresaw and apprehended this, perceiving that by my duty as a good servant I was bound not to keep concealed a thing so much opposed to the honour of my lord the duke; and so, to mislead and deceive me, he told me he could find no better way of effacing from his mind the beauty that so enslaved him than by absenting himself for some months, and that he wished the absence to be effected by our going, both of us, to my father\u2019s house under the pretence, which he would make to the duke, of going to see and buy some fine horses that there were in my city, which produces the best in the world.", " Our lacquey, however, was thinking of something very different; he only thought of what I am now going to mention. It seems that as he stood contemplating his enemy she struck him as the most beautiful woman he had ever seen all his life; and the little blind boy whom in our streets they commonly call Love had no mind to let slip the chance of triumphing over a lacquey heart, and adding it to the list of his trophies; and so, stealing gently upon him unseen, he drove a dart two yards long into the poor lacquey\u2019s left side and pierced his heart through and through; which he was able to do quite at his ease, for Love is invisible, and comes in and goes out as he likes, without anyone calling him to account for what he does. Well then, when they gave the signal for the onset our lacquey was in an ecstasy, musing upon the beauty of her whom he had already made mistress of his liberty, and so he paid no attention to the sound of the trumpet, unlike Don Quixote, who was off the instant he heard it, and, at the highest speed Rocinante was capable of, set out to meet his enemy, his good squire Sancho shouting lustily as he saw him start, \u201cGod guide thee, cream and flower of knights-errant! God give thee the victory, for thou hast the right on thy side!\u201d But though Tosilos saw Don Quixote coming at him he never stirred a step from the spot where he was posted; and instead of doing so called loudly to the marshal of the field, to whom when he came up to see what he wanted he said, \u201cSe\u00f1or, is not this battle to decide whether I marry or do not marry that lady?\u201d \u201cJust so,\u201d was the answer.", " The patience with which she endures the hardships that poverty brings with it, and the eagerness she shows to become a Christian, are such that they fill me with admiration, and bind me to serve her all my life; though the happiness I feel in seeing myself hers, and her mine, is disturbed and marred by not knowing whether I shall find any corner to shelter her in my own country, or whether time and death may not have made such changes in the fortunes and lives of my father and brothers, that I shall hardly find anyone who knows me, if they are not alive. I have no more of my story to tell you, gentlemen; whether it be an interesting or a curious one let your better judgments decide; all I can say is I would gladly have told it to you more briefly; although my fear of wearying you has made me leave out more than one circumstance. c41g.jpg (33K) CHAPTER XLII. WHICH TREATS OF WHAT FURTHER TOOK PLACE IN THE INN, AND OF SEVERAL OTHER THINGS WORTH KNOWING c42a.jpg (139K) Full Size With these words the captive held his peace, and Don Fernando said to him, \u201cIn truth, captain, the manner in which you have related this remarkable adventure has been such as befitted the novelty and strangeness of the matter. The whole story is curious and uncommon, and abounds with incidents that fill the hearers with wonder and astonishment; and so great is the pleasure we have found in listening to it that we should be glad if it were to begin again, even though to-morrow were to find us still occupied with the same tale.\u201d And while he said this Cardenio and the rest of them offered to be of service to him in any way that lay in their power, and in words and language so kindly and sincere that the captain was much gratified by their good-will."], "Why does DonQuixote sing to Altisidora?": [" He set himself to listen attentively, and those below raised their voices so that he could hear these words: \u201cUrge me not to sing, Emerencia, for thou knowest that ever since this stranger entered the castle and my eyes beheld him, I cannot sing but only weep; besides my lady is a light rather than a heavy sleeper, and I would not for all the wealth of the world that she found us here; and even if she were asleep and did not waken, my singing would be in vain, if this strange \u00c6neas, who has come into my neighbourhood to flout me, sleeps on and wakens not to hear it.\u201d \u201cHeed not that, dear Altisidora,\u201d replied a voice; \u201cthe duchess is no doubt asleep, and everybody in the house save the lord of thy heart and disturber of thy soul; for just now I perceived him open the grated window of his chamber, so he must be awake; sing, my poor sufferer, in a low sweet tone to the accompaniment of thy harp; and even if the duchess hears us we can lay the blame on the heat of the night.\u201d \u201cThat is not the point, Emerencia,\u201d replied Altisidora, \u201cit is that I would not that my singing should lay bare my heart, and that I should be thought a light and wanton maiden by those who know not the mighty power of love; but come what may; better a blush on the cheeks than a sore in the heart;\u201d and here a harp softly touched made itself heard. As he listened to all this Don Quixote was in a state of breathless amazement, for immediately the countless adventures like this, with windows, gratings, gardens, serenades, lovemakings, and languishings, that he had read of in his trashy books of chivalry, came to his mind.", " All this, having been taken down by his chronicler, was at once despatched to the duke, who was looking out for it with great eagerness; and here let us leave the good Sancho; for his master, sorely troubled in mind by Altisidora\u2019s music, has pressing claims upon us now. p45e.jpg (11K) CHAPTER XLVI. OF THE TERRIBLE BELL AND CAT FRIGHT THAT DON QUIXOTE GOT IN THE COURSE OF THE ENAMOURED ALTISIDORA\u2019S WOOING p46a.jpg (58K) Full Size We left Don Quixote wrapped up in the reflections which the music of the enamourned maid Altisidora had given rise to. He went to bed with them, and just like fleas they would not let him sleep or get a moment\u2019s rest, and the broken stitches of his stockings helped them. But as Time is fleet and no obstacle can stay his course, he came riding on the hours, and morning very soon arrived. Seeing which Don Quixote quitted the soft down, and, nowise slothful, dressed himself in his chamois suit and put on his travelling boots to hide the disaster to his stockings. He threw over him his scarlet mantle, put on his head a montera of green velvet trimmed with silver edging, flung across his shoulder the baldric with his good trenchant sword, took up a large rosary that he always carried with him, and with great solemnity and precision of gait proceeded to the antechamber where the duke and duchess were already dressed and waiting for him. But as he passed through a gallery, Altisidora and the other damsel, her friend, were lying in wait for him, and the instant Altisidora saw him she pretended to faint, while her friend caught her in her lap, and began hastily unlacing the bosom of her dress.", " \u201cLess politeness and less paint, se\u00f1ora duenna,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cby God your hands smell of vinegar-wash.\u201d In line, all the duennas smacked him and several others of the household pinched him; but what he could not stand was being pricked by the pins; and so, apparently out of patience, he started up out of his chair, and seizing a lighted torch that stood near him fell upon the duennas and the whole set of his tormentors, exclaiming, \u201cBegone, ye ministers of hell; I\u2019m not made of brass not to feel such out-of-the-way tortures.\u201d At this instant Altisidora, who probably was tired of having been so long lying on her back, turned on her side; seeing which the bystanders cried out almost with one voice, \u201cAltisidora is alive! Altisidora lives!\u201d Rhadamanthus bade Sancho put away his wrath, as the object they had in view was now attained. When Don Quixote saw Altisidora move, he went on his knees to Sancho saying to him, \u201cNow is the time, son of my bowels, not to call thee my squire, for thee to give thyself some of those lashes thou art bound to lay on for the disenchantment of Dulcinea. Now, I say, is the time when the virtue that is in thee is ripe, and endowed with efficacy to work the good that is looked for from thee.\u201d To which Sancho made answer, \u201cThat\u2019s trick upon trick, I think, and not honey upon pancakes; a nice thing it would be for a whipping to come now, on the top of pinches, smacks, and pin-proddings!", " You had better take a big stone and tie it round my neck, and pitch me into a well; I should not mind it much, if I\u2019m to be always made the cow of the wedding for the cure of other people\u2019s ailments. Leave me alone; or else by God I\u2019ll fling the whole thing to the dogs, let come what may.\u201d Altisidora had by this time sat up on the catafalque, and as she did so the clarions sounded, accompanied by the flutes, and the voices of all present exclaiming, \u201cLong life to Altisidora! long life to Altisidora!\u201d The duke and duchess and the kings Minos and Rhadamanthus stood up, and all, together with Don Quixote and Sancho, advanced to receive her and take her down from the catafalque; and she, making as though she were recovering from a swoon, bowed her head to the duke and duchess and to the kings, and looking sideways at Don Quixote, said to him, \u201cGod forgive thee, insensible knight, for through thy cruelty I have been, to me it seems, more than a thousand years in the other world; and to thee, the most compassionate upon earth, I render thanks for the life I am now in possession of. From this day forth, friend Sancho, count as thine six smocks of mine which I bestow upon thee, to make as many shirts for thyself, and if they are not all quite whole, at any rate they are all clean.\u201d Sancho kissed her hands in gratitude, kneeling, and with the mitre in his hand. The duke bade them take it from him, and give him back his cap and doublet and remove the flaming robe."], "What initially causes Don Quixote\u2019s obsession with chivalry?": [" But to suppose Cervantes deliberately setting himself to expound any such idea in two stout quarto volumes is to suppose something not only very unlike the age in which he lived, but altogether unlike Cervantes himself, who would have been the first to laugh at an attempt of the sort made by anyone else. The extraordinary influence of the romances of chivalry in his day is quite enough to account for the genesis of the book. Some idea of the prodigious development of this branch of literature in the sixteenth century may be obtained from the scrutiny of Chapter VII, if the reader bears in mind that only a portion of the romances belonging to by far the largest group are enumerated. As to its effect upon the nation, there is abundant evidence. From the time when the Amadises and Palmerins began to grow popular down to the very end of the century, there is a steady stream of invective, from men whose character and position lend weight to their words, against the romances of chivalry and the infatuation of their readers. Ridicule was the only besom to sweep away that dust. That this was the task Cervantes set himself, and that he had ample provocation to urge him to it, will be sufficiently clear to those who look into the evidence; as it will be also that it was not chivalry itself that he attacked and swept away. Of all the absurdities that, thanks to poetry, will be repeated to the end of time, there is no greater one than saying that \u201cCervantes smiled Spain\u2019s chivalry away.\u201d In the first place there was no chivalry for him to smile away.", " For your highnesses must know that, going a few days back to kiss her hands and receive her benediction, approbation, and permission for this third sally, I found her altogether a different being from the one I sought; I found her enchanted and changed from a princess into a peasant, from fair to foul, from an angel into a devil, from fragrant to pestiferous, from refined to clownish, from a dignified lady into a jumping tomboy, and, in a word, from Dulcinea del Toboso into a coarse Sayago wench.\u201d \u201cGod bless me!\u201d said the duke aloud at this, \u201cwho can have done the world such an injury? Who can have robbed it of the beauty that gladdened it, of the grace and gaiety that charmed it, of the modesty that shed a lustre upon it?\u201d \u201cWho?\u201d replied Don Quixote; \u201cwho could it be but some malignant enchanter of the many that persecute me out of envy\u2014that accursed race born into the world to obscure and bring to naught the achievements of the good, and glorify and exalt the deeds of the wicked? Enchanters have persecuted me, enchanters persecute me still, and enchanters will continue to persecute me until they have sunk me and my lofty chivalry in the deep abyss of oblivion; and they injure and wound me where they know I feel it most. For to deprive a knight-errant of his lady is to deprive him of the eyes he sees with, of the sun that gives him light, of the food whereby he lives. Many a time before have I said it, and I say it now once more, a knight-errant without a lady is like a tree without leaves, a building without a foundation, or a shadow without the body that causes it.\u201d \u201cThere is no denying it,\u201d said the duchess; \u201cbut still, if we are to believe the history of Don Quixote that has come out here lately with general applause, it is to be inferred from it, if I mistake not, that you never saw the lady Dulcinea, and that the said lady is nothing in the world but an imaginary lady, one that you yourself begot and gave birth to in your brain, and adorned with whatever charms and perfections you chose.\u201d \u201cThere is a good deal to be said on that point,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cGod knows whether there be any Dulcinea or not in the world, or whether she is imaginary or not imaginary; these are things the proof of which must not be pushed to extreme lengths.", " Don Fernando contrived always to read the letters I sent to Luscinda and her answers to me, under the pretence that he enjoyed the wit and sense of both. It so happened, then, that Luscinda having begged of me a book of chivalry to read, one that she was very fond of, Amadis of Gaul\u2014\u201d Don Quixote no sooner heard a book of chivalry mentioned, than he said: \u201cHad your worship told me at the beginning of your story that the Lady Luscinda was fond of books of chivalry, no other laudation would have been requisite to impress upon me the superiority of her understanding, for it could not have been of the excellence you describe had a taste for such delightful reading been wanting; so, as far as I am concerned, you need waste no more words in describing her beauty, worth, and intelligence; for, on merely hearing what her taste was, I declare her to be the most beautiful and the most intelligent woman in the world; and I wish your worship had, along with Amadis of Gaul, sent her the worthy Don Rugel of Greece, for I know the Lady Luscinda would greatly relish Daraida and Garaya, and the shrewd sayings of the shepherd Darinel, and the admirable verses of his bucolics, sung and delivered by him with such sprightliness, wit, and ease; but a time may come when this omission can be remedied, and to rectify it nothing more is needed than for your worship to be so good as to come with me to my village, for there I can give you more than three hundred books which are the delight of my soul and the entertainment of my life;\u2014though it occurs to me that I have not got one of them now, thanks to the spite of wicked and envious enchanters;\u2014but pardon me for having broken the promise we made not to interrupt your discourse; for when I hear chivalry or knights-errant mentioned, I can no more help talking about them than the rays of the sun can help giving heat, or those of the moon moisture; pardon me, therefore, and proceed, for that is more to the purpose now.\u201d While Don Quixote was saying this, Cardenio allowed his head to fall upon his breast, and seemed plunged in deep thought; and though twice Don Quixote bade him go on with his story, he neither looked up nor uttered a word in reply; but after some time he raised his head and said, \u201cI cannot get rid of the idea, nor will anyone in the world remove it, or make me think otherwise\u2014and he would be a blockhead who would hold or believe anything else than that that arrant knave Master Elisabad made free with Queen Madasima.\u201d \u201cThat is not true, by all that\u2019s good,\u201d said Don Quixote in high wrath, turning upon him angrily, as his way was; \u201cand it is a very great slander, or rather villainy.", " And yet, with all these good things, which are commonly all that men need to enable them to live happily, I am the most discontented and dissatisfied man in the whole world; for, I know not how long since, I have been harassed and oppressed by a desire so strange and so unusual, that I wonder at myself and blame and chide myself when I am alone, and strive to stifle it and hide it from my own thoughts, and with no better success than if I were endeavouring deliberately to publish it to all the world; and as, in short, it must come out, I would confide it to thy safe keeping, feeling sure that by this means, and by thy readiness as a true friend to afford me relief, I shall soon find myself freed from the distress it causes me, and that thy care will give me happiness in the same degree as my own folly has caused me misery.\u201d The words of Anselmo struck Lothario with astonishment, unable as he was to conjecture the purport of such a lengthy preamble; and though he strove to imagine what desire it could be that so troubled his friend, his conjectures were all far from the truth, and to relieve the anxiety which this perplexity was causing him, he told him he was doing a flagrant injustice to their great friendship in seeking circuitous methods of confiding to him his most hidden thoughts, for he well knew he might reckon upon his counsel in diverting them, or his help in carrying them into effect."], "Which character bears the brunt of the punishments that Don Quixote incurs?": [" But turn thine eyes to the other side, and thou shalt see in front and in the van of this other army the ever victorious and never vanquished Timonel of Carcajona, prince of New Biscay, who comes in armour with arms quartered azure, vert, white, and yellow, and bears on his shield a cat or on a field tawny with a motto which says _Miau_, which is the beginning of the name of his lady, who according to report is the peerless Miaulina, daughter of the duke Alfeniquen of the Algarve; the other, who burdens and presses the loins of that powerful charger and bears arms white as snow and a shield blank and without any device, is a novice knight, a Frenchman by birth, Pierres Papin by name, lord of the baronies of Utrique; that other, who with iron-shod heels strikes the flanks of that nimble parti-coloured zebra, and for arms bears azure vair, is the mighty duke of Nerbia, Espartafilardo del Bosque, who bears for device on his shield an asparagus plant with a motto in Castilian that says, _\u2018Rastrea mi suerte\u2019_.\u201d And so he went on naming a number of knights of one squadron or the other out of his imagination, and to all he assigned off-hand their arms, colours, devices, and mottoes, carried away by the illusions of his unheard-of craze; and without a pause, he continued, \u201cPeople of divers nations compose this squadron in front; here are those that drink of the sweet waters of the famous Xanthus, those that scour the woody Massilian plains, those that sift the pure fine gold of Arabia Felix, those that enjoy the famed cool banks of the crystal Thermodon, those that in many and various ways divert the streams of the golden Pactolus, the Numidians, faithless in their promises, the Persians renowned in archery, the Parthians and the Medes that fight as they fly, the Arabs that ever shift their dwellings, the Scythians as cruel as they are fair, the Ethiopians with pierced lips, and an infinity of other nations whose features I recognise and descry, though I cannot recall their names.", " \u201cAnd an unfortunate one,\u201d replied Gines, \u201cfor misfortune always persecutes good wit.\u201d \u201cIt persecutes rogues,\u201d said the commissary. \u201cI told you already to go gently, master commissary,\u201d said Pasamonte; \u201ctheir lordships yonder never gave you that staff to ill-treat us wretches here, but to conduct and take us where his majesty orders you; if not, by the life of-never mind\u2014; it may be that some day the stains made in the inn will come out in the scouring; let everyone hold his tongue and behave well and speak better; and now let us march on, for we have had quite enough of this entertainment.\u201d The commissary lifted his staff to strike Pasamonte in return for his threats, but Don Quixote came between them, and begged him not to ill-use him, as it was not too much to allow one who had his hands tied to have his tongue a trifle free; and turning to the whole chain of them he said: \u201cFrom all you have told me, dear brethren, make out clearly that though they have punished you for your faults, the punishments you are about to endure do not give you much pleasure, and that you go to them very much against the grain and against your will, and that perhaps this one\u2019s want of courage under torture, that one\u2019s want of money, the other\u2019s want of advocacy, and lastly the perverted judgment of the judge may have been the cause of your ruin and of your failure to obtain the justice you had on your side.", " for I believe it has not been the custom so far to go into battle on a beast of this kind.\u201d \u201cThat is true,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand what you had best do with him is to leave him to take his chance whether he be lost or not, for the horses we shall have when we come out victors will be so many that even Rocinante will run a risk of being changed for another. But attend to me and observe, for I wish to give thee some account of the chief knights who accompany these two armies; and that thou mayest the better see and mark, let us withdraw to that hillock which rises yonder, whence both armies may be seen.\u201d They did so, and placed themselves on a rising ground from which the two droves that Don Quixote made armies of might have been plainly seen if the clouds of dust they raised had not obscured them and blinded the sight; nevertheless, seeing in his imagination what he did not see and what did not exist, he began thus in a loud voice: \u201cThat knight whom thou seest yonder in yellow armour, who bears upon his shield a lion crowned crouching at the feet of a damsel, is the valiant Laurcalco, lord of the Silver Bridge; that one in armour with flowers of gold, who bears on his shield three crowns argent on an azure field, is the dreaded Micocolembo, grand duke of Quirocia; that other of gigantic frame, on his right hand, is the ever dauntless Brandabarbaran de Boliche, lord of the three Arabias, who for armour wears that serpent skin, and has for shield a gate which, according to tradition, is one of those of the temple that Samson brought to the ground when by his death he revenged himself upon his enemies.", " The advantage of this is that he is enabled to make use of Don Quixote as a mouthpiece for his own reflections, and so, without seeming to digress, allow himself the relief of digression when he requires it, as freely as in a commonplace book. It is true the amount of individuality bestowed upon Don Quixote is not very great. There are some natural touches of character about him, such as his mixture of irascibility and placability, and his curious affection for Sancho together with his impatience of the squire\u2019s loquacity and impertinence; but in the main, apart from his craze, he is little more than a thoughtful, cultured gentleman, with instinctive good taste and a great deal of shrewdness and originality of mind. As to Sancho, it is plain, from the concluding words of the preface to the First Part, that he was a favourite with his creator even before he had been taken into favour by the public. An inferior genius, taking him in hand a second time, would very likely have tried to improve him by making him more comical, clever, amiable, or virtuous. But Cervantes was too true an artist to spoil his work in this way. Sancho, when he reappears, is the old Sancho with the old familiar features; but with a difference; they have been brought out more distinctly, but at the same time with a careful avoidance of anything like caricature; the outline has been filled in where filling in was necessary, and, vivified by a few touches of a master\u2019s hand, Sancho stands before us as he might in a character portrait by Velazquez."], "What does the narrator rail against at the beginning of part two of Don Quixote?": [" And then, when they quote the Holy Scriptures!\u2014anyone would say they are St. Thomases or other doctors of the Church, observing as they do a decorum so ingenious that in one sentence they describe a distracted lover and in the next deliver a devout little sermon that it is a pleasure and a treat to hear and read. Of all this there will be nothing in my book, for I have nothing to quote in the margin or to note at the end, and still less do I know what authors I follow in it, to place them at the beginning, as all do, under the letters A, B, C, beginning with Aristotle and ending with Xenophon, or Zoilus, or Zeuxis, though one was a slanderer and the other a painter. Also my book must do without sonnets at the beginning, at least sonnets whose authors are dukes, marquises, counts, bishops, ladies, or famous poets. Though if I were to ask two or three obliging friends, I know they would give me them, and such as the productions of those that have the highest reputation in our Spain could not equal. \u201cIn short, my friend,\u201d I continued, \u201cI am determined that Se\u00f1or Don Quixote shall remain buried in the archives of his own La Mancha until Heaven provide someone to garnish him with all those things he stands in need of; because I find myself, through my shallowness and want of learning, unequal to supplying them, and because I am by nature shy and careless about hunting for authors to say what I myself can say without them.", " DIALOGUE Between Babieca and Rocinante SONNET B. \u201cHow comes it, Rocinante, you\u2019re so lean?\u201d R. \u201cI\u2019m underfed, with overwork I\u2019m worn.\u201d B. \u201cBut what becomes of all the hay and corn?\u201d R. \u201cMy master gives me none; he\u2019s much too mean.\u201d B. \u201cCome, come, you show ill-breeding, sir, I ween; \u2019Tis like an ass your master thus to scorn.\u201d R. He is an ass, will die an ass, an ass was born; Why, he\u2019s in love; what\u2019s plainer to be seen?\u201d B. \u201cTo be in love is folly?\u201d\u2014R. \u201cNo great sense.\u201d B. \u201cYou\u2019re metaphysical.\u201d\u2014R. \u201cFrom want of food.\u201d B. \u201cRail at the squire, then.\u201d\u2014R. \u201cWhy, what\u2019s the good?

The canon and his servants were surprised anew when they heard Don Quixote\u2019s strange story, and when it was finished he said, \u201cTo tell the truth, se\u00f1or curate, I for my part consider what they call books of chivalry to be mischievous to the State; and though, led by idle and false taste, I have read the beginnings of almost all that have been printed, I never could manage to read any one of them from beginning to end; for it seems to me they are all more or less the same thing; and one has nothing more in it than another; this no more than that. And in my opinion this sort of writing and composition is of the same species as the fables they call the Milesian, nonsensical tales that aim solely at giving amusement and not instruction, exactly the opposite of the apologue fables which amuse and instruct at the same time. And though it may be the chief object of such books to amuse, I do not know how they can succeed, when they are so full of such monstrous nonsense.", " By this dinner-time arrived, and Don Quixote and Don \u00c1lvaro dined together. The alcalde of the village came by chance into the inn together with a notary, and Don Quixote laid a petition before him, showing that it was requisite for his rights that Don \u00c1lvaro Tarfe, the gentleman there present, should make a declaration before him that he did not know Don Quixote of La Mancha, also there present, and that he was not the one that was in print in a history entitled \u201cSecond Part of Don Quixote of La Mancha, by one Avellaneda of Tordesillas.\u201d The alcalde finally put it in legal form, and the declaration was made with all the formalities required in such cases, at which Don Quixote and Sancho were in high delight, as if a declaration of the sort was of any great importance to them, and as if their words and deeds did not plainly show the difference between the two Don Quixotes and the two Sanchos. Many civilities and offers of service were exchanged by Don \u00c1lvaro and Don Quixote, in the course of which the great Manchegan displayed such good taste that he disabused Don \u00c1lvaro of the error he was under; and he, on his part, felt convinced he must have been enchanted, now that he had been brought in contact with two such opposite Don Quixotes. Evening came, they set out from the village, and after about half a league two roads branched off, one leading to Don Quixote\u2019s village, the other the road Don \u00c1lvaro was to follow."], "What is Don Quixote\u2019s primary goal in part two of the novel?": [" They all embraced one another, and promised to let each other know how things went with them, and Don Fernando directed the curate where to write to him, to tell him what became of Don Quixote, assuring him that there was nothing that could give him more pleasure than to hear of it, and that he too, on his part, would send him word of everything he thought he would like to know, about his marriage, Zoraida\u2019s baptism, Don Luis\u2019s affair, and Luscinda\u2019s return to her home. The curate promised to comply with his request carefully, and they embraced once more, and renewed their promises. The landlord approached the curate and handed him some papers, saying he had discovered them in the lining of the valise in which the novel of \u201cThe Ill-advised Curiosity\u201d had been found, and that he might take them all away with him as their owner had not since returned; for, as he could not read, he did not want them himself. The curate thanked him, and opening them he saw at the beginning of the manuscript the words, \u201cNovel of Rinconete and Cortadillo,\u201d by which he perceived that it was a novel, and as that of \u201cThe Ill-advised Curiosity\u201d had been good he concluded this would be so too, as they were both probably by the same author; so he kept it, intending to read it when he had an opportunity. He then mounted and his friend the barber did the same, both masked, so as not to be recognised by Don Quixote, and set out following in the rear of the cart.", " The landlord was carrying away the valise and the books, but the curate said to him, \u201cWait; I want to see what those papers are that are written in such a good hand.\u201d The landlord taking them out handed them to him to read, and he perceived they were a work of about eight sheets of manuscript, with, in large letters at the beginning, the title of \u201cNovel of the Ill-advised Curiosity.\u201d The curate read three or four lines to himself, and said, \u201cI must say the title of this novel does not seem to me a bad one, and I feel an inclination to read it all.\u201d To which the landlord replied, \u201cThen your reverence will do well to read it, for I can tell you that some guests who have read it here have been much pleased with it, and have begged it of me very earnestly; but I would not give it, meaning to return it to the person who forgot the valise, books, and papers here, for maybe he will return here some time or other; and though I know I shall miss the books, faith I mean to return them; for though I am an innkeeper, still I am a Christian.\u201d \u201cYou are very right, friend,\u201d said the curate; \u201cbut for all that, if the novel pleases me you must let me copy it.\u201d \u201cWith all my heart,\u201d replied the host. While they were talking Cardenio had taken up the novel and begun to read it, and forming the same opinion of it as the curate, he begged him to read it so that they might all hear it. \u201cI would read it,\u201d said the curate, \u201cif the time would not be better spent in sleeping.\u201d \u201cIt will be rest enough for me,\u201d said Dorothea, \u201cto while away the time by listening to some tale, for my spirits are not yet tranquil enough to let me sleep when it would be seasonable.\u201d \u201cWell then, in that case,\u201d said the curate, \u201cI will read it, if it were only out of curiosity; perhaps it may contain something pleasant.\u201d Master Nicholas added his entreaties to the same effect, and Sancho too; seeing which, and considering that he would give pleasure to all, and receive it himself, the curate said, \u201cWell then, attend to me everyone, for the novel begins thus.\u201d c32e.jpg (11K) CHAPTER XXXIII.", " Lothario commended his purpose, and promised on his own part to aid him in raising a monument so glorious. And so Anselmo was left the most charmingly hoodwinked man there could be in the world. He himself, persuaded he was conducting the instrument of his glory, led home by the hand of him who had been the utter destruction of his good name; whom Camilla received with averted countenance, though with smiles in her heart. The deception was carried on for some time, until at the end of a few months Fortune turned her wheel and the guilt which had been until then so skilfully concealed was published abroad, and Anselmo paid with his life the penalty of his ill-advised curiosity. CHAPTER XXXV. WHICH TREATS OF THE HEROIC AND PRODIGIOUS BATTLE DON QUIXOTE HAD WITH CERTAIN SKINS OF RED WINE, AND BRINGS THE NOVEL OF \u201cTHE ILL-ADVISED CURIOSITY\u201d TO A CLOSE There remained but little more of the novel to be read, when Sancho Panza burst forth in wild excitement from the garret where Don Quixote was lying, shouting, \u201cRun, sirs! quick; and help my master, who is in the thick of the toughest and stiffest battle I ever laid eyes on. By the living God he has given the giant, the enemy of my lady the Princess Micomicona, such a slash that he has sliced his head clean off as if it were a turnip.\u201d \u201cWhat are you talking about, brother?\u201d said the curate, pausing as he was about to read the remainder of the novel.", " Nay; see whether by bodily strength it be possible to learn or divine the intentions of the enemy, his plans, stratagems, or obstacles, or to ward off impending mischief; for all these are the work of the mind, and in them the body has no share whatever. Since, therefore, arms have need of the mind, as much as letters, let us see now which of the two minds, that of the man of letters or that of the warrior, has most to do; and this will be seen by the end and goal that each seeks to attain; for that purpose is the more estimable which has for its aim the nobler object. The end and goal of letters\u2014I am not speaking now of divine letters, the aim of which is to raise and direct the soul to Heaven; for with an end so infinite no other can be compared\u2014I speak of human letters, the end of which is to establish distributive justice, give to every man that which is his, and see and take care that good laws are observed: an end undoubtedly noble, lofty, and deserving of high praise, but not such as should be given to that sought by arms, which have for their end and object peace, the greatest boon that men can desire in this life. The first good news the world and mankind received was that which the angels announced on the night that was our day, when they sang in the air, \u2018Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth to men of good-will;\u2019 and the salutation which the great Master of heaven and earth taught his disciples and chosen followers when they entered any house, was to say, \u2018Peace be on this house;\u2019 and many other times he said to them, \u2018My peace I give unto you, my peace I leave you, peace be with you;\u2019 a jewel and a precious gift given and left by such a hand: a jewel without which there can be no happiness either on earth or in heaven."], "What becomes extinct with the death of Don Quixote?": [" Don Quixote, propped up against the trunk of a beech or a cork tree\u2014for Cide Hamete does not specify what kind of tree it was\u2014sang in this strain to the accompaniment of his own sighs: When in my mind I muse, O Love, upon thy cruelty, To death I flee, In hope therein the end of all to find. But drawing near That welcome haven in my sea of woe, Such joy I know, That life revives, and still I linger here. Thus life doth slay, And death again to life restoreth me; Strange destiny, That deals with life and death as with a play! He accompanied each verse with many sighs and not a few tears, just like one whose heart was pierced with grief at his defeat and his separation from Dulcinea. And now daylight came, and the sun smote Sancho on the eyes with his beams. He awoke, roused himself up, shook himself and stretched his lazy limbs, and seeing the havoc the pigs had made with his stores he cursed the drove, and more besides. Then the pair resumed their journey, and as evening closed in they saw coming towards them some ten men on horseback and four or five on foot. Don Quixote\u2019s heart beat quick and Sancho\u2019s quailed with fear, for the persons approaching them carried lances and bucklers, and were in very warlike guise. Don Quixote turned to Sancho and said, \u201cIf I could make use of my weapons, and my promise had not tied my hands, I would count this host that comes against us but cakes and fancy bread; but perhaps it may prove something different from what we apprehend.\u201d The men on horseback now came up, and raising their lances surrounded Don Quixote in silence, and pointed them at his back and breast, menacing him with death.", " But whatever Avellaneda and his book may be, we must not forget the debt we owe them. But for them, there can be no doubt, \u201cDon Quixote\u201d would have come to us a mere torso instead of a complete work. Even if Cervantes had finished the volume he had in hand, most assuredly he would have left off with a promise of a Third Part, giving the further adventures of Don Quixote and humours of Sancho Panza as shepherds. It is plain that he had at one time an intention of dealing with the pastoral romances as he had dealt with the books of chivalry, and but for Avellaneda he would have tried to carry it out. But it is more likely that, with his plans, and projects, and hopefulness, the volume would have remained unfinished till his death, and that we should have never made the acquaintance of the Duke and Duchess, or gone with Sancho to Barataria. From the moment the book came into his hands he seems to have been haunted by the fear that there might be more Avellanedas in the field, and putting everything else aside, he set himself to finish off his task and protect Don Quixote in the only way he could, by killing him. The conclusion is no doubt a hasty and in some places clumsy piece of work and the frequent repetition of the scolding administered to Avellaneda becomes in the end rather wearisome; but it is, at any rate, a conclusion and for that we must thank Avellaneda. The new volume was ready for the press in February, but was not printed till the very end of 1615, and during the interval Cervantes put together the comedies and interludes he had written within the last few years, and, as he adds plaintively, found no demand for among the managers, and published them with a preface, worth the book it introduces tenfold, in which he gives an account of the early Spanish stage, and of his own attempts as a dramatist.", " And bear in mind what I am now about to say to you, for it will be of great use and comfort to you in time of trouble; it is, not to let your mind dwell on the adverse chances that may befall you; for the worst of all is death, and if it be a good death, the best of all is to die. They asked Julius C\u00e6sar, the valiant Roman emperor, what was the best death. He answered, that which is unexpected, which comes suddenly and unforeseen; and though he answered like a pagan, and one without the knowledge of the true God, yet, as far as sparing our feelings is concerned, he was right; for suppose you are killed in the first engagement or skirmish, whether by a cannon ball or blown up by mine, what matters it? It is only dying, and all is over; and according to Terence, a soldier shows better dead in battle, than alive and safe in flight; and the good soldier wins fame in proportion as he is obedient to his captains and those in command over him. And remember, my son, that it is better for the soldier to smell of gunpowder than of civet, and that if old age should come upon you in this honourable calling, though you may be covered with wounds and crippled and lame, it will not come upon you without honour, and that such as poverty cannot lessen; especially now that provisions are being made for supporting and relieving old and disabled soldiers; for it is not right to deal with them after the fashion of those who set free and get rid of their black slaves when they are old and useless, and, turning them out of their houses under the pretence of making them free, make them slaves to hunger, from which they cannot expect to be released except by death.", " It was by this time broad daylight; and for that reason, as well as in consequence of the noise Don Quixote had made, everybody was awake and up, but particularly Do\u00f1a Clara and Dorothea; for they had been able to sleep but badly that night, the one from agitation at having her lover so near her, the other from curiosity to see him. Don Quixote, when he saw that not one of the four travellers took any notice of him or replied to his challenge, was furious and ready to die with indignation and wrath; and if he could have found in the ordinances of chivalry that it was lawful for a knight-errant to undertake or engage in another enterprise, when he had plighted his word and faith not to involve himself in any until he had made an end of the one to which he was pledged, he would have attacked the whole of them, and would have made them return an answer in spite of themselves. But considering that it would not become him, nor be right, to begin any new emprise until he had established Micomicona in her kingdom, he was constrained to hold his peace and wait quietly to see what would be the upshot of the proceedings of those same travellers; one of whom found the youth they were seeking lying asleep by the side of a muleteer, without a thought of anyone coming in search of him, much less finding him. The man laid hold of him by the arm, saying, \u201cIt becomes you well indeed, Se\u00f1or Don Luis, to be in the dress you wear, and well the bed in which I find you agrees with the luxury in which your mother reared you.\u201d The youth rubbed his sleepy eyes and stared for a while at him who held him, but presently recognised him as one of his father\u2019s servants, at which he was so taken aback that for some time he could not find or utter a word; while the servant went on to say, \u201cThere is nothing for it now, Se\u00f1or Don Luis, but to submit quietly and return home, unless it is your wish that my lord, your father, should take his departure for the other world, for nothing else can be the consequence of the grief he is in at your absence.\u201d \u201cBut how did my father know that I had gone this road and in this dress?\u201d said Don Luis."], "What is Don Quixote\u2019s goal in life?": [" Nay; see whether by bodily strength it be possible to learn or divine the intentions of the enemy, his plans, stratagems, or obstacles, or to ward off impending mischief; for all these are the work of the mind, and in them the body has no share whatever. Since, therefore, arms have need of the mind, as much as letters, let us see now which of the two minds, that of the man of letters or that of the warrior, has most to do; and this will be seen by the end and goal that each seeks to attain; for that purpose is the more estimable which has for its aim the nobler object. The end and goal of letters\u2014I am not speaking now of divine letters, the aim of which is to raise and direct the soul to Heaven; for with an end so infinite no other can be compared\u2014I speak of human letters, the end of which is to establish distributive justice, give to every man that which is his, and see and take care that good laws are observed: an end undoubtedly noble, lofty, and deserving of high praise, but not such as should be given to that sought by arms, which have for their end and object peace, the greatest boon that men can desire in this life.

But over-cautious prudery, And coyness cold and cruel, When most I need it, these, like clouds, Its longed-for light refuse me. Bright star, goal of my yearning eyes As thou above me beamest, When thou shalt hide thee from my sight I\u2019ll know that death is near me. The singer had got so far when it struck Dorothea that it was not fair to let Clara miss hearing such a sweet voice, so, shaking her from side to side, she woke her, saying: \u201cForgive me, child, for waking thee, but I do so that thou mayest have the pleasure of hearing the best voice thou hast ever heard, perhaps, in all thy life.\u201d Clara awoke quite drowsy, and not understanding at the moment what Dorothea said, asked her what it was; she repeated what she had said, and Clara became attentive at once; but she had hardly heard two lines, as the singer continued, when a strange trembling seized her, as if she were suffering from a severe attack of quartan ague, and throwing her arms round Dorothea she said: \u201cAh, dear lady of my soul and life! why did you wake me? The greatest kindness fortune could do me now would be to close my eyes and ears so as neither to see or hear that unhappy musician.\u201d \u201cWhat art thou talking about, child?\u201d said Dorothea. \u201cWhy, they say this singer is a muleteer!\u201d \u201cNay, he is the lord of many places,\u201d replied Clara, \u201cand that one in my heart which he holds so firmly shall never be taken from him, unless he be willing to surrender it.\u201d Dorothea was amazed at the ardent language of the girl, for it seemed to be far beyond such experience of life as her tender years gave any promise of, so she said to her: \u201cYou speak in such a way that I cannot understand you, Se\u00f1ora Clara; explain yourself more clearly, and tell me what is this you are saying about hearts and places and this musician whose voice has so moved you?", " It would be so if its moral were that, in this world, true enthusiasm naturally leads to ridicule and discomfiture. But it preaches nothing of the sort; its moral, so far as it can be said to have one, is that the spurious enthusiasm that is born of vanity and self-conceit, that is made an end in itself, not a means to an end, that acts on mere impulse, regardless of circumstances and consequences, is mischievous to its owner, and a very considerable nuisance to the community at large. To those who cannot distinguish between the one kind and the other, no doubt \u201cDon Quixote\u201d is a sad book; no doubt to some minds it is very sad that a man who had just uttered so beautiful a sentiment as that \u201cit is a hard case to make slaves of those whom God and Nature made free,\u201d should be ungratefully pelted by the scoundrels his crazy philanthropy had let loose on society; but to others of a more judicial cast it will be a matter of regret that reckless self-sufficient enthusiasm is not oftener requited in some such way for all the mischief it does in the world. A very slight examination of the structure of \u201cDon Quixote\u201d will suffice to show that Cervantes had no deep design or elaborate plan in his mind when he began the book. When he wrote those lines in which \u201cwith a few strokes of a great master he sets before us the pauper gentleman,\u201d he had no idea of the goal to which his imagination was leading him.", " But do not tell me anything now; I do not want to lose the pleasure I get from listening to the singer by giving my attention to your transports, for I perceive he is beginning to sing a new strain and a new air.\u201d \u201cLet him, in Heaven\u2019s name,\u201d returned Clara; and not to hear him she stopped both ears with her hands, at which Dorothea was again surprised; but turning her attention to the song she found that it ran in this fashion: Sweet Hope, my stay, That onward to the goal of thy intent Dost make thy way, Heedless of hindrance or impediment, Have thou no fear If at each step thou findest death is near. No victory, No joy of triumph doth the faint heart know; Unblest is he That a bold front to Fortune dares not show, But soul and sense In bondage yieldeth up to indolence. If Love his wares Do dearly sell, his right must be contest; What gold compares With that whereon his stamp he hath imprest? And all men know What costeth little that we rate but low. Love resolute Knows not the word \u201cimpossibility;\u201d And though my suit Beset by endless obstacles I see, Yet no despair Shall hold me bound to earth while heaven is there. Here the voice ceased and Clara\u2019s sobs began afresh, all which excited Dorothea\u2019s curiosity to know what could be the cause of singing so sweet and weeping so bitter, so she again asked her what it was she was going to say before. On this Clara, afraid that Luscinda might overhear her, winding her arms tightly round Dorothea put her mouth so close to her ear that she could speak without fear of being heard by anyone else, and said: \u201cThis singer, dear se\u00f1ora, is the son of a gentleman of Aragon, lord of two villages, who lives opposite my father\u2019s house at Madrid; and though my father had curtains to the windows of his house in winter, and lattice-work in summer, in some way\u2014I know not how\u2014this gentleman, who was pursuing his studies, saw me, whether in church or elsewhere, I cannot tell, and, in fact, fell in love with me, and gave me to know it from the windows of his house, with so many signs and tears that I was forced to believe him, and even to love him, without knowing what it was he wanted of me."], "What aspect of Sancho Panza\u2019s speech indicates his peasant origins?": [" p029.jpg (285K) Full Size Nor was Don Quixote less so, for what with blows and bruises he could not sit upright on the ass, and from time to time he sent up sighs to heaven, so that once more he drove the peasant to ask what ailed him. And it could have been only the devil himself that put into his head tales to match his own adventures, for now, forgetting Baldwin, he bethought himself of the Moor Abindarraez, when the Alcaide of Antequera, Rodrigo de Narvaez, took him prisoner and carried him away to his castle; so that when the peasant again asked him how he was and what ailed him, he gave him for reply the same words and phrases that the captive Abindarraez gave to Rodrigo de Narvaez, just as he had read the story in the \u201cDiana\u201d of Jorge de Montemayor where it is written, applying it to his own case so aptly that the peasant went along cursing his fate that he had to listen to such a lot of nonsense; from which, however, he came to the conclusion that his neighbour was mad, and so made all haste to reach the village to escape the wearisomeness of this harangue of Don Quixote\u2019s; who, at the end of it, said, \u201cSe\u00f1or Don Rodrigo de Narvaez, your worship must know that this fair Xarifa I have mentioned is now the lovely Dulcinea del Toboso, for whom I have done, am doing, and will do the most famous deeds of chivalry that in this world have been seen, are to be seen, or ever shall be seen.\u201d To this the peasant answered, \u201cSe\u00f1or\u2014sinner that I am!\u2014cannot your worship see that I am not Don Rodrigo de Narvaez nor the Marquis of Mantua, but Pedro Alonso your neighbour, and that your worship is neither Baldwin nor Abindarraez, but the worthy gentleman Se\u00f1or Quixada?\u201d \u201cI know who I am,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cand I know that I may be not only those I have named, but all the Twelve Peers of France and even all the Nine Worthies, since my achievements surpass all that they have done all together and each of them on his own account.\u201d With this talk and more of the same kind they reached the village just as night was beginning to fall, but the peasant waited until it was a little later that the belaboured gentleman might not be seen riding in such a miserable trim.", " Finally, leading him out of the church they carried him to the judgment seat and seated him on it, and the duke\u2019s majordomo said to him, \u201cIt is an ancient custom in this island, se\u00f1or governor, that he who comes to take possession of this famous island is bound to answer a question which shall be put to him, and which must be a somewhat knotty and difficult one; and by his answer the people take the measure of their new governor\u2019s wit, and hail with joy or deplore his arrival accordingly.\u201d While the majordomo was making this speech Sancho was gazing at several large letters inscribed on the wall opposite his seat, and as he could not read he asked what that was that was painted on the wall. The answer was, \u201cSe\u00f1or, there is written and recorded the day on which your lordship took possession of this island, and the inscription says, \u2018This day, the so-and-so of such-and-such a month and year, Se\u00f1or Don Sancho Panza took possession of this island; many years may he enjoy it.\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd whom do they call Don Sancho Panza?\u201d asked Sancho. \u201cYour lordship,\u201d replied the majordomo; \u201cfor no other Panza but the one who is now seated in that chair has ever entered this island.\u201d \u201cWell then, let me tell you, brother,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cI haven\u2019t got the \u2018Don,\u2019 nor has anyone of my family ever had it; my name is plain Sancho Panza, and Sancho was my father\u2019s name, and Sancho was my grandfather\u2019s and they were all Panzas, without any Dons or Do\u00f1as tacked on; I suspect that in this island there are more Dons than stones; but never mind; God knows what I mean, and maybe if my government lasts four days I\u2019ll weed out these Dons that no doubt are as great a nuisance as the midges, they\u2019re so plenty.", " And it seems to me that, in governments, to make a beginning is everything; and maybe, after having been governor a fortnight, I\u2019ll take kindly to the work and know more about it than the field labour I have been brought up to.\u201d \u201cYou are right, Sancho,\u201d said the duchess, \u201cfor no one is born ready taught, and the bishops are made out of men and not out of stones. But to return to the subject we were discussing just now, the enchantment of the lady Dulcinea, I look upon it as certain, and something more than evident, that Sancho\u2019s idea of practising a deception upon his master, making him believe that the peasant girl was Dulcinea and that if he did not recognise her it must be because she was enchanted, was all a device of one of the enchanters that persecute Don Quixote. For in truth and earnest, I know from good authority that the coarse country wench who jumped up on the ass was and is Dulcinea del Toboso, and that worthy Sancho, though he fancies himself the deceiver, is the one that is deceived; and that there is no more reason to doubt the truth of this, than of anything else we never saw. Se\u00f1or Sancho Panza must know that we too have enchanters here that are well disposed to us, and tell us what goes on in the world, plainly and distinctly, without subterfuge or deception; and believe me, Sancho, that agile country lass was and is Dulcinea del Toboso, who is as much enchanted as the mother that bore her; and when we least expect it, we shall see her in her own proper form, and then Sancho will be disabused of the error he is under at present.\u201d \u201cAll that\u2019s very possible,\u201d said Sancho Panza; \u201cand now I\u2019m willing to believe what my master says about what he saw in the cave of Montesinos, where he says he saw the lady Dulcinea del Toboso in the very same dress and apparel that I said I had seen her in when I enchanted her all to please myself.", " Maybe, by holding out in this way, I may put a stop to his sending me on messages of this kind another time; or maybe he will think, as I suspect he will, that one of those wicked enchanters, who he says have a spite against him, has changed her form for the sake of doing him an ill turn and injuring him.\u201d With this reflection Sancho made his mind easy, counting the business as good as settled, and stayed there till the afternoon so as to make Don Quixote think he had time enough to go to El Toboso and return; and things turned out so luckily for him that as he got up to mount Dapple, he spied, coming from El Toboso towards the spot where he stood, three peasant girls on three colts, or fillies\u2014for the author does not make the point clear, though it is more likely they were she-asses, the usual mount with village girls; but as it is of no great consequence, we need not stop to prove it. To be brief, the instant Sancho saw the peasant girls, he returned full speed to seek his master, and found him sighing and uttering a thousand passionate lamentations. When Don Quixote saw him he exclaimed, \u201cWhat news, Sancho, my friend? Am I to mark this day with a white stone or a black?\u201d \u201cYour worship,\u201d replied Sancho, \u201chad better mark it with ruddle, like the inscriptions on the walls of class rooms, that those who see it may see it plain.\u201d \u201cThen thou bringest good news,\u201d said Don Quixote. \u201cSo good,\u201d replied Sancho, \u201cthat your worship has only to spur Rocinante and get out into the open field to see the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, who, with two others, damsels of hers, is coming to see your worship.\u201d \u201cHoly God!"], "What are the names of Don Quixote\u2019s horse and Sancho Panza\u2019s donkey, respectively?": [" \u201cBethink you, se\u00f1ora, of what I must do, for my heart is most eager to serve you.\u201d \u201cThe fact is,\u201d replied the Distressed One, \u201cit is five thousand leagues, a couple more or less, from this to the kingdom of Kandy, if you go by land; but if you go through the air and in a straight line, it is three thousand two hundred and twenty-seven. You must know, too, that Malambruno told me that, whenever fate provided the knight our deliverer, he himself would send him a steed far better and with less tricks than a post-horse; for he will be that same wooden horse on which the valiant Pierres carried off the fair Magalona; which said horse is guided by a peg he has in his forehead that serves for a bridle, and flies through the air with such rapidity that you would fancy the very devils were carrying him. This horse, according to ancient tradition, was made by Merlin. He lent him to Pierres, who was a friend of his, and who made long journeys with him, and, as has been said, carried off the fair Magalona, bearing her through the air on its haunches and making all who beheld them from the earth gape with astonishment; and he never lent him save to those whom he loved or those who paid him well; and since the great Pierres we know of no one having mounted him until now. From him Malambruno stole him by his magic art, and he has him now in his possession, and makes use of him in his journeys which he constantly makes through different parts of the world; he is here to-day, to-morrow in France, and the next day in Potosi; and the best of it is the said horse neither eats nor sleeps nor wears out shoes, and goes at an ambling pace through the air without wings, so that he whom he has mounted upon him can carry a cup full of water in his hand without spilling a drop, so smoothly and easily does he go, for which reason the fair Magalona enjoyed riding him greatly.\u201d \u201cFor going smoothly and easily,\u201d said Sancho at this, \u201cgive me my Dapple, though he can\u2019t go through the air; but on the ground I\u2019ll back him against all the amblers in the world.\u201d They all laughed, and the Distressed One continued: \u201cAnd this same horse, if so be that Malambruno is disposed to put an end to our sufferings, will be here before us ere the night shall have advanced half an hour; for he announced to me that the sign he would give me whereby I might know that I had found the knight I was in quest of, would be to send me the horse wherever he might be, speedily and promptly.\u201d \u201cAnd how many is there room for on this horse?\u201d asked Sancho.", " As for him, coming out upon the high road, he made for El Toboso, and the next day reached the inn where the mishap of the blanket had befallen him. As soon as he recognised it he felt as if he were once more living through the air, and he could not bring himself to enter it though it was an hour when he might well have done so, for it was dinner-time, and he longed to taste something hot as it had been all cold fare with him for many days past. This craving drove him to draw near to the inn, still undecided whether to go in or not, and as he was hesitating there came out two persons who at once recognised him, and said one to the other: \u201cSe\u00f1or licentiate, is not he on the horse there Sancho Panza who, our adventurer\u2019s housekeeper told us, went off with her master as esquire?\u201d \u201cSo it is,\u201d said the licentiate, \u201cand that is our friend Don Quixote\u2019s horse;\u201d and if they knew him so well it was because they were the curate and the barber of his own village, the same who had carried out the scrutiny and sentence upon the books; and as soon as they recognised Sancho Panza and Rocinante, being anxious to hear of Don Quixote, they approached, and calling him by his name the curate said, \u201cFriend Sancho Panza, where is your master?\u201d Sancho recognised them at once, and determined to keep secret the place and circumstances where and under which he had left his master, so he replied that his master was engaged in a certain quarter on a certain matter of great importance to him which he could not disclose for the eyes in his head.", " \u201cTwo,\u201d said the Distressed One, \u201cone in the saddle, and the other on the croup; and generally these two are knight and squire, when there is no damsel that\u2019s being carried off.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to know, Se\u00f1ora Distressed One,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cwhat is the name of this horse?\u201d \u201cHis name,\u201d said the Distressed One, \u201cis not the same as Bellerophon\u2019s horse that was called Pegasus, or Alexander the Great\u2019s, called Bucephalus, or Orlando Furioso\u2019s, the name of which was Brigliador, nor yet Bayard, the horse of Reinaldos of Montalvan, nor Frontino like Ruggiero\u2019s, nor Bootes or Peritoa, as they say the horses of the sun were called, nor is he called Orelia, like the horse on which the unfortunate Rodrigo, the last king of the Goths, rode to the battle where he lost his life and his kingdom.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll bet,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cthat as they have given him none of these famous names of well-known horses, no more have they given him the name of my master\u2019s Rocinante, which for being apt surpasses all that have been mentioned.\u201d \u201cThat is true,\u201d said the bearded countess, \u201cstill it fits him very well, for he is called Clavile\u00f1o the Swift, which name is in accordance with his being made of wood, with the peg he has in his forehead, and with the swift pace at which he travels; and so, as far as name goes, he may compare with the famous Rocinante.\u201d \u201cI have nothing to say against his name,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cbut with what sort of bridle or halter is he managed?\u201d \u201cI have said already,\u201d said the Trifaldi, \u201cthat it is with a peg, by turning which to one side or the other the knight who rides him makes him go as he pleases, either through the upper air, or skimming and almost sweeping the earth, or else in that middle course that is sought and followed in all well-regulated proceedings.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to see him,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cbut to fancy I\u2019m going to mount him, either in the saddle or on the croup, is to ask pears of the elm tree.", " One of those on foot, putting his finger to his lips as a sign to him to be silent, seized Rocinante\u2019s bridle and drew him out of the road, and the others driving Sancho and Dapple before them, and all maintaining a strange silence, followed in the steps of the one who led Don Quixote. The latter two or three times attempted to ask where they were taking him to and what they wanted, but the instant he began to open his lips they threatened to close them with the points of their lances; and Sancho fared the same way, for the moment he seemed about to speak one of those on foot punched him with a goad, and Dapple likewise, as if he too wanted to talk. Night set in, they quickened their pace, and the fears of the two prisoners grew greater, especially as they heard themselves assailed with\u2014\u201cGet on, ye Troglodytes;\u201d \u201cSilence, ye barbarians;\u201d \u201cMarch, ye cannibals;\u201d \u201cNo murmuring, ye Scythians;\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t open your eyes, ye murderous Polyphemes, ye blood-thirsty lions,\u201d and suchlike names with which their captors harassed the ears of the wretched master and man. Sancho went along saying to himself, \u201cWe, tortolites, barbers, animals! I don\u2019t like those names at all; \u2018it\u2019s in a bad wind our corn is being winnowed;\u2019 \u2018misfortune comes upon us all at once like sticks on a dog,\u2019 and God grant it may be no worse than them that this unlucky adventure has in store for us.\u201d Don Quixote rode completely dazed, unable with the aid of all his wits to make out what could be the meaning of these abusive names they called them, and the only conclusion he could arrive at was that there was no good to be hoped for and much evil to be feared."], "Which of the following characters never makes an actual physical appearance in the novel?": [" They all embraced one another, and promised to let each other know how things went with them, and Don Fernando directed the curate where to write to him, to tell him what became of Don Quixote, assuring him that there was nothing that could give him more pleasure than to hear of it, and that he too, on his part, would send him word of everything he thought he would like to know, about his marriage, Zoraida\u2019s baptism, Don Luis\u2019s affair, and Luscinda\u2019s return to her home. The curate promised to comply with his request carefully, and they embraced once more, and renewed their promises. The landlord approached the curate and handed him some papers, saying he had discovered them in the lining of the valise in which the novel of \u201cThe Ill-advised Curiosity\u201d had been found, and that he might take them all away with him as their owner had not since returned; for, as he could not read, he did not want them himself. The curate thanked him, and opening them he saw at the beginning of the manuscript the words, \u201cNovel of Rinconete and Cortadillo,\u201d by which he perceived that it was a novel, and as that of \u201cThe Ill-advised Curiosity\u201d had been good he concluded this would be so too, as they were both probably by the same author; so he kept it, intending to read it when he had an opportunity. He then mounted and his friend the barber did the same, both masked, so as not to be recognised by Don Quixote, and set out following in the rear of the cart.", " The landlord was carrying away the valise and the books, but the curate said to him, \u201cWait; I want to see what those papers are that are written in such a good hand.\u201d The landlord taking them out handed them to him to read, and he perceived they were a work of about eight sheets of manuscript, with, in large letters at the beginning, the title of \u201cNovel of the Ill-advised Curiosity.\u201d The curate read three or four lines to himself, and said, \u201cI must say the title of this novel does not seem to me a bad one, and I feel an inclination to read it all.\u201d To which the landlord replied, \u201cThen your reverence will do well to read it, for I can tell you that some guests who have read it here have been much pleased with it, and have begged it of me very earnestly; but I would not give it, meaning to return it to the person who forgot the valise, books, and papers here, for maybe he will return here some time or other; and though I know I shall miss the books, faith I mean to return them; for though I am an innkeeper, still I am a Christian.\u201d \u201cYou are very right, friend,\u201d said the curate; \u201cbut for all that, if the novel pleases me you must let me copy it.\u201d \u201cWith all my heart,\u201d replied the host. While they were talking Cardenio had taken up the novel and begun to read it, and forming the same opinion of it as the curate, he begged him to read it so that they might all hear it. \u201cI would read it,\u201d said the curate, \u201cif the time would not be better spent in sleeping.\u201d \u201cIt will be rest enough for me,\u201d said Dorothea, \u201cto while away the time by listening to some tale, for my spirits are not yet tranquil enough to let me sleep when it would be seasonable.\u201d \u201cWell then, in that case,\u201d said the curate, \u201cI will read it, if it were only out of curiosity; perhaps it may contain something pleasant.\u201d Master Nicholas added his entreaties to the same effect, and Sancho too; seeing which, and considering that he would give pleasure to all, and receive it himself, the curate said, \u201cWell then, attend to me everyone, for the novel begins thus.\u201d c32e.jpg (11K) CHAPTER XXXIII.", " Lothario commended his purpose, and promised on his own part to aid him in raising a monument so glorious. And so Anselmo was left the most charmingly hoodwinked man there could be in the world. He himself, persuaded he was conducting the instrument of his glory, led home by the hand of him who had been the utter destruction of his good name; whom Camilla received with averted countenance, though with smiles in her heart. The deception was carried on for some time, until at the end of a few months Fortune turned her wheel and the guilt which had been until then so skilfully concealed was published abroad, and Anselmo paid with his life the penalty of his ill-advised curiosity. CHAPTER XXXV. WHICH TREATS OF THE HEROIC AND PRODIGIOUS BATTLE DON QUIXOTE HAD WITH CERTAIN SKINS OF RED WINE, AND BRINGS THE NOVEL OF \u201cTHE ILL-ADVISED CURIOSITY\u201d TO A CLOSE There remained but little more of the novel to be read, when Sancho Panza burst forth in wild excitement from the garret where Don Quixote was lying, shouting, \u201cRun, sirs! quick; and help my master, who is in the thick of the toughest and stiffest battle I ever laid eyes on. By the living God he has given the giant, the enemy of my lady the Princess Micomicona, such a slash that he has sliced his head clean off as if it were a turnip.\u201d \u201cWhat are you talking about, brother?\u201d said the curate, pausing as he was about to read the remainder of the novel.", " There is life and individuality in all his characters, however little they may have to do, or however short a time they may be before the reader. Samson Carrasco, the curate, Teresa Panza, Altisidora, even the two students met on the road to the cave of Montesinos, all live and move and have their being; and it is characteristic of the broad humanity of Cervantes that there is not a hateful one among them all. Even poor Maritornes, with her deplorable morals, has a kind heart of her own and \u201csome faint and distant resemblance to a Christian about her;\u201d and as for Sancho, though on dissection we fail to find a lovable trait in him, unless it be a sort of dog-like affection for his master, who is there that in his heart does not love him? But it is, after all, the humour of \u201cDon Quixote\u201d that distinguishes it from all other books of the romance kind. It is this that makes it, as one of the most judicial-minded of modern critics calls it, \u201cthe best novel in the world beyond all comparison.\u201d It is its varied humour, ranging from broad farce to comedy as subtle as Shakespeare\u2019s or Moli\u00e8re\u2019s that has naturalised it in every country where there are readers, and made it a classic in every language that has a literature. THE AUTHOR\u2019S PREFACE Idle reader: thou mayest believe me without any oath that I would this book, as it is the child of my brain, were the fairest, gayest, and cleverest that could be imagined."], "Which character(s) invent fictional adventures for Don Quixote as a form of entertainment?": [" He eyed them askance, and could not make out where he was. The curate charged his niece to be very careful to make her uncle comfortable and to keep a watch over him lest he should make his escape from them again, telling her what they had been obliged to do to bring him home. On this the pair once more lifted up their voices and renewed their maledictions upon the books of chivalry, and implored heaven to plunge the authors of such lies and nonsense into the midst of the bottomless pit. They were, in short, kept in anxiety and dread lest their uncle and master should give them the slip the moment he found himself somewhat better, and as they feared so it fell out. But the author of this history, though he has devoted research and industry to the discovery of the deeds achieved by Don Quixote in his third sally, has been unable to obtain any information respecting them, at any rate derived from authentic documents; tradition has merely preserved in the memory of La Mancha the fact that Don Quixote, the third time he sallied forth from his home, betook himself to Saragossa, where he was present at some famous jousts which came off in that city, and that he had adventures there worthy of his valour and high intelligence. Of his end and death he could learn no particulars, nor would he have ascertained it or known of it, if good fortune had not produced an old physician for him who had in his possession a leaden box, which, according to his account, had been discovered among the crumbling foundations of an ancient hermitage that was being rebuilt; in which box were found certain parchment manuscripts in Gothic character, but in Castilian verse, containing many of his achievements, and setting forth the beauty of Dulcinea, the form of Rocinante, the fidelity of Sancho Panza, and the burial of Don Quixote himself, together with sundry epitaphs and eulogies on his life and character; but all that could be read and deciphered were those which the trustworthy author of this new and unparalleled history here presents.", " Sancho shrugged his shoulders, obeyed, and sat down, and all the duchess\u2019s damsels and duennas gathered round him, waiting in profound silence to hear what he would say. It was the duchess, however, who spoke first, saying: \u201cNow that we are alone, and that there is nobody here to overhear us, I should be glad if the se\u00f1or governor would relieve me of certain doubts I have, rising out of the history of the great Don Quixote that is now in print. One is: inasmuch as worthy Sancho never saw Dulcinea, I mean the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, nor took Don Quixote\u2019s letter to her, for it was left in the memorandum book in the Sierra Morena, how did he dare to invent the answer and all that about finding her sifting wheat, the whole story being a deception and falsehood, and so much to the prejudice of the peerless Dulcinea\u2019s good name, a thing that is not at all becoming the character and fidelity of a good squire?\u201d p33b.jpg (326K) Full Size At these words, Sancho, without uttering one in reply, got up from his chair, and with noiseless steps, with his body bent and his finger on his lips, went all round the room lifting up the hangings; and this done, he came back to his seat and said, \u201cNow, se\u00f1ora, that I have seen that there is no one except the bystanders listening to us on the sly, I will answer what you have asked me, and all you may ask me, without fear or dread. And the first thing I have got to say is, that for my own part I hold my master Don Quixote to be stark mad, though sometimes he says things that, to my mind, and indeed everybody\u2019s that listens to him, are so wise, and run in such a straight furrow, that Satan himself could not have said them better; but for all that, really, and beyond all question, it\u2019s my firm belief he is cracked.", " In short, the said history is the most delightful and least injurious entertainment that has been hitherto seen, for there is not to be found in the whole of it even the semblance of an immodest word, or a thought that is other than Catholic.\u201d \u201cTo write in any other way,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cwould not be to write truth, but falsehood, and historians who have recourse to falsehood ought to be burned, like those who coin false money; and I know not what could have led the author to have recourse to novels and irrelevant stories, when he had so much to write about in mine; no doubt he must have gone by the proverb \u2018with straw or with hay, etc,\u2019 for by merely setting forth my thoughts, my sighs, my tears, my lofty purposes, my enterprises, he might have made a volume as large, or larger than all the works of El Tostado would make up. In fact, the conclusion I arrive at, se\u00f1or bachelor, is, that to write histories, or books of any kind, there is need of great judgment and a ripe understanding. To give expression to humour, and write in a strain of graceful pleasantry, is the gift of great geniuses. The cleverest character in comedy is the clown, for he who would make people take him for a fool, must not be one. History is in a measure a sacred thing, for it should be true, and where the truth is, there God is; but notwithstanding this, there are some who write and fling books broadcast on the world as if they were fritters.\u201d \u201cThere is no book so bad but it has something good in it,\u201d said the bachelor.", " The advantage of this is that he is enabled to make use of Don Quixote as a mouthpiece for his own reflections, and so, without seeming to digress, allow himself the relief of digression when he requires it, as freely as in a commonplace book. It is true the amount of individuality bestowed upon Don Quixote is not very great. There are some natural touches of character about him, such as his mixture of irascibility and placability, and his curious affection for Sancho together with his impatience of the squire\u2019s loquacity and impertinence; but in the main, apart from his craze, he is little more than a thoughtful, cultured gentleman, with instinctive good taste and a great deal of shrewdness and originality of mind. As to Sancho, it is plain, from the concluding words of the preface to the First Part, that he was a favourite with his creator even before he had been taken into favour by the public. An inferior genius, taking him in hand a second time, would very likely have tried to improve him by making him more comical, clever, amiable, or virtuous. But Cervantes was too true an artist to spoil his work in this way. Sancho, when he reappears, is the old Sancho with the old familiar features; but with a difference; they have been brought out more distinctly, but at the same time with a careful avoidance of anything like caricature; the outline has been filled in where filling in was necessary, and, vivified by a few touches of a master\u2019s hand, Sancho stands before us as he might in a character portrait by Velazquez."], "What claim does Cervantes make for his narrative in the Prologue?": [" Gustave Dor\u00e9 makes it an elaborate fountain such as no arriero ever watered his mules at in the corral of any venta in Spain, and thereby entirely misses the point aimed at by Cervantes. It is the mean, prosaic, commonplace character of all the surroundings and circumstances that gives a significance to Don Quixote\u2019s vigil and the ceremony that follows. Cervantes\u2019 humour is for the most part of that broader and simpler sort, the strength of which lies in the perception of the incongruous. It is the incongruity of Sancho in all his ways, words, and works, with the ideas and aims of his master, quite as much as the wonderful vitality and truth to nature of the character, that makes him the most humorous creation in the whole range of fiction. That unsmiling gravity of which Cervantes was the first great master, \u201cCervantes\u2019 serious air,\u201d which sits naturally on Swift alone, perhaps, of later humourists, is essential to this kind of humour, and here again Cervantes has suffered at the hands of his interpreters. Nothing, unless indeed the coarse buffoonery of Phillips, could be more out of place in an attempt to represent Cervantes, than a flippant, would-be facetious style, like that of Motteux\u2019s version for example, or the sprightly, jaunty air, French translators sometimes adopt. It is the grave matter-of-factness of the narrative, and the apparent unconsciousness of the author that he is saying anything ludicrous, anything but the merest commonplace, that give its peculiar flavour to the humour of Cervantes.", " He taunts Cervantes with being old, with having lost his hand, with having been in prison, with being poor, with being friendless, accuses him of envy of Lope\u2019s success, of petulance and querulousness, and so on; and it was in this that the sting lay. Avellaneda\u2019s reason for this personal attack is obvious enough. Whoever he may have been, it is clear that he was one of the dramatists of Lope\u2019s school, for he has the impudence to charge Cervantes with attacking him as well as Lope in his criticism on the drama. His identification has exercised the best critics and baffled all the ingenuity and research that has been brought to bear on it. Navarrete and Ticknor both incline to the belief that Cervantes knew who he was; but I must say I think the anger he shows suggests an invisible assailant; it is like the irritation of a man stung by a mosquito in the dark. Cervantes from certain solecisms of language pronounces him to be an Aragonese, and Pellicer, an Aragonese himself, supports this view and believes him, moreover, to have been an ecclesiastic, a Dominican probably. Any merit Avellaneda has is reflected from Cervantes, and he is too dull to reflect much. \u201cDull and dirty\u201d will always be, I imagine, the verdict of the vast majority of unprejudiced readers. He is, at best, a poor plagiarist; all he can do is to follow slavishly the lead given him by Cervantes; his only humour lies in making Don Quixote take inns for castles and fancy himself some legendary or historical personage, and Sancho mistake words, invert proverbs, and display his gluttony; all through he shows a proclivity to coarseness and dirt, and he has contrived to introduce two tales filthier than anything by the sixteenth century novellieri and without their sprightliness.", " All traces of the personality of Cervantes had by that time disappeared. Any floating traditions that may once have existed, transmitted from men who had known him, had long since died out, and of other record there was none; for the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were incurious as to \u201cthe men of the time,\u201d a reproach against which the nineteenth has, at any rate, secured itself, if it has produced no Shakespeare or Cervantes. All that Mayans y Siscar, to whom the task was entrusted, or any of those who followed him, Rios, Pellicer, or Navarrete, could do was to eke out the few allusions Cervantes makes to himself in his various prefaces with such pieces of documentary evidence bearing upon his life as they could find. This, however, has been done by the last-named biographer to such good purpose that he has superseded all predecessors. Thoroughness is the chief characteristic of Navarrete\u2019s work. Besides sifting, testing, and methodising with rare patience and judgment what had been previously brought to light, he left, as the saying is, no stone unturned under which anything to illustrate his subject might possibly be found. Navarrete has done all that industry and acumen could do, and it is no fault of his if he has not given us what we want. What Hallam says of Shakespeare may be applied to the almost parallel case of Cervantes: \u201cIt is not the register of his baptism, or the draft of his will, or the orthography of his name that we seek; no letter of his writing, no record of his conversation, no character of him drawn ... by a contemporary has been produced.\u201d It is only natural, therefore, that the biographers of Cervantes, forced to make brick without straw, should have recourse largely to conjecture, and that conjecture should in some instances come by degrees to take the place of established fact.", " It is needless to say they were put forward by Cervantes in all good faith and full confidence in their merits. The reader, however, was not to suppose they were his last word or final effort in the drama, for he had in hand a comedy called \u201cEngano a los ojos,\u201d about which, if he mistook not, there would be no question. Of this dramatic masterpiece the world has no opportunity of judging; his health had been failing for some time, and he died, apparently of dropsy, on the 23rd of April, 1616, the day on which England lost Shakespeare, nominally at least, for the English calendar had not yet been reformed. He died as he had lived, accepting his lot bravely and cheerfully. Was it an unhappy life, that of Cervantes? His biographers all tell us that it was; but I must say I doubt it. It was a hard life, a life of poverty, of incessant struggle, of toil ill paid, of disappointment, but Cervantes carried within himself the antidote to all these evils. His was not one of those light natures that rise above adversity merely by virtue of their own buoyancy; it was in the fortitude of a high spirit that he was proof against it. It is impossible to conceive Cervantes giving way to despondency or prostrated by dejection. As for poverty, it was with him a thing to be laughed over, and the only sigh he ever allows to escape him is when he says, \u201cHappy he to whom Heaven has given a piece of bread for which he is not bound to give thanks to any but Heaven itself.\u201d Add to all this his vital energy and mental activity, his restless invention and his sanguine temperament, and there will be reason enough to doubt whether his could have been a very unhappy life."], "Where is Don Quixote from?": [" Supper-time having come, then, Don Quixote betook himself to his room, the landlord brought in the stew-pan just as it was, and he sat himself down to sup very resolutely. It seems that in another room, which was next to Don Quixote\u2019s, with nothing but a thin partition to separate it, he overheard these words, \u201cAs you live, Se\u00f1or Don Jeronimo, while they are bringing supper, let us read another chapter of the Second Part of \u2018Don Quixote of La Mancha.\u2019\u201d The instant Don Quixote heard his own name he started to his feet and listened with open ears to catch what they said about him, and heard the Don Jeronimo who had been addressed say in reply, \u201cWhy would you have us read that absurd stuff, Don Juan, when it is impossible for anyone who has read the First Part of the history of \u2018Don Quixote of La Mancha\u2019 to take any pleasure in reading this Second Part?\u201d \u201cFor all that,\u201d said he who was addressed as Don Juan, \u201cwe shall do well to read it, for there is no book so bad but it has something good in it. What displeases me most in it is that it represents Don Quixote as now cured of his love for Dulcinea del Toboso.\u201d On hearing this Don Quixote, full of wrath and indignation, lifted up his voice and said, \u201cWhoever he may be who says that Don Quixote of La Mancha has forgotten or can forget Dulcinea del Toboso, I will teach him with equal arms that what he says is very far from the truth; for neither can the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso be forgotten, nor can forgetfulness have a place in Don Quixote; his motto is constancy, and his profession to maintain the same with his life and never wrong it.\u201d \u201cWho is this that answers us?\u201d said they in the next room.", " They asked him whither he meant to direct his steps. He replied, to Saragossa, to take part in the harness jousts which were held in that city every year. Don Juan told him that the new history described how Don Quixote, let him be who he might, took part there in a tilting at the ring, utterly devoid of invention, poor in mottoes, very poor in costume, though rich in sillinesses. \u201cFor that very reason,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cI will not set foot in Saragossa; and by that means I shall expose to the world the lie of this new history writer, and people will see that I am not the Don Quixote he speaks of.\u201d \u201cYou will do quite right,\u201d said Don Jeronimo; \u201cand there are other jousts at Barcelona in which Se\u00f1or Don Quixote may display his prowess.\u201d \u201cThat is what I mean to do,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cand as it is now time, I pray your worships to give me leave to retire to bed, and to place and retain me among the number of your greatest friends and servants.\u201d \u201cAnd me too,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cmaybe I\u2019ll be good for something.\u201d With this they exchanged farewells, and Don Quixote and Sancho retired to their room, leaving Don Juan and Don Jeronimo amazed to see the medley he made of his good sense and his craziness; and they felt thoroughly convinced that these, and not those their Aragonese author described, were the genuine Don Quixote and Sancho. Don Quixote rose betimes, and bade adieu to his hosts by knocking at the partition of the other room.", " Don Quixote was mounted, not on Rocinante, but upon a tall mule of easy pace and handsomely caparisoned. They put the surcoat on him, and on the back, without his perceiving it, they stitched a parchment on which they wrote in large letters, \u201cThis is Don Quixote of La Mancha.\u201d As they set out upon their excursion the placard attracted the eyes of all who chanced to see him, and as they read out, \u201cThis is Don Quixote of La Mancha,\u201d Don Quixote was amazed to see how many people gazed at him, called him by his name, and recognised him, and turning to Don Antonio, who rode at his side, he observed to him, \u201cGreat are the privileges knight-errantry involves, for it makes him who professes it known and famous in every region of the earth; see, Don Antonio, even the very boys of this city know me without ever having seen me.\u201d \u201cTrue, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote,\u201d returned Don Antonio; \u201cfor as fire cannot be hidden or kept secret, virtue cannot escape being recognised; and that which is attained by the profession of arms shines distinguished above all others.\u201d It came to pass, however, that as Don Quixote was proceeding amid the acclamations that have been described, a Castilian, reading the inscription on his back, cried out in a loud voice, \u201cThe devil take thee for a Don Quixote of La Mancha! What! art thou here, and not dead of the countless drubbings that have fallen on thy ribs? Thou art mad; and if thou wert so by thyself, and kept thyself within thy madness, it would not be so bad; but thou hast the gift of making fools and blockheads of all who have anything to do with thee or say to thee.", " To anyone who knew the country well, the mere style and title of \u201cDon Quixote of La Mancha\u201d gave the key to the author\u2019s meaning at once. La Mancha as the knight\u2019s country and scene of his chivalries is of a piece with the pasteboard helmet, the farm-labourer on ass-back for a squire, knighthood conferred by a rascally ventero, convicts taken for victims of oppression, and the rest of the incongruities between Don Quixote\u2019s world and the world he lived in, between things as he saw them and things as they were. It is strange that this element of incongruity, underlying the whole humour and purpose of the book, should have been so little heeded by the majority of those who have undertaken to interpret \u201cDon Quixote.\u201d It has been completely overlooked, for example, by the illustrators. To be sure, the great majority of the artists who illustrated \u201cDon Quixote\u201d knew nothing whatever of Spain. To them a venta conveyed no idea but the abstract one of a roadside inn, and they could not therefore do full justice to the humour of Don Quixote\u2019s misconception in taking it for a castle, or perceive the remoteness of all its realities from his ideal. But even when better informed they seem to have no apprehension of the full force of the discrepancy. Take, for instance, Gustave Dor\u00e9\u2019s drawing of Don Quixote watching his armour in the inn-yard. Whether or not the Venta de Quesada on the Seville road is, as tradition maintains, the inn described in \u201cDon Quixote,\u201d beyond all question it was just such an inn-yard as the one behind it that Cervantes had in his mind\u2019s eye, and it was on just such a rude stone trough as that beside the primitive draw-well in the corner that he meant Don Quixote to deposit his armour."], "Why does Don Quixote refuse to remove his helmet after the two \u201cprincesses\u201d remove his other armor at the inn?": [" The landlord eyed him over but did not find him as good as Don Quixote said, nor even half as good; and putting him up in the stable, he returned to see what might be wanted by his guest, whom the damsels, who had by this time made their peace with him, were now relieving of his armour. They had taken off his breastplate and backpiece, but they neither knew nor saw how to open his gorget or remove his make-shift helmet, for he had fastened it with green ribbons, which, as there was no untying the knots, required to be cut. This, however, he would not by any means consent to, so he remained all the evening with his helmet on, the drollest and oddest figure that can be imagined; and while they were removing his armour, taking the baggages who were about it for ladies of high degree belonging to the castle, he said to them with great sprightliness: \u201cOh, never, surely, was there knight So served by hand of dame, As served was he, Don Quixote hight, When from his town he came; With maidens waiting on himself, Princesses on his hack\u2014 \u2014or Rocinante, for that, ladies mine, is my horse\u2019s name, and Don Quixote of La Mancha is my own; for though I had no intention of declaring myself until my achievements in your service and honour had made me known, the necessity of adapting that old ballad of Lancelot to the present occasion has given you the knowledge of my name altogether prematurely.", " They left him and went in, and presently the barber brought him out something to eat. By-and-by, after they had between them carefully thought over what they should do to carry out their object, the curate hit upon an idea very well adapted to humour Don Quixote, and effect their purpose; and his notion, which he explained to the barber, was that he himself should assume the disguise of a wandering damsel, while the other should try as best he could to pass for a squire, and that they should thus proceed to where Don Quixote was, and he, pretending to be an aggrieved and distressed damsel, should ask a favour of him, which as a valiant knight-errant he could not refuse to grant; and the favour he meant to ask him was that he should accompany her whither she would conduct him, in order to redress a wrong which a wicked knight had done her, while at the same time she should entreat him not to require her to remove her mask, nor ask her any question touching her circumstances until he had righted her with the wicked knight. And he had no doubt that Don Quixote would comply with any request made in these terms, and that in this way they might remove him and take him to his own village, where they would endeavour to find out if his extraordinary madness admitted of any kind of remedy. c26e.jpg (48K) CHAPTER XXVII. OF HOW THE CURATE AND THE BARBER PROCEEDED WITH THEIR SCHEME; TOGETHER WITH OTHER MATTERS WORTHY OF RECORD IN THIS GREAT HISTORY c27a.jpg (169K) Full Size The curate\u2019s plan did not seem a bad one to the barber, but on the contrary so good that they immediately set about putting it in execution.", " p12b.jpg (298K) Full Size In conversation of this kind they passed a good part of the night, but Sancho felt a desire to let down the curtains of his eyes, as he used to say when he wanted to go to sleep; and stripping Dapple he left him at liberty to graze his fill. He did not remove Rocinante\u2019s saddle, as his master\u2019s express orders were, that so long as they were in the field or not sleeping under a roof Rocinante was not to be stripped\u2014the ancient usage established and observed by knights-errant being to take off the bridle and hang it on the saddle-bow, but to remove the saddle from the horse\u2014never! Sancho acted accordingly, and gave him the same liberty he had given Dapple, between whom and Rocinante there was a friendship so unequalled and so strong, that it is handed down by tradition from father to son, that the author of this veracious history devoted some special chapters to it, which, in order to preserve the propriety and decorum due to a history so heroic, he did not insert therein; although at times he forgets this resolution of his and describes how eagerly the two beasts would scratch one another when they were together and how, when they were tired or full, Rocinante would lay his neck across Dapple\u2019s, stretching half a yard or more on the other side, and the pair would stand thus, gazing thoughtfully on the ground, for three days, or at least so long as they were left alone, or hunger did not drive them to go and look for food.", " For I would have thee know, Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be in hand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in express words: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has in his hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason that he whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imagine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore suffered any indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, were nothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carried rapier, sword, or dagger.\u201d \u201cThey gave me no time to see that much,\u201d answered Sancho, \u201cfor hardly had I laid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with their sticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out of my feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all those stake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain of the blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as on my shoulders.\u201d \u201cFor all that let me tell thee, brother Panza,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cthat there is no recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death does not remove.\u201d \u201cAnd what greater misfortune can there be,\u201d replied Panza, \u201cthan the one that waits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it?"], "Who knights Don Quixote?": [" I shall be told, too, that Don Fernando de Guevara did not go in quest of adventures to Germany, where he engaged in combat with Micer George, a knight of the house of the Duke of Austria. I shall be told that the jousts of Suero de Qui\u00f1ones, him of the \u2018Paso,\u2019 and the emprise of Mosen Luis de Falces against the Castilian knight, Don Gonzalo de Guzman, were mere mockeries; as well as many other achievements of Christian knights of these and foreign realms, which are so authentic and true, that, I repeat, he who denies them must be totally wanting in reason and good sense.\u201d The canon was amazed to hear the medley of truth and fiction Don Quixote uttered, and to see how well acquainted he was with everything relating or belonging to the achievements of his knight-errantry; so he said in reply: \u201cI cannot deny, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote, that there is some truth in what you say, especially as regards the Spanish knights-errant; and I am willing to grant too that the Twelve Peers of France existed, but I am not disposed to believe that they did all the things that the Archbishop Turpin relates of them. For the truth of the matter is they were knights chosen by the kings of France, and called \u2018Peers\u2019 because they were all equal in worth, rank and prowess (at least if they were not they ought to have been), and it was a kind of religious order like those of Santiago and Calatrava in the present day, in which it is assumed that those who take it are valiant knights of distinction and good birth; and just as we say now a Knight of St. John, or of Alc\u00e1ntara, they used to say then a Knight of the Twelve Peers, because twelve equals were chosen for that military order.", " I say this that Master Basin may know that I understand him.\u201d \u201cIndeed, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote,\u201d said the barber, \u201cI did not mean it in that way, and, so help me God, my intention was good, and your worship ought not to be vexed.\u201d \u201cAs to whether I ought to be vexed or not,\u201d returned Don Quixote, \u201cI myself am the best judge.\u201d Hereupon the curate observed, \u201cI have hardly said a word as yet; and I would gladly be relieved of a doubt, arising from what Don Quixote has said, that worries and works my conscience.\u201d \u201cThe se\u00f1or curate has leave for more than that,\u201d returned Don Quixote, \u201cso he may declare his doubt, for it is not pleasant to have a doubt on one\u2019s conscience.\u201d \u201cWell then, with that permission,\u201d said the curate, \u201cI say my doubt is that, all I can do, I cannot persuade myself that the whole pack of knights-errant you, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote, have mentioned, were really and truly persons of flesh and blood, that ever lived in the world; on the contrary, I suspect it to be all fiction, fable, and falsehood, and dreams told by men awakened from sleep, or rather still half asleep.\u201d \u201cThat is another mistake,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cinto which many have fallen who do not believe that there ever were such knights in the world, and I have often, with divers people and on divers occasions, tried to expose this almost universal error to the light of truth. Sometimes I have not been successful in my purpose, sometimes I have, supporting it upon the shoulders of the truth; which truth is so clear that I can almost say I have with my own eyes seen Amadis of Gaul, who was a man of lofty stature, fair complexion, with a handsome though black beard, of a countenance between gentle and stern in expression, sparing of words, slow to anger, and quick to put it away from him; and as I have depicted Amadis, so I could, I think, portray and describe all the knights-errant that are in all the histories in the world; for by the perception I have that they were what their histories describe, and by the deeds they did and the dispositions they displayed, it is possible, with the aid of sound philosophy, to deduce their features, complexion, and stature.\u201d \u201cHow big, in your worship\u2019s opinion, may the giant Morgante have been, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote?\u201d asked the barber.", " What! can it be, most serene Casildea de Vandalia, that thou wilt suffer this thy captive knight to waste away and perish in ceaseless wanderings and rude and arduous toils? It is not enough that I have compelled all the knights of Navarre, all the Leonese, all the Tartesians, all the Castilians, and finally all the knights of La Mancha, to confess thee the most beautiful in the world?\u201d \u201cNot so,\u201d said Don Quixote at this, \u201cfor I am of La Mancha, and I have never confessed anything of the sort, nor could I nor should I confess a thing so much to the prejudice of my lady\u2019s beauty; thou seest how this knight is raving, Sancho. But let us listen, perhaps he will tell us more about himself.\u201d \u201cThat he will,\u201d returned Sancho, \u201cfor he seems in a mood to bewail himself for a month at a stretch.\u201d But this was not the case, for the Knight of the Grove, hearing voices near him, instead of continuing his lamentation, stood up and exclaimed in a distinct but courteous tone, \u201cWho goes there? What are you? Do you belong to the number of the happy or of the miserable?\u201d \u201cOf the miserable,\u201d answered Don Quixote. \u201cThen come to me,\u201d said he of the Grove, \u201cand rest assured that it is to woe itself and affliction itself you come.\u201d Don Quixote, finding himself answered in such a soft and courteous manner, went over to him, and so did Sancho. The doleful knight took Don Quixote by the arm, saying, \u201cSit down here, sir knight; for, that you are one, and of those that profess knight-errantry, it is to me a sufficient proof to have found you in this place, where solitude and night, the natural couch and proper retreat of knights-errant, keep you company.\u201d To which Don made answer, \u201cA knight I am of the profession you mention, and though sorrows, misfortunes, and calamities have made my heart their abode, the compassion I feel for the misfortunes of others has not been thereby banished from it.", " She laughed greatly when I told her how your worship was called The Knight of the Rueful Countenance; I asked her if that Biscayan the other day had been there; and she told me he had, and that he was an honest fellow; I asked her too about the galley slaves, but she said she had not seen any as yet.\u201d \u201cSo far all goes well,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cbut tell me what jewel was it that she gave thee on taking thy leave, in return for thy tidings of me? For it is a usual and ancient custom with knights and ladies errant to give the squires, damsels, or dwarfs who bring tidings of their ladies to the knights, or of their knights to the ladies, some rich jewel as a guerdon for good news, and acknowledgment of the message.\u201d \u201cThat is very likely,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cand a good custom it was, to my mind; but that must have been in days gone by, for now it would seem to be the custom only to give a piece of bread and cheese; because that was what my lady Dulcinea gave me over the top of the yard-wall when I took leave of her; and more by token it was sheep\u2019s-milk cheese.\u201d \u201cShe is generous in the extreme,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand if she did not give thee a jewel of gold, no doubt it must have been because she had not one to hand there to give thee; but sleeves are good after Easter; I shall see her and all shall be made right. But knowest thou what amazes me, Sancho? It seems to me thou must have gone and come through the air, for thou hast taken but little more than three days to go to El Toboso and return, though it is more than thirty leagues from here to there."], "When Don Quixote leaves, what does the farmer do to the young boy he has been whipping?": [" However, tell this good man to come in; but take care first of all that he is not some spy or one of my assassins.\u201d \u201cNo, my lord,\u201d said the page, \u201cfor he looks like a simple fellow, and either I know very little or he is as good as good bread.\u201d \u201cThere is nothing to be afraid of,\u201d said the majordomo, \u201cfor we are all here.\u201d \u201cWould it be possible, carver,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cnow that Doctor Pedro Recio is not here, to let me eat something solid and substantial, if it were even a piece of bread and an onion?\u201d \u201cTo-night at supper,\u201d said the carver, \u201cthe shortcomings of the dinner shall be made good, and your lordship shall be fully contented.\u201d \u201cGod grant it,\u201d said Sancho. The farmer now came in, a well-favoured man that one might see a thousand leagues off was an honest fellow and a good soul. The first thing he said was, \u201cWhich is the lord governor here?\u201d \u201cWhich should it be,\u201d said the secretary, \u201cbut he who is seated in the chair?\u201d \u201cThen I humble myself before him,\u201d said the farmer; and going on his knees he asked for his hand, to kiss it. Sancho refused it, and bade him stand up and say what he wanted. The farmer obeyed, and then said, \u201cI am a farmer, se\u00f1or, a native of Miguelturra, a village two leagues from Ciudad Real.\u201d \u201cAnother Tirteafuera!\u201d said Sancho; \u201csay on, brother; I know Miguelturra very well I can tell you, for it\u2019s not very far from my own town.\u201d \u201cThe case is this, se\u00f1or,\u201d continued the farmer, \u201cthat by God\u2019s mercy I am married with the leave and licence of the holy Roman Catholic Church; I have two sons, students, and the younger is studying to become bachelor, and the elder to be licentiate; I am a widower, for my wife died, or more properly speaking, a bad doctor killed her on my hands, giving her a purge when she was with child; and if it had pleased God that the child had been born, and was a boy, I would have put him to study for doctor, that he might not envy his brothers the bachelor and the licentiate.\u201d \u201cSo that if your wife had not died, or had not been killed, you would not now be a widower,\u201d said Sancho.", " I had no hopes to give her, nor treasures to offer her, for mine are given to Dulcinea, and the treasures of knights-errant are like those of the fairies,\u2019 illusory and deceptive; all I can give her is the place in my memory I keep for her, without prejudice, however, to that which I hold devoted to Dulcinea, whom thou art wronging by thy remissness in whipping thyself and scourging that flesh\u2014would that I saw it eaten by wolves\u2014which would rather keep itself for the worms than for the relief of that poor lady.\u201d \u201cSe\u00f1or,\u201d replied Sancho, \u201cif the truth is to be told, I cannot persuade myself that the whipping of my backside has anything to do with the disenchantment of the enchanted; it is like saying, \u2018If your head aches rub ointment on your knees;\u2019 at any rate I\u2019ll make bold to swear that in all the histories dealing with knight-errantry that your worship has read you have never come across anybody disenchanted by whipping; but whether or no I\u2019ll whip myself when I have a fancy for it, and the opportunity serves for scourging myself comfortably.\u201d \u201cGod grant it,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cand heaven give thee grace to take it to heart and own the obligation thou art under to help my lady, who is thine also, inasmuch as thou art mine.\u201d As they pursued their journey talking in this way they came to the very same spot where they had been trampled on by the bulls. Don Quixote recognised it, and said he to Sancho, \u201cThis is the meadow where we came upon those gay shepherdesses and gallant shepherds who were trying to revive and imitate the pastoral Arcadia there, an idea as novel as it was happy, in emulation whereof, if so be thou dost approve of it, Sancho, I would have ourselves turn shepherds, at any rate for the time I have to live in retirement.", " The farmer followed him with his eyes, and when he saw that he had cleared the wood and was no longer in sight, he turned to his boy Andres, and said, \u201cCome here, my son, I want to pay you what I owe you, as that undoer of wrongs has commanded me.\u201d \u201cMy oath on it,\u201d said Andres, \u201cyour worship will be well advised to obey the command of that good knight\u2014may he live a thousand years\u2014for, as he is a valiant and just judge, by Roque, if you do not pay me, he will come back and do as he said.\u201d \u201cMy oath on it, too,\u201d said the farmer; \u201cbut as I have a strong affection for you, I want to add to the debt in order to add to the payment;\u201d and seizing him by the arm, he tied him up again, and gave him such a flogging that he left him for dead. \u201cNow, Master Andres,\u201d said the farmer, \u201ccall on the undoer of wrongs; you will find he won\u2019t undo that, though I am not sure that I have quite done with you, for I have a good mind to flay you alive.\u201d But at last he untied him, and gave him leave to go look for his judge in order to put the sentence pronounced into execution. Andres went off rather down in the mouth, swearing he would go to look for the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha and tell him exactly what had happened, and that all would have to be repaid him sevenfold; but for all that, he went off weeping, while his master stood laughing. Thus did the valiant Don Quixote right that wrong, and, thoroughly satisfied with what had taken place, as he considered he had made a very happy and noble beginning with his knighthood, he took the road towards his village in perfect self-content, saying in a low voice, \u201cWell mayest thou this day call thyself fortunate above all on earth, O Dulcinea del Toboso, fairest of the fair!", " Come to the point without all this beating about the bush, and all these scraps and additions.\u201d \u201cI want your worship, se\u00f1or,\u201d said the farmer, \u201cto do me the favour of giving me a letter of recommendation to the girl\u2019s father, begging him to be so good as to let this marriage take place, as we are not ill-matched either in the gifts of fortune or of nature; for to tell the truth, se\u00f1or governor, my son is possessed of a devil, and there is not a day but the evil spirits torment him three or four times; and from having once fallen into the fire, he has his face puckered up like a piece of parchment, and his eyes watery and always running; but he has the disposition of an angel, and if it was not for belabouring and pummelling himself he\u2019d be a saint.\u201d \u201cIs there anything else you want, good man?\u201d said Sancho. \u201cThere\u2019s another thing I\u2019d like,\u201d said the farmer, \u201cbut I\u2019m afraid to mention it; however, out it must; for after all I can\u2019t let it be rotting in my breast, come what may. I mean, se\u00f1or, that I\u2019d like your worship to give me three hundred or six hundred ducats as a help to my bachelor\u2019s portion, to help him in setting up house; for they must, in short, live by themselves, without being subject to the interferences of their fathers-in-law.\u201d \u201cJust see if there\u2019s anything else you\u2019d like,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cand don\u2019t hold back from mentioning it out of bashfulness or modesty.\u201d \u201cNo, indeed there is not,\u201d said the farmer."], "Which friends does Don Quixote find at his house upon his return home?": [" The first few days, those of a wedding being usually days of merry-making, Lothario frequented his friend Anselmo\u2019s house as he had been wont, striving to do honour to him and to the occasion, and to gratify him in every way he could; but when the wedding days were over and the succession of visits and congratulations had slackened, he began purposely to leave off going to the house of Anselmo, for it seemed to him, as it naturally would to all men of sense, that friends\u2019 houses ought not to be visited after marriage with the same frequency as in their masters\u2019 bachelor days: because, though true and genuine friendship cannot and should not be in any way suspicious, still a married man\u2019s honour is a thing of such delicacy that it is held liable to injury from brothers, much more from friends. Anselmo remarked the cessation of Lothario\u2019s visits, and complained of it to him, saying that if he had known that marriage was to keep him from enjoying his society as he used, he would have never married; and that, if by the thorough harmony that subsisted between them while he was a bachelor they had earned such a sweet name as that of \u201cThe Two Friends,\u201d he should not allow a title so rare and so delightful to be lost through a needless anxiety to act circumspectly; and so he entreated him, if such a phrase was allowable between them, to be once more master of his house and to come in and go out as formerly, assuring him that his wife Camilla had no other desire or inclination than that which he would wish her to have, and that knowing how sincerely they loved one another she was grieved to see such coldness in him.", " All over the place nothing was to be heard except the barking of dogs, which deafened the ears of Don Quixote and troubled the heart of Sancho. Now and then an ass brayed, pigs grunted, cats mewed, and the various noises they made seemed louder in the silence of the night; all which the enamoured knight took to be of evil omen; nevertheless he said to Sancho, \u201cSancho, my son, lead on to the palace of Dulcinea, it may be that we shall find her awake.\u201d \u201cBody of the sun! what palace am I to lead to,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cwhen what I saw her highness in was only a very little house?\u201d \u201cMost likely she had then withdrawn into some small apartment of her palace,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cto amuse herself with damsels, as great ladies and princesses are accustomed to do.\u201d \u201cSe\u00f1or,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cif your worship will have it in spite of me that the house of my lady Dulcinea is a palace, is this an hour, think you, to find the door open; and will it be right for us to go knocking till they hear us and open the door; making a disturbance and confusion all through the household? Are we going, do you fancy, to the house of our wenches, like gallants who come and knock and go in at any hour, however late it may be?\u201d \u201cLet us first of all find out the palace for certain,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cand then I will tell thee, Sancho, what we had best do; but look, Sancho, for either I see badly, or that dark mass that one sees from here should be Dulcinea\u2019s palace.\u201d \u201cThen let your worship lead the way,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cperhaps it may be so; though I see it with my eyes and touch it with my hands, I\u2019ll believe it as much as I believe it is daylight now.\u201d Don Quixote took the lead, and having gone a matter of two hundred paces he came upon the mass that produced the shade, and found it was a great tower, and then he perceived that the building in question was no palace, but the chief church of the town, and said he, \u201cIt\u2019s the church we have lit upon, Sancho.\u201d \u201cSo I see,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cand God grant we may not light upon our graves; it is no good sign to find oneself wandering in a graveyard at this time of night; and that, after my telling your worship, if I don\u2019t mistake, that the house of this lady will be in an alley without an outlet.\u201d \u201cThe curse of God on thee for a blockhead!\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cwhere hast thou ever heard of castles and royal palaces being built in alleys without an outlet?\u201d \u201cSe\u00f1or,\u201d replied Sancho, \u201cevery country has a way of its own; perhaps here in El Toboso it is the way to build palaces and grand buildings in alleys; so I entreat your worship to let me search about among these streets or alleys before me, and perhaps, in some corner or other, I may stumble on this palace\u2014and I wish I saw the dogs eating it for leading us such a dance.\u201d \u201cSpeak respectfully of what belongs to my lady, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201clet us keep the feast in peace, and not throw the rope after the bucket.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll hold my tongue,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cbut how am I to take it patiently when your worship wants me, with only once seeing the house of our mistress, to know always, and find it in the middle of the night, when your worship can\u2019t find it, who must have seen it thousands of times?\u201d \u201cThou wilt drive me to desperation, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote.", " Don Quixote a madman, and we sane; he goes off laughing, safe, and sound, and you are left sore and sorry! I\u2019d like to know now which is the madder, he who is so because he cannot help it, or he who is so of his own choice?\u201d To which Samson replied, \u201cThe difference between the two sorts of madmen is, that he who is so will he nil he, will be one always, while he who is so of his own accord can leave off being one whenever he likes.\u201d \u201cIn that case,\u201d said Tom Cecial, \u201cI was a madman of my own accord when I volunteered to become your squire, and, of my own accord, I\u2019ll leave off being one and go home.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s your affair,\u201d returned Samson, \u201cbut to suppose that I am going home until I have given Don Quixote a thrashing is absurd; and it is not any wish that he may recover his senses that will make me hunt him out now, but a wish for the sore pain I am in with my ribs won\u2019t let me entertain more charitable thoughts.\u201d Thus discoursing, the pair proceeded until they reached a town where it was their good luck to find a bone-setter, with whose help the unfortunate Samson was cured. Tom Cecial left him and went home, while he stayed behind meditating vengeance; and the history will return to him again at the proper time, so as not to omit making merry with Don Quixote now. p15e.jpg (17K) CHAPTER XVI. OF WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE WITH A DISCREET GENTLEMAN OF LA MANCHA p16a.jpg (85K) Full Size Don Quixote pursued his journey in the high spirits, satisfaction, and self-complacency already described, fancying himself the most valorous knight-errant of the age in the world because of his late victory.", " To all this and much more that Anselmo said to Lothario to persuade him to come to his house as he had been in the habit of doing, Lothario replied with so much prudence, sense, and judgment, that Anselmo was satisfied of his friend\u2019s good intentions, and it was agreed that on two days in the week, and on holidays, Lothario should come to dine with him; but though this arrangement was made between them Lothario resolved to observe it no further than he considered to be in accordance with the honour of his friend, whose good name was more to him than his own. He said, and justly, that a married man upon whom heaven had bestowed a beautiful wife should consider as carefully what friends he brought to his house as what female friends his wife associated with, for what cannot be done or arranged in the market-place, in church, at public festivals or at stations (opportunities that husbands cannot always deny their wives), may be easily managed in the house of the female friend or relative in whom most confidence is reposed. Lothario said, too, that every married man should have some friend who would point out to him any negligence he might be guilty of in his conduct, for it will sometimes happen that owing to the deep affection the husband bears his wife either he does not caution her, or, not to vex her, refrains from telling her to do or not to do certain things, doing or avoiding which may be a matter of honour or reproach to him; and errors of this kind he could easily correct if warned by a friend."], "What do the barber and the priest sort through and destroy in Don Quixote\u2019s home?": [" Her husband Guillermo died of grief at the death of so good a wife, leaving his daughter Marcela, a child and rich, to the care of an uncle of hers, a priest and prebendary in our village. The girl grew up with such beauty that it reminded us of her mother\u2019s, which was very great, and yet it was thought that the daughter\u2019s would exceed it; and so when she reached the age of fourteen to fifteen years nobody beheld her but blessed God that had made her so beautiful, and the greater number were in love with her past redemption. Her uncle kept her in great seclusion and retirement, but for all that the fame of her great beauty spread so that, as well for it as for her great wealth, her uncle was asked, solicited, and importuned, to give her in marriage not only by those of our town but of those many leagues round, and by the persons of highest quality in them. But he, being a good Christian man, though he desired to give her in marriage at once, seeing her to be old enough, was unwilling to do so without her consent, not that he had any eye to the gain and profit which the custody of the girl\u2019s property brought him while he put off her marriage; and, faith, this was said in praise of the good priest in more than one set in the town. For I would have you know, Sir Errant, that in these little villages everything is talked about and everything is carped at, and rest assured, as I am, that the priest must be over and above good who forces his parishioners to speak well of him, especially in villages.\u201d \u201cThat is the truth,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cbut go on, for the story is very good, and you, good Pedro, tell it with very good grace.\u201d \u201cMay that of the Lord not be wanting to me,\u201d said Pedro; \u201cthat is the one to have.", " IN WHICH THE DOUBTFUL QUESTION OF MAMBRINO\u2019S HELMET AND THE PACK-SADDLE IS FINALLY SETTLED, WITH OTHER ADVENTURES THAT OCCURRED IN TRUTH AND EARNEST c45a.jpg (154K) Full Size \u201cWhat do you think now, gentlemen,\u201d said the barber, \u201cof what these gentles say, when they want to make out that this is a helmet?\u201d \u201cAnd whoever says the contrary,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cI will let him know he lies if he is a knight, and if he is a squire that he lies again a thousand times.\u201d Our own barber, who was present at all this, and understood Don Quixote\u2019s humour so thoroughly, took it into his head to back up his delusion and carry on the joke for the general amusement; so addressing the other barber he said: \u201cSe\u00f1or barber, or whatever you are, you must know that I belong to your profession too, and have had a licence to practise for more than twenty years, and I know the implements of the barber craft, every one of them, perfectly well; and I was likewise a soldier for some time in the days of my youth, and I know also what a helmet is, and a morion, and a headpiece with a visor, and other things pertaining to soldiering, I meant to say to soldiers\u2019 arms; and I say\u2014saving better opinions and always with submission to sounder judgments\u2014that this piece we have now before us, which this worthy gentleman has in his hands, not only is no barber\u2019s basin, but is as far from being one as white is from black, and truth from falsehood; I say, moreover, that this, although it is a helmet, is not a complete helmet.\u201d \u201cCertainly not,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cfor half of it is wanting, that is to say the beaver.\u201d \u201cIt is quite true,\u201d said the curate, who saw the object of his friend the barber; and Cardenio, Don Fernando and his companions agreed with him, and even the Judge, if his thoughts had not been so full of Don Luis\u2019s affair, would have helped to carry on the joke; but he was so taken up with the serious matters he had on his mind that he paid little or no attention to these facetious proceedings.", " They took leave of all, and of the good Maritornes, who, sinner as she was, promised to pray a rosary of prayers that God might grant them success in such an arduous and Christian undertaking as that they had in hand. But hardly had he sallied forth from the inn when it struck the curate that he was doing wrong in rigging himself out in that fashion, as it was an indecorous thing for a priest to dress himself that way even though much might depend upon it; and saying so to the barber he begged him to change dresses, as it was fitter he should be the distressed damsel, while he himself would play the squire\u2019s part, which would be less derogatory to his dignity; otherwise he was resolved to have nothing more to do with the matter, and let the devil take Don Quixote. Just at this moment Sancho came up, and on seeing the pair in such a costume he was unable to restrain his laughter; the barber, however, agreed to do as the curate wished, and, altering their plan, the curate went on to instruct him how to play his part and what to say to Don Quixote to induce and compel him to come with them and give up his fancy for the place he had chosen for his idle penance. The barber told him he could manage it properly without any instruction, and as he did not care to dress himself up until they were near where Don Quixote was, he folded up the garments, and the curate adjusted his beard, and they set out under the guidance of Sancho Panza, who went along telling them of the encounter with the madman they met in the Sierra, saying nothing, however, about the finding of the valise and its contents; for with all his simplicity the lad was a trifle covetous.", " \u201cI don\u2019t choose to tell it here, now,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand have it reach the ears of the lords of the council to-morrow morning, and some other carry off the thanks and rewards of my trouble.\u201d \u201cFor my part,\u201d said the barber, \u201cI give my word here and before God that I will not repeat what your worship says, to King, Rook or earthly man\u2014an oath I learned from the ballad of the curate, who, in the prelude, told the king of the thief who had robbed him of the hundred gold crowns and his pacing mule.\u201d \u201cI am not versed in stories,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cbut I know the oath is a good one, because I know the barber to be an honest fellow.\u201d \u201cEven if he were not,\u201d said the curate, \u201cI will go bail and answer for him that in this matter he will be as silent as a dummy, under pain of paying any penalty that may be pronounced.\u201d \u201cAnd who will be security for you, se\u00f1or curate?\u201d said Don Quixote. \u201cMy profession,\u201d replied the curate, \u201cwhich is to keep secrets.\u201d \u201cOds body!\u201d said Don Quixote at this, \u201cwhat more has his Majesty to do but to command, by public proclamation, all the knights-errant that are scattered over Spain to assemble on a fixed day in the capital, for even if no more than half a dozen come, there may be one among them who alone will suffice to destroy the entire might of the Turk. Give me your attention and follow me. Is it, pray, any new thing for a single knight-errant to demolish an army of two hundred thousand men, as if they all had but one throat or were made of sugar paste?"], "What does Don Quixote promise Sancho on the condition he leave his wife and become Quixote\u2019s squire?": [" They all flocked to see what was in the cart, and when they recognised their townsman they were filled with amazement, and a boy ran off to bring the news to his housekeeper and his niece that their master and uncle had come back all lean and yellow and stretched on a truss of hay on an ox-cart. It was piteous to hear the cries the two good ladies raised, how they beat their breasts and poured out fresh maledictions on those accursed books of chivalry; all which was renewed when they saw Don Quixote coming in at the gate. At the news of Don Quixote\u2019s arrival Sancho Panza\u2019s wife came running, for she by this time knew that her husband had gone away with him as his squire, and on seeing Sancho, the first thing she asked him was if the ass was well. Sancho replied that he was, better than his master was. \u201cThanks be to God,\u201d said she, \u201cfor being so good to me; but now tell me, my friend, what have you made by your squirings? What gown have you brought me back? What shoes for your children?\u201d \u201cI bring nothing of that sort, wife,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cthough I bring other things of more consequence and value.\u201d \u201cI am very glad of that,\u201d returned his wife; \u201cshow me these things of more value and consequence, my friend; for I want to see them to cheer my heart that has been so sad and heavy all these ages that you have been away.\u201d \u201cI will show them to you at home, wife,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cbe content for the present; for if it please God that we should again go on our travels in search of adventures, you will soon see me a count, or governor of an island, and that not one of those everyday ones, but the best that is to be had.\u201d \u201cHeaven grant it, husband,\u201d said she, \u201cfor indeed we have need of it.", " \u201cWho should it be,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cbut Don Quixote of La Mancha himself, who will make good all he has said and all he will say; for pledges don\u2019t trouble a good payer.\u201d Sancho had hardly uttered these words when two gentlemen, for such they seemed to be, entered the room, and one of them, throwing his arms round Don Quixote\u2019s neck, said to him, \u201cYour appearance cannot leave any question as to your name, nor can your name fail to identify your appearance; unquestionably, se\u00f1or, you are the real Don Quixote of La Mancha, cynosure and morning star of knight-errantry, despite and in defiance of him who has sought to usurp your name and bring to naught your achievements, as the author of this book which I here present to you has done;\u201d and with this he put a book which his companion carried into the hands of Don Quixote, who took it, and without replying began to run his eye over it; but he presently returned it saying, \u201cIn the little I have seen I have discovered three things in this author that deserve to be censured. The first is some words that I have read in the preface; the next that the language is Aragonese, for sometimes he writes without articles; and the third, which above all stamps him as ignorant, is that he goes wrong and departs from the truth in the most important part of the history, for here he says that my squire Sancho Panza\u2019s wife is called Mari Gutierrez, when she is called nothing of the sort, but Teresa Panza; and when a man errs on such an important point as this there is good reason to fear that he is in error on every other point in the history.\u201d \u201cA nice sort of historian, indeed!\u201d exclaimed Sancho at this; \u201che must know a deal about our affairs when he calls my wife Teresa Panza, Mari Gutierrez; take the book again, se\u00f1or, and see if I am in it and if he has changed my name.\u201d \u201cFrom your talk, friend,\u201d said Don Jeronimo, \u201cno doubt you are Sancho Panza, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote\u2019s squire.\u201d \u201cYes, I am,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cand I\u2019m proud of it.\u201d \u201cFaith, then,\u201d said the gentleman, \u201cthis new author does not handle you with the decency that displays itself in your person; he makes you out a heavy feeder and a fool, and not in the least droll, and a very different being from the Sancho described in the First Part of your master\u2019s history.\u201d \u201cGod forgive him,\u201d said Sancho; \u201che might have left me in my corner without troubling his head about me; \u2018let him who knows how ring the bells; \u2018Saint Peter is very well in Rome.\u2019\u201d The two gentlemen pressed Don Quixote to come into their room and have supper with them, as they knew very well there was nothing in that inn fit for one of his sort.", " Aid me, friend Sancho, to mount the enchanted cart, for I am not in a condition to press the saddle of Rocinante, as this shoulder is all knocked to pieces.\u201d \u201cThat I will do with all my heart, se\u00f1or,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cand let us return to our village with these gentlemen, who seek your good, and there we will prepare for making another sally, which may turn out more profitable and creditable to us.\u201d \u201cThou art right, Sancho,\u201d returned Don Quixote; \u201cIt will be wise to let the malign influence of the stars which now prevails pass off.\u201d The canon, the curate, and the barber told him he would act very wisely in doing as he said; and so, highly amused at Sancho Panza\u2019s simplicities, they placed Don Quixote in the cart as before. The procession once more formed itself in order and proceeded on its road; the goatherd took his leave of the party; the officers of the Brotherhood declined to go any farther, and the curate paid them what was due to them; the canon begged the curate to let him know how Don Quixote did, whether he was cured of his madness or still suffered from it, and then begged leave to continue his journey; in short, they all separated and went their ways, leaving to themselves the curate and the barber, Don Quixote, Sancho Panza, and the good Rocinante, who regarded everything with as great resignation as his master. The carter yoked his oxen and made Don Quixote comfortable on a truss of hay, and at his usual deliberate pace took the road the curate directed, and at the end of six days they reached Don Quixote\u2019s village, and entered it about the middle of the day, which it so happened was a Sunday, and the people were all in the plaza, through which Don Quixote\u2019s cart passed.", " Don Quixote, among other things, told him he ought to be ready to go with him gladly, because any moment an adventure might occur that might win an island in the twinkling of an eye and leave him governor of it. On these and the like promises Sancho Panza (for so the labourer was called) left wife and children, and engaged himself as esquire to his neighbour. c07b.jpg (322K) Full Size Don Quixote next set about getting some money; and selling one thing and pawning another, and making a bad bargain in every case, he got together a fair sum. He provided himself with a buckler, which he begged as a loan from a friend, and, restoring his battered helmet as best he could, he warned his squire Sancho of the day and hour he meant to set out, that he might provide himself with what he thought most needful. Above all, he charged him to take alforjas with him. The other said he would, and that he meant to take also a very good ass he had, as he was not much given to going on foot. About the ass, Don Quixote hesitated a little, trying whether he could call to mind any knight-errant taking with him an esquire mounted on ass-back, but no instance occurred to his memory. For all that, however, he determined to take him, intending to furnish him with a more honourable mount when a chance of it presented itself, by appropriating the horse of the first discourteous knight he encountered. Himself he provided with shirts and such other things as he could, according to the advice the host had given him; all which being done, without taking leave, Sancho Panza of his wife and children, or Don Quixote of his housekeeper and niece, they sallied forth unseen by anybody from the village one night, and made such good way in the course of it that by daylight they held themselves safe from discovery, even should search be made for them."], "Which large objects does Don Quixote mistake for giants?": [" \u201cThose thou seest there,\u201d answered his master, \u201cwith the long arms, and some have them nearly two leagues long.\u201d \u201cLook, your worship,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cwhat we see there are not giants but windmills, and what seem to be their arms are the sails that turned by the wind make the millstone go.\u201d \u201cIt is easy to see,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cthat thou art not used to this business of adventures; those are giants; and if thou art afraid, away with thee out of this and betake thyself to prayer while I engage them in fierce and unequal combat.\u201d So saying, he gave the spur to his steed Rocinante, heedless of the cries his squire Sancho sent after him, warning him that most certainly they were windmills and not giants he was going to attack. He, however, was so positive they were giants that he neither heard the cries of Sancho, nor perceived, near as he was, what they were, but made at them shouting, \u201cFly not, cowards and vile beings, for a single knight attacks you.\u201d A slight breeze at this moment sprang up, and the great sails began to move, seeing which Don Quixote exclaimed, \u201cThough ye flourish more arms than the giant Briareus, ye have to reckon with me.\u201d So saying, and commending himself with all his heart to his lady Dulcinea, imploring her to support him in such a peril, with lance in rest and covered by his buckler, he charged at Rocinante\u2019s fullest gallop and fell upon the first mill that stood in front of him; but as he drove his lance-point into the sail the wind whirled it round with such force that it shivered the lance to pieces, sweeping with it horse and rider, who went rolling over on the plain, in a sorry condition.", " \u201cWhat, seen her!\u201d said Sancho; \u201cwhy, who the devil was it but myself that first thought of the enchantment business? She is as much enchanted as my father.\u201d The ecclesiastic, when he heard them talking of giants and caitiffs and enchantments, began to suspect that this must be Don Quixote of La Mancha, whose story the duke was always reading; and he had himself often reproved him for it, telling him it was foolish to read such fooleries; and becoming convinced that his suspicion was correct, addressing the duke, he said very angrily to him, \u201cSe\u00f1or, your excellence will have to give account to God for what this good man does. This Don Quixote, or Don Simpleton, or whatever his name is, cannot, I imagine, be such a blockhead as your excellence would have him, holding out encouragement to him to go on with his vagaries and follies.\u201d Then turning to address Don Quixote he said, \u201cAnd you, num-skull, who put it into your head that you are a knight-errant, and vanquish giants and capture miscreants? Go your ways in a good hour, and in a good hour be it said to you. Go home and bring up your children if you have any, and attend to your business, and give over going wandering about the world, gaping and making a laughing-stock of yourself to all who know you and all who don\u2019t. Where, in heaven\u2019s name, have you discovered that there are or ever were knights-errant? Where are there giants in Spain or miscreants in La Mancha, or enchanted Dulcineas, or all the rest of the silly things they tell about you?\u201d Don Quixote listened attentively to the reverend gentleman\u2019s words, and as soon as he perceived he had done speaking, regardless of the presence of the duke and duchess, he sprang to his feet with angry looks and an agitated countenance, and said\u2014But the reply deserves a chapter to itself.", " \u201cWith regard to giants,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201copinions differ as to whether there ever were any or not in the world; but the Holy Scripture, which cannot err by a jot from the truth, shows us that there were, when it gives us the history of that big Philistine, Goliath, who was seven cubits and a half in height, which is a huge size. Likewise, in the island of Sicily, there have been found leg-bones and arm-bones so large that their size makes it plain that their owners were giants, and as tall as great towers; geometry puts this fact beyond a doubt. But, for all that, I cannot speak with certainty as to the size of Morgante, though I suspect he cannot have been very tall; and I am inclined to be of this opinion because I find in the history in which his deeds are particularly mentioned, that he frequently slept under a roof and as he found houses to contain him, it is clear that his bulk could not have been anything excessive.\u201d \u201cThat is true,\u201d said the curate, and yielding to the enjoyment of hearing such nonsense, he asked him what was his notion of the features of Reinaldos of Montalban, and Don Roland and the rest of the Twelve Peers of France, for they were all knights-errant. \u201cAs for Reinaldos,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cI venture to say that he was broad-faced, of ruddy complexion, with roguish and somewhat prominent eyes, excessively punctilious and touchy, and given to the society of thieves and scapegraces.", " A curse I say once more, and a hundred times more, on those books of chivalry that have brought your worship to such a pass.\u201d They carried him to bed at once, and after searching for his wounds could find none, but he said they were all bruises from having had a severe fall with his horse Rocinante when in combat with ten giants, the biggest and the boldest to be found on earth. \u201cSo, so!\u201d said the curate, \u201care there giants in the dance? By the sign of the Cross I will burn them to-morrow before the day is over.\u201d They put a host of questions to Don Quixote, but his only answer to all was\u2014give him something to eat, and leave him to sleep, for that was what he needed most. They did so, and the curate questioned the peasant at great length as to how he had found Don Quixote. He told him, and the nonsense he had talked when found and on the way home, all which made the licentiate the more eager to do what he did the next day, which was to summon his friend the barber, Master Nicholas, and go with him to Don Quixote\u2019s house. p031.jpg (31K) CHAPTER VI. OF THE DIVERTING AND IMPORTANT SCRUTINY WHICH THE CURATE AND THE BARBER MADE IN THE LIBRARY OF OUR INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN c06a.jpg (92K) Full Size He was still sleeping; so the curate asked the niece for the keys of the room where the books, the authors of all the mischief, were, and right willingly she gave them. They all went in, the housekeeper with them, and found more than a hundred volumes of big books very well bound, and some other small ones."], "From whom does Cervantes claim to have bought the manuscript of Don Quixote?": [" Gustave Dor\u00e9 makes it an elaborate fountain such as no arriero ever watered his mules at in the corral of any venta in Spain, and thereby entirely misses the point aimed at by Cervantes. It is the mean, prosaic, commonplace character of all the surroundings and circumstances that gives a significance to Don Quixote\u2019s vigil and the ceremony that follows. Cervantes\u2019 humour is for the most part of that broader and simpler sort, the strength of which lies in the perception of the incongruous. It is the incongruity of Sancho in all his ways, words, and works, with the ideas and aims of his master, quite as much as the wonderful vitality and truth to nature of the character, that makes him the most humorous creation in the whole range of fiction. That unsmiling gravity of which Cervantes was the first great master, \u201cCervantes\u2019 serious air,\u201d which sits naturally on Swift alone, perhaps, of later humourists, is essential to this kind of humour, and here again Cervantes has suffered at the hands of his interpreters. Nothing, unless indeed the coarse buffoonery of Phillips, could be more out of place in an attempt to represent Cervantes, than a flippant, would-be facetious style, like that of Motteux\u2019s version for example, or the sprightly, jaunty air, French translators sometimes adopt. It is the grave matter-of-factness of the narrative, and the apparent unconsciousness of the author that he is saying anything ludicrous, anything but the merest commonplace, that give its peculiar flavour to the humour of Cervantes.", " To checkmate him Cervantes drew up a series of twenty-five questions, covering the whole period of his captivity, upon which he requested Father Gil to take the depositions of credible witnesses before a notary. Eleven witnesses taken from among the principal captives in Algiers deposed to all the facts above stated and to a great deal more besides. There is something touching in the admiration, love, and gratitude we see struggling to find expression in the formal language of the notary, as they testify one after another to the good deeds of Cervantes, how he comforted and helped the weak-hearted, how he kept up their drooping courage, how he shared his poor purse with this deponent, and how \u201cin him this deponent found father and mother.\u201d On his return to Spain he found his old regiment about to march for Portugal to support Philip\u2019s claim to the crown, and utterly penniless now, had no choice but to rejoin it. He was in the expeditions to the Azores in 1582 and the following year, and on the conclusion of the war returned to Spain in the autumn of 1583, bringing with him the manuscript of his pastoral romance, the \u201cGalatea,\u201d and probably also, to judge by internal evidence, that of the first portion of \u201cPersiles and Sigismunda.\u201d He also brought back with him, his biographers assert, an infant daughter, the offspring of an amour, as some of them with great circumstantiality inform us, with a Lisbon lady of noble birth, whose name, however, as well as that of the street she lived in, they omit to mention.", " He taunts Cervantes with being old, with having lost his hand, with having been in prison, with being poor, with being friendless, accuses him of envy of Lope\u2019s success, of petulance and querulousness, and so on; and it was in this that the sting lay. Avellaneda\u2019s reason for this personal attack is obvious enough. Whoever he may have been, it is clear that he was one of the dramatists of Lope\u2019s school, for he has the impudence to charge Cervantes with attacking him as well as Lope in his criticism on the drama. His identification has exercised the best critics and baffled all the ingenuity and research that has been brought to bear on it. Navarrete and Ticknor both incline to the belief that Cervantes knew who he was; but I must say I think the anger he shows suggests an invisible assailant; it is like the irritation of a man stung by a mosquito in the dark. Cervantes from certain solecisms of language pronounces him to be an Aragonese, and Pellicer, an Aragonese himself, supports this view and believes him, moreover, to have been an ecclesiastic, a Dominican probably. Any merit Avellaneda has is reflected from Cervantes, and he is too dull to reflect much. \u201cDull and dirty\u201d will always be, I imagine, the verdict of the vast majority of unprejudiced readers. He is, at best, a poor plagiarist; all he can do is to follow slavishly the lead given him by Cervantes; his only humour lies in making Don Quixote take inns for castles and fancy himself some legendary or historical personage, and Sancho mistake words, invert proverbs, and display his gluttony; all through he shows a proclivity to coarseness and dirt, and he has contrived to introduce two tales filthier than anything by the sixteenth century novellieri and without their sprightliness.", " The scramble for copies which, as we have seen, followed immediately on the appearance of the book, does not look like general insensibility to its merits. No doubt it was received coldly by some, but if a man writes a book in ridicule of periwigs he must make his account with being coldly received by the periwig wearers and hated by the whole tribe of wigmakers. If Cervantes had the chivalry-romance readers, the sentimentalists, the dramatists, and the poets of the period all against him, it was because \u201cDon Quixote\u201d was what it was; and if the general public did not come forward to make him comfortable for the rest of his days, it is no more to be charged with neglect and ingratitude than the English-speaking public that did not pay off Scott\u2019s liabilities. It did the best it could; it read his book and liked it and bought it, and encouraged the bookseller to pay him well for others. It has been also made a reproach to Spain that she has erected no monument to the man she is proudest of; no monument, that is to say, of him; for the bronze statue in the little garden of the Plaza de las Cort\u00e9s, a fair work of art no doubt, and unexceptionable had it been set up to the local poet in the market-place of some provincial town, is not worthy of Cervantes or of Madrid. But what need has Cervantes of \u201csuch weak witness of his name;\u201d or what could a monument do in his case except testify to the self-glorification of those who had put it up?"], "What reason does Don Quixote give to the goatherds for the existence of knights?": [" In defence of these, as time advanced and wickedness increased, the order of knights-errant was instituted, to defend maidens, to protect widows and to succour the orphans and the needy.

WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE WITH CERTAIN GOATHERDS c11a.jpg (173K) Full Size He was cordially welcomed by the goatherds, and Sancho, having as best he could put up Rocinante and the ass, drew towards the fragrance that came from some pieces of salted goat simmering in a pot on the fire; and though he would have liked at once to try if they were ready to be transferred from the pot to the stomach, he refrained from doing so as the goatherds removed them from the fire, and laying sheepskins on the ground, quickly spread their rude table, and with signs of hearty good-will invited them both to share what they had. Round the skins six of the men belonging to the fold seated themselves, having first with rough politeness pressed Don Quixote to take a seat upon a trough which they placed for him upside down. Don Quixote seated himself, and Sancho remained standing to serve the cup, which was made of horn. Seeing him standing, his master said to him: \u201cThat thou mayest see, Sancho, the good that knight-errantry contains in itself, and how those who fill any office in it are on the high road to be speedily honoured and esteemed by the world, I desire that thou seat thyself here at my side and in the company of these worthy people, and that thou be one with me who am thy master and natural lord, and that thou eat from my plate and drink from whatever I drink from; for the same may be said of knight-errantry as of love, that it levels all.\u201d \u201cGreat thanks,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cbut I may tell your worship that provided I have enough to eat, I can eat it as well, or better, standing, and by myself, than seated alongside of an emperor.", " \u201cWhence it arises,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat when we see any person well dressed and making a figure with rich garments and retinue of servants, it seems to lead and impel us perforce to respect him, though memory may at the same moment recall to us some lowly condition in which we have seen him, but which, whether it may have been poverty or low birth, being now a thing of the past, has no existence; while the only thing that has any existence is what we see before us; and if this person whom fortune has raised from his original lowly state (these were the very words the padre used) to his present height of prosperity, be well bred, generous, courteous to all, without seeking to vie with those whose nobility is of ancient date, depend upon it, Teresa, no one will remember what he was, and everyone will respect what he is, except indeed the envious, from whom no fair fortune is safe.\u201d \u201cI do not understand you, husband,\u201d replied Teresa; \u201cdo as you like, and don\u2019t break my head with any more speechifying and rethoric; and if you have revolved to do what you say\u2014\u201d \u201cResolved, you should say, woman,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cnot revolved.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t set yourself to wrangle with me, husband,\u201d said Teresa; \u201cI speak as God pleases, and don\u2019t deal in out-of-the-way phrases; and I say if you are bent upon having a government, take your son Sancho with you, and teach him from this time on how to hold a government; for sons ought to inherit and learn the trades of their fathers.\u201d \u201cAs soon as I have the government,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cI will send for him by post, and I will send thee money, of which I shall have no lack, for there is never any want of people to lend it to governors when they have not got it; and do thou dress him so as to hide what he is and make him look what he is to be.\u201d \u201cYou send the money,\u201d said Teresa, \u201cand I\u2019ll dress him up for you as fine as you please.\u201d \u201cThen we are agreed that our daughter is to be a countess,\u201d said Sancho.", " For so far, if I remember rightly, I have not mentioned it in the whole story of my misfortunes.\u201d \u201cI am that unhappy being, se\u00f1ora,\u201d replied Cardenio, \u201cwhom, as you have said, Luscinda declared to be her husband; I am the unfortunate Cardenio, whom the wrong-doing of him who has brought you to your present condition has reduced to the state you see me in, bare, ragged, bereft of all human comfort, and what is worse, of reason, for I only possess it when Heaven is pleased for some short space to restore it to me. I, Dorothea, am he who witnessed the wrong done by Don Fernando, and waited to hear the \u2018Yes\u2019 uttered by which Luscinda owned herself his betrothed: I am he who had not courage enough to see how her fainting fit ended, or what came of the paper that was found in her bosom, because my heart had not the fortitude to endure so many strokes of ill-fortune at once; and so losing patience I quitted the house, and leaving a letter with my host, which I entreated him to place in Luscinda\u2019s hands, I betook myself to these solitudes, resolved to end here the life I hated as if it were my mortal enemy. But fate would not rid me of it, contenting itself with robbing me of my reason, perhaps to preserve me for the good fortune I have had in meeting you; for if that which you have just told us be true, as I believe it to be, it may be that Heaven has yet in store for both of us a happier termination to our misfortunes than we look for; because seeing that Luscinda cannot marry Don Fernando, being mine, as she has herself so openly declared, and that Don Fernando cannot marry her as he is yours, we may reasonably hope that Heaven will restore to us what is ours, as it is still in existence and not yet alienated or destroyed."], "Who dies from a broken heart after the beautiful shepherdess Marcela refuses his love?": [" Let the three-headed guardian of the gate, And all the monstrous progeny of hell, The doleful concert join: a lover dead Methinks can have no fitter obsequies.

Seeing his good intention, the travellers were unwilling to press him further, and once more bidding him farewell, they left him and pursued their journey, in the course of which they did not fail to discuss the story of Marcela and Chrysostom as well as the madness of Don Quixote. He, on his part, resolved to go in quest of the shepherdess Marcela, and make offer to her of all the service he could render her; but things did not fall out with him as he expected, according to what is related in the course of this veracious history, of which the Second Part ends here. c14e.jpg (31K) CHAPTER XV. IN WHICH IS RELATED THE UNFORTUNATE ADVENTURE THAT DON QUIXOTE FELL IN WITH WHEN HE FELL OUT WITH CERTAIN HEARTLESS YANGUESANS c15a.jpg (81K) Full Size The sage Cid Hamete Benengeli relates that as soon as Don Quixote took leave of his hosts and all who had been present at the burial of Chrysostom, he and his squire passed into the same wood which they had seen the shepherdess Marcela enter, and after having wandered for more than two hours in all directions in search of her without finding her, they came to a halt in a glade covered with tender grass, beside which ran a pleasant cool stream that invited and compelled them to pass there the hours of the noontide heat, which by this time was beginning to come on oppressively.", " By that natural understanding which God has given me I know that everything beautiful attracts love, but I cannot see how, by reason of being loved, that which is loved for its beauty is bound to love that which loves it; besides, it may happen that the lover of that which is beautiful may be ugly, and ugliness being detestable, it is very absurd to say, \u201cI love thee because thou art beautiful, thou must love me though I be ugly.\u201d But supposing the beauty equal on both sides, it does not follow that the inclinations must be therefore alike, for it is not every beauty that excites love, some but pleasing the eye without winning the affection; and if every sort of beauty excited love and won the heart, the will would wander vaguely to and fro unable to make choice of any; for as there is an infinity of beautiful objects there must be an infinity of inclinations, and true love, I have heard it said, is indivisible, and must be voluntary and not compelled. If this be so, as I believe it to be, why do you desire me to bend my will by force, for no other reason but that you say you love me? Nay\u2014tell me\u2014had Heaven made me ugly, as it has made me beautiful, could I with justice complain of you for not loving me? Moreover, you must remember that the beauty I possess was no choice of mine, for, be it what it may, Heaven of its bounty gave it me without my asking or choosing it; and as the viper, though it kills with it, does not deserve to be blamed for the poison it carries, as it is a gift of nature, neither do I deserve reproach for being beautiful; for beauty in a modest woman is like fire at a distance or a sharp sword; the one does not burn, the other does not cut, those who do not come too near.", " For although she does not avoid or shun the society and conversation of the shepherds, and treats them courteously and kindly, should any one of them come to declare his intention to her, though it be one as proper and holy as that of matrimony, she flings him from her like a catapult. And with this kind of disposition she does more harm in this country than if the plague had got into it, for her affability and her beauty draw on the hearts of those that associate with her to love her and to court her, but her scorn and her frankness bring them to the brink of despair; and so they know not what to say save to proclaim her aloud cruel and hard-hearted, and other names of the same sort which well describe the nature of her character; and if you should remain here any time, se\u00f1or, you would hear these hills and valleys resounding with the laments of the rejected ones who pursue her. Not far from this there is a spot where there are a couple of dozen of tall beeches, and there is not one of them but has carved and written on its smooth bark the name of Marcela, and above some a crown carved on the same tree as though her lover would say more plainly that Marcela wore and deserved that of all human beauty. Here one shepherd is sighing, there another is lamenting; there love songs are heard, here despairing elegies. One will pass all the hours of the night seated at the foot of some oak or rock, and there, without having closed his weeping eyes, the sun finds him in the morning bemused and bereft of sense; and another without relief or respite to his sighs, stretched on the burning sand in the full heat of the sultry summer noontide, makes his appeal to the compassionate heavens, and over one and the other, over these and all, the beautiful Marcela triumphs free and careless."], "At the funeral of Chrysostom, which of the deceased\u2019s requests does the traveler Vivaldo propose ignoring?": [" c12e.jpg (42K) CHAPTER XIII. IN WHICH IS ENDED THE STORY OF THE SHEPHERDESS MARCELA, WITH OTHER INCIDENTS c13a.jpg (181K) Full Size But hardly had day begun to show itself through the balconies of the east, when five of the six goatherds came to rouse Don Quixote and tell him that if he was still of a mind to go and see the famous burial of Chrysostom they would bear him company. Don Quixote, who desired nothing better, rose and ordered Sancho to saddle and pannel at once, which he did with all despatch, and with the same they all set out forthwith. They had not gone a quarter of a league when at the meeting of two paths they saw coming towards them some six shepherds dressed in black sheepskins and with their heads crowned with garlands of cypress and bitter oleander. Each of them carried a stout holly staff in his hand, and along with them there came two men of quality on horseback in handsome travelling dress, with three servants on foot accompanying them. Courteous salutations were exchanged on meeting, and inquiring one of the other which way each party was going, they learned that all were bound for the scene of the burial, so they went on all together. One of those on horseback addressing his companion said to him, \u201cIt seems to me, Se\u00f1or Vivaldo, that we may reckon as well spent the delay we shall incur in seeing this remarkable funeral, for remarkable it cannot but be judging by the strange things these shepherds have told us, of both the dead shepherd and homicide shepherdess.\u201d \u201cSo I think too,\u201d replied Vivaldo, \u201cand I would delay not to say a day, but four, for the sake of seeing it.\u201d Don Quixote asked them what it was they had heard of Marcela and Chrysostom.", " I forgot to say that Chrysostom, who is dead, was a great man for writing verses, so much so that he made carols for Christmas Eve, and plays for Corpus Christi, which the young men of our village acted, and all said they were excellent. When the villagers saw the two scholars so unexpectedly appearing in shepherd\u2019s dress, they were lost in wonder, and could not guess what had led them to make so extraordinary a change. About this time the father of our Chrysostom died, and he was left heir to a large amount of property in chattels as well as in land, no small number of cattle and sheep, and a large sum of money, of all of which the young man was left dissolute owner, and indeed he was deserving of it all, for he was a very good comrade, and kind-hearted, and a friend of worthy folk, and had a countenance like a benediction. Presently it came to be known that he had changed his dress with no other object than to wander about these wastes after that shepherdess Marcela our lad mentioned a while ago, with whom the deceased Chrysostom had fallen in love. And I must tell you now, for it is well you should know it, who this girl is; perhaps, and even without any perhaps, you will not have heard anything like it all the days of your life, though you should live more years than sarna.\u201d \u201cSay Sarra,\u201d said Don Quixote, unable to endure the goatherd\u2019s confusion of words. \u201cThe sarna lives long enough,\u201d answered Pedro; \u201cand if, se\u00f1or, you must go finding fault with words at every step, we shall not make an end of it this twelvemonth.\u201d \u201cPardon me, friend,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cbut, as there is such a difference between sarna and Sarra, I told you of it; however, you have answered very rightly, for sarna lives longer than Sarra: so continue your story, and I will not object any more to anything.\u201d \u201cI say then, my dear sir,\u201d said the goatherd, \u201cthat in our village there was a farmer even richer than the father of Chrysostom, who was named Guillermo, and upon whom God bestowed, over and above great wealth, a daughter at whose birth her mother died, the most respected woman there was in this neighbourhood; I fancy I can see her now with that countenance which had the sun on one side and the moon on the other; and moreover active, and kind to the poor, for which I trust that at the present moment her soul is in bliss with God in the other world.", " So that, Se\u00f1or Ambrosia while you consign your friend\u2019s body to the earth, you should not consign his writings to oblivion, for if he gave the order in bitterness of heart, it is not right that you should irrationally obey it. On the contrary, by granting life to those papers, let the cruelty of Marcela live for ever, to serve as a warning in ages to come to all men to shun and avoid falling into like danger; or I and all of us who have come here know already the story of this your love-stricken and heart-broken friend, and we know, too, your friendship, and the cause of his death, and the directions he gave at the close of his life; from which sad story may be gathered how great was the cruelty of Marcela, the love of Chrysostom, and the loyalty of your friendship, together with the end awaiting those who pursue rashly the path that insane passion opens to their eyes. Last night we learned the death of Chrysostom and that he was to be buried here, and out of curiosity and pity we left our direct road and resolved to come and see with our eyes that which when heard of had so moved our compassion, and in consideration of that compassion and our desire to prove it if we might by condolence, we beg of you, excellent Ambrosia, or at least I on my own account entreat you, that instead of burning those papers you allow me to carry away some of them.\u201d And without waiting for the shepherd\u2019s answer, he stretched out his hand and took up some of those that were nearest to him; seeing which Ambrosio said, \u201cOut of courtesy, se\u00f1or, I will grant your request as to those you have taken, but it is idle to expect me to abstain from burning the remainder.\u201d Vivaldo, who was eager to see what the papers contained, opened one of them at once, and saw that its title was \u201cLay of Despair.\u201d Ambrosio hearing it said, \u201cThat is the last paper the unhappy man wrote; and that you may see, se\u00f1or, to what an end his misfortunes brought him, read it so that you may be heard, for you will have time enough for that while we are waiting for the grave to be dug.\u201d \u201cI will do so very willingly,\u201d said Vivaldo; and as all the bystanders were equally eager they gathered round him, and he, reading in a loud voice, found that it ran as follows.", " Let the three-headed guardian of the gate, And all the monstrous progeny of hell, The doleful concert join: a lover dead Methinks can have no fitter obsequies.

I call her peerless because she has no peer, whether it be in bodily stature or in the supremacy of rank and beauty. This same Casildea, then, that I speak of, requited my honourable passion and gentle aspirations by compelling me, as his stepmother did Hercules, to engage in many perils of various sorts, at the end of each promising me that, with the end of the next, the object of my hopes should be attained; but my labours have gone on increasing link by link until they are past counting, nor do I know what will be the last one that is to be the beginning of the accomplishment of my chaste desires. On one occasion she bade me go and challenge the famous giantess of Seville, La Giralda by name, who is as mighty and strong as if made of brass, and though never stirring from one spot, is the most restless and changeable woman in the world. I came, I saw, I conquered, and I made her stay quiet and behave herself, for nothing but north winds blew for more than a week.

Round the skins six of the men belonging to the fold seated themselves, having first with rough politeness pressed Don Quixote to take a seat upon a trough which they placed for him upside down.

Don Quixote was longer in talking than the supper in finishing, at the end of which one of the goatherds said, \u201cThat your worship, se\u00f1or knight-errant, may say with more truth that we show you hospitality with ready good-will, we will give you amusement and pleasure by making one of our comrades sing: he will be here before long, and he is a very intelligent youth and deep in love, and what is more he can read and write and play on the rebeck to perfection.\u201d The goatherd had hardly done speaking, when the notes of the rebeck reached their ears; and shortly after, the player came up, a very good-looking young man of about two-and-twenty.", " Here the goatherd brought his song to an end, and though Don Quixote entreated him to sing more, Sancho had no mind that way, being more inclined for sleep than for listening to songs; so said he to his master, \u201cYour worship will do well to settle at once where you mean to pass the night, for the labour these good men are at all day does not allow them to spend the night in singing.\u201d \u201cI understand thee, Sancho,\u201d replied Don Quixote; \u201cI perceive clearly that those visits to the wine-skin demand compensation in sleep rather than in music.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s sweet to us all, blessed be God,\u201d said Sancho. \u201cI do not deny it,\u201d replied Don Quixote; \u201cbut settle thyself where thou wilt; those of my calling are more becomingly employed in watching than in sleeping; still it would be as well if thou wert to dress this ear for me again, for it is giving me more pain than it need.\u201d Sancho did as he bade him, but one of the goatherds, seeing the wound, told him not to be uneasy, as he would apply a remedy with which it would be soon healed; and gathering some leaves of rosemary, of which there was a great quantity there, he chewed them and mixed them with a little salt, and applying them to the ear he secured them firmly with a bandage, assuring him that no other treatment would be required, and so it proved. c11e.jpg (37K) CHAPTER XII. OF WHAT A GOATHERD RELATED TO THOSE WITH DON QUIXOTE c12a.jpg (143K) Full Size Just then another young man, one of those who fetched their provisions from the village, came up and said, \u201cDo you know what is going on in the village, comrades?\u201d \u201cHow could we know it?\u201d replied one of them.", " He at once concluded that some damsel of the duchess\u2019s was in love with him, and that her modesty forced her to keep her passion secret. He trembled lest he should fall, and made an inward resolution not to yield; and commending himself with all his might and soul to his lady Dulcinea he made up his mind to listen to the music; and to let them know he was there he gave a pretended sneeze, at which the damsels were not a little delighted, for all they wanted was that Don Quixote should hear them. So having tuned the harp, Altisidora, running her hand across the strings, began this ballad: O thou that art above in bed, Between the holland sheets, A-lying there from night till morn, With outstretched legs asleep; O thou, most valiant knight of all The famed Manchegan breed, Of purity and virtue more Than gold of Araby; Give ear unto a suffering maid, Well-grown but evil-starr\u2019d, For those two suns of thine have lit A fire within her heart. Adventures seeking thou dost rove, To others bringing woe; Thou scatterest wounds, but, ah, the balm To heal them dost withhold! Say, valiant youth, and so may God Thy enterprises speed, Didst thou the light mid Libya\u2019s sands Or Jaca\u2019s rocks first see? Did scaly serpents give thee suck? Who nursed thee when a babe? Wert cradled in the forest rude, Or gloomy mountain cave? O Dulcinea may be proud, That plump and lusty maid; For she alone hath had the power A tiger fierce to tame."], "How does the Duchess already know about Don Quixote, even before she and the Duke encounter him in the woods?": [" They placed him in the midst of them, and with much pomp and stateliness they conducted him into another room, where there was a sumptuous table laid with but four covers. The duchess and the duke came out to the door of the room to receive him, and with them a grave ecclesiastic, one of those who rule noblemen\u2019s houses; one of those who, not being born magnates themselves, never know how to teach those who are how to behave as such; one of those who would have the greatness of great folk measured by their own narrowness of mind; one of those who, when they try to introduce economy into the household they rule, lead it into meanness. One of this sort, I say, must have been the grave churchman who came out with the duke and duchess to receive Don Quixote. A vast number of polite speeches were exchanged, and at length, taking Don Quixote between them, they proceeded to sit down to table. The duke pressed Don Quixote to take the head of the table, and, though he refused, the entreaties of the duke were so urgent that he had to accept it. The ecclesiastic took his seat opposite to him, and the duke and duchess those at the sides. All this time Sancho stood by, gaping with amazement at the honour he saw shown to his master by these illustrious persons; and observing all the ceremonious pressing that had passed between the duke and Don Quixote to induce him to take his seat at the head of the table, he said, \u201cIf your worship will give me leave I will tell you a story of what happened in my village about this matter of seats.\u201d The moment Sancho said this Don Quixote trembled, making sure that he was about to say something foolish.", " The history informs us, then, that before they reached the country house or castle, the duke went on in advance and instructed all his servants how they were to treat Don Quixote; and so the instant he came up to the castle gates with the duchess, two lackeys or equerries, clad in what they call morning gowns of fine crimson satin reaching to their feet, hastened out, and catching Don Quixote in their arms before he saw or heard them, said to him, \u201cYour highness should go and take my lady the duchess off her horse.\u201d p31b.jpg (334K) Full Size Don Quixote obeyed, and great bandying of compliments followed between the two over the matter; but in the end the duchess\u2019s determination carried the day, and she refused to get down or dismount from her palfrey except in the arms of the duke, saying she did not consider herself worthy to impose so unnecessary a burden on so great a knight. At length the duke came out to take her down, and as they entered a spacious court two fair damsels came forward and threw over Don Quixote\u2019s shoulders a large mantle of the finest scarlet cloth, and at the same instant all the galleries of the court were lined with the men-servants and women-servants of the household, crying, \u201cWelcome, flower and cream of knight-errantry!\u201d while all or most of them flung pellets filled with scented water over Don Quixote and the duke and duchess; at all which Don Quixote was greatly astonished, and this was the first time that he thoroughly felt and believed himself to be a knight-errant in reality and not merely in fancy, now that he saw himself treated in the same way as he had read of such knights being treated in days of yore.", " \u201cSo much the better,\u201d said the duke, \u201cfor many droll things cannot be said in few words; but not to lose time in talking, come, great Knight of the Rueful Countenance\u2014\u201d \u201cOf the Lions, your highness must say,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cfor there is no Rueful Countenance nor any such character now.\u201d \u201cHe of the Lions be it,\u201d continued the duke; \u201cI say, let Sir Knight of the Lions come to a castle of mine close by, where he shall be given that reception which is due to so exalted a personage, and which the duchess and I are wont to give to all knights-errant who come there.\u201d By this time Sancho had fixed and girthed Rocinante\u2019s saddle, and Don Quixote having got on his back and the duke mounted a fine horse, they placed the duchess in the middle and set out for the castle. The duchess desired Sancho to come to her side, for she found infinite enjoyment in listening to his shrewd remarks. Sancho required no pressing, but pushed himself in between them and the duke, who thought it rare good fortune to receive such a knight-errant and such a homely squire in their castle. p30e.jpg (54K) CHAPTER XXXI.br/> WHICH TREATS OF MANY AND GREAT MATTERS p31a.jpg (155K) Full Size Supreme was the satisfaction that Sancho felt at seeing himself, as it seemed, an established favourite with the duchess, for he looked forward to finding in her castle what he had found in Don Diego\u2019s house and in Basilio\u2019s; he was always fond of good living, and always seized by the forelock any opportunity of feasting himself whenever it presented itself.", " He came to the duke\u2019s castle, and the duke informed him of the road and route Don Quixote had taken with the intention of being present at the jousts at Saragossa. He told him, too, of the jokes he had practised upon him, and of the device for the disenchantment of Dulcinea at the expense of Sancho\u2019s backside; and finally he gave him an account of the trick Sancho had played upon his master, making him believe that Dulcinea was enchanted and turned into a country wench; and of how the duchess, his wife, had persuaded Sancho that it was he himself who was deceived, inasmuch as Dulcinea was really enchanted; at which the bachelor laughed not a little, and marvelled as well at the sharpness and simplicity of Sancho as at the length to which Don Quixote\u2019s madness went. The duke begged of him if he found him (whether he overcame him or not) to return that way and let him know the result. This the bachelor did; he set out in quest of Don Quixote, and not finding him at Saragossa, he went on, and how he fared has been already told. He returned to the duke\u2019s castle and told him all, what the conditions of the combat were, and how Don Quixote was now, like a loyal knight-errant, returning to keep his promise of retiring to his village for a year, by which time, said the bachelor, he might perhaps be cured of his madness; for that was the object that had led him to adopt these disguises, as it was a sad thing for a gentleman of such good parts as Don Quixote to be a madman."], "How does the Duke and Duchess\u2019 behaviour during the reception make Don Quixote feel?": [" \u201cSo much the better,\u201d said the duke, \u201cfor many droll things cannot be said in few words; but not to lose time in talking, come, great Knight of the Rueful Countenance\u2014\u201d \u201cOf the Lions, your highness must say,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cfor there is no Rueful Countenance nor any such character now.\u201d \u201cHe of the Lions be it,\u201d continued the duke; \u201cI say, let Sir Knight of the Lions come to a castle of mine close by, where he shall be given that reception which is due to so exalted a personage, and which the duchess and I are wont to give to all knights-errant who come there.\u201d By this time Sancho had fixed and girthed Rocinante\u2019s saddle, and Don Quixote having got on his back and the duke mounted a fine horse, they placed the duchess in the middle and set out for the castle.

Thy husband, the governor, SANCHO PANZA When she had done reading the letter the duchess said to Sancho, \u201cOn two points the worthy governor goes rather astray; one is in saying or hinting that this government has been bestowed upon him for the lashes that he is to give himself, when he knows (and he cannot deny it) that when my lord the duke promised it to him nobody ever dreamt of such a thing as lashes; the other is that he shows himself here to be very covetous; and I would not have him a money-seeker, for \u2018covetousness bursts the bag,\u2019 and the covetous governor does ungoverned justice.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t mean it that way, se\u00f1ora,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cand if you think the letter doesn\u2019t run as it ought to do, it\u2019s only to tear it up and make another; and maybe it will be a worse one if it is left to my gumption.\u201d \u201cNo, no,\u201d said the duchess, \u201cthis one will do, and I wish the duke to see it.\u201d With this they betook themselves to a garden where they were to dine, and the duchess showed Sancho\u2019s letter to the duke, who was highly delighted with it."], "Why does the Duchess take a particular liking to Sancho?": [" Fair be the fortunes of such a master and such a servant, the one the cynosure of knight-errantry, the other the star of squirely fidelity! Rise, Sancho, my friend; I will repay your courtesy by taking care that my lord the duke makes good to you the promised gift of the government as soon as possible.\u201d With this, the conversation came to an end, and Don Quixote retired to take his midday sleep; but the duchess begged Sancho, unless he had a very great desire to go to sleep, to come and spend the afternoon with her and her damsels in a very cool chamber. Sancho replied that, though he certainly had the habit of sleeping four or five hours in the heat of the day in summer, to serve her excellence he would try with all his might not to sleep even one that day, and that he would come in obedience to her command, and with that he went off. The duke gave fresh orders with respect to treating Don Quixote as a knight-errant, without departing even in smallest particular from the style in which, as the stories tell us, they used to treat the knights of old. p32e.jpg (16K) CHAPTER XXXIII. OF THE DELECTABLE DISCOURSE WHICH THE DUCHESS AND HER DAMSELS HELD WITH SANCHO PANZA, WELL WORTH READING AND NOTING p33a.jpg (138K) Full Size The history records that Sancho did not sleep that afternoon, but in order to keep his word came, before he had well done dinner, to visit the duchess, who, finding enjoyment in listening to him, made him sit down beside her on a low seat, though Sancho, out of pure good breeding, wanted not to sit down; the duchess, however, told him he was to sit down as governor and talk as squire, as in both respects he was worthy of even the chair of the Cid Ruy Diaz the Campeador.", " \u201cWhat is Dapple?\u201d said the duchess. \u201cMy ass,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cwhich, not to mention him by that name, I\u2019m accustomed to call Dapple; I begged this lady duenna here to take care of him when I came into the castle, and she got as angry as if I had said she was ugly or old, though it ought to be more natural and proper for duennas to feed asses than to ornament chambers. God bless me! what a spite a gentleman of my village had against these ladies!\u201d \u201cHe must have been some clown,\u201d said Do\u00f1a Rodriguez the duenna; \u201cfor if he had been a gentleman and well-born he would have exalted them higher than the horns of the moon.\u201d \u201cThat will do,\u201d said the duchess; \u201cno more of this; hush, Do\u00f1a Rodriguez, and let Se\u00f1or Panza rest easy and leave the treatment of Dapple in my charge, for as he is a treasure of Sancho\u2019s, I\u2019ll put him on the apple of my eye.\u201d \u201cIt will be enough for him to be in the stable,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cfor neither he nor I are worthy to rest a moment in the apple of your highness\u2019s eye, and I\u2019d as soon stab myself as consent to it; for though my master says that in civilities it is better to lose by a card too many than a card too few, when it comes to civilities to asses we must mind what we are about and keep within due bounds.\u201d \u201cTake him to your government, Sancho,\u201d said the duchess, \u201cand there you will be able to make as much of him as you like, and even release him from work and pension him off.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t think, se\u00f1ora duchess, that you have said anything absurd,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cI have seen more than two asses go to governments, and for me to take mine with me would be nothing new.\u201d Sancho\u2019s words made the duchess laugh again and gave her fresh amusement, and dismissing him to sleep she went away to tell the duke the conversation she had had with him, and between them they plotted and arranged to play a joke upon Don Quixote that was to be a rare one and entirely in knight-errantry style, and in that same style they practised several upon him, so much in keeping and so clever that they form the best adventures this great history contains.", " It appeared afterwards that the duke had sworn that if they had not washed him as they had Don Quixote he would have punished them for their impudence, which they adroitly atoned for by soaping him as well. Sancho observed the ceremony of the washing very attentively, and said to himself, \u201cGod bless me, if it were only the custom in this country to wash squires\u2019 beards too as well as knights\u2019. For by God and upon my soul I want it badly; and if they gave me a scrape of the razor besides I\u2019d take it as a still greater kindness.\u201d \u201cWhat are you saying to yourself, Sancho?\u201d asked the duchess. \u201cI was saying, se\u00f1ora,\u201d he replied, \u201cthat in the courts of other princes, when the cloth is taken away, I have always heard say they give water for the hands, but not lye for the beard; and that shows it is good to live long that you may see much; to be sure, they say too that he who lives a long life must undergo much evil, though to undergo a washing of that sort is pleasure rather than pain.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be uneasy, friend Sancho,\u201d said the duchess; \u201cI will take care that my damsels wash you, and even put you in the tub if necessary.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be content with the beard,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cat any rate for the present; and as for the future, God has decreed what is to be.\u201d \u201cAttend to worthy Sancho\u2019s request, seneschal,\u201d said the duchess, \u201cand do exactly what he wishes.\u201d The seneschal replied that Se\u00f1or Sancho should be obeyed in everything; and with that he went away to dinner and took Sancho along with him, while the duke and duchess and Don Quixote remained at table discussing a great variety of things, but all bearing on the calling of arms and knight-errantry.", " \u201cWho should have dictated but myself, sinner as I am?\u201d said Sancho. \u201cAnd did you write it yourself?\u201d said the duchess. \u201cThat I didn\u2019t,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cfor I can neither read nor write, though I can sign my name.\u201d \u201cLet us see it,\u201d said the duchess, \u201cfor never fear but you display in it the quality and quantity of your wit.\u201d Sancho drew out an open letter from his bosom, and the duchess, taking it, found it ran in this fashion: SANCHO PANZA\u2019S LETTER TO HIS WIFE, TERESA PANZA If I was well whipped I went mounted like a gentleman; if I have got a good government it is at the cost of a good whipping. Thou wilt not understand this just now, my Teresa; by-and-by thou wilt know what it means. I may tell thee, Teresa, I mean thee to go in a coach, for that is a matter of importance, because every other way of going is going on all-fours. Thou art a governor\u2019s wife; take care that nobody speaks evil of thee behind thy back. I send thee here a green hunting suit that my lady the duchess gave me; alter it so as to make a petticoat and bodice for our daughter. Don Quixote, my master, if I am to believe what I hear in these parts, is a madman of some sense, and a droll blockhead, and I am in no way behind him. We have been in the cave of Montesinos, and the sage Merlin has laid hold of me for the disenchantment of Dulcinea del Toboso, her that is called Aldonza Lorenzo over there. With three thousand three hundred lashes, less five, that I\u2019m to give myself, she will be left as entirely disenchanted as the mother that bore her."], "When Sancho confides that he deceived Don Quixote about Dulcinea\u2019s transformation, how does the Duchess respond?": [" And it seems to me that, in governments, to make a beginning is everything; and maybe, after having been governor a fortnight, I\u2019ll take kindly to the work and know more about it than the field labour I have been brought up to.\u201d \u201cYou are right, Sancho,\u201d said the duchess, \u201cfor no one is born ready taught, and the bishops are made out of men and not out of stones. But to return to the subject we were discussing just now, the enchantment of the lady Dulcinea, I look upon it as certain, and something more than evident, that Sancho\u2019s idea of practising a deception upon his master, making him believe that the peasant girl was Dulcinea and that if he did not recognise her it must be because she was enchanted, was all a device of one of the enchanters that persecute Don Quixote. For in truth and earnest, I know from good authority that the coarse country wench who jumped up on the ass was and is Dulcinea del Toboso, and that worthy Sancho, though he fancies himself the deceiver, is the one that is deceived; and that there is no more reason to doubt the truth of this, than of anything else we never saw. Se\u00f1or Sancho Panza must know that we too have enchanters here that are well disposed to us, and tell us what goes on in the world, plainly and distinctly, without subterfuge or deception; and believe me, Sancho, that agile country lass was and is Dulcinea del Toboso, who is as much enchanted as the mother that bore her; and when we least expect it, we shall see her in her own proper form, and then Sancho will be disabused of the error he is under at present.\u201d \u201cAll that\u2019s very possible,\u201d said Sancho Panza; \u201cand now I\u2019m willing to believe what my master says about what he saw in the cave of Montesinos, where he says he saw the lady Dulcinea del Toboso in the very same dress and apparel that I said I had seen her in when I enchanted her all to please myself.", " He came to the duke\u2019s castle, and the duke informed him of the road and route Don Quixote had taken with the intention of being present at the jousts at Saragossa. He told him, too, of the jokes he had practised upon him, and of the device for the disenchantment of Dulcinea at the expense of Sancho\u2019s backside; and finally he gave him an account of the trick Sancho had played upon his master, making him believe that Dulcinea was enchanted and turned into a country wench; and of how the duchess, his wife, had persuaded Sancho that it was he himself who was deceived, inasmuch as Dulcinea was really enchanted; at which the bachelor laughed not a little, and marvelled as well at the sharpness and simplicity of Sancho as at the length to which Don Quixote\u2019s madness went. The duke begged of him if he found him (whether he overcame him or not) to return that way and let him know the result. This the bachelor did; he set out in quest of Don Quixote, and not finding him at Saragossa, he went on, and how he fared has been already told. He returned to the duke\u2019s castle and told him all, what the conditions of the combat were, and how Don Quixote was now, like a loyal knight-errant, returning to keep his promise of retiring to his village for a year, by which time, said the bachelor, he might perhaps be cured of his madness; for that was the object that had led him to adopt these disguises, as it was a sad thing for a gentleman of such good parts as Don Quixote to be a madman.", " My squire, God\u2019s curse upon him, is better at unloosing his tongue in talking impertinence than in tightening the girths of a saddle to keep it steady; but however I may be, fallen or raised up, on foot or on horseback, I shall always be at your service and that of my lady the duchess, your worthy consort, worthy queen of beauty and paramount princess of courtesy.\u201d \u201cGently, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote of La Mancha,\u201d said the duke; \u201cwhere my lady Do\u00f1a Dulcinea del Toboso is, it is not right that other beauties should be praised.\u201d Sancho, by this time released from his entanglement, was standing by, and before his master could answer he said, \u201cThere is no denying, and it must be maintained, that my lady Dulcinea del Toboso is very beautiful; but the hare jumps up where one least expects it; and I have heard say that what we call nature is like a potter that makes vessels of clay, and he who makes one fair vessel can as well make two, or three, or a hundred; I say so because, by my faith, my lady the duchess is in no way behind my mistress the lady Dulcinea del Toboso.\u201d Don Quixote turned to the duchess and said, \u201cYour highness may conceive that never had knight-errant in this world a more talkative or a droller squire than I have, and he will prove the truth of what I say, if your highness is pleased to accept of my services for a few days.\u201d To which the duchess made answer, \u201cthat worthy Sancho is droll I consider a very good thing, because it is a sign that he is shrewd; for drollery and sprightliness, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote, as you very well know, do not take up their abode with dull wits; and as good Sancho is droll and sprightly I here set him down as shrewd.\u201d \u201cAnd talkative,\u201d added Don Quixote.", " The duke and duchess, pleased with their hunt and at having carried out their plans so cleverly and successfully, returned to their castle resolved to follow up their joke; for to them there was no reality that could afford them more amusement. p35e.jpg (10K) CHAPTER XXXVI. WHEREIN IS RELATED THE STRANGE AND UNDREAMT-OF ADVENTURE OF THE DISTRESSED DUENNA, ALIAS THE COUNTESS TRIFALDI, TOGETHER WITH A LETTER WHICH SANCHO PANZA WROTE TO HIS WIFE, TERESA PANZA p36a.jpg (150K) Full Size The duke had a majordomo of a very facetious and sportive turn, and he it was that played the part of Merlin, made all the arrangements for the late adventure, composed the verses, and got a page to represent Dulcinea; and now, with the assistance of his master and mistress, he got up another of the drollest and strangest contrivances that can be imagined. The duchess asked Sancho the next day if he had made a beginning with his penance task which he had to perform for the disenchantment of Dulcinea. He said he had, and had given himself five lashes overnight. The duchess asked him what he had given them with. He said with his hand. \u201cThat,\u201d said the duchess, \u201cis more like giving oneself slaps than lashes; I am sure the sage Merlin will not be satisfied with such tenderness; worthy Sancho must make a scourge with claws, or a cat-o\u2019-nine tails, that will make itself felt; for it\u2019s with blood that letters enter, and the release of so great a lady as Dulcinea will not be granted so cheaply, or at such a paltry price; and remember, Sancho, that works of charity done in a lukewarm and half-hearted way are without merit and of no avail.\u201d To which Sancho replied, \u201cIf your ladyship will give me a proper scourge or cord, I\u2019ll lay on with it, provided it does not hurt too much; for you must know, boor as I am, my flesh is more cotton than hemp, and it won\u2019t do for me to destroy myself for the good of anybody else.\u201d \u201cSo be it by all means,\u201d said the duchess; \u201cto-morrow I\u2019ll give you a scourge that will be just the thing for you, and will accommodate itself to the tenderness of your flesh, as if it was its own sister.\u201d Then said Sancho, \u201cYour highness must know, dear lady of my soul, that I have a letter written to my wife, Teresa Panza, giving her an account of all that has happened me since I left her; I have it here in my bosom, and there\u2019s nothing wanting but to put the address to it; I\u2019d be glad if your discretion would read it, for I think it runs in the governor style; I mean the way governors ought to write.\u201d \u201cAnd who dictated it?\u201d asked the duchess."], "When the Duke and Duchess take Don Quixote and Sancho boar hunting, the group encounters ox-drawn wagons carrying ___.": [" The duchess came out splendidly attired, and Don Quixote, in pure courtesy and politeness, held the rein of her palfrey, though the duke wanted not to allow him; and at last they reached a wood that lay between two high mountains, where, after occupying various posts, ambushes, and paths, and distributing the party in different positions, the hunt began with great noise, shouting, and hallooing, so that, between the baying of the hounds and the blowing of the horns, they could not hear one another. The duchess dismounted, and with a sharp boar-spear in her hand posted herself where she knew the wild boars were in the habit of passing. The duke and Don Quixote likewise dismounted and placed themselves one at each side of her. Sancho took up a position in the rear of all without dismounting from Dapple, whom he dared not desert lest some mischief should befall him. Scarcely had they taken their stand in a line with several of their servants, when they saw a huge boar, closely pressed by the hounds and followed by the huntsmen, making towards them, grinding his teeth and tusks, and scattering foam from his mouth. As soon as he saw him Don Quixote, bracing his shield on his arm, and drawing his sword, advanced to meet him; the duke with boar-spear did the same; but the duchess would have gone in front of them all had not the duke prevented her. Sancho alone, deserting Dapple at the sight of the mighty beast, took to his heels as hard as he could and strove in vain to mount a tall oak.", " Sancho, as he showed the rents in his torn suit to the duchess, observed, \u201cIf we had been hunting hares, or after small birds, my coat would have been safe from being in the plight it\u2019s in; I don\u2019t know what pleasure one can find in lying in wait for an animal that may take your life with his tusk if he gets at you. I recollect having heard an old ballad sung that says, By bears be thou devoured, as erst Was famous Favila.\u201d \u201cThat,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cwas a Gothic king, who, going a-hunting, was devoured by a bear.\u201d \u201cJust so,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cand I would not have kings and princes expose themselves to such dangers for the sake of a pleasure which, to my mind, ought not to be one, as it consists in killing an animal that has done no harm whatever.\u201d \u201cQuite the contrary, Sancho; you are wrong there,\u201d said the duke; \u201cfor hunting is more suitable and requisite for kings and princes than for anybody else. The chase is the emblem of war; it has stratagems, wiles, and crafty devices for overcoming the enemy in safety; in it extreme cold and intolerable heat have to be borne, indolence and sleep are despised, the bodily powers are invigorated, the limbs of him who engages in it are made supple, and, in a word, it is a pursuit which may be followed without injury to anyone and with enjoyment to many; and the best of it is, it is not for everybody, as field-sports of other sorts are, except hawking, which also is only for kings and great lords.", " They placed him in the midst of them, and with much pomp and stateliness they conducted him into another room, where there was a sumptuous table laid with but four covers. The duchess and the duke came out to the door of the room to receive him, and with them a grave ecclesiastic, one of those who rule noblemen\u2019s houses; one of those who, not being born magnates themselves, never know how to teach those who are how to behave as such; one of those who would have the greatness of great folk measured by their own narrowness of mind; one of those who, when they try to introduce economy into the household they rule, lead it into meanness. One of this sort, I say, must have been the grave churchman who came out with the duke and duchess to receive Don Quixote. A vast number of polite speeches were exchanged, and at length, taking Don Quixote between them, they proceeded to sit down to table. The duke pressed Don Quixote to take the head of the table, and, though he refused, the entreaties of the duke were so urgent that he had to accept it. The ecclesiastic took his seat opposite to him, and the duke and duchess those at the sides. All this time Sancho stood by, gaping with amazement at the honour he saw shown to his master by these illustrious persons; and observing all the ceremonious pressing that had passed between the duke and Don Quixote to induce him to take his seat at the head of the table, he said, \u201cIf your worship will give me leave I will tell you a story of what happened in my village about this matter of seats.\u201d The moment Sancho said this Don Quixote trembled, making sure that he was about to say something foolish.", " The history informs us, then, that before they reached the country house or castle, the duke went on in advance and instructed all his servants how they were to treat Don Quixote; and so the instant he came up to the castle gates with the duchess, two lackeys or equerries, clad in what they call morning gowns of fine crimson satin reaching to their feet, hastened out, and catching Don Quixote in their arms before he saw or heard them, said to him, \u201cYour highness should go and take my lady the duchess off her horse.\u201d p31b.jpg (334K) Full Size Don Quixote obeyed, and great bandying of compliments followed between the two over the matter; but in the end the duchess\u2019s determination carried the day, and she refused to get down or dismount from her palfrey except in the arms of the duke, saying she did not consider herself worthy to impose so unnecessary a burden on so great a knight. At length the duke came out to take her down, and as they entered a spacious court two fair damsels came forward and threw over Don Quixote\u2019s shoulders a large mantle of the finest scarlet cloth, and at the same instant all the galleries of the court were lined with the men-servants and women-servants of the household, crying, \u201cWelcome, flower and cream of knight-errantry!\u201d while all or most of them flung pellets filled with scented water over Don Quixote and the duke and duchess; at all which Don Quixote was greatly astonished, and this was the first time that he thoroughly felt and believed himself to be a knight-errant in reality and not merely in fancy, now that he saw himself treated in the same way as he had read of such knights being treated in days of yore."], "What does Don Quixote take to wearing on his head in place of a proper helmet?": [" IN WHICH THE DOUBTFUL QUESTION OF MAMBRINO\u2019S HELMET AND THE PACK-SADDLE IS FINALLY SETTLED, WITH OTHER ADVENTURES THAT OCCURRED IN TRUTH AND EARNEST c45a.jpg (154K) Full Size \u201cWhat do you think now, gentlemen,\u201d said the barber, \u201cof what these gentles say, when they want to make out that this is a helmet?\u201d \u201cAnd whoever says the contrary,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cI will let him know he lies if he is a knight, and if he is a squire that he lies again a thousand times.\u201d Our own barber, who was present at all this, and understood Don Quixote\u2019s humour so thoroughly, took it into his head to back up his delusion and carry on the joke for the general amusement; so addressing the other barber he said: \u201cSe\u00f1or barber, or whatever you are, you must know that I belong to your profession too, and have had a licence to practise for more than twenty years, and I know the implements of the barber craft, every one of them, perfectly well; and I was likewise a soldier for some time in the days of my youth, and I know also what a helmet is, and a morion, and a headpiece with a visor, and other things pertaining to soldiering, I meant to say to soldiers\u2019 arms; and I say\u2014saving better opinions and always with submission to sounder judgments\u2014that this piece we have now before us, which this worthy gentleman has in his hands, not only is no barber\u2019s basin, but is as far from being one as white is from black, and truth from falsehood; I say, moreover, that this, although it is a helmet, is not a complete helmet.\u201d \u201cCertainly not,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cfor half of it is wanting, that is to say the beaver.\u201d \u201cIt is quite true,\u201d said the curate, who saw the object of his friend the barber; and Cardenio, Don Fernando and his companions agreed with him, and even the Judge, if his thoughts had not been so full of Don Luis\u2019s affair, would have helped to carry on the joke; but he was so taken up with the serious matters he had on his mind that he paid little or no attention to these facetious proceedings.", " In the course of the altercation, among other things the barber said, \u201cGentlemen, this pack-saddle is mine as surely as I owe God a death, and I know it as well as if I had given birth to it, and here is my ass in the stable who will not let me lie; only try it, and if it does not fit him like a glove, call me a rascal; and what is more, the same day I was robbed of this, they robbed me likewise of a new brass basin, never yet handselled, that would fetch a crown any day.\u201d At this Don Quixote could not keep himself from answering; and interposing between the two, and separating them, he placed the pack-saddle on the ground, to lie there in sight until the truth was established, and said, \u201cYour worships may perceive clearly and plainly the error under which this worthy squire lies when he calls a basin which was, is, and shall be the helmet of Mambrino which I won from him in fair war, and made myself master of by legitimate and lawful possession. With the pack-saddle I do not concern myself; but I may tell you on that head that my squire Sancho asked my permission to strip off the caparison of this vanquished poltroon\u2019s steed, and with it adorn his own; I allowed him, and he took it; and as to its having been changed from a caparison into a pack-saddle, I can give no explanation except the usual one, that such transformations will take place in adventures of chivalry. To confirm all which, run, Sancho my son, and fetch hither the helmet which this good fellow calls a basin.\u201d \u201cEgad, master,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cif we have no other proof of our case than what your worship puts forward, Mambrino\u2019s helmet is just as much a basin as this good fellow\u2019s caparison is a pack-saddle.\u201d \u201cDo as I bid thee,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cit cannot be that everything in this castle goes by enchantment.\u201d Sancho hastened to where the basin was, and brought it back with him, and when Don Quixote saw it, he took hold of it and said: \u201cYour worships may see with what a face this squire can assert that this is a basin and not the helmet I told you of; and I swear by the order of chivalry I profess, that this helmet is the identical one I took from him, without anything added to or taken from it.\u201d \u201cThere is no doubt of that,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cfor from the time my master won it until now he has only fought one battle in it, when he let loose those unlucky men in chains; and if it had not been for this basin-helmet he would not have come off over well that time, for there was plenty of stone-throwing in that affair.\u201d c44e.jpg (13K) CHAPTER XLV.", " WHICH TREATS OF THE EXALTED ADVENTURE AND RICH PRIZE OF MAMBRINO\u2019S HELMET, TOGETHER WITH OTHER THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO OUR INVINCIBLE KNIGHT c20a.jpg (73K) Full Size It now began to rain a little, and Sancho was for going into the fulling mills, but Don Quixote had taken such an abhorrence to them on account of the late joke that he would not enter them on any account; so turning aside to right they came upon another road, different from that which they had taken the night before. Shortly afterwards Don Quixote perceived a man on horseback who wore on his head something that shone like gold, and the moment he saw him he turned to Sancho and said: \u201cI think, Sancho, there is no proverb that is not true, all being maxims drawn from experience itself, the mother of all the sciences, especially that one that says, \u2018Where one door shuts, another opens.\u2019 I say so because if last night fortune shut the door of the adventure we were looking for against us, cheating us with the fulling mills, it now opens wide another one for another better and more certain adventure, and if I do not contrive to enter it, it will be my own fault, and I cannot lay it to my ignorance of fulling mills, or the darkness of the night. I say this because, if I mistake not, there comes towards us one who wears on his head the helmet of Mambrino, concerning which I took the oath thou rememberest.\u201d \u201cMind what you say, your worship, and still more what you do,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cfor I don\u2019t want any more fulling mills to finish off fulling and knocking our senses out.\u201d \u201cThe devil take thee, man,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cwhat has a helmet to do with fulling mills?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d replied Sancho, \u201cbut, faith, if I might speak as I used, perhaps I could give such reasons that your worship would see you were mistaken in what you say.\u201d \u201cHow can I be mistaken in what I say, unbelieving traitor?\u201d returned Don Quixote; \u201ctell me, seest thou not yonder knight coming towards us on a dappled grey steed, who has upon his head a helmet of gold?\u201d \u201cWhat I see and make out,\u201d answered Sancho, \u201cis only a man on a grey ass like my own, who has something that shines on his head.\u201d \u201cWell, that is the helmet of Mambrino,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cstand to one side and leave me alone with him; thou shalt see how, without saying a word, to save time, I shall bring this adventure to an issue and possess myself of the helmet I have so longed for.\u201d \u201cI will take care to stand aside,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cbut God grant, I say once more, that it may be marjoram and not fulling mills.\u201d \u201cI have told thee, brother, on no account to mention those fulling mills to me again,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cor I vow\u2014and I say no more\u2014I\u2019ll full the soul out of you.\u201d Sancho held his peace in dread lest his master should carry out the vow he had hurled like a bowl at him.", " Don Quixote took it, and without perceiving what was in it thrust it down in hot haste upon his head; but as the curds were pressed and squeezed the whey began to run all over his face and beard, whereat he was so startled that he cried out to Sancho: \u201cSancho, what\u2019s this? I think my head is softening, or my brains are melting, or I am sweating from head to foot! If I am sweating it is not indeed from fear. I am convinced beyond a doubt that the adventure which is about to befall me is a terrible one. Give me something to wipe myself with, if thou hast it, for this profuse sweat is blinding me.\u201d Sancho held his tongue, and gave him a cloth, and gave thanks to God at the same time that his master had not found out what was the matter. Don Quixote then wiped himself, and took off his helmet to see what it was that made his head feel so cool, and seeing all that white mash inside his helmet he put it to his nose, and as soon as he had smelt it he exclaimed: \u201cBy the life of my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, but it is curds thou hast put here, thou treacherous, impudent, ill-mannered squire!\u201d To which, with great composure and pretended innocence, Sancho replied, \u201cIf they are curds let me have them, your worship, and I\u2019ll eat them; but let the devil eat them, for it must have been he who put them there. I dare to dirty your helmet! You have guessed the offender finely! Faith, sir, by the light God gives me, it seems I must have enchanters too, that persecute me as a creature and limb of your worship, and they must have put that nastiness there in order to provoke your patience to anger, and make you baste my ribs as you are wont to do."], "What prompts Don Quixote to free the galley slaves?": [" He wants us to let the king\u2019s prisoners go, as if we had any authority to release them, or he to order us to do so! Go your way, sir, and good luck to you; put that basin straight that you\u2019ve got on your head, and don\u2019t go looking for three feet on a cat.\u201d \u201c\u2019Tis you that are the cat, rat, and rascal,\u201d replied Don Quixote, and acting on the word he fell upon him so suddenly that without giving him time to defend himself he brought him to the ground sorely wounded with a lance-thrust; and lucky it was for him that it was the one that had the musket. The other guards stood thunderstruck and amazed at this unexpected event, but recovering presence of mind, those on horseback seized their swords, and those on foot their javelins, and attacked Don Quixote, who was waiting for them with great calmness; and no doubt it would have gone badly with him if the galley slaves, seeing the chance before them of liberating themselves, had not effected it by contriving to break the chain on which they were strung. Such was the confusion, that the guards, now rushing at the galley slaves who were breaking loose, now to attack Don Quixote who was waiting for them, did nothing at all that was of any use. Sancho, on his part, gave a helping hand to release Gines de Pasamonte, who was the first to leap forth upon the plain free and unfettered, and who, attacking the prostrate commissary, took from him his sword and the musket, with which, aiming at one and levelling at another, he, without ever discharging it, drove every one of the guards off the field, for they took to flight, as well to escape Pasamonte\u2019s musket, as the showers of stones the now released galley slaves were raining upon them.", " It only concerns them to aid them as persons in need of help, having regard to their sufferings and not to their rascalities. I encountered a chaplet or string of miserable and unfortunate people, and did for them what my sense of duty demands of me, and as for the rest be that as it may; and whoever takes objection to it, saving the sacred dignity of the se\u00f1or licentiate and his honoured person, I say he knows little about chivalry and lies like a whoreson villain, and this I will give him to know to the fullest extent with my sword;\u201d and so saying he settled himself in his stirrups and pressed down his morion; for the barber\u2019s basin, which according to him was Mambrino\u2019s helmet, he carried hanging at the saddle-bow until he could repair the damage done to it by the galley slaves. Dorothea, who was shrewd and sprightly, and by this time thoroughly understood Don Quixote\u2019s crazy turn, and that all except Sancho Panza were making game of him, not to be behind the rest said to him, on observing his irritation, \u201cSir Knight, remember the boon you have promised me, and that in accordance with it you must not engage in any other adventure, be it ever so pressing; calm yourself, for if the licentiate had known that the galley slaves had been set free by that unconquered arm he would have stopped his mouth thrice over, or even bitten his tongue three times before he would have said a word that tended towards disrespect of your worship.\u201d \u201cThat I swear heartily,\u201d said the curate, \u201cand I would have even plucked off a moustache.\u201d \u201cI will hold my peace, se\u00f1ora,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand I will curb the natural anger that had arisen in my breast, and will proceed in peace and quietness until I have fulfilled my promise; but in return for this consideration I entreat you to tell me, if you have no objection to do so, what is the nature of your trouble, and how many, who, and what are the persons of whom I am to require due satisfaction, and on whom I am to take vengeance on your behalf?\u201d \u201cThat I will do with all my heart,\u201d replied Dorothea, \u201cif it will not be wearisome to you to hear of miseries and misfortunes.\u201d \u201cIt will not be wearisome, se\u00f1ora,\u201d said Don Quixote; to which Dorothea replied, \u201cWell, if that be so, give me your attention.\u201d As soon as she said this, Cardenio and the barber drew close to her side, eager to hear what sort of story the quick-witted Dorothea would invent for herself; and Sancho did the same, for he was as much taken in by her as his master; and she having settled herself comfortably in the saddle, and with the help of coughing and other preliminaries taken time to think, began with great sprightliness of manner in this fashion.", " c20e.jpg (18K) CHAPTER XXII. OF THE FREEDOM DON QUIXOTE CONFERRED ON SEVERAL UNFORTUNATES WHO AGAINST THEIR WILL WERE BEING CARRIED WHERE THEY HAD NO WISH TO GO c22a.jpg (178K) Full Size Cid Hamete Benengeli, the Arab and Manchegan author, relates in this most grave, high-sounding, minute, delightful, and original history that after the discussion between the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha and his squire Sancho Panza which is set down at the end of chapter twenty-one, Don Quixote raised his eyes and saw coming along the road he was following some dozen men on foot strung together by the neck, like beads, on a great iron chain, and all with manacles on their hands. With them there came also two men on horseback and two on foot; those on horseback with wheel-lock muskets, those on foot with javelins and swords, and as soon as Sancho saw them he said: \u201cThat is a chain of galley slaves, on the way to the galleys by force of the king\u2019s orders.\u201d \u201cHow by force?\u201d asked Don Quixote; \u201cis it possible that the king uses force against anyone?\u201d \u201cI do not say that,\u201d answered Sancho, \u201cbut that these are people condemned for their crimes to serve by force in the king\u2019s galleys.\u201d \u201cIn fact,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201chowever it may be, these people are going where they are taking them by force, and not of their own will.\u201d \u201cJust so,\u201d said Sancho. \u201cThen if so,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201chere is a case for the exercise of my office, to put down force and to succour and help the wretched.\u201d \u201cRecollect, your worship,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cJustice, which is the king himself, is not using force or doing wrong to such persons, but punishing them for their crimes.\u201d The chain of galley slaves had by this time come up, and Don Quixote in very courteous language asked those who were in custody of it to be good enough to tell him the reason or reasons for which they were conducting these people in this manner.", " One of the guards on horseback answered that they were galley slaves belonging to his majesty, that they were going to the galleys, and that was all that was to be said and all he had any business to know. c22b.jpg (298K) Full Size \u201cNevertheless,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cI should like to know from each of them separately the reason of his misfortune;\u201d to this he added more to the same effect to induce them to tell him what he wanted so civilly that the other mounted guard said to him: \u201cThough we have here the register and certificate of the sentence of every one of these wretches, this is no time to take them out or read them; come and ask themselves; they can tell if they choose, and they will, for these fellows take a pleasure in doing and talking about rascalities.\u201d With this permission, which Don Quixote would have taken even had they not granted it, he approached the chain and asked the first for what offences he was now in such a sorry case. He made answer that it was for being a lover. \u201cFor that only?\u201d replied Don Quixote; \u201cwhy, if for being lovers they send people to the galleys I might have been rowing in them long ago.\u201d \u201cThe love is not the sort your worship is thinking of,\u201d said the galley slave; \u201cmine was that I loved a washerwoman\u2019s basket of clean linen so well, and held it so close in my embrace, that if the arm of the law had not forced it from me, I should never have let it go of my own will to this moment; I was caught in the act, there was no occasion for torture, the case was settled, they treated me to a hundred lashes on the back, and three years of gurapas besides, and that was the end of it.\u201d \u201cWhat are gurapas?\u201d asked Don Quixote."], "What is the most apparent sign of madness in the \u201cRagged Knight of the Sorry Countenance\u201d?": [" The other, whom we may call the Ragged One of the Sorry Countenance, as Don Quixote was of the Rueful, after submitting to the embrace pushed him back a little and, placing his hands on Don Quixote\u2019s shoulders, stood gazing at him as if seeking to see whether he knew him, not less amazed, perhaps, at the sight of the face, figure, and armour of Don Quixote than Don Quixote was at the sight of him.

On reaching it he stretched himself upon the grass, and the others did the same, all keeping silence, until the Ragged One, settling himself in his place, said: \u201cIf it is your wish, sirs, that I should disclose in a few words the surpassing extent of my misfortunes, you must promise not to break the thread of my sad story with any question or other interruption, for the instant you do so the tale I tell will come to an end.\u201d These words of the Ragged One reminded Don Quixote of the tale his squire had told him, when he failed to keep count of the goats that had crossed the river and the story remained unfinished; but to return to the Ragged One, he went on to say: \u201cI give you this warning because I wish to pass briefly over the story of my misfortunes, for recalling them to memory only serves to add fresh ones, and the less you question me the sooner shall I make an end of the recital, though I shall not omit to relate anything of importance in order fully to satisfy your curiosity.\u201d Don Quixote gave the promise for himself and the others, and with this assurance he began as follows: \u201cMy name is Cardenio, my birthplace one of the best cities of this Andalusia, my family noble, my parents rich, my misfortune so great that my parents must have wept and my family grieved over it without being able by their wealth to lighten it; for the gifts of fortune can do little to relieve reverses sent by Heaven.", " \u201cI will tell you,\u201d answered Sancho; \u201cit was because I have been looking at you for some time by the light of the torch held by that unfortunate, and verily your worship has got of late the most ill-favoured countenance I ever saw: it must be either owing to the fatigue of this combat, or else to the want of teeth and grinders.\u201d \u201cIt is not that,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cbut because the sage whose duty it will be to write the history of my achievements must have thought it proper that I should take some distinctive name as all knights of yore did; one being \u2018He of the Burning Sword,\u2019 another \u2018He of the Unicorn,\u2019 this one \u2018He of the Damsels,\u2019 that \u2018He of the Ph\u0153nix,\u2019 another \u2018The Knight of the Griffin,\u2019 and another \u2018He of the Death,\u2019 and by these names and designations they were known all the world round; and so I say that the sage aforesaid must have put it into your mouth and mind just now to call me \u2018The Knight of the Rueful Countenance,\u2019 as I intend to call myself from this day forward; and that the said name may fit me better, I mean, when the opportunity offers, to have a very rueful countenance painted on my shield.\u201d \u201cThere is no occasion, se\u00f1or, for wasting time or money on making that countenance,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cfor all that need be done is for your worship to show your own, face to face, to those who look at you, and without anything more, either image or shield, they will call you \u2018Him of the Rueful Countenance\u2019 and believe me I am telling you the truth, for I assure you, se\u00f1or (and in good part be it said), hunger and the loss of your grinders have given you such an ill-favoured face that, as I say, the rueful picture may be very well spared.\u201d Don Quixote laughed at Sancho\u2019s pleasantry; nevertheless he resolved to call himself by that name, and have his shield or buckler painted as he had devised.", " The Knight of the Rueful Countenance was still very anxious to find out who the owner of the valise could be, conjecturing from the sonnet and letter, from the money in gold, and from the fineness of the shirts, that he must be some lover of distinction whom the scorn and cruelty of his lady had driven to some desperate course; but as in that uninhabited and rugged spot there was no one to be seen of whom he could inquire, he saw nothing else for it but to push on, taking whatever road Rocinante chose\u2014which was where he could make his way\u2014firmly persuaded that among these wilds he could not fail to meet some rare adventure. As he went along, then, occupied with these thoughts, he perceived on the summit of a height that rose before their eyes a man who went springing from rock to rock and from tussock to tussock with marvellous agility. As well as he could make out he was unclad, with a thick black beard, long tangled hair, and bare legs and feet, his thighs were covered by breeches apparently of tawny velvet but so ragged that they showed his skin in several places. c23g.jpg (360K) Full Size He was bareheaded, and notwithstanding the swiftness with which he passed as has been described, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance observed and noted all these trifles, and though he made the attempt, he was unable to follow him, for it was not granted to the feebleness of Rocinante to make way over such rough ground, he being, moreover, slow-paced and sluggish by nature."], "Before he went mad with heartsickness, who was Cardenio, the \u201cRagged Knight of the Sorry Countenance\u201d?": [" The other, whom we may call the Ragged One of the Sorry Countenance, as Don Quixote was of the Rueful, after submitting to the embrace pushed him back a little and, placing his hands on Don Quixote\u2019s shoulders, stood gazing at him as if seeking to see whether he knew him, not less amazed, perhaps, at the sight of the face, figure, and armour of Don Quixote than Don Quixote was at the sight of him.

Strange to say, he stood up for her as if she were in earnest his veritable born lady; to such a pass had his unholy books brought him. Cardenio, then, being, as I said, now mad, when he heard himself given the lie, and called a scoundrel and other insulting names, not relishing the jest, snatched up a stone that he found near him, and with it delivered such a blow on Don Quixote\u2019s breast that he laid him on his back. Sancho Panza, seeing his master treated in this fashion, attacked the madman with his closed fist; but the Ragged One received him in such a way that with a blow of his fist he stretched him at his feet, and then mounting upon him crushed his ribs to his own satisfaction; the goatherd, who came to the rescue, shared the same fate; and having beaten and pummelled them all he left them and quietly withdrew to his hiding-place on the mountain.", " And though I have no intention of imitating Roland, or Orlando, or Rotolando (for he went by all these names), step by step in all the mad things he did, said, and thought, I will make a rough copy to the best of my power of all that seems to me most essential; but perhaps I shall content myself with the simple imitation of Amadis, who without giving way to any mischievous madness but merely to tears and sorrow, gained as much fame as the most famous.\u201d \u201cIt seems to me,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cthat the knights who behaved in this way had provocation and cause for those follies and penances; but what cause has your worship for going mad? What lady has rejected you, or what evidence have you found to prove that the lady Dulcinea del Toboso has been trifling with Moor or Christian?\u201d \u201cThere is the point,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cand that is the beauty of this business of mine; no thanks to a knight-errant for going mad when he has cause; the thing is to turn crazy without any provocation, and let my lady know, if I do this in the dry, what I would do in the moist; moreover I have abundant cause in the long separation I have endured from my lady till death, Dulcinea del Toboso; for as thou didst hear that shepherd Ambrosio say the other day, in absence all ills are felt and feared; and so, friend Sancho, waste no time in advising me against so rare, so happy, and so unheard-of an imitation; mad I am, and mad I must be until thou returnest with the answer to a letter that I mean to send by thee to my lady Dulcinea; and if it be such as my constancy deserves, my insanity and penance will come to an end; and if it be to the opposite effect, I shall become mad in earnest, and, being so, I shall suffer no more; thus in whatever way she may answer I shall escape from the struggle and affliction in which thou wilt leave me, enjoying in my senses the boon thou bearest me, or as a madman not feeling the evil thou bringest me."], "What does Don Quixote assert when Sancho derides his plan to do penance and imagine Dulcinea\u2019s infidelity?": [" But one thing, se\u00f1or, troubles me more than all the rest, and that is thinking what is to be done when your worship conquers some giant, or some other knight, and orders him to go and present himself before the beauty of the lady Dulcinea. Where is this poor giant, or this poor wretch of a vanquished knight, to find her? I think I can see them wandering all over El Toboso, looking like noddies, and asking for my lady Dulcinea; and even if they meet her in the middle of the street they won\u2019t know her any more than they would my father.\u201d \u201cPerhaps, Sancho,\u201d returned Don Quixote, \u201cthe enchantment does not go so far as to deprive conquered and presented giants and knights of the power of recognising Dulcinea; we will try by experiment with one or two of the first I vanquish and send to her, whether they see her or not, by commanding them to return and give me an account of what happened to them in this respect.\u201d \u201cI declare, I think what your worship has proposed is excellent,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cand that by this plan we shall find out what we want to know; and if it be that it is only from your worship she is hidden, the misfortune will be more yours than hers; but so long as the lady Dulcinea is well and happy, we on our part will make the best of it, and get on as well as we can, seeking our adventures, and leaving Time to take his own course; for he is the best physician for these and greater ailments.\u201d Don Quixote was about to reply to Sancho Panza, but he was prevented by a cart crossing the road full of the most diverse and strange personages and figures that could be imagined.", " In this short interval Don Quixote told him of his unfortunate defeat, and of Dulcinea\u2019s enchantment and the remedy, all which threw Don \u00c1lvaro into fresh amazement, and embracing Don Quixote and Sancho, he went his way, and Don Quixote went his. That night he passed among trees again in order to give Sancho an opportunity of working out his penance, which he did in the same fashion as the night before, at the expense of the bark of the beech trees much more than of his back, of which he took such good care that the lashes would not have knocked off a fly had there been one there. The duped Don Quixote did not miss a single stroke of the count, and he found that together with those of the night before they made up three thousand and twenty-nine. The sun apparently had got up early to witness the sacrifice, and with his light they resumed their journey, discussing the deception practised on Don \u00c1lvaro, and saying how well done it was to have taken his declaration before a magistrate in such an unimpeachable form. That day and night they travelled on, nor did anything worth mention happen to them, unless it was that in the course of the night Sancho finished off his task, whereat Don Quixote was beyond measure joyful. He watched for daylight, to see if along the road he should fall in with his already disenchanted lady Dulcinea; and as he pursued his journey there was no woman he met that he did not go up to, to see if she was Dulcinea del Toboso, as he held it absolutely certain that Merlin\u2019s promises could not lie.", " And so they supped in high enjoyment, which was increased when they observed Don Quixote leave off eating, and, moved by an impulse like that which made him deliver himself at such length when he supped with the goatherds, begin to address them: \u201cVerily, gentlemen, if we reflect upon it, great and marvellous are the things they see, who make profession of the order of knight-errantry. Say, what being is there in this world, who entering the gate of this castle at this moment, and seeing us as we are here, would suppose or imagine us to be what we are? Who would say that this lady who is beside me was the great queen that we all know her to be, or that I am that Knight of the Rueful Countenance, trumpeted far and wide by the mouth of Fame? Now, there can be no doubt that this art and calling surpasses all those that mankind has invented, and is the more deserving of being held in honour in proportion as it is the more exposed to peril. Away with those who assert that letters have the preeminence over arms; I will tell them, whosoever they may be, that they know not what they say. For the reason which such persons commonly assign, and upon which they chiefly rest, is, that the labours of the mind are greater than those of the body, and that arms give employment to the body alone; as if the calling were a porter\u2019s trade, for which nothing more is required than sturdy strength; or as if, in what we who profess them call arms, there were not included acts of vigour for the execution of which high intelligence is requisite; or as if the soul of the warrior, when he has an army, or the defence of a city under his care, did not exert itself as much by mind as by body.", " What your worship may do, and fairly do, is to change this service and tribute as regards the lady Dulcinea del Toboso for a certain quantity of ave-marias and credos which we will say for your worship\u2019s intention, and this is a condition that can be complied with by night as by day, running or resting, in peace or in war; but to imagine that we are going now to return to the flesh-pots of Egypt, I mean to take up our chain and set out for El Toboso, is to imagine that it is now night, though it is not yet ten in the morning, and to ask this of us is like asking pears of the elm tree.\u201d \u201cThen by all that\u2019s good,\u201d said Don Quixote (now stirred to wrath), \u201cDon son of a bitch, Don Ginesillo de Paropillo, or whatever your name is, you will have to go yourself alone, with your tail between your legs and the whole chain on your back.\u201d Pasamonte, who was anything but meek (being by this time thoroughly convinced that Don Quixote was not quite right in his head as he had committed such a vagary as to set them free), finding himself abused in this fashion, gave the wink to his companions, and falling back they began to shower stones on Don Quixote at such a rate that he was quite unable to protect himself with his buckler, and poor Rocinante no more heeded the spur than if he had been made of brass. Sancho planted himself behind his ass, and with him sheltered himself from the hailstorm that poured on both of them."], "In the story that Cardenio tells the priest and the barber, who marries Cardenio\u2019s beloved, Lucinda, against her wishes?": [" The gentleman grasped her firmly by the shoulders, and being so fully occupied with holding her back, he was unable to put a hand to his veil which was falling off, as it did at length entirely, and Dorothea, who was holding the lady in her arms, raising her eyes saw that he who likewise held her was her husband, Don Fernando. The instant she recognised him, with a prolonged plaintive cry drawn from the depths of her heart, she fell backwards fainting, and but for the barber being close by to catch her in his arms, she would have fallen completely to the ground. The curate at once hastened to uncover her face and throw water on it, and as he did so Don Fernando, for he it was who held the other in his arms, recognised her and stood as if death-stricken by the sight; not, however, relaxing his grasp of Luscinda, for it was she that was struggling to release herself from his hold, having recognised Cardenio by his voice, as he had recognised her. Cardenio also heard Dorothea\u2019s cry as she fell fainting, and imagining that it came from his Luscinda burst forth in terror from the room, and the first thing he saw was Don Fernando with Luscinda in his arms. Don Fernando, too, knew Cardenio at once; and all three, Luscinda, Cardenio, and Dorothea, stood in silent amazement scarcely knowing what had happened to them. They gazed at one another without speaking, Dorothea at Don Fernando, Don Fernando at Cardenio, Cardenio at Luscinda, and Luscinda at Cardenio.", " And as we have this consolation springing from no very visionary hope or wild fancy, I entreat you, se\u00f1ora, to form new resolutions in your better mind, as I mean to do in mine, preparing yourself to look forward to happier fortunes; for I swear to you by the faith of a gentleman and a Christian not to desert you until I see you in possession of Don Fernando, and if I cannot by words induce him to recognise his obligation to you, in that case to avail myself of the right which my rank as a gentleman gives me, and with just cause challenge him on account of the injury he has done you, not regarding my own wrongs, which I shall leave to Heaven to avenge, while I on earth devote myself to yours.\u201d Cardenio\u2019s words completed the astonishment of Dorothea, and not knowing how to return thanks for such an offer, she attempted to kiss his feet; but Cardenio would not permit it, and the licentiate replied for both, commended the sound reasoning of Cardenio, and lastly, begged, advised, and urged them to come with him to his village, where they might furnish themselves with what they needed, and take measures to discover Don Fernando, or restore Dorothea to her parents, or do what seemed to them most advisable. Cardenio and Dorothea thanked him, and accepted the kind offer he made them; and the barber, who had been listening to all attentively and in silence, on his part some kindly words also, and with no less good-will than the curate offered his services in any way that might be of use to them.", " Not so Luscinda, and Cardenio, and almost all the others, for they shed so many tears, some in their own happiness, some at that of the others, that one would have supposed a heavy calamity had fallen upon them all. Even Sancho Panza was weeping; though afterwards he said he only wept because he saw that Dorothea was not as he fancied the queen Micomicona, of whom he expected such great favours. Their wonder as well as their weeping lasted some time, and then Cardenio and Luscinda went and fell on their knees before Don Fernando, returning him thanks for the favour he had rendered them in language so grateful that he knew not how to answer them, and raising them up embraced them with every mark of affection and courtesy. He then asked Dorothea how she had managed to reach a place so far removed from her own home, and she in a few fitting words told all that she had previously related to Cardenio, with which Don Fernando and his companions were so delighted that they wished the story had been longer; so charmingly did Dorothea describe her misadventures. When she had finished Don Fernando recounted what had befallen him in the city after he had found in Luscinda\u2019s bosom the paper in which she declared that she was Cardenio\u2019s wife, and never could be his. He said he meant to kill her, and would have done so had he not been prevented by her parents, and that he quitted the house full of rage and shame, and resolved to avenge himself when a more convenient opportunity should offer.", " Cardenio then bade Dorothea return to her room, as he would endeavour to make the whole matter right, and they did as he desired. All the four who had come in quest of Don Luis had now come into the inn and surrounded him, urging him to return and console his father at once and without a moment\u2019s delay. He replied that he could not do so on any account until he had concluded some business in which his life, honour, and heart were at stake. The servants pressed him, saying that most certainly they would not return without him, and that they would take him away whether he liked it or not. \u201cYou shall not do that,\u201d replied Don Luis, \u201cunless you take me dead; though however you take me, it will be without life.\u201d By this time most of those in the inn had been attracted by the dispute, but particularly Cardenio, Don Fernando, his companions, the Judge, the curate, the barber, and Don Quixote; for he now considered there was no necessity for mounting guard over the castle any longer. Cardenio being already acquainted with the young man\u2019s story, asked the men who wanted to take him away, what object they had in seeking to carry off this youth against his will. \u201cOur object,\u201d said one of the four, \u201cis to save the life of his father, who is in danger of losing it through this gentleman\u2019s disappearance.\u201d Upon this Don Luis exclaimed, \u201cThere is no need to make my affairs public here; I am free, and I will return if I please; and if not, none of you shall compel me.\u201d \u201cReason will compel your worship,\u201d said the man, \u201cand if it has no power over you, it has power over us, to make us do what we came for, and what it is our duty to do.\u201d \u201cLet us hear what the whole affair is about,\u201d said the Judge at this; but the man, who knew him as a neighbour of theirs, replied, \u201cDo you not know this gentleman, Se\u00f1or Judge?"], "What does Dorothea reveal about Ferdinand to the priest, the barber, and Cardenio?": [" The gentleman grasped her firmly by the shoulders, and being so fully occupied with holding her back, he was unable to put a hand to his veil which was falling off, as it did at length entirely, and Dorothea, who was holding the lady in her arms, raising her eyes saw that he who likewise held her was her husband, Don Fernando.

He said he meant to kill her, and would have done so had he not been prevented by her parents, and that he quitted the house full of rage and shame, and resolved to avenge himself when a more convenient opportunity should offer.", " IN WHICH THE DOUBTFUL QUESTION OF MAMBRINO\u2019S HELMET AND THE PACK-SADDLE IS FINALLY SETTLED, WITH OTHER ADVENTURES THAT OCCURRED IN TRUTH AND EARNEST c45a.jpg (154K) Full Size \u201cWhat do you think now, gentlemen,\u201d said the barber, \u201cof what these gentles say, when they want to make out that this is a helmet?\u201d \u201cAnd whoever says the contrary,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cI will let him know he lies if he is a knight, and if he is a squire that he lies again a thousand times.\u201d Our own barber, who was present at all this, and understood Don Quixote\u2019s humour so thoroughly, took it into his head to back up his delusion and carry on the joke for the general amusement; so addressing the other barber he said: \u201cSe\u00f1or barber, or whatever you are, you must know that I belong to your profession too, and have had a licence to practise for more than twenty years, and I know the implements of the barber craft, every one of them, perfectly well; and I was likewise a soldier for some time in the days of my youth, and I know also what a helmet is, and a morion, and a headpiece with a visor, and other things pertaining to soldiering, I meant to say to soldiers\u2019 arms; and I say\u2014saving better opinions and always with submission to sounder judgments\u2014that this piece we have now before us, which this worthy gentleman has in his hands, not only is no barber\u2019s basin, but is as far from being one as white is from black, and truth from falsehood; I say, moreover, that this, although it is a helmet, is not a complete helmet.\u201d \u201cCertainly not,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cfor half of it is wanting, that is to say the beaver.\u201d \u201cIt is quite true,\u201d said the curate, who saw the object of his friend the barber; and Cardenio, Don Fernando and his companions agreed with him, and even the Judge, if his thoughts had not been so full of Don Luis\u2019s affair, would have helped to carry on the joke; but he was so taken up with the serious matters he had on his mind that he paid little or no attention to these facetious proceedings."], "How does the priest introduce Dorothea to Sancho and Don Quixote?": [" Her husband Guillermo died of grief at the death of so good a wife, leaving his daughter Marcela, a child and rich, to the care of an uncle of hers, a priest and prebendary in our village. The girl grew up with such beauty that it reminded us of her mother\u2019s, which was very great, and yet it was thought that the daughter\u2019s would exceed it; and so when she reached the age of fourteen to fifteen years nobody beheld her but blessed God that had made her so beautiful, and the greater number were in love with her past redemption. Her uncle kept her in great seclusion and retirement, but for all that the fame of her great beauty spread so that, as well for it as for her great wealth, her uncle was asked, solicited, and importuned, to give her in marriage not only by those of our town but of those many leagues round, and by the persons of highest quality in them. But he, being a good Christian man, though he desired to give her in marriage at once, seeing her to be old enough, was unwilling to do so without her consent, not that he had any eye to the gain and profit which the custody of the girl\u2019s property brought him while he put off her marriage; and, faith, this was said in praise of the good priest in more than one set in the town. For I would have you know, Sir Errant, that in these little villages everything is talked about and everything is carped at, and rest assured, as I am, that the priest must be over and above good who forces his parishioners to speak well of him, especially in villages.\u201d \u201cThat is the truth,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cbut go on, for the story is very good, and you, good Pedro, tell it with very good grace.\u201d \u201cMay that of the Lord not be wanting to me,\u201d said Pedro; \u201cthat is the one to have.", " He described to them also nearly all the adventures that Sancho had mentioned, at which they marvelled and laughed not a little, thinking it, as all did, the strangest form of madness a crazy intellect could be capable of. But now, the curate said, that the lady Dorothea\u2019s good fortune prevented her from proceeding with their purpose, it would be necessary to devise or discover some other way of getting him home. Cardenio proposed to carry out the scheme they had begun, and suggested that Luscinda would act and support Dorothea\u2019s part sufficiently well. \u201cNo,\u201d said Don Fernando, \u201cthat must not be, for I want Dorothea to follow out this idea of hers; and if the worthy gentleman\u2019s village is not very far off, I shall be happy if I can do anything for his relief.\u201d \u201cIt is not more than two days\u2019 journey from this,\u201d said the curate. \u201cEven if it were more,\u201d said Don Fernando, \u201cI would gladly travel so far for the sake of doing so good a work.\u201d At this moment Don Quixote came out in full panoply, with Mambrino\u2019s helmet, all dinted as it was, on his head, his buckler on his arm, and leaning on his staff or pike. The strange figure he presented filled Don Fernando and the rest with amazement as they contemplated his lean yellow face half a league long, his armour of all sorts, and the solemnity of his deportment. They stood silent waiting to see what he would say, and he, fixing his eyes on the fair Dorothea, addressed her with great gravity and composure: \u201cI am informed, fair lady, by my squire here that your greatness has been annihilated and your being abolished, since, from a queen and lady of high degree as you used to be, you have been turned into a private maiden.", " My father said, too, that when he was dead, and I saw Pandafilando about to invade my kingdom, I was not to wait and attempt to defend myself, for that would be destructive to me, but that I should leave the kingdom entirely open to him if I wished to avoid the death and total destruction of my good and loyal vassals, for there would be no possibility of defending myself against the giant\u2019s devilish power; and that I should at once with some of my followers set out for Spain, where I should obtain relief in my distress on finding a certain knight-errant whose fame by that time would extend over the whole kingdom, and who would be called, if I remember rightly, Don Azote or Don Gigote.\u201d \u201c\u2018Don Quixote,\u2019 he must have said, se\u00f1ora,\u201d observed Sancho at this, \u201cotherwise called the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.\u201d \u201cThat is it,\u201d said Dorothea; \u201che said, moreover, that he would be tall of stature and lank featured; and that on his right side under the left shoulder, or thereabouts, he would have a grey mole with hairs like bristles.\u201d On hearing this, Don Quixote said to his squire, \u201cHere, Sancho my son, bear a hand and help me to strip, for I want to see if I am the knight that sage king foretold.\u201d \u201cWhat does your worship want to strip for?\u201d said Dorothea. \u201cTo see if I have that mole your father spoke of,\u201d answered Don Quixote. \u201cThere is no occasion to strip,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cfor I know your worship has just such a mole on the middle of your backbone, which is the mark of a strong man.\u201d \u201cThat is enough,\u201d said Dorothea, \u201cfor with friends we must not look too closely into trifles; and whether it be on the shoulder or on the backbone matters little; it is enough if there is a mole, be it where it may, for it is all the same flesh; no doubt my good father hit the truth in every particular, and I have made a lucky hit in commending myself to Don Quixote; for he is the one my father spoke of, as the features of his countenance correspond with those assigned to this knight by that wide fame he has acquired not only in Spain but in all La Mancha; for I had scarcely landed at Osuna when I heard such accounts of his achievements, that at once my heart told me he was the very one I had come in search of.\u201d \u201cBut how did you land at Osuna, se\u00f1ora,\u201d asked Don Quixote, \u201cwhen it is not a seaport?\u201d But before Dorothea could reply the curate anticipated her, saying, \u201cThe princess meant to say that after she had landed at Malaga the first place where she heard of your worship was Osuna.\u201d \u201cThat is what I meant to say,\u201d said Dorothea.", " And vaguely drifting am I borne, I know not where it leads me; I fix my gaze on it alone, Of all beside it heedless. But over-cautious prudery, And coyness cold and cruel, When most I need it, these, like clouds, Its longed-for light refuse me. Bright star, goal of my yearning eyes As thou above me beamest, When thou shalt hide thee from my sight I\u2019ll know that death is near me. The singer had got so far when it struck Dorothea that it was not fair to let Clara miss hearing such a sweet voice, so, shaking her from side to side, she woke her, saying: \u201cForgive me, child, for waking thee, but I do so that thou mayest have the pleasure of hearing the best voice thou hast ever heard, perhaps, in all thy life.\u201d Clara awoke quite drowsy, and not understanding at the moment what Dorothea said, asked her what it was; she repeated what she had said, and Clara became attentive at once; but she had hardly heard two lines, as the singer continued, when a strange trembling seized her, as if she were suffering from a severe attack of quartan ague, and throwing her arms round Dorothea she said: \u201cAh, dear lady of my soul and life! why did you wake me? The greatest kindness fortune could do me now would be to close my eyes and ears so as neither to see or hear that unhappy musician.\u201d \u201cWhat art thou talking about, child?\u201d said Dorothea. \u201cWhy, they say this singer is a muleteer!\u201d \u201cNay, he is the lord of many places,\u201d replied Clara, \u201cand that one in my heart which he holds so firmly shall never be taken from him, unless he be willing to surrender it.\u201d Dorothea was amazed at the ardent language of the girl, for it seemed to be far beyond such experience of life as her tender years gave any promise of, so she said to her: \u201cYou speak in such a way that I cannot understand you, Se\u00f1ora Clara; explain yourself more clearly, and tell me what is this you are saying about hearts and places and this musician whose voice has so moved you?"], "What reward does Dorothea promise Don Quixote for vanquishing \u201cthe giant\u201d?": [" IN WHICH IS CONTINUED THE STORY OF THE FAMOUS PRINCESS MICOMICONA, WITH OTHER DROLL ADVENTURES c37a.jpg (159K) Full Size To all this Sancho listened with no little sorrow at heart to see how his hopes of dignity were fading away and vanishing in smoke, and how the fair Princess Micomicona had turned into Dorothea, and the giant into Don Fernando, while his master was sleeping tranquilly, totally unconscious of all that had come to pass. Dorothea was unable to persuade herself that her present happiness was not all a dream; Cardenio was in a similar state of mind, and Luscinda\u2019s thoughts ran in the same direction. Don Fernando gave thanks to Heaven for the favour shown to him and for having been rescued from the intricate labyrinth in which he had been brought so near the destruction of his good name and of his soul; and in short everybody in the inn was full of contentment and satisfaction at the happy issue of such a complicated and hopeless business. The curate as a sensible man made sound reflections upon the whole affair, and congratulated each upon his good fortune; but the one that was in the highest spirits and good humour was the landlady, because of the promise Cardenio and the curate had given her to pay for all the losses and damage she had sustained through Don Quixote\u2019s means. Sancho, as has been already said, was the only one who was distressed, unhappy, and dejected; and so with a long face he went in to his master, who had just awoke, and said to him: \u201cSir Rueful Countenance, your worship may as well sleep on as much as you like, without troubling yourself about killing any giant or restoring her kingdom to the princess; for that is all over and settled now.\u201d \u201cI should think it was,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cfor I have had the most prodigious and stupendous battle with the giant that I ever remember having had all the days of my life; and with one back-stroke\u2014swish!\u2014I brought his head tumbling to the ground, and so much blood gushed forth from him that it ran in rivulets over the earth like water.\u201d \u201cLike red wine, your worship had better say,\u201d replied Sancho; \u201cfor I would have you know, if you don\u2019t know it, that the dead giant is a hacked wine-skin, and the blood four-and-twenty gallons of red wine that it had in its belly, and the cut-off head is the bitch that bore me; and the devil take it all.\u201d \u201cWhat art thou talking about, fool?\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cart thou in thy senses?\u201d \u201cLet your worship get up,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cand you will see the nice business you have made of it, and what we have to pay; and you will see the queen turned into a private lady called Dorothea, and other things that will astonish you, if you understand them.\u201d \u201cI shall not be surprised at anything of the kind,\u201d returned Don Quixote; \u201cfor if thou dost remember the last time we were here I told thee that everything that happened here was a matter of enchantment, and it would be no wonder if it were the same now.\u201d \u201cI could believe all that,\u201d replied Sancho, \u201cif my blanketing was the same sort of thing also; only it wasn\u2019t, but real and genuine; for I saw the landlord, who is here to-day, holding one end of the blanket and jerking me up to the skies very neatly and smartly, and with as much laughter as strength; and when it comes to be a case of knowing people, I hold for my part, simple and sinner as I am, that there is no enchantment about it at all, but a great deal of bruising and bad luck.\u201d \u201cWell, well, God will give a remedy,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201chand me my clothes and let me go out, for I want to see these transformations and things thou speakest of.\u201d Sancho fetched him his clothes; and while he was dressing, the curate gave Don Fernando and the others present an account of Don Quixote\u2019s madness and of the stratagem they had made use of to withdraw him from that Pena Pobre where he fancied himself stationed because of his lady\u2019s scorn.", " For his imagination was so wrought upon by the adventure he was going to accomplish, that it made him dream he had already reached the kingdom of Micomicon, and was engaged in combat with his enemy; and believing he was laying on the giant, he had given so many sword cuts to the skins that the whole room was full of wine. On seeing this the landlord was so enraged that he fell on Don Quixote, and with his clenched fist began to pummel him in such a way, that if Cardenio and the curate had not dragged him off, he would have brought the war of the giant to an end. But in spite of all the poor gentleman never woke until the barber brought a great pot of cold water from the well and flung it with one dash all over his body, on which Don Quixote woke up, but not so completely as to understand what was the matter. Dorothea, seeing how short and slight his attire was, would not go in to witness the battle between her champion and her opponent. As for Sancho, he went searching all over the floor for the head of the giant, and not finding it he said, \u201cI see now that it\u2019s all enchantment in this house; for the last time, on this very spot where I am now, I got ever so many thumps without knowing who gave them to me, or being able to see anybody; and now this head is not to be seen anywhere about, though I saw it cut off with my own eyes and the blood running from the body as if from a fountain.\u201d \u201cWhat blood and fountains are you talking about, enemy of God and his saints?\u201d said the landlord.", " I wish I saw his own blood spilt! But let him not deceive himself, for, by the bones of my father and the shade of my mother, they shall pay me down every quarts; or my name is not what it is, and I am not my father\u2019s daughter.\u201d All this and more to the same effect the landlady delivered with great irritation, and her good maid Maritornes backed her up, while the daughter held her peace and smiled from time to time. The curate smoothed matters by promising to make good all losses to the best of his power, not only as regarded the wine-skins but also the wine, and above all the depreciation of the tail which they set such store by. Dorothea comforted Sancho, telling him that she pledged herself, as soon as it should appear certain that his master had decapitated the giant, and she found herself peacefully established in her kingdom, to bestow upon him the best county there was in it. With this Sancho consoled himself, and assured the princess she might rely upon it that he had seen the head of the giant, and more by token it had a beard that reached to the girdle, and that if it was not to be seen now it was because everything that happened in that house went by enchantment, as he himself had proved the last time he had lodged there. Dorothea said she fully believed it, and that he need not be uneasy, for all would go well and turn out as he wished. All therefore being appeased, the curate was anxious to go on with the novel, as he saw there was but little more left to read.", " \u201cAre you in your senses, Sancho? How the devil can it be as you say, when the giant is two thousand leagues away?\u201d Here they heard a loud noise in the chamber, and Don Quixote shouting out, \u201cStand, thief, brigand, villain; now I have got thee, and thy scimitar shall not avail thee!\u201d And then it seemed as though he were slashing vigorously at the wall. \u201cDon\u2019t stop to listen,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cbut go in and part them or help my master: though there is no need of that now, for no doubt the giant is dead by this time and giving account to God of his past wicked life; for I saw the blood flowing on the ground, and the head cut off and fallen on one side, and it is as big as a large wine-skin.\u201d \u201cMay I die,\u201d said the landlord at this, \u201cif Don Quixote or Don Devil has not been slashing some of the skins of red wine that stand full at his bed\u2019s head, and the spilt wine must be what this good fellow takes for blood;\u201d and so saying he went into the room and the rest after him, and there they found Don Quixote in the strangest costume in the world. He was in his shirt, which was not long enough in front to cover his thighs completely and was six fingers shorter behind; his legs were very long and lean, covered with hair, and anything but clean; on his head he had a little greasy red cap that belonged to the host, round his left arm he had rolled the blanket of the bed, to which Sancho, for reasons best known to himself, owed a grudge, and in his right hand he held his unsheathed sword, with which he was slashing about on all sides, uttering exclamations as if he were actually fighting some giant: and the best of it was his eyes were not open, for he was fast asleep, and dreaming that he was doing battle with the giant."], "Who does Don Quixote encounter that tells Quixote not to interfere in his business again?": [" And you, secretary, answer my lord the duke and tell him that all his commands shall be obeyed to the letter, as he directs; and say from me to my lady the duchess that I kiss her hands, and that I beg of her not to forget to send my letter and bundle to my wife Teresa Panza by a messenger; and I will take it as a great favour and will not fail to serve her in all that may lie within my power; and as you are about it you may enclose a kiss of the hand to my master Don Quixote that he may see I am grateful bread; and as a good secretary and a good Biscayan you may add whatever you like and whatever will come in best; and now take away this cloth and give me something to eat, and I\u2019ll be ready to meet all the spies and assassins and enchanters that may come against me or my island.\u201d At this instant a page entered saying, \u201cHere is a farmer on business, who wants to speak to your lordship on a matter of great importance, he says.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very odd,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cthe ways of these men on business; is it possible they can be such fools as not to see that an hour like this is no hour for coming on business? We who govern and we who are judges\u2014are we not men of flesh and blood, and are we not to be allowed the time required for taking rest, unless they\u2019d have us made of marble? By God and on my conscience, if the government remains in my hands (which I have a notion it won\u2019t), I\u2019ll bring more than one man on business to order.", " On the other hand, it is clear that there are many who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it, so far at least as differences of idiom and circumstances permit, and who will give a preference to the conscientious translator, even though he may have acquitted himself somewhat awkwardly. But after all there is no real antagonism between the two classes; there is no reason why what pleases the one should not please the other, or why a translator who makes it his aim to treat \u201cDon Quixote\u201d with the respect due to a great classic, should not be as acceptable even to the careless reader as the one who treats it as a famous old jest-book. It is not a question of caviare to the general, or, if it is, the fault rests with him who makes so. The method by which Cervantes won the ear of the Spanish people ought, mutatis mutandis, to be equally effective with the great majority of English readers. At any rate, even if there are readers to whom it is a matter of indifference, fidelity to the method is as much a part of the translator\u2019s duty as fidelity to the matter. If he can please all parties, so much the better; but his first duty is to those who look to him for as faithful a representation of his author as it is in his power to give them, faithful to the letter so long as fidelity is practicable, faithful to the spirit so far as he can make it. My purpose here is not to dogmatise on the rules of translation, but to indicate those I have followed, or at least tried to the best of my ability to follow, in the present instance.", " He crossed the courtyard at a walk, and coming to where the duennas were placed stopped to look at her who demanded him for a husband; the marshal of the field summoned Don Quixote, who had already presented himself in the courtyard, and standing by the side of Tosilos he addressed the duennas, and asked them if they consented that Don Quixote of La Mancha should do battle for their right. They said they did, and that whatever he should do in that behalf they declared rightly done, final and valid. By this time the duke and duchess had taken their places in a gallery commanding the enclosure, which was filled to overflowing with a multitude of people eager to see this perilous and unparalleled encounter. The conditions of the combat were that if Don Quixote proved the victor his antagonist was to marry the daughter of Do\u00f1a Rodriguez; but if he should be vanquished his opponent was released from the promise that was claimed against him and from all obligations to give satisfaction. The master of the ceremonies apportioned the sun to them, and stationed them, each on the spot where he was to stand. The drums beat, the sound of the trumpets filled the air, the earth trembled under foot, the hearts of the gazing crowd were full of anxiety, some hoping for a happy issue, some apprehensive of an untoward ending to the affair, and lastly, Don Quixote, commending himself with all his heart to God our Lord and to the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, stood waiting for them to give the necessary signal for the onset.", " \u201cWhat, seen her!\u201d said Sancho; \u201cwhy, who the devil was it but myself that first thought of the enchantment business? She is as much enchanted as my father.\u201d The ecclesiastic, when he heard them talking of giants and caitiffs and enchantments, began to suspect that this must be Don Quixote of La Mancha, whose story the duke was always reading; and he had himself often reproved him for it, telling him it was foolish to read such fooleries; and becoming convinced that his suspicion was correct, addressing the duke, he said very angrily to him, \u201cSe\u00f1or, your excellence will have to give account to God for what this good man does. This Don Quixote, or Don Simpleton, or whatever his name is, cannot, I imagine, be such a blockhead as your excellence would have him, holding out encouragement to him to go on with his vagaries and follies.\u201d Then turning to address Don Quixote he said, \u201cAnd you, num-skull, who put it into your head that you are a knight-errant, and vanquish giants and capture miscreants? Go your ways in a good hour, and in a good hour be it said to you. Go home and bring up your children if you have any, and attend to your business, and give over going wandering about the world, gaping and making a laughing-stock of yourself to all who know you and all who don\u2019t. Where, in heaven\u2019s name, have you discovered that there are or ever were knights-errant? Where are there giants in Spain or miscreants in La Mancha, or enchanted Dulcineas, or all the rest of the silly things they tell about you?\u201d Don Quixote listened attentively to the reverend gentleman\u2019s words, and as soon as he perceived he had done speaking, regardless of the presence of the duke and duchess, he sprang to his feet with angry looks and an agitated countenance, and said\u2014But the reply deserves a chapter to itself."], "What do the priest and the barber want to do with the inn\u2019s collection of chivalric romances?": [" Don Quixote said he would, so they made up a tolerable one for him in the same garret as before; and he lay down at once, being sorely shaken and in want of sleep. No sooner was the door shut upon him than the landlady made at the barber, and seizing him by the beard, said: \u201cBy my faith you are not going to make a beard of my tail any longer; you must give me back my tail, for it is a shame the way that thing of my husband\u2019s goes tossing about on the floor; I mean the comb that I used to stick in my good tail.\u201d But for all she tugged at it the barber would not give it up until the licentiate told him to let her have it, as there was now no further occasion for that stratagem, because he might declare himself and appear in his own character, and tell Don Quixote that he had fled to this inn when those thieves the galley slaves robbed him; and should he ask for the princess\u2019s squire, they could tell him that she had sent him on before her to give notice to the people of her kingdom that she was coming, and bringing with her the deliverer of them all. On this the barber cheerfully restored the tail to the landlady, and at the same time they returned all the accessories they had borrowed to effect Don Quixote\u2019s deliverance. All the people of the inn were struck with astonishment at the beauty of Dorothea, and even at the comely figure of the shepherd Cardenio. The curate made them get ready such fare as there was in the inn, and the landlord, in hope of better payment, served them up a tolerably good dinner.", " He is a much more important and prominent figure in the Second Part than in the First; indeed, it is his matchless mendacity about Dulcinea that to a great extent supplies the action of the story. His development in this respect is as remarkable as in any other. In the First Part he displays a great natural gift of lying. His lies are not of the highly imaginative sort that liars in fiction commonly indulge in; like Falstaff\u2019s, they resemble the father that begets them; they are simple, homely, plump lies; plain working lies, in short. But in the service of such a master as Don Quixote he develops rapidly, as we see when he comes to palm off the three country wenches as Dulcinea and her ladies in waiting. It is worth noticing how, flushed by his success in this instance, he is tempted afterwards to try a flight beyond his powers in his account of the journey on Clavile\u00f1o. In the Second Part it is the spirit rather than the incidents of the chivalry romances that is the subject of the burlesque. Enchantments of the sort travestied in those of Dulcinea and the Trifaldi and the cave of Montesinos play a leading part in the later and inferior romances, and another distinguishing feature is caricatured in Don Quixote\u2019s blind adoration of Dulcinea. In the romances of chivalry love is either a mere animalism or a fantastic idolatry. Only a coarse-minded man would care to make merry with the former, but to one of Cervantes\u2019 humour the latter was naturally an attractive subject for ridicule.", " But to suppose Cervantes deliberately setting himself to expound any such idea in two stout quarto volumes is to suppose something not only very unlike the age in which he lived, but altogether unlike Cervantes himself, who would have been the first to laugh at an attempt of the sort made by anyone else. The extraordinary influence of the romances of chivalry in his day is quite enough to account for the genesis of the book. Some idea of the prodigious development of this branch of literature in the sixteenth century may be obtained from the scrutiny of Chapter VII, if the reader bears in mind that only a portion of the romances belonging to by far the largest group are enumerated. As to its effect upon the nation, there is abundant evidence. From the time when the Amadises and Palmerins began to grow popular down to the very end of the century, there is a steady stream of invective, from men whose character and position lend weight to their words, against the romances of chivalry and the infatuation of their readers. Ridicule was the only besom to sweep away that dust. That this was the task Cervantes set himself, and that he had ample provocation to urge him to it, will be sufficiently clear to those who look into the evidence; as it will be also that it was not chivalry itself that he attacked and swept away. Of all the absurdities that, thanks to poetry, will be repeated to the end of time, there is no greater one than saying that \u201cCervantes smiled Spain\u2019s chivalry away.\u201d In the first place there was no chivalry for him to smile away.", " IN WHICH THE DOUBTFUL QUESTION OF MAMBRINO\u2019S HELMET AND THE PACK-SADDLE IS FINALLY SETTLED, WITH OTHER ADVENTURES THAT OCCURRED IN TRUTH AND EARNEST c45a.jpg (154K) Full Size \u201cWhat do you think now, gentlemen,\u201d said the barber, \u201cof what these gentles say, when they want to make out that this is a helmet?\u201d \u201cAnd whoever says the contrary,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cI will let him know he lies if he is a knight, and if he is a squire that he lies again a thousand times.\u201d Our own barber, who was present at all this, and understood Don Quixote\u2019s humour so thoroughly, took it into his head to back up his delusion and carry on the joke for the general amusement; so addressing the other barber he said: \u201cSe\u00f1or barber, or whatever you are, you must know that I belong to your profession too, and have had a licence to practise for more than twenty years, and I know the implements of the barber craft, every one of them, perfectly well; and I was likewise a soldier for some time in the days of my youth, and I know also what a helmet is, and a morion, and a headpiece with a visor, and other things pertaining to soldiering, I meant to say to soldiers\u2019 arms; and I say\u2014saving better opinions and always with submission to sounder judgments\u2014that this piece we have now before us, which this worthy gentleman has in his hands, not only is no barber\u2019s basin, but is as far from being one as white is from black, and truth from falsehood; I say, moreover, that this, although it is a helmet, is not a complete helmet.\u201d \u201cCertainly not,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cfor half of it is wanting, that is to say the beaver.\u201d \u201cIt is quite true,\u201d said the curate, who saw the object of his friend the barber; and Cardenio, Don Fernando and his companions agreed with him, and even the Judge, if his thoughts had not been so full of Don Luis\u2019s affair, would have helped to carry on the joke; but he was so taken up with the serious matters he had on his mind that he paid little or no attention to these facetious proceedings."], "In the manuscript that the priest reads at the inn, what does Anselmo test Camilla for?": [" Anselmo embraced him warmly and affectionately, and thanked him for his offer as if he had bestowed some great favour upon him; and it was agreed between them to set about it the next day, Anselmo affording opportunity and time to Lothario to converse alone with Camilla, and furnishing him with money and jewels to offer and present to her. He suggested, too, that he should treat her to music, and write verses in her praise, and if he was unwilling to take the trouble of composing them, he offered to do it himself. Lothario agreed to all with an intention very different from what Anselmo supposed, and with this understanding they returned to Anselmo\u2019s house, where they found Camilla awaiting her husband anxiously and uneasily, for he was later than usual in returning that day. Lothario repaired to his own house, and Anselmo remained in his, as well satisfied as Lothario was troubled in mind; for he could see no satisfactory way out of this ill-advised business. That night, however, he thought of a plan by which he might deceive Anselmo without any injury to Camilla. The next day he went to dine with his friend, and was welcomed by Camilla, who received and treated him with great cordiality, knowing the affection her husband felt for him. When dinner was over and the cloth removed, Anselmo told Lothario to stay there with Camilla while he attended to some pressing business, as he would return in an hour and a half.", " But the influence which the many virtues of Camilla exerted in imposing silence on Lothario\u2019s tongue proved mischievous for both of them, for if his tongue was silent his thoughts were busy, and could dwell at leisure upon the perfections of Camilla\u2019s goodness and beauty one by one, charms enough to warm with love a marble statue, not to say a heart of flesh. Lothario gazed upon her when he might have been speaking to her, and thought how worthy of being loved she was; and thus reflection began little by little to assail his allegiance to Anselmo, and a thousand times he thought of withdrawing from the city and going where Anselmo should never see him nor he see Camilla. But already the delight he found in gazing on her interposed and held him fast. He put a constraint upon himself, and struggled to repel and repress the pleasure he found in contemplating Camilla; when alone he blamed himself for his weakness, called himself a bad friend, nay a bad Christian; then he argued the matter and compared himself with Anselmo; always coming to the conclusion that the folly and rashness of Anselmo had been worse than his faithlessness, and that if he could excuse his intentions as easily before God as with man, he had no reason to fear any punishment for his offence. In short the beauty and goodness of Camilla, joined with the opportunity which the blind husband had placed in his hands, overthrew the loyalty of Lothario; and giving heed to nothing save the object towards which his inclinations led him, after Anselmo had been three days absent, during which he had been carrying on a continual struggle with his passion, he began to make love to Camilla with so much vehemence and warmth of language that she was overwhelmed with amazement, and could only rise from her place and retire to her room without answering him a word.", " Camilla begged him not to go, and Lothario offered to accompany him, but nothing could persuade Anselmo, who on the contrary pressed Lothario to remain waiting for him as he had a matter of great importance to discuss with him. At the same time he bade Camilla not to leave Lothario alone until he came back. In short he contrived to put so good a face on the reason, or the folly, of his absence that no one could have suspected it was a pretence. Anselmo took his departure, and Camilla and Lothario were left alone at the table, for the rest of the household had gone to dinner. Lothario saw himself in the lists according to his friend\u2019s wish, and facing an enemy that could by her beauty alone vanquish a squadron of armed knights; judge whether he had good reason to fear; but what he did was to lean his elbow on the arm of the chair, and his cheek upon his hand, and, asking Camilla\u2019s pardon for his ill manners, he said he wished to take a little sleep until Anselmo returned. Camilla in reply said he could repose more at his ease in the reception-room than in his chair, and begged of him to go in and sleep there; but Lothario declined, and there he remained asleep until the return of Anselmo, who finding Camilla in her own room, and Lothario asleep, imagined that he had stayed away so long as to have afforded them time enough for conversation and even for sleep, and was all impatience until Lothario should wake up, that he might go out with him and question him as to his success.", " Camilla was distressed, as a discreet and right-minded woman would be, at the orders her husband left her, and bade him remember that it was not becoming that anyone should occupy his seat at the table during his absence, and if he acted thus from not feeling confidence that she would be able to manage his house, let him try her this time, and he would find by experience that she was equal to greater responsibilities. Anselmo replied that it was his pleasure to have it so, and that she had only to submit and obey. Camilla said she would do so, though against her will. Anselmo went, and the next day Lothario came to his house, where he was received by Camilla with a friendly and modest welcome; but she never suffered Lothario to see her alone, for she was always attended by her men and women servants, especially by a handmaid of hers, Leonela by name, to whom she was much attached (for they had been brought up together from childhood in her father\u2019s house), and whom she had kept with her after her marriage with Anselmo. The first three days Lothario did not speak to her, though he might have done so when they removed the cloth and the servants retired to dine hastily; for such were Camilla\u2019s orders; nay more, Leonela had directions to dine earlier than Camilla and never to leave her side. She, however, having her thoughts fixed upon other things more to her taste, and wanting that time and opportunity for her own pleasures, did not always obey her mistress\u2019s commands, but on the contrary left them alone, as if they had ordered her to do so; but the modest bearing of Camilla, the calmness of her countenance, the composure of her aspect were enough to bridle the tongue of Lothario."], "In the manuscript that the priest reads at the inn, what motivates Lothario to tell Anselmo about Camilla\u2019s infidelity?": [" Camilla begged him not to go, and Lothario offered to accompany him, but nothing could persuade Anselmo, who on the contrary pressed Lothario to remain waiting for him as he had a matter of great importance to discuss with him.

Do thou tell Camilla what thou hast proposed about a pretended amour of mine; as for the verses I will make them, and if not as good as the subject deserves, they shall be at least the best I can produce.\u201d An agreement to this effect was made between the friends, the ill-advised one and the treacherous, and Anselmo returning to his house asked Camilla the question she already wondered he had not asked before\u2014what it was that had caused her to write the letter she had sent him. Camilla replied that it had seemed to her that Lothario looked at her somewhat more freely than when he had been at home; but that now she was undeceived and believed it to have been only her own imagination, for Lothario now avoided seeing her, or being alone with her. Anselmo told her she might be quite easy on the score of that suspicion, for he knew that Lothario was in love with a damsel of rank in the city whom he celebrated under the name of Chloris, and that even if he were not, his fidelity and their great friendship left no room for fear. Had not Camilla, however, been informed beforehand by Lothario that this love for Chloris was a pretence, and that he himself had told Anselmo of it in order to be able sometimes to give utterance to the praises of Camilla herself, no doubt she would have fallen into the despairing toils of jealousy; but being forewarned she received the startling news without uneasiness.", " IN WHICH IS RELATED THE NOVEL OF \u201cTHE ILL-ADVISED CURIOSITY\u201d In Florence, a rich and famous city of Italy in the province called Tuscany, there lived two gentlemen of wealth and quality, Anselmo and Lothario, such great friends that by way of distinction they were called by all that knew them \u201cThe Two Friends.\u201d They were unmarried, young, of the same age and of the same tastes, which was enough to account for the reciprocal friendship between them.

I have been just now watching through this keyhole, and I have seen that thou hast not said a word to Camilla, whence I conclude that on the former occasions thou hast not spoken to her either, and if this be so, as no doubt it is, why dost thou deceive me, or wherefore seekest thou by craft to deprive me of the means I might find of attaining my desire?\u201d Anselmo said no more, but he had said enough to cover Lothario with shame and confusion, and he, feeling as it were his honour touched by having been detected in a lie, swore to Anselmo that he would from that moment devote himself to satisfying him without any deception, as he would see if he had the curiosity to watch; though he need not take the trouble, for the pains he would take to satisfy him would remove all suspicions from his mind. Anselmo believed him, and to afford him an opportunity more free and less liable to surprise, he resolved to absent himself from his house for eight days, betaking himself to that of a friend of his who lived in a village not far from the city; and, the better to account for his departure to Camilla, he so arranged it that the friend should send him a very pressing invitation.", " IN WHICH IS RELATED THE NOVEL OF \u201cTHE ILL-ADVISED CURIOSITY\u201d In Florence, a rich and famous city of Italy in the province called Tuscany, there lived two gentlemen of wealth and quality, Anselmo and Lothario, such great friends that by way of distinction they were called by all that knew them \u201cThe Two Friends.\u201d They were unmarried, young, of the same age and of the same tastes, which was enough to account for the reciprocal friendship between them.

The citizen replied, \u201cThe strangest that have been heard for many a day; for it is reported abroad that Lothario, the great friend of the wealthy Anselmo, who lived at San Giovanni, carried off last night Camilla, the wife of Anselmo, who also has disappeared. All this has been told by a maid-servant of Camilla\u2019s, whom the governor found last night lowering herself by a sheet from the windows of Anselmo\u2019s house. I know not indeed, precisely, how the affair came to pass; all I know is that the whole city is wondering at the occurrence, for no one could have expected a thing of the kind, seeing the great and intimate friendship that existed between them, so great, they say, that they were called \u2018The Two Friends.\u2019\u201d \u201cIs it known at all,\u201d said Anselmo, \u201cwhat road Lothario and Camilla took?\u201d \u201cNot in the least,\u201d said the citizen, \u201cthough the governor has been very active in searching for them.\u201d \u201cGod speed you, se\u00f1or,\u201d said Anselmo."], "When Ferdinand and Dorothea reunite, and Cardenio and Lucinda reunite, who alone weeps for grief rather than joy?": [" The gentleman grasped her firmly by the shoulders, and being so fully occupied with holding her back, he was unable to put a hand to his veil which was falling off, as it did at length entirely, and Dorothea, who was holding the lady in her arms, raising her eyes saw that he who likewise held her was her husband, Don Fernando. The instant she recognised him, with a prolonged plaintive cry drawn from the depths of her heart, she fell backwards fainting, and but for the barber being close by to catch her in his arms, she would have fallen completely to the ground. The curate at once hastened to uncover her face and throw water on it, and as he did so Don Fernando, for he it was who held the other in his arms, recognised her and stood as if death-stricken by the sight; not, however, relaxing his grasp of Luscinda, for it was she that was struggling to release herself from his hold, having recognised Cardenio by his voice, as he had recognised her. Cardenio also heard Dorothea\u2019s cry as she fell fainting, and imagining that it came from his Luscinda burst forth in terror from the room, and the first thing he saw was Don Fernando with Luscinda in his arms. Don Fernando, too, knew Cardenio at once; and all three, Luscinda, Cardenio, and Dorothea, stood in silent amazement scarcely knowing what had happened to them. They gazed at one another without speaking, Dorothea at Don Fernando, Don Fernando at Cardenio, Cardenio at Luscinda, and Luscinda at Cardenio.", " Not so Luscinda, and Cardenio, and almost all the others, for they shed so many tears, some in their own happiness, some at that of the others, that one would have supposed a heavy calamity had fallen upon them all. Even Sancho Panza was weeping; though afterwards he said he only wept because he saw that Dorothea was not as he fancied the queen Micomicona, of whom he expected such great favours. Their wonder as well as their weeping lasted some time, and then Cardenio and Luscinda went and fell on their knees before Don Fernando, returning him thanks for the favour he had rendered them in language so grateful that he knew not how to answer them, and raising them up embraced them with every mark of affection and courtesy. He then asked Dorothea how she had managed to reach a place so far removed from her own home, and she in a few fitting words told all that she had previously related to Cardenio, with which Don Fernando and his companions were so delighted that they wished the story had been longer; so charmingly did Dorothea describe her misadventures. When she had finished Don Fernando recounted what had befallen him in the city after he had found in Luscinda\u2019s bosom the paper in which she declared that she was Cardenio\u2019s wife, and never could be his. He said he meant to kill her, and would have done so had he not been prevented by her parents, and that he quitted the house full of rage and shame, and resolved to avenge himself when a more convenient opportunity should offer.", " And as we have this consolation springing from no very visionary hope or wild fancy, I entreat you, se\u00f1ora, to form new resolutions in your better mind, as I mean to do in mine, preparing yourself to look forward to happier fortunes; for I swear to you by the faith of a gentleman and a Christian not to desert you until I see you in possession of Don Fernando, and if I cannot by words induce him to recognise his obligation to you, in that case to avail myself of the right which my rank as a gentleman gives me, and with just cause challenge him on account of the injury he has done you, not regarding my own wrongs, which I shall leave to Heaven to avenge, while I on earth devote myself to yours.\u201d Cardenio\u2019s words completed the astonishment of Dorothea, and not knowing how to return thanks for such an offer, she attempted to kiss his feet; but Cardenio would not permit it, and the licentiate replied for both, commended the sound reasoning of Cardenio, and lastly, begged, advised, and urged them to come with him to his village, where they might furnish themselves with what they needed, and take measures to discover Don Fernando, or restore Dorothea to her parents, or do what seemed to them most advisable. Cardenio and Dorothea thanked him, and accepted the kind offer he made them; and the barber, who had been listening to all attentively and in silence, on his part some kindly words also, and with no less good-will than the curate offered his services in any way that might be of use to them.", " He described to them also nearly all the adventures that Sancho had mentioned, at which they marvelled and laughed not a little, thinking it, as all did, the strangest form of madness a crazy intellect could be capable of. But now, the curate said, that the lady Dorothea\u2019s good fortune prevented her from proceeding with their purpose, it would be necessary to devise or discover some other way of getting him home. Cardenio proposed to carry out the scheme they had begun, and suggested that Luscinda would act and support Dorothea\u2019s part sufficiently well. \u201cNo,\u201d said Don Fernando, \u201cthat must not be, for I want Dorothea to follow out this idea of hers; and if the worthy gentleman\u2019s village is not very far off, I shall be happy if I can do anything for his relief.\u201d \u201cIt is not more than two days\u2019 journey from this,\u201d said the curate. \u201cEven if it were more,\u201d said Don Fernando, \u201cI would gladly travel so far for the sake of doing so good a work.\u201d At this moment Don Quixote came out in full panoply, with Mambrino\u2019s helmet, all dinted as it was, on his head, his buckler on his arm, and leaning on his staff or pike. The strange figure he presented filled Don Fernando and the rest with amazement as they contemplated his lean yellow face half a league long, his armour of all sorts, and the solemnity of his deportment. They stood silent waiting to see what he would say, and he, fixing his eyes on the fair Dorothea, addressed her with great gravity and composure: \u201cI am informed, fair lady, by my squire here that your greatness has been annihilated and your being abolished, since, from a queen and lady of high degree as you used to be, you have been turned into a private maiden."], "Upon the arrival of Zoraida and the captive, what lecture does Don Quixote give to the rest of the inn?": [" Don Fernando asked the captive what her name was, and he replied that it was Lela Zoraida; but the instant she heard him, she guessed what the Christian had asked, and said hastily, with some displeasure and energy, \u201cNo, not Zoraida; Maria, Maria!\u201d giving them to understand that she was called \u201cMaria\u201d and not \u201cZoraida.\u201d These words, and the touching earnestness with which she uttered them, drew more than one tear from some of the listeners, particularly the women, who are by nature tender-hearted and compassionate. Luscinda embraced her affectionately, saying, \u201cYes, yes, Maria, Maria,\u201d to which the Moor replied, \u201cYes, yes, Maria; Zoraida macange,\u201d which means \u201cnot Zoraida.\u201d Night was now approaching, and by the orders of those who accompanied Don Fernando the landlord had taken care and pains to prepare for them the best supper that was in his power. The hour therefore having arrived they all took their seats at a long table like a refectory one, for round or square table there was none in the inn, and the seat of honour at the head of it, though he was for refusing it, they assigned to Don Quixote, who desired the lady Micomicona to place herself by his side, as he was her protector. Luscinda and Zoraida took their places next her, opposite to them were Don Fernando and Cardenio, and next the captive and the other gentlemen, and by the side of the ladies, the curate and the barber.", " \u201cTo-morrow, I think,\u201d said I, \u201cfor there is a vessel here from France which sails to-morrow, and I think I shall go in her.\u201d \u201cWould it not be better,\u201d said Zoraida, \u201cto wait for the arrival of ships from Spain and go with them and not with the French who are not your friends?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said I; \u201cthough if there were intelligence that a vessel were now coming from Spain it is true I might, perhaps, wait for it; however, it is more likely I shall depart to-morrow, for the longing I feel to return to my country and to those I love is so great that it will not allow me to wait for another opportunity, however more convenient, if it be delayed.\u201d \u201cNo doubt thou art married in thine own country,\u201d said Zoraida, \u201cand for that reason thou art anxious to go and see thy wife.\u201d \u201cI am not married,\u201d I replied, \u201cbut I have given my promise to marry on my arrival there.\u201d \u201cAnd is the lady beautiful to whom thou hast given it?\u201d said Zoraida. \u201cSo beautiful,\u201d said I, \u201cthat, to describe her worthily and tell thee the truth, she is very like thee.\u201d At this her father laughed very heartily and said, \u201cBy Allah, Christian, she must be very beautiful if she is like my daughter, who is the most beautiful woman in all this kingdom: only look at her well and thou wilt see I am telling the truth.\u201d Zoraida\u2019s father as the better linguist helped to interpret most of these words and phrases, for though she spoke the bastard language, that, as I have said, is employed there, she expressed her meaning more by signs than by words.", " But Heaven\u2019s will be done; if I succeed in my attempt I shall be all the more honoured, as I have faced greater dangers than the knights-errant of yore exposed themselves to.\u201d All this lengthy discourse Don Quixote delivered while the others supped, forgetting to raise a morsel to his lips, though Sancho more than once told him to eat his supper, as he would have time enough afterwards to say all he wanted. It excited fresh pity in those who had heard him to see a man of apparently sound sense, and with rational views on every subject he discussed, so hopelessly wanting in all, when his wretched unlucky chivalry was in question. The curate told him he was quite right in all he had said in favour of arms, and that he himself, though a man of letters and a graduate, was of the same opinion. They finished their supper, the cloth was removed, and while the hostess, her daughter, and Maritornes were getting Don Quixote of La Mancha\u2019s garret ready, in which it was arranged that the women were to be quartered by themselves for the night, Don Fernando begged the captive to tell them the story of his life, for it could not fail to be strange and interesting, to judge by the hints he had let fall on his arrival in company with Zoraida. To this the captive replied that he would very willingly yield to his request, only he feared his tale would not give them as much pleasure as he wished; nevertheless, not to be wanting in compliance, he would tell it.", " In particular Don Fernando offered, if he would go back with him, to get his brother the marquis to become godfather at the baptism of Zoraida, and on his own part to provide him with the means of making his appearance in his own country with the credit and comfort he was entitled to. For all this the captive returned thanks very courteously, although he would not accept any of their generous offers. By this time night closed in, and as it did, there came up to the inn a coach attended by some men on horseback, who demanded accommodation; to which the landlady replied that there was not a hand\u2019s breadth of the whole inn unoccupied. \u201cStill, for all that,\u201d said one of those who had entered on horseback, \u201croom must be found for his lordship the Judge here.\u201d At this name the landlady was taken aback, and said, \u201cSe\u00f1or, the fact is I have no beds; but if his lordship the Judge carries one with him, as no doubt he does, let him come in and welcome; for my husband and I will give up our room to accommodate his worship.\u201d \u201cVery good, so be it,\u201d said the squire; but in the meantime a man had got out of the coach whose dress indicated at a glance the office and post he held, for the long robe with ruffled sleeves that he wore showed that he was, as his servant said, a Judge of appeal. He led by the hand a young girl in a travelling dress, apparently about sixteen years of age, and of such a high-bred air, so beautiful and so graceful, that all were filled with admiration when she made her appearance, and but for having seen Dorothea, Luscinda, and Zoraida, who were there in the inn, they would have fancied that a beauty like that of this maiden\u2019s would have been hard to find."], "What career did the captive\u2019s father order him to pursue?": [" The instant the captive mentioned the name of Don Pedro de Aguilar, Don Fernando looked at his companions and they all three smiled; and when he came to speak of the sonnets one of them said, \u201cBefore your worship proceeds any further I entreat you to tell me what became of that Don Pedro de Aguilar you have spoken of.\u201d \u201cAll I know is,\u201d replied the captive, \u201cthat after having been in Constantinople two years, he escaped in the disguise of an Arnaut, in company with a Greek spy; but whether he regained his liberty or not I cannot tell, though I fancy he did, because a year afterwards I saw the Greek at Constantinople, though I was unable to ask him what the result of the journey was.\u201d \u201cWell then, you are right,\u201d returned the gentleman, \u201cfor that Don Pedro is my brother, and he is now in our village in good health, rich, married, and with three children.\u201d \u201cThanks be to God for all the mercies he has shown him,\u201d said the captive; \u201cfor to my mind there is no happiness on earth to compare with recovering lost liberty.\u201d \u201cAnd what is more,\u201d said the gentleman, \u201cI know the sonnets my brother made.\u201d \u201cThen let your worship repeat them,\u201d said the captive, \u201cfor you will recite them better than I can.\u201d \u201cWith all my heart,\u201d said the gentleman; \u201cthat on the Goletta runs thus.\u201d c39e.jpg (38K) CHAPTER XL. IN WHICH THE STORY OF THE CAPTIVE IS CONTINUED. c40a.jpg (131K) Full Size SONNET \u201cBlest souls, that, from this mortal husk set free, In guerdon of brave deeds beatified, Above this lowly orb of ours abide Made heirs of heaven and immortality, With noble rage and ardour glowing ye Your strength, while strength was yours, in battle plied, And with your own blood and the foeman\u2019s dyed The sandy soil and the encircling sea.", " Nor is it to be supposed from this that they are to omit commending themselves to God, for there will be time and opportunity for doing so while they are engaged in their task.\u201d \u201cFor all that,\u201d answered the traveller, \u201cI feel some doubt still, because often I have read how words will arise between two knights-errant, and from one thing to another it comes about that their anger kindles and they wheel their horses round and take a good stretch of field, and then without any more ado at the top of their speed they come to the charge, and in mid-career they are wont to commend themselves to their ladies; and what commonly comes of the encounter is that one falls over the haunches of his horse pierced through and through by his antagonist\u2019s lance, and as for the other, it is only by holding on to the mane of his horse that he can help falling to the ground; but I know not how the dead man had time to commend himself to God in the course of such rapid work as this; it would have been better if those words which he spent in commending himself to his lady in the midst of his career had been devoted to his duty and obligation as a Christian. Moreover, it is my belief that all knights-errant have not ladies to commend themselves to, for they are not all in love.\u201d \u201cThat is impossible,\u201d said Don Quixote: \u201cI say it is impossible that there could be a knight-errant without a lady, because to such it is as natural and proper to be in love as to the heavens to have stars: most certainly no history has been seen in which there is to be found a knight-errant without an amour, and for the simple reason that without one he would be held no legitimate knight but a bastard, and one who had gained entrance into the stronghold of the said knighthood, not by the door, but over the wall like a thief and a robber.\u201d \u201cNevertheless,\u201d said the traveller, \u201cif I remember rightly, I think I have read that Don Galaor, the brother of the valiant Amadis of Gaul, never had any special lady to whom he might commend himself, and yet he was not the less esteemed, and was a very stout and famous knight.\u201d To which our Don Quixote made answer, \u201cSir, one solitary swallow does not make summer; moreover, I know that knight was in secret very deeply in love; besides which, that way of falling in love with all that took his fancy was a natural propensity which he could not control.", " The curate, however, only went so far as to describe how the Frenchmen plundered those who were in the boat, and the poverty and distress in which his comrade and the fair Moor were left, of whom he said he had not been able to learn what became of them, or whether they had reached Spain, or been carried to France by the Frenchmen. The captain, standing a little to one side, was listening to all the curate said, and watching every movement of his brother, who, as soon as he perceived the curate had made an end of his story, gave a deep sigh and said with his eyes full of tears, \u201cOh, se\u00f1or, if you only knew what news you have given me and how it comes home to me, making me show how I feel it with these tears that spring from my eyes in spite of all my worldly wisdom and self-restraint! That brave captain that you speak of is my eldest brother, who, being of a bolder and loftier mind than my other brother or myself, chose the honourable and worthy calling of arms, which was one of the three careers our father proposed to us, as your comrade mentioned in that fable you thought he was telling you. I followed that of letters, in which God and my own exertions have raised me to the position in which you see me. My second brother is in Peru, so wealthy that with what he has sent to my father and to me he has fully repaid the portion he took with him, and has even furnished my father\u2019s hands with the means of gratifying his natural generosity, while I too have been enabled to pursue my studies in a more becoming and creditable fashion, and so to attain my present standing.", " \u201cThere has been no opportunity for that,\u201d replied the captive, \u201csince she left Algiers, her native country and home; and up to the present she has not found herself in any such imminent danger of death as to make it necessary to baptise her before she has been instructed in all the ceremonies our holy mother Church ordains; but, please God, ere long she shall be baptised with the solemnity befitting her which is higher than her dress or mine indicates.\u201d By these words he excited a desire in all who heard him, to know who the Moorish lady and the captive were, but no one liked to ask just then, seeing that it was a fitter moment for helping them to rest themselves than for questioning them about their lives. Dorothea took the Moorish lady by the hand and leading her to a seat beside herself, requested her to remove her veil. She looked at the captive as if to ask him what they meant and what she was to do. He said to her in Arabic that they asked her to take off her veil, and thereupon she removed it and disclosed a countenance so lovely, that to Dorothea she seemed more beautiful than Luscinda, and to Luscinda more beautiful than Dorothea, and all the bystanders felt that if any beauty could compare with theirs it was the Moorish lady\u2019s, and there were even those who were inclined to give it somewhat the preference. And as it is the privilege and charm of beauty to win the heart and secure good-will, all forthwith became eager to show kindness and attention to the lovely Moor."], "Where was the captive when Zoraida fell in love with him?": [" Don Fernando asked the captive what her name was, and he replied that it was Lela Zoraida; but the instant she heard him, she guessed what the Christian had asked, and said hastily, with some displeasure and energy, \u201cNo, not Zoraida; Maria, Maria!\u201d giving them to understand that she was called \u201cMaria\u201d and not \u201cZoraida.\u201d These words, and the touching earnestness with which she uttered them, drew more than one tear from some of the listeners, particularly the women, who are by nature tender-hearted and compassionate. Luscinda embraced her affectionately, saying, \u201cYes, yes, Maria, Maria,\u201d to which the Moor replied, \u201cYes, yes, Maria; Zoraida macange,\u201d which means \u201cnot Zoraida.\u201d Night was now approaching, and by the orders of those who accompanied Don Fernando the landlord had taken care and pains to prepare for them the best supper that was in his power. The hour therefore having arrived they all took their seats at a long table like a refectory one, for round or square table there was none in the inn, and the seat of honour at the head of it, though he was for refusing it, they assigned to Don Quixote, who desired the lady Micomicona to place herself by his side, as he was her protector. Luscinda and Zoraida took their places next her, opposite to them were Don Fernando and Cardenio, and next the captive and the other gentlemen, and by the side of the ladies, the curate and the barber.", " We went straight to the church to return thanks to God for the mercies we had received, and when Zoraida entered it she said there were faces there like Lela Marien\u2019s. We told her they were her images; and as well as he could the renegade explained to her what they meant, that she might adore them as if each of them were the very same Lela Marien that had spoken to her; and she, having great intelligence and a quick and clear instinct, understood at once all he said to her about them. Thence they took us away and distributed us all in different houses in the town; but as for the renegade, Zoraida, and myself, the Christian who came with us brought us to the house of his parents, who had a fair share of the gifts of fortune, and treated us with as much kindness as they did their own son. We remained six days in Velez, at the end of which the renegade, having informed himself of all that was requisite for him to do, set out for the city of Granada to restore himself to the sacred bosom of the Church through the medium of the Holy Inquisition. The other released captives took their departures, each the way that seemed best to him, and Zoraida and I were left alone, with nothing more than the crowns which the courtesy of the Frenchman had bestowed upon Zoraida, out of which I bought the beast on which she rides; and, I for the present attending her as her father and squire and not as her husband, we are now going to ascertain if my father is living, or if any of my brothers has had better fortune than mine has been; though, as Heaven has made me the companion of Zoraida, I think no other lot could be assigned to me, however happy, that I would rather have.", " \u201cTo-morrow, I think,\u201d said I, \u201cfor there is a vessel here from France which sails to-morrow, and I think I shall go in her.\u201d \u201cWould it not be better,\u201d said Zoraida, \u201cto wait for the arrival of ships from Spain and go with them and not with the French who are not your friends?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said I; \u201cthough if there were intelligence that a vessel were now coming from Spain it is true I might, perhaps, wait for it; however, it is more likely I shall depart to-morrow, for the longing I feel to return to my country and to those I love is so great that it will not allow me to wait for another opportunity, however more convenient, if it be delayed.\u201d \u201cNo doubt thou art married in thine own country,\u201d said Zoraida, \u201cand for that reason thou art anxious to go and see thy wife.\u201d \u201cI am not married,\u201d I replied, \u201cbut I have given my promise to marry on my arrival there.\u201d \u201cAnd is the lady beautiful to whom thou hast given it?\u201d said Zoraida. \u201cSo beautiful,\u201d said I, \u201cthat, to describe her worthily and tell thee the truth, she is very like thee.\u201d At this her father laughed very heartily and said, \u201cBy Allah, Christian, she must be very beautiful if she is like my daughter, who is the most beautiful woman in all this kingdom: only look at her well and thou wilt see I am telling the truth.\u201d Zoraida\u2019s father as the better linguist helped to interpret most of these words and phrases, for though she spoke the bastard language, that, as I have said, is employed there, she expressed her meaning more by signs than by words.", " The instant the captive mentioned the name of Don Pedro de Aguilar, Don Fernando looked at his companions and they all three smiled; and when he came to speak of the sonnets one of them said, \u201cBefore your worship proceeds any further I entreat you to tell me what became of that Don Pedro de Aguilar you have spoken of.\u201d \u201cAll I know is,\u201d replied the captive, \u201cthat after having been in Constantinople two years, he escaped in the disguise of an Arnaut, in company with a Greek spy; but whether he regained his liberty or not I cannot tell, though I fancy he did, because a year afterwards I saw the Greek at Constantinople, though I was unable to ask him what the result of the journey was.\u201d \u201cWell then, you are right,\u201d returned the gentleman, \u201cfor that Don Pedro is my brother, and he is now in our village in good health, rich, married, and with three children.\u201d \u201cThanks be to God for all the mercies he has shown him,\u201d said the captive; \u201cfor to my mind there is no happiness on earth to compare with recovering lost liberty.\u201d \u201cAnd what is more,\u201d said the gentleman, \u201cI know the sonnets my brother made.\u201d \u201cThen let your worship repeat them,\u201d said the captive, \u201cfor you will recite them better than I can.\u201d \u201cWith all my heart,\u201d said the gentleman; \u201cthat on the Goletta runs thus.\u201d c39e.jpg (38K) CHAPTER XL.

The captive, whose heart had leaped within him the instant he saw the Judge, telling him somehow that this was his brother, asked one of the servants who accompanied him what his name was, and whether he knew from what part of the country he came. The servant replied that he was called the Licentiate Juan Perez de Viedma, and that he had heard it said he came from a village in the mountains of Leon. From this statement, and what he himself had seen, he felt convinced that this was his brother who had adopted letters by his father\u2019s advice; and excited and rejoiced, he called Don Fernando and Cardenio and the curate aside, and told them how the matter stood, assuring them that the judge was his brother.", " Finding herself then in the presence of no more, the damsel went on to say, \u201cI am the daughter, sirs, of Pedro Perez Mazorca, the wool-farmer of this town, who is in the habit of coming very often to my father\u2019s house.\u201d \u201cThat won\u2019t do, se\u00f1ora,\u201d said the majordomo; \u201cfor I know Pedro Perez very well, and I know he has no child at all, either son or daughter; and besides, though you say he is your father, you add then that he comes very often to your father\u2019s house.\u201d \u201cI had already noticed that,\u201d said Sancho. \u201cI am confused just now, sirs,\u201d said the damsel, \u201cand I don\u2019t know what I am saying; but the truth is that I am the daughter of Diego de la Llana, whom you must all know.\u201d \u201cAy, that will do,\u201d said the majordomo; \u201cfor I know Diego de la Llana, and know that he is a gentleman of position and a rich man, and that he has a son and a daughter, and that since he was left a widower nobody in all this town can speak of having seen his daughter\u2019s face; for he keeps her so closely shut up that he does not give even the sun a chance of seeing her; and for all that report says she is extremely beautiful.\u201d \u201cIt is true,\u201d said the damsel, \u201cand I am that daughter; whether report lies or not as to my beauty, you, sirs, will have decided by this time, as you have seen me;\u201d and with this she began to weep bitterly. On seeing this the secretary leant over to the head-carver\u2019s ear, and said to him in a low voice, \u201cSomething serious has no doubt happened this poor maiden, that she goes wandering from home in such a dress and at such an hour, and one of her rank too.\u201d \u201cThere can be no doubt about it,\u201d returned the carver, \u201cand moreover her tears confirm your suspicion.\u201d Sancho gave her the best comfort he could, and entreated her to tell them without any fear what had happened her, as they would all earnestly and by every means in their power endeavour to relieve her.", " The ladies, then, having retired to their chamber, and the others having disposed themselves with as little discomfort as they could, Don Quixote sallied out of the inn to act as sentinel of the castle as he had promised. It happened, however, that a little before the approach of dawn a voice so musical and sweet reached the ears of the ladies that it forced them all to listen attentively, but especially Dorothea, who had been awake, and by whose side Do\u00f1a Clara de Viedma, for so the Judge\u2019s daughter was called, lay sleeping. No one could imagine who it was that sang so sweetly, and the voice was unaccompanied by any instrument. At one moment it seemed to them as if the singer were in the courtyard, at another in the stable; and as they were all attention, wondering, Cardenio came to the door and said, \u201cListen, whoever is not asleep, and you will hear a muleteer\u2019s voice that enchants as it chants.\u201d \u201cWe are listening to it already, se\u00f1or,\u201d said Dorothea; on which Cardenio went away; and Dorothea, giving all her attention to it, made out the words of the song to be these: c42e.jpg (11K) CHAPTER XLIII.

The captain was waiting to see what the curate would do, when the latter, taking him with the other hand, advanced with both of them to where the Judge and the other gentlemen were and said, \u201cLet your tears cease to flow, Se\u00f1or Judge, and the wish of your heart be gratified as fully as you could desire, for you have before you your worthy brother and your good sister-in-law. He whom you see here is the Captain Viedma, and this is the fair Moor who has been so good to him. The Frenchmen I told you of have reduced them to the state of poverty you see that you may show the generosity of your kind heart.\u201d The captain ran to embrace his brother, who placed both hands on his breast so as to have a good look at him, holding him a little way off but as soon as he had fully recognised him he clasped him in his arms so closely, shedding such tears of heartfelt joy, that most of those present could not but join in them. The words the brothers exchanged, the emotion they showed can scarcely be imagined, I fancy, much less put down in writing. They told each other in a few words the events of their lives; they showed the true affection of brothers in all its strength; then the judge embraced Zoraida, putting all he possessed at her disposal; then he made his daughter embrace her, and the fair Christian and the lovely Moor drew fresh tears from every eye."], "How does Don Quixote respond when a member of the Holy Brotherhood presents him with a warrant for his arrest?": [" As soon as he had satisfied himself, folding up the parchment, he took the warrant in his left hand and with his right seized Don Quixote by the collar so tightly that he did not allow him to breathe, and shouted aloud, \u201cHelp for the Holy Brotherhood! and that you may see I demand it in earnest, read this warrant which says this highwayman is to be arrested.\u201d The curate took the warrant and saw that what the officer said was true, and that it agreed with Don Quixote\u2019s appearance, who, on his part, when he found himself roughly handled by this rascally clown, worked up to the highest pitch of wrath, and all his joints cracking with rage, with both hands seized the officer by the throat with all his might, so that had he not been helped by his comrades he would have yielded up his life ere Don Quixote released his hold. The landlord, who had perforce to support his brother officers, ran at once to aid them. The landlady, when she saw her husband engaged in a fresh quarrel, lifted up her voice afresh, and its note was immediately caught up by Maritornes and her daughter, calling upon heaven and all present for help; and Sancho, seeing what was going on, exclaimed, \u201cBy the Lord, it is quite true what my master says about the enchantments of this castle, for it is impossible to live an hour in peace in it!\u201d Don Fernando parted the officer and Don Quixote, and to their mutual contentment made them relax the grip by which they held, the one the coat collar, the other the throat of his adversary; for all this, however, the officers did not cease to demand their prisoner and call on them to help, and deliver him over bound into their power, as was required for the service of the King and of the Holy Brotherhood, on whose behalf they again demanded aid and assistance to effect the capture of this robber and footpad of the highways.", " Thus by the authority of Agramante and the wisdom of King Sobrino all this complication of disputes was arranged; but the enemy of concord and hater of peace, feeling himself slighted and made a fool of, and seeing how little he had gained after having involved them all in such an elaborate entanglement, resolved to try his hand once more by stirring up fresh quarrels and disturbances. It came about in this wise: the officers were pacified on learning the rank of those with whom they had been engaged, and withdrew from the contest, considering that whatever the result might be they were likely to get the worst of the battle; but one of them, the one who had been thrashed and kicked by Don Fernando, recollected that among some warrants he carried for the arrest of certain delinquents, he had one against Don Quixote, whom the Holy Brotherhood had ordered to be arrested for setting the galley slaves free, as Sancho had, with very good reason, apprehended. Suspecting how it was, then, he wished to satisfy himself as to whether Don Quixote\u2019s features corresponded; and taking a parchment out of his bosom he lit upon what he was in search of, and setting himself to read it deliberately, for he was not a quick reader, as he made out each word he fixed his eyes on Don Quixote, and went on comparing the description in the warrant with his face, and discovered that beyond all doubt he was the person described in it.", " Sancho followed him at his ass\u2019s best trot, but Rocinante stepped out so that, seeing himself left behind, he was forced to call to his master to wait for him. Don Quixote did so, reining in Rocinante until his weary squire came up, who on reaching him said, \u201cIt seems to me, se\u00f1or, it would be prudent in us to go and take refuge in some church, for, seeing how mauled he with whom you fought has been left, it will be no wonder if they give information of the affair to the Holy Brotherhood and arrest us, and, faith, if they do, before we come out of gaol we shall have to sweat for it.\u201d \u201cPeace,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cwhere hast thou ever seen or heard that a knight-errant has been arraigned before a court of justice, however many homicides he may have committed?\u201d \u201cI know nothing about omecils,\u201d answered Sancho, \u201cnor in my life have had anything to do with one; I only know that the Holy Brotherhood looks after those who fight in the fields, and in that other matter I do not meddle.\u201d \u201cThen thou needst have no uneasiness, my friend,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cfor I will deliver thee out of the hands of the Chaldeans, much more out of those of the Brotherhood. But tell me, as thou livest, hast thou seen a more valiant knight than I in all the known world; hast thou read in history of any who has or had higher mettle in attack, more spirit in maintaining it, more dexterity in wounding or skill in overthrowing?\u201d \u201cThe truth is,\u201d answered Sancho, \u201cthat I have never read any history, for I can neither read nor write, but what I will venture to bet is that a more daring master than your worship I have never served in all the days of my life, and God grant that this daring be not paid for where I have said; what I beg of your worship is to dress your wound, for a great deal of blood flows from that ear, and I have here some lint and a little white ointment in the alforjas.\u201d \u201cAll that might be well dispensed with,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cif I had remembered to make a vial of the balsam of Fierabras, for time and medicine are saved by one single drop.\u201d \u201cWhat vial and what balsam is that?\u201d said Sancho Panza.", " What damsel was not enamoured of him and did not yield herself up wholly to his will and pleasure? And, lastly, what knight-errant has there been, is there, or will there ever be in the world, not bold enough to give, single-handed, four hundred cudgellings to four hundred officers of the Holy Brotherhood if they come in his way?\u201d CHAPTER XLVI. OF THE END OF THE NOTABLE ADVENTURE OF THE OFFICERS OF THE HOLY BROTHERHOOD; AND OF THE GREAT FEROCITY OF OUR WORTHY KNIGHT, DON QUIXOTE c46a.jpg (163K) Full Size While Don Quixote was talking in this strain, the curate was endeavouring to persuade the officers that he was out of his senses, as they might perceive by his deeds and his words, and that they need not press the matter any further, for even if they arrested him and carried him off, they would have to release him by-and-by as a madman; to which the holder of the warrant replied that he had nothing to do with inquiring into Don Quixote\u2019s madness, but only to execute his superior\u2019s orders, and that once taken they might let him go three hundred times if they liked. \u201cFor all that,\u201d said the curate, \u201cyou must not take him away this time, nor will he, it is my opinion, let himself be taken away.\u201d In short, the curate used such arguments, and Don Quixote did such mad things, that the officers would have been more mad than he was if they had not perceived his want of wits, and so they thought it best to allow themselves to be pacified, and even to act as peacemakers between the barber and Sancho Panza, who still continued their altercation with much bitterness."], "How do the priest and the barber go about bringing Don Quixote home without the help of Dorothea and Ferdinand?": [" Her husband Guillermo died of grief at the death of so good a wife, leaving his daughter Marcela, a child and rich, to the care of an uncle of hers, a priest and prebendary in our village. The girl grew up with such beauty that it reminded us of her mother\u2019s, which was very great, and yet it was thought that the daughter\u2019s would exceed it; and so when she reached the age of fourteen to fifteen years nobody beheld her but blessed God that had made her so beautiful, and the greater number were in love with her past redemption. Her uncle kept her in great seclusion and retirement, but for all that the fame of her great beauty spread so that, as well for it as for her great wealth, her uncle was asked, solicited, and importuned, to give her in marriage not only by those of our town but of those many leagues round, and by the persons of highest quality in them. But he, being a good Christian man, though he desired to give her in marriage at once, seeing her to be old enough, was unwilling to do so without her consent, not that he had any eye to the gain and profit which the custody of the girl\u2019s property brought him while he put off her marriage; and, faith, this was said in praise of the good priest in more than one set in the town. For I would have you know, Sir Errant, that in these little villages everything is talked about and everything is carped at, and rest assured, as I am, that the priest must be over and above good who forces his parishioners to speak well of him, especially in villages.\u201d \u201cThat is the truth,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cbut go on, for the story is very good, and you, good Pedro, tell it with very good grace.\u201d \u201cMay that of the Lord not be wanting to me,\u201d said Pedro; \u201cthat is the one to have.", " It only concerns them to aid them as persons in need of help, having regard to their sufferings and not to their rascalities. I encountered a chaplet or string of miserable and unfortunate people, and did for them what my sense of duty demands of me, and as for the rest be that as it may; and whoever takes objection to it, saving the sacred dignity of the se\u00f1or licentiate and his honoured person, I say he knows little about chivalry and lies like a whoreson villain, and this I will give him to know to the fullest extent with my sword;\u201d and so saying he settled himself in his stirrups and pressed down his morion; for the barber\u2019s basin, which according to him was Mambrino\u2019s helmet, he carried hanging at the saddle-bow until he could repair the damage done to it by the galley slaves. Dorothea, who was shrewd and sprightly, and by this time thoroughly understood Don Quixote\u2019s crazy turn, and that all except Sancho Panza were making game of him, not to be behind the rest said to him, on observing his irritation, \u201cSir Knight, remember the boon you have promised me, and that in accordance with it you must not engage in any other adventure, be it ever so pressing; calm yourself, for if the licentiate had known that the galley slaves had been set free by that unconquered arm he would have stopped his mouth thrice over, or even bitten his tongue three times before he would have said a word that tended towards disrespect of your worship.\u201d \u201cThat I swear heartily,\u201d said the curate, \u201cand I would have even plucked off a moustache.\u201d \u201cI will hold my peace, se\u00f1ora,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand I will curb the natural anger that had arisen in my breast, and will proceed in peace and quietness until I have fulfilled my promise; but in return for this consideration I entreat you to tell me, if you have no objection to do so, what is the nature of your trouble, and how many, who, and what are the persons of whom I am to require due satisfaction, and on whom I am to take vengeance on your behalf?\u201d \u201cThat I will do with all my heart,\u201d replied Dorothea, \u201cif it will not be wearisome to you to hear of miseries and misfortunes.\u201d \u201cIt will not be wearisome, se\u00f1ora,\u201d said Don Quixote; to which Dorothea replied, \u201cWell, if that be so, give me your attention.\u201d As soon as she said this, Cardenio and the barber drew close to her side, eager to hear what sort of story the quick-witted Dorothea would invent for herself; and Sancho did the same, for he was as much taken in by her as his master; and she having settled herself comfortably in the saddle, and with the help of coughing and other preliminaries taken time to think, began with great sprightliness of manner in this fashion.", " Don Quixote said he would, so they made up a tolerable one for him in the same garret as before; and he lay down at once, being sorely shaken and in want of sleep. No sooner was the door shut upon him than the landlady made at the barber, and seizing him by the beard, said: \u201cBy my faith you are not going to make a beard of my tail any longer; you must give me back my tail, for it is a shame the way that thing of my husband\u2019s goes tossing about on the floor; I mean the comb that I used to stick in my good tail.\u201d But for all she tugged at it the barber would not give it up until the licentiate told him to let her have it, as there was now no further occasion for that stratagem, because he might declare himself and appear in his own character, and tell Don Quixote that he had fled to this inn when those thieves the galley slaves robbed him; and should he ask for the princess\u2019s squire, they could tell him that she had sent him on before her to give notice to the people of her kingdom that she was coming, and bringing with her the deliverer of them all. On this the barber cheerfully restored the tail to the landlady, and at the same time they returned all the accessories they had borrowed to effect Don Quixote\u2019s deliverance. All the people of the inn were struck with astonishment at the beauty of Dorothea, and even at the comely figure of the shepherd Cardenio. The curate made them get ready such fare as there was in the inn, and the landlord, in hope of better payment, served them up a tolerably good dinner.", " IN WHICH THE DOUBTFUL QUESTION OF MAMBRINO\u2019S HELMET AND THE PACK-SADDLE IS FINALLY SETTLED, WITH OTHER ADVENTURES THAT OCCURRED IN TRUTH AND EARNEST c45a.jpg (154K) Full Size \u201cWhat do you think now, gentlemen,\u201d said the barber, \u201cof what these gentles say, when they want to make out that this is a helmet?\u201d \u201cAnd whoever says the contrary,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cI will let him know he lies if he is a knight, and if he is a squire that he lies again a thousand times.\u201d Our own barber, who was present at all this, and understood Don Quixote\u2019s humour so thoroughly, took it into his head to back up his delusion and carry on the joke for the general amusement;

which said barber, as he led his ass to the stable, observed Sancho Panza engaged in repairing something or other belonging to the pack-saddle; and the moment he saw it he knew it, and made bold to attack Sancho, exclaiming, \u201cHo, sir thief, I have caught you! hand over my basin and my pack-saddle, and all my trappings that you robbed me of.\u201d Sancho, finding himself so unexpectedly assailed, and hearing the abuse poured upon him, seized the pack-saddle with one hand, and with the other gave the barber a cuff that bathed his teeth in blood. The barber, however, was not so ready to relinquish the prize he had made in the pack-saddle; on the contrary, he raised such an outcry that everyone in the inn came running to know what the noise and quarrel meant. \u201cHere, in the name of the king and justice!\u201d he cried, \u201cthis thief and highwayman wants to kill me for trying to recover my property.\u201d \u201cYou lie,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cI am no highwayman; it was in fair war my master Don Quixote won these spoils.\u201d Don Quixote was standing by at the time, highly pleased to see his squire\u2019s stoutness, both offensive and defensive, and from that time forth he reckoned him a man of mettle, and in his heart resolved to dub him a knight on the first opportunity that presented itself, feeling sure that the order of chivalry would be fittingly bestowed upon him.", " They left him and went in, and presently the barber brought him out something to eat. By-and-by, after they had between them carefully thought over what they should do to carry out their object, the curate hit upon an idea very well adapted to humour Don Quixote, and effect their purpose; and his notion, which he explained to the barber, was that he himself should assume the disguise of a wandering damsel, while the other should try as best he could to pass for a squire, and that they should thus proceed to where Don Quixote was, and he, pretending to be an aggrieved and distressed damsel, should ask a favour of him, which as a valiant knight-errant he could not refuse to grant; and the favour he meant to ask him was that he should accompany her whither she would conduct him, in order to redress a wrong which a wicked knight had done her, while at the same time she should entreat him not to require her to remove her mask, nor ask her any question touching her circumstances until he had righted her with the wicked knight. And he had no doubt that Don Quixote would comply with any request made in these terms, and that in this way they might remove him and take him to his own village, where they would endeavour to find out if his extraordinary madness admitted of any kind of remedy. c26e.jpg (48K) CHAPTER XXVII. OF HOW THE CURATE AND THE BARBER PROCEEDED WITH THEIR SCHEME; TOGETHER WITH OTHER MATTERS WORTHY OF RECORD IN THIS GREAT HISTORY c27a.jpg (169K) Full Size The curate\u2019s plan did not seem a bad one to the barber, but on the contrary so good that they immediately set about putting it in execution."], "According to the canon, who should take responsibility for improving Spanish theatre?": [" Don Quixote, finding himself free, strove to get on top of the goatherd, who, with his face covered with blood, and soundly kicked by Sancho, was on all fours feeling about for one of the table-knives to take a bloody revenge with. The canon and the curate, however, prevented him, but the barber so contrived it that he got Don Quixote under him, and rained down upon him such a shower of fisticuffs that the poor knight\u2019s face streamed with blood as freely as his own. The canon and the curate were bursting with laughter, the officers were capering with delight, and both the one and the other hissed them on as they do dogs that are worrying one another in a fight. Sancho alone was frantic, for he could not free himself from the grasp of one of the canon\u2019s servants, who kept him from going to his master\u2019s assistance. c52b.jpg (348K) Full Size At last, while they were all, with the exception of the two bruisers who were mauling each other, in high glee and enjoyment, they heard a trumpet sound a note so doleful that it made them all look in the direction whence the sound seemed to come. But the one that was most excited by hearing it was Don Quixote, who though sorely against his will he was under the goatherd, and something more than pretty well pummelled, said to him, \u201cBrother devil (for it is impossible but that thou must be one since thou hast had might and strength enough to overcome mine), I ask thee to agree to a truce for but one hour for the solemn note of yonder trumpet that falls on our ears seems to me to summon me to some new adventure.\u201d The goatherd, who was by this time tired of pummelling and being pummelled, released him at once, and Don Quixote rising to his feet and turning his eyes to the quarter where the sound had been heard, suddenly saw coming down the slope of a hill several men clad in white like penitents.", " That\u2019s what I\u2019ll do, and not stand haggling over trifles, but wash my hands at once of the whole business, and enjoy my rents like a duke, and let things go their own way.\u201d \u201cThat, brother Sancho,\u201d said the canon, \u201conly holds good as far as the enjoyment of the revenue goes; but the lord of the seigniory must attend to the administration of justice, and here capacity and sound judgment come in, and above all a firm determination to find out the truth; for if this be wanting in the beginning, the middle and the end will always go wrong; and God as commonly aids the honest intentions of the simple as he frustrates the evil designs of the crafty.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand those philosophies,\u201d returned Sancho Panza; \u201call I know is I would I had the county as soon as I shall know how to govern it; for I have as much soul as another, and as much body as anyone, and I shall be as much king of my realm as any other of his; and being so I should do as I liked, and doing as I liked I should please myself, and pleasing myself I should be content, and when one is content he has nothing more to desire, and when one has nothing more to desire there is an end of it; so let the county come, and God be with you, and let us see one another, as one blind man said to the other.\u201d \u201cThat is not bad philosophy thou art talking, Sancho,\u201d said the canon; \u201cbut for all that there is a good deal to be said on this matter of counties.\u201d To which Don Quixote returned, \u201cI know not what more there is to be said; I only guide myself by the example set me by the great Amadis of Gaul, when he made his squire count of the Insula Firme; and so, without any scruples of conscience, I can make a count of Sancho Panza, for he is one of the best squires that ever knight-errant had.\u201d The canon was astonished at the methodical nonsense (if nonsense be capable of method) that Don Quixote uttered, at the way in which he had described the adventure of the knight of the lake, at the impression that the deliberate lies of the books he read had made upon him, and lastly he marvelled at the simplicity of Sancho, who desired so eagerly to obtain the county his master had promised him.", " I swear in my heart she is a brave lass, and fit \u2018to pass over the banks of Flanders.\u2019\u201d Don Quixote laughed at Sancho\u2019s boorish eulogies and thought that, saving his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, he had never seen a more beautiful woman. The fair Quiteria appeared somewhat pale, which was, no doubt, because of the bad night brides always pass dressing themselves out for their wedding on the morrow. They advanced towards a theatre that stood on one side of the meadow decked with carpets and boughs, where they were to plight their troth, and from which they were to behold the dances and plays; but at the moment of their arrival at the spot they heard a loud outcry behind them, and a voice exclaiming, \u201cWait a little, ye, as inconsiderate as ye are hasty!\u201d At these words all turned round, and perceived that the speaker was a man clad in what seemed to be a loose black coat garnished with crimson patches like flames. He was crowned (as was presently seen) with a crown of gloomy cypress, and in his hand he held a long staff. As he approached he was recognised by everyone as the gay Basilio, and all waited anxiously to see what would come of his words, in dread of some catastrophe in consequence of his appearance at such a moment. He came up at last weary and breathless, and planting himself in front of the bridal pair, drove his staff, which had a steel spike at the end, into the ground, and, with a pale face and eyes fixed on Quiteria, he thus addressed her in a hoarse, trembling voice: \u201cWell dost thou know, ungrateful Quiteria, that according to the holy law we acknowledge, so long as live thou canst take no husband; nor art thou ignorant either that, in my hopes that time and my own exertions would improve my fortunes, I have never failed to observe the respect due to thy honour; but thou, casting behind thee all thou owest to my true love, wouldst surrender what is mine to another whose wealth serves to bring him not only good fortune but supreme happiness; and now to complete it (not that I think he deserves it, but inasmuch as heaven is pleased to bestow it upon him), I will, with my own hands, do away with the obstacle that may interfere with it, and remove myself from between you.", " Lusitania had a Viriatus, Rome a C\u00e6sar, Carthage a Hannibal, Greece an Alexander, Castile a Count Fernan Gonzalez, Valencia a Cid, Andalusia a Gonzalo Fernandez, Estremadura a Diego Garc\u00eda de Paredes, Jerez a Garci Perez de Vargas, Toledo a Garcilaso, Seville a Don Manuel de Leon, to read of whose valiant deeds will entertain and instruct the loftiest minds and fill them with delight and wonder. Here, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote, will be reading worthy of your sound understanding; from which you will rise learned in history, in love with virtue, strengthened in goodness, improved in manners, brave without rashness, prudent without cowardice; and all to the honour of God, your own advantage and the glory of La Mancha, whence, I am informed, your worship derives your birth.\u201d Don Quixote listened with the greatest attention to the canon\u2019s words, and when he found he had finished, after regarding him for some time, he replied to him: \u201cIt appears to me, gentle sir, that your worship\u2019s discourse is intended to persuade me that there never were any knights-errant in the world, and that all the books of chivalry are false, lying, mischievous and useless to the State, and that I have done wrong in reading them, and worse in believing them, and still worse in imitating them, when I undertook to follow the arduous calling of knight-errantry which they set forth; for you deny that there ever were Amadises of Gaul or of Greece, or any other of the knights of whom the books are full.\u201d \u201cIt is all exactly as you state it,\u201d said the canon; to which Don Quixote returned, \u201cYou also went on to say that books of this kind had done me much harm, inasmuch as they had upset my senses, and shut me up in a cage, and that it would be better for me to reform and change my studies, and read other truer books which would afford more pleasure and instruction.\u201d \u201cJust so,\u201d said the canon."], "What special ability does the goatherd Eugenio claim to possess?": [" Sancho rose, and with the rage he felt at finding himself so belaboured without deserving it, ran to take vengeance on the goatherd, accusing him of not giving them warning that this man was at times taken with a mad fit, for if they had known it they would have been on their guard to protect themselves. The goatherd replied that he had said so, and that if he had not heard him, that was no fault of his. Sancho retorted, and the goatherd rejoined, and the altercation ended in their seizing each other by the beard, and exchanging such fisticuffs that if Don Quixote had not made peace between them, they would have knocked one another to pieces. \u201cLeave me alone, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance,\u201d said Sancho, grappling with the goatherd, \u201cfor of this fellow, who is a clown like myself, and no dubbed knight, I can safely take satisfaction for the affront he has offered me, fighting with him hand to hand like an honest man.\u201d \u201cThat is true,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cbut I know that he is not to blame for what has happened.\u201d With this he pacified them, and again asked the goatherd if it would be possible to find Cardenio, as he felt the greatest anxiety to know the end of his story. The goatherd told him, as he had told him before, that there was no knowing of a certainty where his lair was; but that if he wandered about much in that neighbourhood he could not fail to fall in with him either in or out of his senses.", " This, sirs, was the reason of words and expressions I made use of to this goat when I came up just now; for as she is a female I have a contempt for her, though she is the best in all my fold. This is the story I promised to tell you, and if I have been tedious in telling it, I will not be slow to serve you; my hut is close by, and I have fresh milk and dainty cheese there, as well as a variety of toothsome fruit, no less pleasing to the eye than to the palate. c51e.jpg (14K) CHAPTER LII. OF THE QUARREL THAT DON QUIXOTE HAD WITH THE GOATHERD, TOGETHER WITH THE RARE ADVENTURE OF THE PENITENTS, WHICH WITH AN EXPENDITURE OF SWEAT HE BROUGHT TO A HAPPY CONCLUSION c52a.jpg (40K) Full Size The goatherd\u2019s tale gave great satisfaction to all the hearers, and the canon especially enjoyed it, for he had remarked with particular attention the manner in which it had been told, which was as unlike the manner of a clownish goatherd as it was like that of a polished city wit; and he observed that the curate had been quite right in saying that the woods bred men of learning. They all offered their services to Eugenio but he who showed himself most liberal in this way was Don Quixote, who said to him, \u201cMost assuredly, brother goatherd, if I found myself in a position to attempt any adventure, I would, this very instant, set out on your behalf, and would rescue Leandra from that convent (where no doubt she is kept against her will), in spite of the abbess and all who might try to prevent me, and would place her in your hands to deal with her according to your will and pleasure, observing, however, the laws of chivalry which lay down that no violence of any kind is to be offered to any damsel.", " But I trust in God our Lord that the might of one malignant enchanter may not prove so great but that the power of another better disposed may prove superior to it, and then I promise you my support and assistance, as I am bound to do by my profession, which is none other than to give aid to the weak and needy.\u201d The goatherd eyed him, and noticing Don Quixote\u2019s sorry appearance and looks, he was filled with wonder, and asked the barber, who was next him, \u201cSe\u00f1or, who is this man who makes such a figure and talks in such a strain?\u201d \u201cWho should it be,\u201d said the barber, \u201cbut the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, the undoer of injustice, the righter of wrongs, the protector of damsels, the terror of giants, and the winner of battles?\u201d \u201cThat,\u201d said the goatherd, \u201csounds like what one reads in the books of the knights-errant, who did all that you say this man does; though it is my belief that either you are joking, or else this gentleman has empty lodgings in his head.\u201d \u201cYou are a great scoundrel,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand it is you who are empty and a fool. I am fuller than ever was the whoreson bitch that bore you;\u201d and passing from words to deeds, he caught up a loaf that was near him and sent it full in the goatherd\u2019s face, with such force that he flattened his nose; but the goatherd, who did not understand jokes, and found himself roughly handled in such good earnest, paying no respect to carpet, tablecloth, or diners, sprang upon Don Quixote, and seizing him by the throat with both hands would no doubt have throttled him, had not Sancho Panza that instant come to the rescue, and grasping him by the shoulders flung him down on the table, smashing plates, breaking glasses, and upsetting and scattering everything on it.", " c23h.jpg (381K) Full Size As they stood looking at it they heard a whistle like that of a shepherd watching his flock, and suddenly on their left there appeared a great number of goats and behind them on the summit of the mountain the goatherd in charge of them, a man advanced in years. Don Quixote called aloud to him and begged him to come down to where they stood. He shouted in return, asking what had brought them to that spot, seldom or never trodden except by the feet of goats, or of the wolves and other wild beasts that roamed around. Sancho in return bade him come down, and they would explain all to him. The goatherd descended, and reaching the place where Don Quixote stood, he said, \u201cI will wager you are looking at that hack mule that lies dead in the hollow there, and, faith, it has been lying there now these six months; tell me, have you come upon its master about here?\u201d \u201cWe have come upon nobody,\u201d answered Don Quixote, \u201cnor on anything except a saddle-pad and a little valise that we found not far from this.\u201d \u201cI found it too,\u201d said the goatherd, \u201cbut I would not lift it nor go near it for fear of some ill-luck or being charged with theft, for the devil is crafty, and things rise up under one\u2019s feet to make one fall without knowing why or wherefore.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I say,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cI found it too, and I would not go within a stone\u2019s throw of it; there I left it, and there it lies just as it was, for I don\u2019t want a dog with a bell.\u201d \u201cTell me, good man,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cdo you know who is the owner of this property?\u201d \u201cAll I can tell you,\u201d said the goatherd, \u201cis that about six months ago, more or less, there arrived at a shepherd\u2019s hut three leagues, perhaps, away from this, a youth of well-bred appearance and manners, mounted on that same mule which lies dead here, and with the same saddle-pad and valise which you say you found and did not touch."], "What does Don Quixote overhear that moves him to return home willingly?": [" I fear that he will think ill of my pliancy or lightness, not considering the irresistible influence he brought to bear upon me.\u201d \u201cLet not that trouble you, my lady,\u201d said Leonela, \u201cfor it does not take away the value of the thing given or make it the less precious to give it quickly if it be really valuable and worthy of being prized; nay, they are wont to say that he who gives quickly gives twice.\u201d \u201cThey say also,\u201d said Camilla, \u201cthat what costs little is valued less.\u201d \u201cThat saying does not hold good in your case,\u201d replied Leonela, \u201cfor love, as I have heard say, sometimes flies and sometimes walks; with this one it runs, with that it moves slowly; some it cools, others it burns; some it wounds, others it slays; it begins the course of its desires, and at the same moment completes and ends it; in the morning it will lay siege to a fortress and by night will have taken it, for there is no power that can resist it; so what are you in dread of, what do you fear, when the same must have befallen Lothario, love having chosen the absence of my lord as the instrument for subduing you? and it was absolutely necessary to complete then what love had resolved upon, without affording the time to let Anselmo return and by his presence compel the work to be left unfinished; for love has no better agent for carrying out his designs than opportunity; and of opportunity he avails himself in all his feats, especially at the outset.", " Sancho shrugged his shoulders, obeyed, and sat down, and all the duchess\u2019s damsels and duennas gathered round him, waiting in profound silence to hear what he would say. It was the duchess, however, who spoke first, saying: \u201cNow that we are alone, and that there is nobody here to overhear us, I should be glad if the se\u00f1or governor would relieve me of certain doubts I have, rising out of the history of the great Don Quixote that is now in print. One is: inasmuch as worthy Sancho never saw Dulcinea, I mean the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, nor took Don Quixote\u2019s letter to her, for it was left in the memorandum book in the Sierra Morena, how did he dare to invent the answer and all that about finding her sifting wheat, the whole story being a deception and falsehood, and so much to the prejudice of the peerless Dulcinea\u2019s good name, a thing that is not at all becoming the character and fidelity of a good squire?\u201d p33b.jpg (326K) Full Size At these words, Sancho, without uttering one in reply, got up from his chair, and with noiseless steps, with his body bent and his finger on his lips, went all round the room lifting up the hangings; and this done, he came back to his seat and said, \u201cNow, se\u00f1ora, that I have seen that there is no one except the bystanders listening to us on the sly, I will answer what you have asked me, and all you may ask me, without fear or dread. And the first thing I have got to say is, that for my own part I hold my master Don Quixote to be stark mad, though sometimes he says things that, to my mind, and indeed everybody\u2019s that listens to him, are so wise, and run in such a straight furrow, that Satan himself could not have said them better; but for all that, really, and beyond all question, it\u2019s my firm belief he is cracked.", " Don Quixote a madman, and we sane; he goes off laughing, safe, and sound, and you are left sore and sorry! I\u2019d like to know now which is the madder, he who is so because he cannot help it, or he who is so of his own choice?\u201d To which Samson replied, \u201cThe difference between the two sorts of madmen is, that he who is so will he nil he, will be one always, while he who is so of his own accord can leave off being one whenever he likes.\u201d \u201cIn that case,\u201d said Tom Cecial, \u201cI was a madman of my own accord when I volunteered to become your squire, and, of my own accord, I\u2019ll leave off being one and go home.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s your affair,\u201d returned Samson, \u201cbut to suppose that I am going home until I have given Don Quixote a thrashing is absurd; and it is not any wish that he may recover his senses that will make me hunt him out now, but a wish for the sore pain I am in with my ribs won\u2019t let me entertain more charitable thoughts.\u201d Thus discoursing, the pair proceeded until they reached a town where it was their good luck to find a bone-setter, with whose help the unfortunate Samson was cured. Tom Cecial left him and went home, while he stayed behind meditating vengeance; and the history will return to him again at the proper time, so as not to omit making merry with Don Quixote now. p15e.jpg (17K) CHAPTER XVI. OF WHAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE WITH A DISCREET GENTLEMAN OF LA MANCHA p16a.jpg (85K) Full Size Don Quixote pursued his journey in the high spirits, satisfaction, and self-complacency already described, fancying himself the most valorous knight-errant of the age in the world because of his late victory.", " A curse I say once more, and a hundred times more, on those books of chivalry that have brought your worship to such a pass.\u201d They carried him to bed at once, and after searching for his wounds could find none, but he said they were all bruises from having had a severe fall with his horse Rocinante when in combat with ten giants, the biggest and the boldest to be found on earth. \u201cSo, so!\u201d said the curate, \u201care there giants in the dance? By the sign of the Cross I will burn them to-morrow before the day is over.\u201d They put a host of questions to Don Quixote, but his only answer to all was\u2014give him something to eat, and leave him to sleep, for that was what he needed most. They did so, and the curate questioned the peasant at great length as to how he had found Don Quixote. He told him, and the nonsense he had talked when found and on the way home, all which made the licentiate the more eager to do what he did the next day, which was to summon his friend the barber, Master Nicholas, and go with him to Don Quixote\u2019s house. p031.jpg (31K) CHAPTER VI. OF THE DIVERTING AND IMPORTANT SCRUTINY WHICH THE CURATE AND THE BARBER MADE IN THE LIBRARY OF OUR INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN c06a.jpg (92K) Full Size He was still sleeping; so the curate asked the niece for the keys of the room where the books, the authors of all the mischief, were, and right willingly she gave them. They all went in, the housekeeper with them, and found more than a hundred volumes of big books very well bound, and some other small ones."], "What work has another author published that provokes Cervantes\u2019 anger?": [" Gustave Dor\u00e9 makes it an elaborate fountain such as no arriero ever watered his mules at in the corral of any venta in Spain, and thereby entirely misses the point aimed at by Cervantes. It is the mean, prosaic, commonplace character of all the surroundings and circumstances that gives a significance to Don Quixote\u2019s vigil and the ceremony that follows. Cervantes\u2019 humour is for the most part of that broader and simpler sort, the strength of which lies in the perception of the incongruous. It is the incongruity of Sancho in all his ways, words, and works, with the ideas and aims of his master, quite as much as the wonderful vitality and truth to nature of the character, that makes him the most humorous creation in the whole range of fiction. That unsmiling gravity of which Cervantes was the first great master, \u201cCervantes\u2019 serious air,\u201d which sits naturally on Swift alone, perhaps, of later humourists, is essential to this kind of humour, and here again Cervantes has suffered at the hands of his interpreters. Nothing, unless indeed the coarse buffoonery of Phillips, could be more out of place in an attempt to represent Cervantes, than a flippant, would-be facetious style, like that of Motteux\u2019s version for example, or the sprightly, jaunty air, French translators sometimes adopt. It is the grave matter-of-factness of the narrative, and the apparent unconsciousness of the author that he is saying anything ludicrous, anything but the merest commonplace, that give its peculiar flavour to the humour of Cervantes.", " He taunts Cervantes with being old, with having lost his hand, with having been in prison, with being poor, with being friendless, accuses him of envy of Lope\u2019s success, of petulance and querulousness, and so on; and it was in this that the sting lay. Avellaneda\u2019s reason for this personal attack is obvious enough. Whoever he may have been, it is clear that he was one of the dramatists of Lope\u2019s school, for he has the impudence to charge Cervantes with attacking him as well as Lope in his criticism on the drama. His identification has exercised the best critics and baffled all the ingenuity and research that has been brought to bear on it. Navarrete and Ticknor both incline to the belief that Cervantes knew who he was; but I must say I think the anger he shows suggests an invisible assailant; it is like the irritation of a man stung by a mosquito in the dark. Cervantes from certain solecisms of language pronounces him to be an Aragonese, and Pellicer, an Aragonese himself, supports this view and believes him, moreover, to have been an ecclesiastic, a Dominican probably. Any merit Avellaneda has is reflected from Cervantes, and he is too dull to reflect much. \u201cDull and dirty\u201d will always be, I imagine, the verdict of the vast majority of unprejudiced readers. He is, at best, a poor plagiarist; all he can do is to follow slavishly the lead given him by Cervantes; his only humour lies in making Don Quixote take inns for castles and fancy himself some legendary or historical personage, and Sancho mistake words, invert proverbs, and display his gluttony; all through he shows a proclivity to coarseness and dirt, and he has contrived to introduce two tales filthier than anything by the sixteenth century novellieri and without their sprightliness.", " One which, it seems to me, cannot be too rigidly followed in translating \u201cDon Quixote,\u201d is to avoid everything that savours of affectation. The book itself is, indeed, in one sense a protest against it, and no man abhorred it more than Cervantes. For this reason, I think, any temptation to use antiquated or obsolete language should be resisted. It is after all an affectation, and one for which there is no warrant or excuse. Spanish has probably undergone less change since the seventeenth century than any language in Europe, and by far the greater and certainly the best part of \u201cDon Quixote\u201d differs but little in language from the colloquial Spanish of the present day. Except in the tales and Don Quixote\u2019s speeches, the translator who uses the simplest and plainest everyday language will almost always be the one who approaches nearest to the original. Seeing that the story of \u201cDon Quixote\u201d and all its characters and incidents have now been for more than two centuries and a half familiar as household words in English mouths, it seems to me that the old familiar names and phrases should not be changed without good reason. Of course a translator who holds that \u201cDon Quixote\u201d should receive the treatment a great classic deserves, will feel himself bound by the injunction laid upon the Morisco in Chap. IX not to omit or add anything. II: ABOUT CERVANTES AND DON QUIXOTE Four generations had laughed over \u201cDon Quixote\u201d before it occurred to anyone to ask, who and what manner of man was this Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra whose name is on the title-page; and it was too late for a satisfactory answer to the question when it was proposed to add a life of the author to the London edition published at Lord Carteret\u2019s instance in 1738.", " Smollett\u2019s version, published in 1755, may be almost counted as one of these. At any rate it is plain that in its construction Jervas\u2019s translation was very freely drawn upon, and very little or probably no heed given to the original Spanish. The later translations may be dismissed in a few words. George Kelly\u2019s, which appeared in 1769, \u201cprinted for the Translator,\u201d was an impudent imposture, being nothing more than Motteux\u2019s version with a few of the words, here and there, artfully transposed; Charles Wilmot\u2019s (1774) was only an abridgment like Florian\u2019s, but not so skilfully executed; and the version published by Miss Smirke in 1818, to accompany her brother\u2019s plates, was merely a patchwork production made out of former translations. On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield\u2019s, it would be in every sense of the word impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not even seen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, and since then I may say vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr. Duffield\u2019s reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes. From the foregoing history of our translations of \u201cDon Quixote,\u201d it will be seen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrative with its full complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in a form that amuses them, care very little whether that form is the one in which Cervantes originally shaped his ideas."], "What are the contents of the book Sancho that describes to Don Quixote at Quixote\u2019s house?": [" Almost the same civilities were exchanged between him and the student, who listening to Don Quixote, took him to be a sensible, clear-headed person. Here the author describes minutely everything belonging to Don Diego\u2019s mansion, putting before us in his picture the whole contents of a rich gentleman-farmer\u2019s house; but the translator of the history thought it best to pass over these and other details of the same sort in silence, as they are not in harmony with the main purpose of the story, the strong point of which is truth rather than dull digressions. They led Don Quixote into a room, and Sancho removed his armour, leaving him in loose Walloon breeches and chamois-leather doublet, all stained with the rust of his armour; his collar was a falling one of scholastic cut, without starch or lace, his buskins buff-coloured, and his shoes polished. He wore his good sword, which hung in a baldric of sea-wolf\u2019s skin, for he had suffered for many years, they say, from an ailment of the kidneys; and over all he threw a long cloak of good grey cloth. But first of all, with five or six buckets of water (for as regard the number of buckets there is some dispute), he washed his head and face, and still the water remained whey-coloured, thanks to Sancho\u2019s greediness and purchase of those unlucky curds that turned his master so white. Thus arrayed, and with an easy, sprightly, and gallant air, Don Quixote passed out into another room, where the student was waiting to entertain him while the table was being laid; for on the arrival of so distinguished a guest, Do\u00f1a Christina was anxious to show that she knew how and was able to give a becoming reception to those who came to her house.", " \u201cAt the same time they might fairly have passed them over in silence,\u201d observed Don Quixote; \u201cfor there is no need of recording events which do not change or affect the truth of a history, if they tend to bring the hero of it into contempt. \u00c6neas was not in truth and earnest so pious as Virgil represents him, nor Ulysses so wise as Homer describes him.\u201d \u201cThat is true,\u201d said Samson; \u201cbut it is one thing to write as a poet, another to write as a historian; the poet may describe or sing things, not as they were, but as they ought to have been; but the historian has to write them down, not as they ought to have been, but as they were, without adding anything to the truth or taking anything from it.\u201d \u201cWell then,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cif this se\u00f1or Moor goes in for telling the truth, no doubt among my master\u2019s drubbings mine are to be found; for they never took the measure of his worship\u2019s shoulders without doing the same for my whole body; but I have no right to wonder at that, for, as my master himself says, the members must share the pain of the head.\u201d \u201cYou are a sly dog, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201ci\u2019 faith, you have no want of memory when you choose to remember.\u201d \u201cIf I were to try to forget the thwacks they gave me,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cmy weals would not let me, for they are still fresh on my ribs.\u201d \u201cHush, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand don\u2019t interrupt the bachelor, whom I entreat to go on and tell all that is said about me in this history.\u201d \u201cAnd about me,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cfor they say, too, that I am one of the principal presonages in it.\u201d \u201cPersonages, not presonages, friend Sancho,\u201d said Samson.", " But what book is that next it?\u201d \u201cThe \u2018Galatea\u2019 of Miguel de Cervantes,\u201d said the barber. \u201cThat Cervantes has been for many years a great friend of mine, and to my knowledge he has had more experience in reverses than in verses. His book has some good invention in it, it presents us with something but brings nothing to a conclusion: we must wait for the Second Part it promises: perhaps with amendment it may succeed in winning the full measure of grace that is now denied it; and in the mean time do you, se\u00f1or gossip, keep it shut up in your own quarters.\u201d \u201cVery good,\u201d said the barber; \u201cand here come three together, the \u2018Araucana\u2019 of Don Alonso de Ercilla, the \u2018Austriada\u2019 of Juan Rufo, Justice of Cordova, and the \u2018Montserrate\u2019 of Christobal de Viru\u00e9s, the Valencian poet.\u201d \u201cThese three books,\u201d said the curate, \u201care the best that have been written in Castilian in heroic verse, and they may compare with the most famous of Italy; let them be preserved as the richest treasures of poetry that Spain possesses.\u201d The curate was tired and would not look into any more books, and so he decided that, \u201ccontents uncertified,\u201d all the rest should be burned; but just then the barber held open one, called \u201cThe Tears of Angelica.\u201d \u201cI should have shed tears myself,\u201d said the curate when he heard the title, \u201chad I ordered that book to be burned, for its author was one of the famous poets of the world, not to say of Spain, and was very happy in the translation of some of Ovid\u2019s fables.\u201d c06e.jpg (30K) CHAPTER VII.", " By Don Quixote, however, and by Sancho the head was still held to be an enchanted one, and capable of answering questions, though more to Don Quixote\u2019s satisfaction than Sancho\u2019s. The gentlemen of the city, to gratify Don Antonio and also to do the honours to Don Quixote, and give him an opportunity of displaying his folly, made arrangements for a tilting at the ring in six days from that time, which, however, for reason that will be mentioned hereafter, did not take place. Don Quixote took a fancy to stroll about the city quietly and on foot, for he feared that if he went on horseback the boys would follow him; so he and Sancho and two servants that Don Antonio gave him set out for a walk. Thus it came to pass that going along one of the streets Don Quixote lifted up his eyes and saw written in very large letters over a door, \u201cBooks printed here,\u201d at which he was vastly pleased, for until then he had never seen a printing office, and he was curious to know what it was like. He entered with all his following, and saw them drawing sheets in one place, correcting in another, setting up type here, revising there; in short all the work that is to be seen in great printing offices. He went up to one case and asked what they were about there; the workmen told him, he watched them with wonder, and passed on. He approached one man, among others, and asked him what he was doing. The workman replied, \u201cSe\u00f1or, this gentleman here\u201d (pointing to a man of prepossessing appearance and a certain gravity of look) \u201chas translated an Italian book into our Spanish tongue, and I am setting it up in type for the press.\u201d \u201cWhat is the title of the book?\u201d asked Don Quixote; to which the author replied, \u201cSe\u00f1or, in Italian the book is called _Le Bagatelle_.\u201d \u201cAnd what does _Le Bagatelle_ import in our Spanish?\u201d asked Don Quixote."], "What does Don Quixote call the writer of the book that details his and Sancho\u2019s adventures?": [" They asked him whither he meant to direct his steps. He replied, to Saragossa, to take part in the harness jousts which were held in that city every year. Don Juan told him that the new history described how Don Quixote, let him be who he might, took part there in a tilting at the ring, utterly devoid of invention, poor in mottoes, very poor in costume, though rich in sillinesses. \u201cFor that very reason,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cI will not set foot in Saragossa; and by that means I shall expose to the world the lie of this new history writer, and people will see that I am not the Don Quixote he speaks of.\u201d \u201cYou will do quite right,\u201d said Don Jeronimo; \u201cand there are other jousts at Barcelona in which Se\u00f1or Don Quixote may display his prowess.\u201d \u201cThat is what I mean to do,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cand as it is now time, I pray your worships to give me leave to retire to bed, and to place and retain me among the number of your greatest friends and servants.\u201d \u201cAnd me too,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cmaybe I\u2019ll be good for something.\u201d With this they exchanged farewells, and Don Quixote and Sancho retired to their room, leaving Don Juan and Don Jeronimo amazed to see the medley he made of his good sense and his craziness; and they felt thoroughly convinced that these, and not those their Aragonese author described, were the genuine Don Quixote and Sancho. Don Quixote rose betimes, and bade adieu to his hosts by knocking at the partition of the other room.", " p33e.jpg (34K) CHAPTER XXXIV. WHICH RELATES HOW THEY LEARNED THE WAY IN WHICH THEY WERE TO DISENCHANT THE PEERLESS DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO, WHICH IS ONE OF THE RAREST ADVENTURES IN THIS BOOK p34a.jpg (141K) Full Size Great was the pleasure the duke and duchess took in the conversation of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza; and, more bent than ever upon the plan they had of practising some jokes upon them that should have the look and appearance of adventures, they took as their basis of action what Don Quixote had already told them about the cave of Montesinos, in order to play him a famous one. But what the duchess marvelled at above all was that Sancho\u2019s simplicity could be so great as to make him believe as absolute truth that Dulcinea had been enchanted, when it was he himself who had been the enchanter and trickster in the business. Having, therefore, instructed their servants in everything they were to do, six days afterwards they took him out to hunt, with as great a retinue of huntsmen and beaters as a crowned king. They presented Don Quixote with a hunting suit, and Sancho with another of the finest green cloth; but Don Quixote declined to put his on, saying that he must soon return to the hard pursuit of arms, and could not carry wardrobes or stores with him. Sancho, however, took what they gave him, meaning to sell it at the first opportunity. The appointed day having arrived, Don Quixote armed himself, and Sancho arrayed himself, and mounted on his Dapple (for he would not give him up though they offered him a horse), he placed himself in the midst of the troop of huntsmen.", " Sancho, hearing himself called, quitted the shepherds, and, prodding Dapple vigorously, came up to his master, to whom there fell a terrific and desperate adventure. p16e.jpg (49K) CHAPTER XVII. WHEREIN IS SHOWN THE FURTHEST AND HIGHEST POINT WHICH THE UNEXAMPLED COURAGE OF DON QUIXOTE REACHED OR COULD REACH; TOGETHER WITH THE HAPPILY ACHIEVED ADVENTURE OF THE LIONS p17a.jpg (137K) Full Size The history tells that when Don Quixote called out to Sancho to bring him his helmet, Sancho was buying some curds the shepherds agreed to sell him, and flurried by the great haste his master was in did not know what to do with them or what to carry them in; so, not to lose them, for he had already paid for them, he thought it best to throw them into his master\u2019s helmet, and acting on this bright idea he went to see what his master wanted with him. He, as he approached, exclaimed to him: \u201cGive me that helmet, my friend, for either I know little of adventures, or what I observe yonder is one that will, and does, call upon me to arm myself.\u201d He of the green gaban, on hearing this, looked in all directions, but could perceive nothing, except a cart coming towards them with two or three small flags, which led him to conclude it must be carrying treasure of the King\u2019s, and he said so to Don Quixote. He, however, would not believe him, being always persuaded and convinced that all that happened to him must be adventures and still more adventures; so he replied to the gentleman, \u201cHe who is prepared has his battle half fought; nothing is lost by my preparing myself, for I know by experience that I have enemies, visible and invisible, and I know not when, or where, or at what moment, or in what shapes they will attack me;\u201d and turning to Sancho, he called for his helmet; and Sancho, as he had no time to take out the curds, had to give it just as it was.", " The painter or writer, for it\u2019s all the same, who published the history of this new Don Quixote that has come out, must have been one of this sort I think, Sancho, for he painted or wrote \u2018whatever it might turn out;\u2019 or perhaps he is like a poet called Mauleon that was about the Court some years ago, who used to answer at haphazard whatever he was asked, and on one asking him what _Deum de Deo_ meant, he replied _D\u00e9 donde diere_. But, putting this aside, tell me, Sancho, hast thou a mind to have another turn at thyself to-night, and wouldst thou rather have it indoors or in the open air?\u201d \u201cEgad, se\u00f1or,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cfor what I\u2019m going to give myself, it comes all the same to me whether it is in a house or in the fields; still I\u2019d like it to be among trees; for I think they are company for me and help me to bear my pain wonderfully.\u201d \u201cAnd yet it must not be, Sancho my friend,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cbut, to enable thee to recover strength, we must keep it for our own village; for at the latest we shall get there the day after to-morrow.\u201d Sancho said he might do as he pleased; but that for his own part he would like to finish off the business quickly before his blood cooled and while he had an appetite, because \u201cin delay there is apt to be danger\u201d very often, and \u201cpraying to God and plying the hammer,\u201d and \u201cone take was better than two I\u2019ll give thee\u2019s,\u201d and \u201ca sparrow in the hand than a vulture on the wing.\u201d \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, Sancho, no more proverbs!\u201d exclaimed Don Quixote; \u201cit seems to me thou art becoming _sicut erat_ again; speak in a plain, simple, straight-forward way, as I have often told thee, and thou wilt find the good of it.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what bad luck it is of mine,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cbut I can\u2019t utter a word without a proverb that is not as good as an argument to my mind; however, I mean to mend if I can;\u201d and so for the present the conversation ended."], "Why does Cervantes, the \u201ctranslator,\u201d doubt the authenticity of one of his manuscript chapters?": [" There can be little doubt that all he contemplated was a short tale to range with those he had already written, a tale setting forth the ludicrous results that might be expected to follow the attempt of a crazy gentleman to act the part of a knight-errant in modern life. It is plain, for one thing, that Sancho Panza did not enter into the original scheme, for had Cervantes thought of him he certainly would not have omitted him in his hero\u2019s outfit, which he obviously meant to be complete. Him we owe to the landlord\u2019s chance remark in Chapter III that knights seldom travelled without squires. To try to think of a Don Quixote without Sancho Panza is like trying to think of a one-bladed pair of scissors. The story was written at first, like the others, without any division and without the intervention of Cid Hamete Benengeli; and it seems not unlikely that Cervantes had some intention of bringing Dulcinea, or Aldonza Lorenzo, on the scene in person. It was probably the ransacking of the Don\u2019s library and the discussion on the books of chivalry that first suggested it to him that his idea was capable of development. What, if instead of a mere string of farcical misadventures, he were to make his tale a burlesque of one of these books, caricaturing their style, incidents, and spirit? In pursuance of this change of plan, he hastily and somewhat clumsily divided what he had written into chapters on the model of \u201cAmadis,\u201d invented the fable of a mysterious Arabic manuscript, and set up Cid Hamete Benengeli in imitation of the almost invariable practice of the chivalry-romance authors, who were fond of tracing their books to some recondite source.", " One which, it seems to me, cannot be too rigidly followed in translating \u201cDon Quixote,\u201d is to avoid everything that savours of affectation. The book itself is, indeed, in one sense a protest against it, and no man abhorred it more than Cervantes. For this reason, I think, any temptation to use antiquated or obsolete language should be resisted. It is after all an affectation, and one for which there is no warrant or excuse. Spanish has probably undergone less change since the seventeenth century than any language in Europe, and by far the greater and certainly the best part of \u201cDon Quixote\u201d differs but little in language from the colloquial Spanish of the present day. Except in the tales and Don Quixote\u2019s speeches, the translator who uses the simplest and plainest everyday language will almost always be the one who approaches nearest to the original. Seeing that the story of \u201cDon Quixote\u201d and all its characters and incidents have now been for more than two centuries and a half familiar as household words in English mouths, it seems to me that the old familiar names and phrases should not be changed without good reason. Of course a translator who holds that \u201cDon Quixote\u201d should receive the treatment a great classic deserves, will feel himself bound by the injunction laid upon the Morisco in Chap. IX not to omit or add anything. II: ABOUT CERVANTES AND DON QUIXOTE Four generations had laughed over \u201cDon Quixote\u201d before it occurred to anyone to ask, who and what manner of man was this Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra whose name is on the title-page; and it was too late for a satisfactory answer to the question when it was proposed to add a life of the author to the London edition published at Lord Carteret\u2019s instance in 1738.", " On the other hand, it is clear that there are many who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it, so far at least as differences of idiom and circumstances permit, and who will give a preference to the conscientious translator, even though he may have acquitted himself somewhat awkwardly. But after all there is no real antagonism between the two classes; there is no reason why what pleases the one should not please the other, or why a translator who makes it his aim to treat \u201cDon Quixote\u201d with the respect due to a great classic, should not be as acceptable even to the careless reader as the one who treats it as a famous old jest-book. It is not a question of caviare to the general, or, if it is, the fault rests with him who makes so. The method by which Cervantes won the ear of the Spanish people ought, mutatis mutandis, to be equally effective with the great majority of English readers. At any rate, even if there are readers to whom it is a matter of indifference, fidelity to the method is as much a part of the translator\u2019s duty as fidelity to the matter. If he can please all parties, so much the better; but his first duty is to those who look to him for as faithful a representation of his author as it is in his power to give them, faithful to the letter so long as fidelity is practicable, faithful to the spirit so far as he can make it. My purpose here is not to dogmatise on the rules of translation, but to indicate those I have followed, or at least tried to the best of my ability to follow, in the present instance.", " Gustave Dor\u00e9 makes it an elaborate fountain such as no arriero ever watered his mules at in the corral of any venta in Spain, and thereby entirely misses the point aimed at by Cervantes. It is the mean, prosaic, commonplace character of all the surroundings and circumstances that gives a significance to Don Quixote\u2019s vigil and the ceremony that follows. Cervantes\u2019 humour is for the most part of that broader and simpler sort, the strength of which lies in the perception of the incongruous. It is the incongruity of Sancho in all his ways, words, and works, with the ideas and aims of his master, quite as much as the wonderful vitality and truth to nature of the character, that makes him the most humorous creation in the whole range of fiction. That unsmiling gravity of which Cervantes was the first great master, \u201cCervantes\u2019 serious air,\u201d which sits naturally on Swift alone, perhaps, of later humourists, is essential to this kind of humour, and here again Cervantes has suffered at the hands of his interpreters. Nothing, unless indeed the coarse buffoonery of Phillips, could be more out of place in an attempt to represent Cervantes, than a flippant, would-be facetious style, like that of Motteux\u2019s version for example, or the sprightly, jaunty air, French translators sometimes adopt. It is the grave matter-of-factness of the narrative, and the apparent unconsciousness of the author that he is saying anything ludicrous, anything but the merest commonplace, that give its peculiar flavour to the humour of Cervantes."], "Don Quixote tells his niece and housekeeper that ___ and ___ are the only ways to increase fame and honor.": [" p01e.jpg (15K) CHAPTER II.

Be off to your own, brother, for it is you, and no one else, that delude my master, and lead him astray, and take him tramping about the country.\u201d To which Sancho replied, \u201cDevil\u2019s own housekeeper! it is I who am deluded, and led astray, and taken tramping about the country, and not thy master! He has carried me all over the world, and you are mightily mistaken. He enticed me away from home by a trick, promising me an island, which I am still waiting for.\u201d \u201cMay evil islands choke thee, thou detestable Sancho,\u201d said the niece; \u201cWhat are islands? Is it something to eat, glutton and gormandiser that thou art?\u201d \u201cIt is not something to eat,\u201d replied Sancho, \u201cbut something to govern and rule, and better than four cities or four judgeships at court.\u201d \u201cFor all that,\u201d said the housekeeper, \u201cyou don\u2019t enter here, you bag of mischief and sack of knavery; go govern your house and dig your seed-patch, and give over looking for islands or shylands.\u201d The curate and the barber listened with great amusement to the words of the three; but Don Quixote, uneasy lest Sancho should blab and blurt out a whole heap of mischievous stupidities, and touch upon points that might not be altogether to his credit, called to him and made the other two hold their tongues and let him come in.", " \u201cThe day that I see her a countess,\u201d replied Teresa, \u201cit will be the same to me as if I was burying her; but once more I say do as you please, for we women are born to this burden of being obedient to our husbands, though they be dogs;\u201d and with this she began to weep in earnest, as if she already saw Sanchica dead and buried. Sancho consoled her by saying that though he must make her a countess, he would put it off as long as possible. Here their conversation came to an end, and Sancho went back to see Don Quixote, and make arrangements for their departure. p05e.jpg (49K) Full Size CHAPTER VI. OF WHAT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE AND HIS NIECE AND HOUSEKEEPER; ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CHAPTERS IN THE WHOLE HISTORY p06a.jpg (93K) Full Size While Sancho Panza and his wife, Teresa Cascajo, held the above irrelevant conversation, Don Quixote\u2019s niece and housekeeper were not idle, for by a thousand signs they began to perceive that their uncle and master meant to give them the slip the third time, and once more betake himself to his, for them, ill-errant chivalry. They strove by all the means in their power to divert him from such an unlucky scheme; but it was all preaching in the desert and hammering cold iron. Nevertheless, among many other representations made to him, the housekeeper said to him, \u201cIn truth, master, if you do not keep still and stay quiet at home, and give over roaming mountains and valleys like a troubled spirit, looking for what they say are called adventures, but what I call misfortunes, I shall have to make complaint to God and the king with loud supplication to send some remedy.\u201d To which Don Quixote replied, \u201cWhat answer God will give to your complaints, housekeeper, I know not, nor what his Majesty will answer either; I only know that if I were king I should decline to answer the numberless silly petitions they present every day; for one of the greatest among the many troubles kings have is being obliged to listen to all and answer all, and therefore I should be sorry that any affairs of mine should worry him.\u201d Whereupon the housekeeper said, \u201cTell us, se\u00f1or, at his Majesty\u2019s court are there no knights?\u201d \u201cThere are,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cand plenty of them; and it is right there should be, to set off the dignity of the prince, and for the greater glory of the king\u2019s majesty.\u201d \u201cThen might not your worship,\u201d said she, \u201cbe one of those that, without stirring a step, serve their king and lord in his court?\u201d \u201cRecollect, my friend,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201call knights cannot be courtiers, nor can all courtiers be knights-errant, nor need they be.", " The housekeeper, who had been already well instructed in what she was to answer, said, \u201cWhat room or what nothing is it that your worship is looking for? There are neither room nor books in this house now, for the devil himself has carried all away.\u201d \u201cIt was not the devil,\u201d said the niece, \u201cbut a magician who came on a cloud one night after the day your worship left this, and dismounting from a serpent that he rode he entered the room, and what he did there I know not, but after a little while he made off, flying through the roof, and left the house full of smoke; and when we went to see what he had done we saw neither book nor room: but we remember very well, the housekeeper and I, that on leaving, the old villain said in a loud voice that, for a private grudge he owed the owner of the books and the room, he had done mischief in that house that would be discovered by-and-by: he said too that his name was the Sage Mu\u00f1aton.\u201d \u201cHe must have said Friston,\u201d said Don Quixote. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether he called himself Friston or Friton,\u201d said the housekeeper, \u201cI only know that his name ended with \u2018ton.\u2019\u201d \u201cSo it does,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand he is a sage magician, a great enemy of mine, who has a spite against me because he knows by his arts and lore that in process of time I am to engage in single combat with a knight whom he befriends and that I am to conquer, and he will be unable to prevent it; and for this reason he endeavours to do me all the ill turns that he can; but I promise him it will be hard for him to oppose or avoid what is decreed by Heaven.\u201d \u201cWho doubts that?\u201d said the niece; \u201cbut, uncle, who mixes you up in these quarrels?", " The curate turned them all out, and left alone with him confessed him. The bachelor went for the notary and returned shortly afterwards with him and with Sancho, who, having already learned from the bachelor the condition his master was in, and finding the housekeeper and niece weeping, began to blubber and shed tears. The confession over, the curate came out saying, \u201cAlonso Quixano the Good is indeed dying, and is indeed in his right mind; we may now go in to him while he makes his will.\u201d This news gave a tremendous impulse to the brimming eyes of the housekeeper, niece, and Sancho Panza his good squire, making the tears burst from their eyes and a host of sighs from their hearts; for of a truth, as has been said more than once, whether as plain Alonso Quixano the Good, or as Don Quixote of La Mancha, Don Quixote was always of a gentle disposition and kindly in all his ways, and hence he was beloved, not only by those of his own house, but by all who knew him. The notary came in with the rest, and as soon as the preamble of the will had been set out and Don Quixote had commended his soul to God with all the devout formalities that are usual, coming to the bequests, he said, \u201cItem, it is my will that, touching certain moneys in the hands of Sancho Panza (whom in my madness I made my squire), inasmuch as between him and me there have been certain accounts and debits and credits, no claim be made against him, nor any account demanded of him in respect of them; but that if anything remain over and above, after he has paid himself what I owe him, the balance, which will be but little, shall be his, and much good may it do him; and if, as when I was mad I had a share in giving him the government of an island, so, now that I am in my senses, I could give him that of a kingdom, it should be his, for the simplicity of his character and the fidelity of his conduct deserve it.\u201d And then, turning to Sancho, he said, \u201cForgive me, my friend, that I led thee to seem as mad as myself, making thee fall into the same error I myself fell into, that there were and still are knights-errant in the world.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d said Sancho weeping, \u201cdon\u2019t die, master, but take my advice and live many years; for the foolishest thing a man can do in this life is to let himself die without rhyme or reason, without anybody killing him, or any hands but melancholy\u2019s making an end of him."], "As they leave La Mancha, Sancho suggests that he and Don Quixote should be ___ instead of knights.": [" What! can it be, most serene Casildea de Vandalia, that thou wilt suffer this thy captive knight to waste away and perish in ceaseless wanderings and rude and arduous toils? It is not enough that I have compelled all the knights of Navarre, all the Leonese, all the Tartesians, all the Castilians, and finally all the knights of La Mancha, to confess thee the most beautiful in the world?\u201d \u201cNot so,\u201d said Don Quixote at this, \u201cfor I am of La Mancha, and I have never confessed anything of the sort, nor could I nor should I confess a thing so much to the prejudice of my lady\u2019s beauty; thou seest how this knight is raving, Sancho. But let us listen, perhaps he will tell us more about himself.\u201d \u201cThat he will,\u201d returned Sancho, \u201cfor he seems in a mood to bewail himself for a month at a stretch.\u201d But this was not the case, for the Knight of the Grove, hearing voices near him, instead of continuing his lamentation, stood up and exclaimed in a distinct but courteous tone, \u201cWho goes there? What are you? Do you belong to the number of the happy or of the miserable?\u201d \u201cOf the miserable,\u201d answered Don Quixote. \u201cThen come to me,\u201d said he of the Grove, \u201cand rest assured that it is to woe itself and affliction itself you come.\u201d Don Quixote, finding himself answered in such a soft and courteous manner, went over to him, and so did Sancho. The doleful knight took Don Quixote by the arm, saying, \u201cSit down here, sir knight; for, that you are one, and of those that profess knight-errantry, it is to me a sufficient proof to have found you in this place, where solitude and night, the natural couch and proper retreat of knights-errant, keep you company.\u201d To which Don made answer, \u201cA knight I am of the profession you mention, and though sorrows, misfortunes, and calamities have made my heart their abode, the compassion I feel for the misfortunes of others has not been thereby banished from it.", " Don Quixote was mounted, not on Rocinante, but upon a tall mule of easy pace and handsomely caparisoned. They put the surcoat on him, and on the back, without his perceiving it, they stitched a parchment on which they wrote in large letters, \u201cThis is Don Quixote of La Mancha.\u201d As they set out upon their excursion the placard attracted the eyes of all who chanced to see him, and as they read out, \u201cThis is Don Quixote of La Mancha,\u201d Don Quixote was amazed to see how many people gazed at him, called him by his name, and recognised him, and turning to Don Antonio, who rode at his side, he observed to him, \u201cGreat are the privileges knight-errantry involves, for it makes him who professes it known and famous in every region of the earth; see, Don Antonio, even the very boys of this city know me without ever having seen me.\u201d \u201cTrue, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote,\u201d returned Don Antonio; \u201cfor as fire cannot be hidden or kept secret, virtue cannot escape being recognised; and that which is attained by the profession of arms shines distinguished above all others.\u201d It came to pass, however, that as Don Quixote was proceeding amid the acclamations that have been described, a Castilian, reading the inscription on his back, cried out in a loud voice, \u201cThe devil take thee for a Don Quixote of La Mancha! What! art thou here, and not dead of the countless drubbings that have fallen on thy ribs? Thou art mad; and if thou wert so by thyself, and kept thyself within thy madness, it would not be so bad; but thou hast the gift of making fools and blockheads of all who have anything to do with thee or say to thee.", " Supper-time having come, then, Don Quixote betook himself to his room, the landlord brought in the stew-pan just as it was, and he sat himself down to sup very resolutely. It seems that in another room, which was next to Don Quixote\u2019s, with nothing but a thin partition to separate it, he overheard these words, \u201cAs you live, Se\u00f1or Don Jeronimo, while they are bringing supper, let us read another chapter of the Second Part of \u2018Don Quixote of La Mancha.\u2019\u201d The instant Don Quixote heard his own name he started to his feet and listened with open ears to catch what they said about him, and heard the Don Jeronimo who had been addressed say in reply, \u201cWhy would you have us read that absurd stuff, Don Juan, when it is impossible for anyone who has read the First Part of the history of \u2018Don Quixote of La Mancha\u2019 to take any pleasure in reading this Second Part?\u201d \u201cFor all that,\u201d said he who was addressed as Don Juan, \u201cwe shall do well to read it, for there is no book so bad but it has something good in it. What displeases me most in it is that it represents Don Quixote as now cured of his love for Dulcinea del Toboso.\u201d On hearing this Don Quixote, full of wrath and indignation, lifted up his voice and said, \u201cWhoever he may be who says that Don Quixote of La Mancha has forgotten or can forget Dulcinea del Toboso, I will teach him with equal arms that what he says is very far from the truth; for neither can the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso be forgotten, nor can forgetfulness have a place in Don Quixote; his motto is constancy, and his profession to maintain the same with his life and never wrong it.\u201d \u201cWho is this that answers us?\u201d said they in the next room.", " p74b.jpg (391K) Full Size At last Don Quixote\u2019s end came, after he had received all the sacraments, and had in full and forcible terms expressed his detestation of books of chivalry. The notary was there at the time, and he said that in no book of chivalry had he ever read of any knight-errant dying in his bed so calmly and so like a Christian as Don Quixote, who amid the tears and lamentations of all present yielded up his spirit, that is to say died. On perceiving it the curate begged the notary to bear witness that Alonso Quixano the Good, commonly called Don Quixote of La Mancha, had passed away from this present life, and died naturally; and said he desired this testimony in order to remove the possibility of any other author save Cide Hamete Benengeli bringing him to life again falsely and making interminable stories out of his achievements. Such was the end of the Ingenious Gentleman of La Mancha, whose village Cide Hamete would not indicate precisely, in order to leave all the towns and villages of La Mancha to contend among themselves for the right to adopt him and claim him as a son, as the seven cities of Greece contended for Homer. The lamentations of Sancho and the niece and housekeeper are omitted here, as well as the new epitaphs upon his tomb; Samson Carrasco, however, put the following lines: A doughty gentleman lies here; A stranger all his life to fear; Nor in his death could Death prevail, In that last hour, to make him quail."], "Why does Sancho panic when he and Don Quixote enter Toboso?": [" \u201cMany,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cbut few they who deserve the name of knights.\u201d With these, and other discussions of the same sort, they passed that night and the following day, without anything worth mention happening to them, whereat Don Quixote was not a little dejected; but at length the next day, at daybreak, they descried the great city of El Toboso, at the sight of which Don Quixote\u2019s spirits rose and Sancho\u2019s fell, for he did not know Dulcinea\u2019s house, nor in all his life had he ever seen her, any more than his master; so that they were both uneasy, the one to see her, the other at not having seen her, and Sancho was at a loss to know what he was to do when his master sent him to El Toboso. In the end, Don Quixote made up his mind to enter the city at nightfall, and they waited until the time came among some oak trees that were near El Toboso; and when the moment they had agreed upon arrived, they made their entrance into the city, where something happened them that may fairly be called something. p08e.jpg (49K) Full Size CHAPTER IX. WHEREIN IS RELATED WHAT WILL BE SEEN THERE p09a.jpg (79K) Full Size \u2019Twas at the very midnight hour\u2014more or less\u2014when Don Quixote and Sancho quitted the wood and entered El Toboso. The town was in deep silence, for all the inhabitants were asleep, and stretched on the broad of their backs, as the saying is. The night was darkish, though Sancho would have been glad had it been quite dark, so as to find in the darkness an excuse for his blundering.", " The worthy carrier, whose unholy thoughts kept him awake, was aware of his doxy the moment she entered the door, and was listening attentively to all Don Quixote said; and jealous that the Asturian should have broken her word with him for another, drew nearer to Don Quixote\u2019s bed and stood still to see what would come of this talk which he could not understand; but when he perceived the wench struggling to get free and Don Quixote striving to hold her, not relishing the joke he raised his arm and delivered such a terrible cuff on the lank jaws of the amorous knight that he bathed all his mouth in blood, and not content with this he mounted on his ribs and with his feet tramped all over them at a pace rather smarter than a trot. The bed which was somewhat crazy and not very firm on its feet, unable to support the additional weight of the carrier, came to the ground, and at the mighty crash of this the innkeeper awoke and at once concluded that it must be some brawl of Maritornes\u2019, because after calling loudly to her he got no answer. With this suspicion he got up, and lighting a lamp hastened to the quarter where he had heard the disturbance. The wench, seeing that her master was coming and knowing that his temper was terrible, frightened and panic-stricken made for the bed of Sancho Panza, who still slept, and crouching upon it made a ball of herself. The innkeeper came in exclaiming, \u201cWhere art thou, strumpet?", " In the meantime turn thy attention to what happened his master the same night, and if thou dost not laugh thereat, at any rate thou wilt stretch thy mouth with a grin; for Don Quixote\u2019s adventures must be honoured either with wonder or with laughter. It is recorded, then, that as soon as Sancho had gone, Don Quixote felt his loneliness, and had it been possible for him to revoke the mandate and take away the government from him he would have done so. The duchess observed his dejection and asked him why he was melancholy; because, she said, if it was for the loss of Sancho, there were squires, duennas, and damsels in her house who would wait upon him to his full satisfaction. \u201cThe truth is, se\u00f1ora,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cthat I do feel the loss of Sancho; but that is not the main cause of my looking sad; and of all the offers your excellence makes me, I accept only the good-will with which they are made, and as to the remainder I entreat of your excellence to permit and allow me alone to wait upon myself in my chamber.\u201d \u201cIndeed, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote,\u201d said the duchess, \u201cthat must not be; four of my damsels, as beautiful as flowers, shall wait upon you.\u201d \u201cTo me,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cthey will not be flowers, but thorns to pierce my heart. They, or anything like them, shall as soon enter my chamber as fly. If your highness wishes to gratify me still further, though I deserve it not, permit me to please myself, and wait upon myself in my own room; for I place a barrier between my inclinations and my virtue, and I do not wish to break this rule through the generosity your highness is disposed to display towards me; and, in short, I will sleep in my clothes, sooner than allow anyone to undress me.\u201d \u201cSay no more, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote, say no more,\u201d said the duchess; \u201cI assure you I will give orders that not even a fly, not to say a damsel, shall enter your room.", " And it seems to me that, in governments, to make a beginning is everything; and maybe, after having been governor a fortnight, I\u2019ll take kindly to the work and know more about it than the field labour I have been brought up to.\u201d \u201cYou are right, Sancho,\u201d said the duchess, \u201cfor no one is born ready taught, and the bishops are made out of men and not out of stones. But to return to the subject we were discussing just now, the enchantment of the lady Dulcinea, I look upon it as certain, and something more than evident, that Sancho\u2019s idea of practising a deception upon his master, making him believe that the peasant girl was Dulcinea and that if he did not recognise her it must be because she was enchanted, was all a device of one of the enchanters that persecute Don Quixote. For in truth and earnest, I know from good authority that the coarse country wench who jumped up on the ass was and is Dulcinea del Toboso, and that worthy Sancho, though he fancies himself the deceiver, is the one that is deceived; and that there is no more reason to doubt the truth of this, than of anything else we never saw. Se\u00f1or Sancho Panza must know that we too have enchanters here that are well disposed to us, and tell us what goes on in the world, plainly and distinctly, without subterfuge or deception; and believe me, Sancho, that agile country lass was and is Dulcinea del Toboso, who is as much enchanted as the mother that bore her; and when we least expect it, we shall see her in her own proper form, and then Sancho will be disabused of the error he is under at present.\u201d \u201cAll that\u2019s very possible,\u201d said Sancho Panza; \u201cand now I\u2019m willing to believe what my master says about what he saw in the cave of Montesinos, where he says he saw the lady Dulcinea del Toboso in the very same dress and apparel that I said I had seen her in when I enchanted her all to please myself."], "Who does Sancho present to Don Quixote as Dulcinea?": [" And it seems to me that, in governments, to make a beginning is everything; and maybe, after having been governor a fortnight, I\u2019ll take kindly to the work and know more about it than the field labour I have been brought up to.\u201d \u201cYou are right, Sancho,\u201d said the duchess, \u201cfor no one is born ready taught, and the bishops are made out of men and not out of stones.

I think I can see them wandering all over El Toboso, looking like noddies, and asking for my lady Dulcinea; and even if they meet her in the middle of the street they won\u2019t know her any more than they would my father.\u201d \u201cPerhaps, Sancho,\u201d returned Don Quixote, \u201cthe enchantment does not go so far as to deprive conquered and presented giants and knights of the power of recognising Dulcinea; we will try by experiment with one or two of the first I vanquish and send to her, whether they see her or not, by commanding them to return and give me an account of what happened to them in this respect.\u201d \u201cI declare, I think what your worship has proposed is excellent,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cand that by this plan we shall find out what we want to know; and if it be that it is only from your worship she is hidden, the misfortune will be more yours than hers; but so long as the lady Dulcinea is well and happy, we on our part will make the best of it, and get on as well as we can, seeking our adventures, and leaving Time to take his own course; for he is the best physician for these and greater ailments.\u201d Don Quixote was about to reply to Sancho Panza, but he was prevented by a cart crossing the road full of the most diverse and strange personages and figures that could be imagined.", " He came to the duke\u2019s castle, and the duke informed him of the road and route Don Quixote had taken with the intention of being present at the jousts at Saragossa. He told him, too, of the jokes he had practised upon him, and of the device for the disenchantment of Dulcinea at the expense of Sancho\u2019s backside; and finally he gave him an account of the trick Sancho had played upon his master, making him believe that Dulcinea was enchanted and turned into a country wench; and of how the duchess, his wife, had persuaded Sancho that it was he himself who was deceived, inasmuch as Dulcinea was really enchanted; at which the bachelor laughed not a little, and marvelled as well at the sharpness and simplicity of Sancho as at the length to which Don Quixote\u2019s madness went. The duke begged of him if he found him (whether he overcame him or not) to return that way and let him know the result. This the bachelor did; he set out in quest of Don Quixote, and not finding him at Saragossa, he went on, and how he fared has been already told. He returned to the duke\u2019s castle and told him all, what the conditions of the combat were, and how Don Quixote was now, like a loyal knight-errant, returning to keep his promise of retiring to his village for a year, by which time, said the bachelor, he might perhaps be cured of his madness; for that was the object that had led him to adopt these disguises, as it was a sad thing for a gentleman of such good parts as Don Quixote to be a madman.", " Peace, for the love of God! Blush for what you have said, and take my advice, and forgive me, and marry at once in the first village where there is a curate; if not, here is our licentiate who will do the business beautifully; remember, I am old enough to give advice, and this I am giving comes pat to the purpose; for a sparrow in the hand is better than a vulture on the wing, and he who has the good to his hand and chooses the bad, that the good he complains of may not come to him.\u201d \u201cLook here, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote. \u201cIf thou art advising me to marry, in order that immediately on slaying the giant I may become king, and be able to confer favours on thee, and give thee what I have promised, let me tell thee I shall be able very easily to satisfy thy desires without marrying; for before going into battle I will make it a stipulation that, if I come out of it victorious, even I do not marry, they shall give me a portion of the kingdom, that I may bestow it upon whomsoever I choose, and when they give it to me upon whom wouldst thou have me bestow it but upon thee?\u201d \u201cThat is plain speaking,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cbut let your worship take care to choose it on the seacoast, so that if I don\u2019t like the life, I may be able to ship off my black vassals and deal with them as I have said; don\u2019t mind going to see my lady Dulcinea now, but go and kill this giant and let us finish off this business; for by God it strikes me it will be one of great honour and great profit.\u201d \u201cI hold thou art in the right of it, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand I will take thy advice as to accompanying the princess before going to see Dulcinea; but I counsel thee not to say anything to anyone, or to those who are with us, about what we have considered and discussed, for as Dulcinea is so decorous that she does not wish her thoughts to be known it is not right that I or anyone for me should disclose them.\u201d \u201cWell then, if that be so,\u201d said Sancho, \u201chow is it that your worship makes all those you overcome by your arm go to present themselves before my lady Dulcinea, this being the same thing as signing your name to it that you love her and are her lover?"], "Who does the Knight of the Wood claim to have vanquished?": [" Again, she bade me fling myself into the cavern of Cabra\u2014an unparalleled and awful peril\u2014and bring her a minute account of all that is concealed in those gloomy depths. I stopped the motion of the Giralda, I lifted the bulls of Guisando, I flung myself into the cavern and brought to light the secrets of its abyss; and my hopes are as dead as dead can be, and her scorn and her commands as lively as ever. To be brief, last of all she has commanded me to go through all the provinces of Spain and compel all the knights-errant wandering therein to confess that she surpasses all women alive to-day in beauty, and that I am the most valiant and the most deeply enamoured knight on earth; in support of which claim I have already travelled over the greater part of Spain, and have there vanquished several knights who have dared to contradict me; but what I most plume and pride myself upon is having vanquished in single combat that so famous knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, and made him confess that my Casildea is more beautiful than his Dulcinea; and in this one victory I hold myself to have conquered all the knights in the world; for this Don Quixote that I speak of has vanquished them all, and I having vanquished him, his glory, his fame, and his honour have passed and are transferred to my person; for The more the vanquished hath of fair renown, The greater glory gilds the victor\u2019s crown.", " Pray, your highnesses, leave this fool alone, for he will grind your souls between, not to say two, but two thousand proverbs, dragged in as much in season, and as much to the purpose as\u2014may God grant as much health to him, or to me if I want to listen to them!\u201d \u201cSancho Panza\u2019s proverbs,\u201d said the duchess, \u201cthough more in number than the Greek Commander\u2019s, are not therefore less to be esteemed for the conciseness of the maxims. For my own part, I can say they give me more pleasure than others that may be better brought in and more seasonably introduced.\u201d In pleasant conversation of this sort they passed out of the tent into the wood, and the day was spent in visiting some of the posts and hiding-places, and then night closed in, not, however, as brilliantly or tranquilly as might have been expected at the season, for it was then midsummer; but bringing with it a kind of haze that greatly aided the project of the duke and duchess; and thus, as night began to fall, and a little after twilight set in, suddenly the whole wood on all four sides seemed to be on fire, and shortly after, here, there, on all sides, a vast number of trumpets and other military instruments were heard, as if several troops of cavalry were passing through the wood. The blaze of the fire and the noise of the warlike instruments almost blinded the eyes and deafened the ears of those that stood by, and indeed of all who were in the wood.", " He of the White Moon, seeing then that the gentleman would not leave him, said, \u201cI know very well, se\u00f1or, what you have come for; it is to find out who I am; and as there is no reason why I should conceal it from you, while my servant here is taking off my armour I will tell you the true state of the case, without leaving out anything. You must know, se\u00f1or, that I am called the bachelor Samson Carrasco. I am of the same village as Don Quixote of La Mancha, whose craze and folly make all of us who know him feel pity for him, and I am one of those who have felt it most; and persuaded that his chance of recovery lay in quiet and keeping at home and in his own house, I hit upon a device for keeping him there. Three months ago, therefore, I went out to meet him as a knight-errant, under the assumed name of the Knight of the Mirrors, intending to engage him in combat and overcome him without hurting him, making it the condition of our combat that the vanquished should be at the disposal of the victor. What I meant to demand of him (for I regarded him as vanquished already) was that he should return to his own village, and not leave it for a whole year, by which time he might be cured. But fate ordered it otherwise, for he vanquished me and unhorsed me, and so my plan failed. He went his way, and I came back conquered, covered with shame, and sorely bruised by my fall, which was a particularly dangerous one.", " But hardly had the light of day made it possible to see and distinguish things, when the first object that presented itself to the eyes of Sancho Panza was the squire of the Grove\u2019s nose, which was so big that it almost overshadowed his whole body. It is, in fact, stated, that it was of enormous size, hooked in the middle, covered with warts, and of a mulberry colour like an egg-plant; it hung down two fingers\u2019 length below his mouth, and the size, the colour, the warts, and the bend of it, made his face so hideous, that Sancho, as he looked at him, began to tremble hand and foot like a child in convulsions, and he vowed in his heart to let himself be given two hundred buffets, sooner than be provoked to fight that monster. Don Quixote examined his adversary, and found that he already had his helmet on and visor lowered, so that he could not see his face; he observed, however, that he was a sturdily built man, but not very tall in stature. Over his armour he wore a surcoat or cassock of what seemed to be the finest cloth of gold, all bespangled with glittering mirrors like little moons, which gave him an extremely gallant and splendid appearance; above his helmet fluttered a great quantity of plumes, green, yellow, and white, and his lance, which was leaning against a tree, was very long and stout, and had a steel point more than a palm in length. Don Quixote observed all, and took note of all, and from what he saw and observed he concluded that the said knight must be a man of great strength, but he did not for all that give way to fear, like Sancho Panza; on the contrary, with a composed and dauntless air, he said to the Knight of the Mirrors, \u201cIf, sir knight, your great eagerness to fight has not banished your courtesy, by it I would entreat you to raise your visor a little, in order that I may see if the comeliness of your countenance corresponds with that of your equipment.\u201d \u201cWhether you come victorious or vanquished out of this emprise, sir knight,\u201d replied he of the Mirrors, \u201cyou will have more than enough time and leisure to see me; and if now I do not comply with your request, it is because it seems to me I should do a serious wrong to the fair Casildea de Vandalia in wasting time while I stopped to raise my visor before compelling you to confess what you are already aware I maintain.\u201d \u201cWell then,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cwhile we are mounting you can at least tell me if I am that Don Quixote whom you said you vanquished.\u201d \u201cTo that we answer you,\u201d said he of the Mirrors, \u201cthat you are as like the very knight I vanquished as one egg is like another, but as you say enchanters persecute you, I will not venture to say positively whether you are the said person or not.\u201d \u201cThat,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cis enough to convince me that you are under a deception; however, entirely to relieve you of it, let our horses be brought, and in less time than it would take you to raise your visor, if God, my lady, and my arm stand me in good stead, I shall see your face, and you shall see that I am not the vanquished Don Quixote you take me to be.\u201d With this, cutting short the colloquy, they mounted, and Don Quixote wheeled Rocinante round in order to take a proper distance to charge back upon his adversary, and he of the Mirrors did the same; but Don Quixote had not moved away twenty paces when he heard himself called by the other, and, each returning half-way, he of the Mirrors said to him, \u201cRemember, sir knight, that the terms of our combat are, that the vanquished, as I said before, shall be at the victor\u2019s disposal.\u201d \u201cI am aware of it already,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cprovided what is commanded and imposed upon the vanquished be things that do not transgress the limits of chivalry.\u201d \u201cThat is understood,\u201d replied he of the Mirrors."], "Who is the Knight of the Wood /Knight of the Mirrors?": [" In fine, both master and man remained under the delusion; and, down in the mouth, and out of luck, he of the Mirrors and his squire parted from Don Quixote and Sancho, he meaning to go look for some village where he could plaster and strap his ribs. Don Quixote and Sancho resumed their journey to Saragossa, and on it the history leaves them in order that it may tell who the Knight of the Mirrors and his long-nosed squire were. p14e.jpg (56K) CHAPTER XV. WHEREIN IT IS TOLD AND KNOWN WHO THE KNIGHT OF THE MIRRORS AND HIS SQUIRE WERE p15a.jpg (122K) Full Size Don Quixote went off satisfied, elated, and vain-glorious in the highest degree at having won a victory over such a valiant knight as he fancied him of the Mirrors to be, and one from whose knightly word he expected to learn whether the enchantment of his lady still continued; inasmuch as the said vanquished knight was bound, under the penalty of ceasing to be one, to return and render him an account of what took place between him and her. But Don Quixote was of one mind, he of the Mirrors of another, for he just then had no thought of anything but finding some village where he could plaster himself, as has been said already. The history goes on to say, then, that when the bachelor Samson Carrasco recommended Don Quixote to resume his knight-errantry which he had laid aside, it was in consequence of having been previously in conclave with the curate and the barber on the means to be adopted to induce Don Quixote to stay at home in peace and quiet without worrying himself with his ill-starred adventures; at which consultation it was decided by the unanimous vote of all, and on the special advice of Carrasco, that Don Quixote should be allowed to go, as it seemed impossible to restrain him, and that Samson should sally forth to meet him as a knight-errant, and do battle with him, for there would be no difficulty about a cause, and vanquish him, that being looked upon as an easy matter; and that it should be agreed and settled that the vanquished was to be at the mercy of the victor.", " But hardly had the light of day made it possible to see and distinguish things, when the first object that presented itself to the eyes of Sancho Panza was the squire of the Grove\u2019s nose, which was so big that it almost overshadowed his whole body.

and if now I do not comply with your request, it is because it seems to me I should do a serious wrong to the fair Casildea de Vandalia in wasting time while I stopped to raise my visor before compelling you to confess what you are already aware I maintain.\u201d \u201cWell then,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cwhile we are mounting you can at least tell me if I am that Don Quixote whom you said you vanquished.\u201d \u201cTo that we answer you,\u201d said he of the Mirrors, \u201cthat you are as like the very knight I vanquished as one egg is like another, but as you say enchanters persecute you, I will not venture to say positively whether you are the said person or not.\u201d \u201cThat,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cis enough to convince me that you are under a deception; however, entirely to relieve you of it, let our horses be brought, and in less time than it would take you to raise your visor, if God, my lady, and my arm stand me in good stead, I shall see your face, and you shall see that I am not the vanquished Don Quixote you take me to be.\u201d With this, cutting short the colloquy, they mounted, and Don Quixote wheeled Rocinante round in order to take a proper distance to charge back upon his adversary, and he of the Mirrors did the same; but Don Quixote had not moved away twenty paces when he heard himself called by the other, and, each returning half-way, he of the Mirrors said to him, \u201cRemember, sir knight, that the terms of our combat are, that the vanquished, as I said before, shall be at the victor\u2019s disposal.\u201d \u201cI am aware of it already,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cprovided what is commanded and imposed upon the vanquished be things that do not transgress the limits of chivalry.\u201d \u201cThat is understood,\u201d replied he of the Mirrors.", " Isn\u2019t it Tom Cecial, my neighbour and gossip?\u201d \u201cWhy, to be sure I am!\u201d returned the now unnosed squire; \u201cTom Cecial I am, gossip and friend Sancho Panza; and I\u2019ll tell you presently the means and tricks and falsehoods by which I have been brought here; but in the meantime, beg and entreat of your master not to touch, maltreat, wound, or slay the Knight of the Mirrors whom he has at his feet; because, beyond all dispute, it is the rash and ill-advised bachelor Samson Carrasco, our fellow townsman.\u201d At this moment he of the Mirrors came to himself, and Don Quixote perceiving it, held the naked point of his sword over his face, and said to him, \u201cYou are a dead man, knight, unless you confess that the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso excels your Casildea de Vandalia in beauty; and in addition to this you must promise, if you should survive this encounter and fall, to go to the city of El Toboso and present yourself before her on my behalf, that she deal with you according to her good pleasure; and if she leaves you free to do yours, you are in like manner to return and seek me out (for the trail of my mighty deeds will serve you as a guide to lead you to where I may be), and tell me what may have passed between you and her\u2014conditions which, in accordance with what we stipulated before our combat, do not transgress the just limits of knight-errantry.\u201d \u201cI confess,\u201d said the fallen knight, \u201cthat the dirty tattered shoe of the lady Dulcinea del Toboso is better than the ill-combed though clean beard of Casildea; and I promise to go and to return from her presence to yours, and to give you a full and particular account of all you demand of me.\u201d \u201cYou must also confess and believe,\u201d added Don Quixote, \u201cthat the knight you vanquished was not and could not be Don Quixote of La Mancha, but someone else in his likeness, just as I confess and believe that you, though you seem to be the bachelor Samson Carrasco, are not so, but some other resembling him, whom my enemies have here put before me in his shape, in order that I may restrain and moderate the vehemence of my wrath, and make a gentle use of the glory of my victory.\u201d \u201cI confess, hold, and think everything to be as you believe, hold, and think it,\u201d the crippled knight; \u201clet me rise, I entreat you; if, indeed, the shock of my fall will allow me, for it has left me in a sorry plight enough.\u201d Don Quixote helped him to rise, with the assistance of his squire Tom Cecial; from whom Sancho never took his eyes, and to whom he put questions, the replies to which furnished clear proof that he was really and truly the Tom Cecial he said; but the impression made on Sancho\u2019s mind by what his master said about the enchanters having changed the face of the Knight of the Mirrors into that of the bachelor Samson Carrasco, would not permit him to believe what he saw with his eyes.", " Don Quixote, fancying that his foe was coming down upon him flying, drove his spurs vigorously into Rocinante\u2019s lean flanks and made him scud along in such style that the history tells us that on this occasion only was he known to make something like running, for on all others it was a simple trot with him; and with this unparalleled fury he bore down where he of the Mirrors stood digging his spurs into his horse up to buttons, without being able to make him stir a finger\u2019s length from the spot where he had come to a standstill in his course. At this lucky moment and crisis, Don Quixote came upon his adversary, in trouble with his horse, and embarrassed with his lance, which he either could not manage, or had no time to lay in rest. Don Quixote, however, paid no attention to these difficulties, and in perfect safety to himself and without any risk encountered him of the Mirrors with such force that he brought him to the ground in spite of himself over the haunches of his horse, and with so heavy a fall that he lay to all appearance dead, not stirring hand or foot. The instant Sancho saw him fall he slid down from the cork tree, and made all haste to where his master was, who, dismounting from Rocinante, went and stood over him of the Mirrors, and unlacing his helmet to see if he was dead, and to give him air if he should happen to be alive, he saw\u2014who can say what he saw, without filling all who hear it with astonishment, wonder, and awe?"], "How does Don Diego de Miranda dress?": [" \u201cWhat dost thou think of this, Sancho?\u201d said Don Quixote. \u201cAre there any enchantments that can prevail against true valour? The enchanters may be able to rob me of good fortune, but of fortitude and courage they cannot.\u201d Sancho paid the crowns, the carter put to, the keeper kissed Don Quixote\u2019s hands for the bounty bestowed upon him, and promised to give an account of the valiant exploit to the King himself, as soon as he saw him at court. \u201cThen,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cif his Majesty should happen to ask who performed it, you must say THE KNIGHT OF THE LIONS; for it is my desire that into this the name I have hitherto borne of Knight of the Rueful Countenance be from this time forward changed, altered, transformed, and turned; and in this I follow the ancient usage of knights-errant, who changed their names when they pleased, or when it suited their purpose.\u201d The cart went its way, and Don Quixote, Sancho, and he of the green gaban went theirs. All this time, Don Diego de Miranda had not spoken a word, being entirely taken up with observing and noting all that Don Quixote did and said, and the opinion he formed was that he was a man of brains gone mad, and a madman on the verge of rationality. The first part of his history had not yet reached him, for, had he read it, the amazement with which his words and deeds filled him would have vanished, as he would then have understood the nature of his madness; but knowing nothing of it, he took him to be rational one moment, and crazy the next, for what he said was sensible, elegant, and well expressed, and what he did, absurd, rash, and foolish; and said he to himself, \u201cWhat could be madder than putting on a helmet full of curds, and then persuading oneself that enchanters are softening one\u2019s skull; or what could be greater rashness and folly than wanting to fight lions tooth and nail?\u201d Don Quixote roused him from these reflections and this soliloquy by saying, \u201cNo doubt, Se\u00f1or Don Diego de Miranda, you set me down in your mind as a fool and a madman, and it would be no wonder if you did, for my deeds do not argue anything else.", " OF WHAT HAPPENED DON QUIXOTE IN THE CASTLE OR HOUSE OF THE KNIGHT OF THE GREEN GABAN, TOGETHER WITH OTHER MATTERS OUT OF THE COMMON p18a.jpg (133K) Full Size Don Quixote found Don Diego de Miranda\u2019s house built in village style, with his arms in rough stone over the street door; in the patio was the store-room, and at the entrance the cellar, with plenty of wine-jars standing round, which, coming from El Toboso, brought back to his memory his enchanted and transformed Dulcinea; and with a sigh, and not thinking of what he was saying, or in whose presence he was, he exclaimed- \u201cO ye sweet treasures, to my sorrow found! Once sweet and welcome when \u2019twas heaven\u2019s good-will. \u201cO ye Tobosan jars, how ye bring back to my memory the sweet object of my bitter regrets!\u201d p18b.jpg (300K) Full Size The student poet, Don Diego\u2019s son, who had come out with his mother to receive him, heard this exclamation, and both mother and son were filled with amazement at the extraordinary figure he presented; he, however, dismounting from Rocinante, advanced with great politeness to ask permission to kiss the lady\u2019s hand, while Don Diego said, \u201cSe\u00f1ora, pray receive with your wonted kindness Se\u00f1or Don Quixote of La Mancha, whom you see before you, a knight-errant, and the bravest and wisest in the world.\u201d The lady, whose name was Do\u00f1a Christina, received him with every sign of good-will and great courtesy, and Don Quixote placed himself at her service with an abundance of well-chosen and polished phrases.", " While Don Quixote was taking off his armour, Don Lorenzo (for so Don Diego\u2019s son was called) took the opportunity to say to his father, \u201cWhat are we to make of this gentleman you have brought home to us, sir? For his name, his appearance, and your describing him as a knight-errant have completely puzzled my mother and me.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say, my son,\u201d replied. Don Diego; \u201call I can tell thee is that I have seen him act the acts of the greatest madman in the world, and heard him make observations so sensible that they efface and undo all he does; do thou talk to him and feel the pulse of his wits, and as thou art shrewd, form the most reasonable conclusion thou canst as to his wisdom or folly; though, to tell the truth, I am more inclined to take him to be mad than sane.\u201d With this Don Lorenzo went away to entertain Don Quixote as has been said, and in the course of the conversation that passed between them Don Quixote said to Don Lorenzo, \u201cYour father, Se\u00f1or Don Diego de Miranda, has told me of the rare abilities and subtle intellect you possess, and, above all, that you are a great poet.\u201d \u201cA poet, it may be,\u201d replied Don Lorenzo, \u201cbut a great one, by no means. It is true that I am somewhat given to poetry and to reading good poets, but not so much so as to justify the title of \u2018great\u2019 which my father gives me.\u201d \u201cI do not dislike that modesty,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cfor there is no poet who is not conceited and does not think he is the best poet in the world.\u201d \u201cThere is no rule without an exception,\u201d said Don Lorenzo; \u201cthere may be some who are poets and yet do not think they are.\u201d \u201cVery few,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cbut tell me, what verses are those which you have now in hand, and which your father tells me keep you somewhat restless and absorbed?", " The first thing he did was to make Don Quixote take off his armour, and lead him, in that tight chamois suit we have already described and depicted more than once, out on a balcony overhanging one of the chief streets of the city, in full view of the crowd and of the boys, who gazed at him as they would at a monkey. The cavaliers in livery careered before him again as though it were for him alone, and not to enliven the festival of the day, that they wore it, and Sancho was in high delight, for it seemed to him that, how he knew not, he had fallen upon another Camacho\u2019s wedding, another house like Don Diego de Miranda\u2019s, another castle like the duke\u2019s. Some of Don Antonio\u2019s friends dined with him that day, and all showed honour to Don Quixote and treated him as a knight-errant, and he becoming puffed up and exalted in consequence could not contain himself for satisfaction. Such were the drolleries of Sancho that all the servants of the house, and all who heard him, were kept hanging upon his lips. While at table Don Antonio said to him, \u201cWe hear, worthy Sancho, that you are so fond of manjar blanco and forced-meat balls, that if you have any left, you keep them in your bosom for the next day.\u201d \u201cNo, se\u00f1or, that\u2019s not true,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cfor I am more cleanly than greedy, and my master Don Quixote here knows well that we two are used to live for a week on a handful of acorns or nuts."], "When Don Quixote challenges the lions and the lion tamer opens a cage, what does the lion then do?": [" Don Quixote merely observed him steadily, longing for him to leap from the cart and come to close quarters with him, when he hoped to hew him in pieces. So far did his unparalleled madness go; but the noble lion, more courteous than arrogant, not troubling himself about silly bravado, after having looked all round, as has been said, turned about and presented his hind-quarters to Don Quixote, and very coolly and tranquilly lay down again in the cage. Seeing this, Don Quixote ordered the keeper to take a stick to him and provoke him to make him come out. \u201cThat I won\u2019t,\u201d said the keeper; \u201cfor if I anger him, the first he\u2019ll tear in pieces will be myself. Be satisfied, sir knight, with what you have done, which leaves nothing more to be said on the score of courage, and do not seek to tempt fortune a second time. The lion has the door open; he is free to come out or not to come out; but as he has not come out so far, he will not come out to-day. Your worship\u2019s great courage has been fully manifested already; no brave champion, so it strikes me, is bound to do more than challenge his enemy and wait for him on the field; if his adversary does not come, on him lies the disgrace, and he who waits for him carries off the crown of victory.\u201d \u201cThat is true,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cclose the door, my friend, and let me have, in the best form thou canst, what thou hast seen me do, by way of certificate; to wit, that thou didst open for the lion, that I waited for him, that he did not come out, that I still waited for him, and that still he did not come out, and lay down again.", " They are male and female; the male is in that first cage and the female in the one behind, and they are hungry now, for they have eaten nothing to-day, so let your worship stand aside, for we must make haste to the place where we are to feed them.\u201d Hereupon, smiling slightly, Don Quixote exclaimed, \u201cLion-whelps to me! to me whelps of lions, and at such a time! Then, by God! those gentlemen who send them here shall see if I am a man to be frightened by lions. Get down, my good fellow, and as you are the keeper open the cages, and turn me out those beasts, and in the midst of this plain I will let them know who Don Quixote of La Mancha is, in spite and in the teeth of the enchanters who send them to me.\u201d \u201cSo, so,\u201d said the gentleman to himself at this; \u201cour worthy knight has shown of what sort he is; the curds, no doubt, have softened his skull and brought his brains to a head.\u201d At this instant Sancho came up to him, saying, \u201cSe\u00f1or, for God\u2019s sake do something to keep my master, Don Quixote, from tackling these lions; for if he does they\u2019ll tear us all to pieces here.\u201d \u201cIs your master then so mad,\u201d asked the gentleman, \u201cthat you believe and are afraid he will engage such fierce animals?\u201d \u201cHe is not mad,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cbut he is venturesome.\u201d \u201cI will prevent it,\u201d said the gentleman; and going over to Don Quixote, who was insisting upon the keeper\u2019s opening the cages, he said to him, \u201cSir knight, knights-errant should attempt adventures which encourage the hope of a successful issue, not those which entirely withhold it; for valour that trenches upon temerity savours rather of madness than of courage; moreover, these lions do not come to oppose you, nor do they dream of such a thing; they are going as presents to his Majesty, and it will not be right to stop them or delay their journey.\u201d \u201cGentle sir,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cyou go and mind your tame partridge and your bold ferret, and leave everyone to manage his own business; this is mine, and I know whether these gentlemen the lions come to me or not;\u201d and then turning to the keeper he exclaimed, \u201cBy all that\u2019s good, sir scoundrel, if you don\u2019t open the cages this very instant, I\u2019ll pin you to the cart with this lance.\u201d The carter, seeing the determination of this apparition in armour, said to him, \u201cPlease your worship, for charity\u2019s sake, se\u00f1or, let me unyoke the mules and place myself in safety along with them before the lions are turned out; for if they kill them on me I am ruined for life, for all I possess is this cart and mules.\u201d \u201cO man of little faith,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cget down and unyoke; you will soon see that you are exerting yourself for nothing, and that you might have spared yourself the trouble.\u201d The carter got down and with all speed unyoked the mules, and the keeper called out at the top of his voice, \u201cI call all here to witness that against my will and under compulsion I open the cages and let the lions loose, and that I warn this gentleman that he will be accountable for all the harm and mischief which these beasts may do, and for my salary and dues as well.", " I am not bound to do more; enchantments avaunt, and God uphold the right, the truth, and true chivalry! Close the door as I bade thee, while I make signals to the fugitives that have left us, that they may learn this exploit from thy lips.\u201d The keeper obeyed, and Don Quixote, fixing on the point of his lance the cloth he had wiped his face with after the deluge of curds, proceeded to recall the others, who still continued to fly, looking back at every step, all in a body, the gentleman bringing up the rear. Sancho, however, happening to observe the signal of the white cloth, exclaimed, \u201cMay I die, if my master has not overcome the wild beasts, for he is calling to us.\u201d They all stopped, and perceived that it was Don Quixote who was making signals, and shaking off their fears to some extent, they approached slowly until they were near enough to hear distinctly Don Quixote\u2019s voice calling to them. They returned at length to the cart, and as they came up, Don Quixote said to the carter, \u201cPut your mules to once more, brother, and continue your journey; and do thou, Sancho, give him two gold crowns for himself and the keeper, to compensate for the delay they have incurred through me.\u201d \u201cThat will I give with all my heart,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cbut what has become of the lions? Are they dead or alive?\u201d The keeper, then, in full detail, and bit by bit, described the end of the contest, exalting to the best of his power and ability the valour of Don Quixote, at the sight of whom the lion quailed, and would not and dared not come out of the cage, although he had held the door open ever so long; and showing how, in consequence of his having represented to the knight that it was tempting God to provoke the lion in order to force him out, which he wished to have done, he very reluctantly, and altogether against his will, had allowed the door to be closed.", " You, gentlemen, place yourselves in safety before I open, for I know they will do me no harm.\u201d Once more the gentleman strove to persuade Don Quixote not to do such a mad thing, as it was tempting God to engage in such a piece of folly. To this, Don Quixote replied that he knew what he was about. The gentleman in return entreated him to reflect, for he knew he was under a delusion. \u201cWell, se\u00f1or,\u201d answered Don Quixote, \u201cif you do not like to be a spectator of this tragedy, as in your opinion it will be, spur your flea-bitten mare, and place yourself in safety.\u201d Hearing this, Sancho with tears in his eyes entreated him to give up an enterprise compared with which the one of the windmills, and the awful one of the fulling mills, and, in fact, all the feats he had attempted in the whole course of his life, were cakes and fancy bread. \u201cLook ye, se\u00f1or,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cthere\u2019s no enchantment here, nor anything of the sort, for between the bars and chinks of the cage I have seen the paw of a real lion, and judging by that I reckon the lion such a paw could belong to must be bigger than a mountain.\u201d \u201cFear at any rate,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cwill make him look bigger to thee than half the world. Retire, Sancho, and leave me; and if I die here thou knowest our old compact; thou wilt repair to Dulcinea\u2014I say no more.\u201d To these he added some further words that banished all hope of his giving up his insane project."], "What does Don Diego\u2019s son, Don Lorenzo, do?": [" While Don Quixote was taking off his armour, Don Lorenzo (for so Don Diego\u2019s son was called) took the opportunity to say to his father, \u201cWhat are we to make of this gentleman you have brought home to us, sir? For his name, his appearance, and your describing him as a knight-errant have completely puzzled my mother and me.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say, my son,\u201d replied. Don Diego; \u201call I can tell thee is that I have seen him act the acts of the greatest madman in the world, and heard him make observations so sensible that they efface and undo all he does; do thou talk to him and feel the pulse of his wits, and as thou art shrewd, form the most reasonable conclusion thou canst as to his wisdom or folly; though, to tell the truth, I am more inclined to take him to be mad than sane.\u201d With this Don Lorenzo went away to entertain Don Quixote as has been said, and in the course of the conversation that passed between them Don Quixote said to Don Lorenzo, \u201cYour father, Se\u00f1or Don Diego de Miranda, has told me of the rare abilities and subtle intellect you possess, and, above all, that you are a great poet.\u201d \u201cA poet, it may be,\u201d replied Don Lorenzo, \u201cbut a great one, by no means. It is true that I am somewhat given to poetry and to reading good poets, but not so much so as to justify the title of \u2018great\u2019 which my father gives me.\u201d \u201cI do not dislike that modesty,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cfor there is no poet who is not conceited and does not think he is the best poet in the world.\u201d \u201cThere is no rule without an exception,\u201d said Don Lorenzo; \u201cthere may be some who are poets and yet do not think they are.\u201d \u201cVery few,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cbut tell me, what verses are those which you have now in hand, and which your father tells me keep you somewhat restless and absorbed?", " Don Diego and his son commended his laudable resolution, and bade him furnish himself with all he wanted from their house and belongings, as they would most gladly be of service to him; which, indeed, his personal worth and his honourable profession made incumbent upon them. The day of his departure came at length, as welcome to Don Quixote as it was sad and sorrowful to Sancho Panza, who was very well satisfied with the abundance of Don Diego\u2019s house, and objected to return to the starvation of the woods and wilds and the short-commons of his ill-stocked alforjas; these, however, he filled and packed with what he considered needful. On taking leave, Don Quixote said to Don Lorenzo, \u201cI know not whether I have told you already, but if I have I tell you once more, that if you wish to spare yourself fatigue and toil in reaching the inaccessible summit of the temple of fame, you have nothing to do but to turn aside out of the somewhat narrow path of poetry and take the still narrower one of knight-errantry, wide enough, however, to make you an emperor in the twinkling of an eye.\u201d In this speech Don Quixote wound up the evidence of his madness, but still better in what he added when he said, \u201cGod knows, I would gladly take Don Lorenzo with me to teach him how to spare the humble, and trample the proud under foot, virtues that are part and parcel of the profession I belong to; but since his tender age does not allow of it, nor his praiseworthy pursuits permit it, I will simply content myself with impressing it upon your worship that you will become famous as a poet if you are guided by the opinion of others rather than by your own; because no fathers or mothers ever think their own children ill-favoured, and this sort of deception prevails still more strongly in the case of the children of the brain.\u201d Both father and son were amazed afresh at the strange medley Don Quixote talked, at one moment sense, at another nonsense, and at the pertinacity and persistence he displayed in going through thick and thin in quest of his unlucky adventures, which he made the end and aim of his desires.", " All I shall do is to pray to heaven to deliver you from it, and show you how beneficial and necessary knights-errant were in days of yore, and how useful they would be in these days were they but in vogue; but now, for the sins of the people, sloth and indolence, gluttony and luxury are triumphant.\u201d \u201cOur guest has broken out on our hands,\u201d said Don Lorenzo to himself at this point; \u201cbut, for all that, he is a glorious madman, and I should be a dull blockhead to doubt it.\u201d Here, being summoned to dinner, they brought their colloquy to a close. Don Diego asked his son what he had been able to make out as to the wits of their guest. To which he replied, \u201cAll the doctors and clever scribes in the world will not make sense of the scrawl of his madness; he is a madman full of streaks, full of lucid intervals.\u201d They went in to dinner, and the repast was such as Don Diego said on the road he was in the habit of giving to his guests, neat, plentiful, and tasty; but what pleased Don Quixote most was the marvellous silence that reigned throughout the house, for it was like a Carthusian monastery. When the cloth had been removed, grace said and their hands washed, Don Quixote earnestly pressed Don Lorenzo to repeat to him his verses for the poetical tournament, to which he replied, \u201cNot to be like those poets who, when they are asked to recite their verses, refuse, and when they are not asked for them vomit them up, I will repeat my gloss, for which I do not expect any prize, having composed it merely as an exercise of ingenuity.\u201d \u201cA discerning friend of mine,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cwas of opinion that no one ought to waste labour in glossing verses; and the reason he gave was that the gloss can never come up to the text, and that often or most frequently it wanders away from the meaning and purpose aimed at in the glossed lines; and besides, that the laws of the gloss were too strict, as they did not allow interrogations, nor \u2018said he,\u2019 nor \u2018I say,\u2019 nor turning verbs into nouns, or altering the construction, not to speak of other restrictions and limitations that fetter gloss-writers, as you no doubt know.\u201d \u201cVerily, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote,\u201d said Don Lorenzo, \u201cI wish I could catch your worship tripping at a stretch, but I cannot, for you slip through my fingers like an eel.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand what you say, or mean by slipping,\u201d said Don Quixote.", " OF WHAT HAPPENED DON QUIXOTE IN THE CASTLE OR HOUSE OF THE KNIGHT OF THE GREEN GABAN, TOGETHER WITH OTHER MATTERS OUT OF THE COMMON p18a.jpg (133K) Full Size Don Quixote found Don Diego de Miranda\u2019s house built in village style, with his arms in rough stone over the street door; in the patio was the store-room, and at the entrance the cellar, with plenty of wine-jars standing round, which, coming from El Toboso, brought back to his memory his enchanted and transformed Dulcinea; and with a sigh, and not thinking of what he was saying, or in whose presence he was, he exclaimed- \u201cO ye sweet treasures, to my sorrow found! Once sweet and welcome when \u2019twas heaven\u2019s good-will. \u201cO ye Tobosan jars, how ye bring back to my memory the sweet object of my bitter regrets!\u201d p18b.jpg (300K) Full Size The student poet, Don Diego\u2019s son, who had come out with his mother to receive him, heard this exclamation, and both mother and son were filled with amazement at the extraordinary figure he presented; he, however, dismounting from Rocinante, advanced with great politeness to ask permission to kiss the lady\u2019s hand, while Don Diego said, \u201cSe\u00f1ora, pray receive with your wonted kindness Se\u00f1or Don Quixote of La Mancha, whom you see before you, a knight-errant, and the bravest and wisest in the world.\u201d The lady, whose name was Do\u00f1a Christina, received him with every sign of good-will and great courtesy, and Don Quixote placed himself at her service with an abundance of well-chosen and polished phrases."], "What decision has Quiteria made that elicits Sancho\u2019s praise but not Don Quixote\u2019s?": [" \u201cHold, sirs, hold!\u201d cried Don Quixote in a loud voice; \u201cwe have no right to take vengeance for wrongs that love may do to us: remember love and war are the same thing, and as in war it is allowable and common to make use of wiles and stratagems to overcome the enemy, so in the contests and rivalries of love the tricks and devices employed to attain the desired end are justifiable, provided they be not to the discredit or dishonour of the loved object. Quiteria belonged to Basilio and Basilio to Quiteria by the just and beneficent disposal of heaven. Camacho is rich, and can purchase his pleasure when, where, and as it pleases him. Basilio has but this ewe-lamb, and no one, however powerful he may be, shall take her from him; these two whom God hath joined man cannot separate; and he who attempts it must first pass the point of this lance;\u201d and so saying he brandished it so stoutly and dexterously that he overawed all who did not know him. But so deep an impression had the rejection of Quiteria made on Camacho\u2019s mind that it banished her at once from his thoughts; and so the counsels of the priest, who was a wise and kindly disposed man, prevailed with him, and by their means he and his partisans were pacified and tranquillised, and to prove it put up their swords again, inveighing against the pliancy of Quiteria rather than the craftiness of Basilio; Camacho maintaining that, if Quiteria as a maiden had such a love for Basilio, she would have loved him too as a married woman, and that he ought to thank heaven more for having taken her than for having given her.", " p21b.jpg (374K) Full Size On this the fair Quiteria, to all appearance distressed, grieved, and repentant, advanced without a word to where Basilio lay, his eyes already turned in his head, his breathing short and painful, murmuring the name of Quiteria between his teeth, and apparently about to die like a heathen and not like a Christian. Quiteria approached him, and kneeling, demanded his hand by signs without speaking. Basilio opened his eyes and gazing fixedly at her, said, \u201cO Quiteria, why hast thou turned compassionate at a moment when thy compassion will serve as a dagger to rob me of life, for I have not now the strength left either to bear the happiness thou givest me in accepting me as thine, or to suppress the pain that is rapidly drawing the dread shadow of death over my eyes? What I entreat of thee, O thou fatal star to me, is that the hand thou demandest of me and wouldst give me, be not given out of complaisance or to deceive me afresh, but that thou confess and declare that without any constraint upon thy will thou givest it to me as to thy lawful husband; for it is not meet that thou shouldst trifle with me at such a moment as this, or have recourse to falsehoods with one who has dealt so truly by thee.\u201d While uttering these words he showed such weakness that the bystanders expected each return of faintness would take his life with it. Then Quiteria, overcome with modesty and shame, holding in her right hand the hand of Basilio, said, \u201cNo force would bend my will; as freely, therefore, as it is possible for me to do so, I give thee the hand of a lawful wife, and take thine if thou givest it to me of thine own free will, untroubled and unaffected by the calamity thy hasty act has brought upon thee.\u201d \u201cYes, I give it,\u201d said Basilio, \u201cnot agitated or distracted, but with unclouded reason that heaven is pleased to grant me, thus do I give myself to be thy husband.\u201d \u201cAnd I give myself to be thy wife,\u201d said Quiteria, \u201cwhether thou livest many years, or they carry thee from my arms to the grave.\u201d \u201cFor one so badly wounded,\u201d observed Sancho at this point, \u201cthis young man has a great deal to say; they should make him leave off billing and cooing, and attend to his soul; for to my thinking he has it more on his tongue than at his teeth.\u201d Basilio and Quiteria having thus joined hands, the priest, deeply moved and with tears in his eyes, pronounced the blessing upon them, and implored heaven to grant an easy passage to the soul of the newly wedded man, who, the instant he received the blessing, started nimbly to his feet and with unparalleled effrontery pulled out the rapier that had been sheathed in his body.", " Don Quixote hearing the wounded man\u2019s entreaty, exclaimed aloud that what Basilio asked was just and reasonable, and moreover a request that might be easily complied with; and that it would be as much to Se\u00f1or Camacho\u2019s honour to receive the lady Quiteria as the widow of the brave Basilio as if he received her direct from her father. \u201cIn this case,\u201d said he, \u201cit will be only to say \u2018yes,\u2019 and no consequences can follow the utterance of the word, for the nuptial couch of this marriage must be the grave.\u201d Camacho was listening to all this, perplexed and bewildered and not knowing what to say or do; but so urgent were the entreaties of Basilio\u2019s friends, imploring him to allow Quiteria to give him her hand, so that his soul, quitting this life in despair, should not be lost, that they moved, nay, forced him, to say that if Quiteria were willing to give it he was satisfied, as it was only putting off the fulfillment of his wishes for a moment. At once all assailed Quiteria and pressed her, some with prayers, and others with tears, and others with persuasive arguments, to give her hand to poor Basilio; but she, harder than marble and more unmoved than any statue, seemed unable or unwilling to utter a word, nor would she have given any reply had not the priest bade her decide quickly what she meant to do, as Basilio now had his soul at his teeth, and there was no time for hesitation.", " At any rate, Camacho is free-handed, and it is his fancy to screen the whole meadow with boughs and cover it in overhead, so that the sun will have hard work if he tries to get in to reach the grass that covers the soil. He has provided dancers too, not only sword but also bell-dancers, for in his own town there are those who ring the changes and jingle the bells to perfection; of shoe-dancers I say nothing, for of them he has engaged a host. But none of these things, nor of the many others I have omitted to mention, will do more to make this a memorable wedding than the part which I suspect the despairing Basilio will play in it. This Basilio is a youth of the same village as Quiteria, and he lived in the house next door to that of her parents, of which circumstance Love took advantage to reproduce to the word the long-forgotten loves of Pyramus and Thisbe; for Basilio loved Quiteria from his earliest years, and she responded to his passion with countless modest proofs of affection, so that the loves of the two children, Basilio and Quiteria, were the talk and the amusement of the town. As they grew up, the father of Quiteria made up his mind to refuse Basilio his wonted freedom of access to the house, and to relieve himself of constant doubts and suspicions, he arranged a match for his daughter with the rich Camacho, as he did not approve of marrying her to Basilio, who had not so large a share of the gifts of fortune as of nature; for if the truth be told ungrudgingly, he is the most agile youth we know, a mighty thrower of the bar, a first-rate wrestler, and a great ball-player; he runs like a deer, and leaps better than a goat, bowls over the nine-pins as if by magic, sings like a lark, plays the guitar so as to make it speak, and, above all, handles a sword as well as the best.\u201d \u201cFor that excellence alone,\u201d said Don Quixote at this, \u201cthe youth deserves to marry, not merely the fair Quiteria, but Queen Guinevere herself, were she alive now, in spite of Launcelot and all who would try to prevent it.\u201d \u201cSay that to my wife,\u201d said Sancho, who had until now listened in silence, \u201cfor she won\u2019t hear of anything but each one marrying his equal, holding with the proverb \u2018each ewe to her like.\u2019 What I would like is that this good Basilio (for I am beginning to take a fancy to him already) should marry this lady Quiteria; and a blessing and good luck\u2014I meant to say the opposite\u2014on people who would prevent those who love one another from marrying.\u201d \u201cIf all those who love one another were to marry,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cit would deprive parents of the right to choose, and marry their children to the proper person and at the proper time; and if it was left to daughters to choose husbands as they pleased, one would be for choosing her father\u2019s servant, and another, someone she has seen passing in the street and fancies gallant and dashing, though he may be a drunken bully; for love and fancy easily blind the eyes of the judgment, so much wanted in choosing one\u2019s way of life; and the matrimonial choice is very liable to error, and it needs great caution and the special favour of heaven to make it a good one."], "What ploy does Basilio use to marry Quiteria, just as she is about to marry Camacho?": [" At any rate, Camacho is free-handed, and it is his fancy to screen the whole meadow with boughs and cover it in overhead, so that the sun will have hard work if he tries to get in to reach the grass that covers the soil.

But so deep an impression had the rejection of Quiteria made on Camacho\u2019s mind that it banished her at once from his thoughts; and so the counsels of the priest, who was a wise and kindly disposed man, prevailed with him, and by their means he and his partisans were pacified and tranquillised, and to prove it put up their swords again, inveighing against the pliancy of Quiteria rather than the craftiness of Basilio; Camacho maintaining that, if Quiteria as a maiden had such a love for Basilio, she would have loved him too as a married woman, and that he ought to thank heaven more for having taken her than for having given her.", " Don Quixote hearing the wounded man\u2019s entreaty, exclaimed aloud that what Basilio asked was just and reasonable, and moreover a request that might be easily complied with; and that it would be as much to Se\u00f1or Camacho\u2019s honour to receive the lady Quiteria as the widow of the brave Basilio as if he received her direct from her father. \u201cIn this case,\u201d said he, \u201cit will be only to say \u2018yes,\u2019 and no consequences can follow the utterance of the word, for the nuptial couch of this marriage must be the grave.\u201d Camacho was listening to all this, perplexed and bewildered and not knowing what to say or do; but so urgent were the entreaties of Basilio\u2019s friends, imploring him to allow Quiteria to give him her hand, so that his soul, quitting this life in despair, should not be lost, that they moved, nay, forced him, to say that if Quiteria were willing to give it he was satisfied, as it was only putting off the fulfillment of his wishes for a moment. At once all assailed Quiteria and pressed her, some with prayers, and others with tears, and others with persuasive arguments, to give her hand to poor Basilio; but she, harder than marble and more unmoved than any statue, seemed unable or unwilling to utter a word, nor would she have given any reply had not the priest bade her decide quickly what she meant to do, as Basilio now had his soul at his teeth, and there was no time for hesitation.", " p21b.jpg (374K) Full Size On this the fair Quiteria, to all appearance distressed, grieved, and repentant, advanced without a word to where Basilio lay, his eyes already turned in his head, his breathing short and painful, murmuring the name of Quiteria between his teeth, and apparently about to die like a heathen and not like a Christian. Quiteria approached him, and kneeling, demanded his hand by signs without speaking. Basilio opened his eyes and gazing fixedly at her, said, \u201cO Quiteria, why hast thou turned compassionate at a moment when thy compassion will serve as a dagger to rob me of life, for I have not now the strength left either to bear the happiness thou givest me in accepting me as thine, or to suppress the pain that is rapidly drawing the dread shadow of death over my eyes? What I entreat of thee, O thou fatal star to me, is that the hand thou demandest of me and wouldst give me, be not given out of complaisance or to deceive me afresh, but that thou confess and declare that without any constraint upon thy will thou givest it to me as to thy lawful husband; for it is not meet that thou shouldst trifle with me at such a moment as this, or have recourse to falsehoods with one who has dealt so truly by thee.\u201d While uttering these words he showed such weakness that the bystanders expected each return of faintness would take his life with it. Then Quiteria, overcome with modesty and shame, holding in her right hand the hand of Basilio, said, \u201cNo force would bend my will; as freely, therefore, as it is possible for me to do so, I give thee the hand of a lawful wife, and take thine if thou givest it to me of thine own free will, untroubled and unaffected by the calamity thy hasty act has brought upon thee.\u201d \u201cYes, I give it,\u201d said Basilio, \u201cnot agitated or distracted, but with unclouded reason that heaven is pleased to grant me, thus do I give myself to be thy husband.\u201d \u201cAnd I give myself to be thy wife,\u201d said Quiteria, \u201cwhether thou livest many years, or they carry thee from my arms to the grave.\u201d \u201cFor one so badly wounded,\u201d observed Sancho at this point, \u201cthis young man has a great deal to say; they should make him leave off billing and cooing, and attend to his soul; for to my thinking he has it more on his tongue than at his teeth.\u201d Basilio and Quiteria having thus joined hands, the priest, deeply moved and with tears in his eyes, pronounced the blessing upon them, and implored heaven to grant an easy passage to the soul of the newly wedded man, who, the instant he received the blessing, started nimbly to his feet and with unparalleled effrontery pulled out the rapier that had been sheathed in his body."], "What happens to Don Quixote when Sancho and Balsilio\u2019s cousin lower him into Montesino\u2019s Cave?": [" Don Quixote begged the fencing licentiate to find him a guide to show him the way to the cave of Montesinos, as he had a great desire to enter it and see with his own eyes if the wonderful tales that were told of it all over the country were true. The licentiate said he would get him a cousin of his own, a famous scholar, and one very much given to reading books of chivalry, who would have great pleasure in conducting him to the mouth of the very cave, and would show him the lakes of Ruidera, which were likewise famous all over La Mancha, and even all over Spain; and he assured him he would find him entertaining, for he was a youth who could write books good enough to be printed and dedicated to princes. The cousin arrived at last, leading an ass in foal, with a pack-saddle covered with a parti-coloured carpet or sackcloth; Sancho saddled Rocinante, got Dapple ready, and stocked his alforjas, along with which went those of the cousin, likewise well filled; and so, commending themselves to God and bidding farewell to all, they set out, taking the road for the famous cave of Montesinos. On the way Don Quixote asked the cousin of what sort and character his pursuits, avocations, and studies were, to which he replied that he was by profession a humanist, and that his pursuits and studies were making books for the press, all of great utility and no less entertainment to the nation. One was called \u201cThe Book of Liveries,\u201d in which he described seven hundred and three liveries, with their colours, mottoes, and ciphers, from which gentlemen of the court might pick and choose any they fancied for festivals and revels, without having to go a-begging for them from anyone, or puzzling their brains, as the saying is, to have them appropriate to their objects and purposes; \u201cfor,\u201d said he, \u201cI give the jealous, the rejected, the forgotten, the absent, what will suit them, and fit them without fail.", " For to my thinking it must have been our father Adam.\u201d \u201cSo it must,\u201d replied the cousin; \u201cfor there is no doubt but Adam had a head and hair; and being the first man in the world he would have scratched himself sometimes.\u201d \u201cSo I think,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cbut now tell me, who was the first tumbler in the world?\u201d \u201cReally, brother,\u201d answered the cousin, \u201cI could not at this moment say positively without having investigated it; I will look it up when I go back to where I have my books, and will satisfy you the next time we meet, for this will not be the last time.\u201d \u201cLook here, se\u00f1or,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cdon\u2019t give yourself any trouble about it, for I have just this minute hit upon what I asked you. The first tumbler in the world, you must know, was Lucifer, when they cast or pitched him out of heaven; for he came tumbling into the bottomless pit.\u201d \u201cYou are right, friend,\u201d said the cousin; and said Don Quixote, \u201cSancho, that question and answer are not thine own; thou hast heard them from someone else.\u201d \u201cHold your peace, se\u00f1or,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cfaith, if I take to asking questions and answering, I\u2019ll go on from this till to-morrow morning. Nay! to ask foolish things and answer nonsense I needn\u2019t go looking for help from my neighbours.\u201d \u201cThou hast said more than thou art aware of, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cfor there are some who weary themselves out in learning and proving things that, after they are known and proved, are not worth a farthing to the understanding or memory.\u201d In this and other pleasant conversation the day went by, and that night they put up at a small hamlet whence it was not more than two leagues to the cave of Montesinos, so the cousin told Don Quixote, adding, that if he was bent upon entering it, it would be requisite for him to provide himself with ropes, so that he might be tied and lowered into its depths.", " Don Quixote explained his wish, and begged him to ask his ape at once to tell him whether certain things which had happened to him in the cave of Montesinos were dreams or realities, for to him they appeared to partake of both. Upon this Master Pedro, without answering, went back to fetch the ape, and, having placed it in front of Don Quixote and Sancho, said: \u201cSee here, se\u00f1or ape, this gentleman wishes to know whether certain things which happened to him in the cave called the cave of Montesinos were false or true.\u201d On his making the usual sign the ape mounted on his left shoulder and seemed to whisper in his ear, and Master Pedro said at once, \u201cThe ape says that the things you saw or that happened to you in that cave are, part of them false, part true; and that he only knows this and no more as regards this question; but if your worship wishes to know more, on Friday next he will answer all that may be asked him, for his virtue is at present exhausted, and will not return to him till Friday, as he has said.\u201d \u201cDid I not say, se\u00f1or,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cthat I could not bring myself to believe that all your worship said about the adventures in the cave was true, or even the half of it?\u201d \u201cThe course of events will tell, Sancho,\u201d replied Don Quixote; \u201ctime, that discloses all things, leaves nothing that it does not drag into the light of day, though it be buried in the bosom of the earth.", " \u201cLittle better than an hour,\u201d replied Sancho. \u201cThat cannot be,\u201d returned Don Quixote, \u201cbecause night overtook me while I was there, and day came, and it was night again and day again three times; so that, by my reckoning, I have been three days in those remote regions beyond our ken.\u201d \u201cMy master must be right,\u201d replied Sancho; \u201cfor as everything that has happened to him is by enchantment, maybe what seems to us an hour would seem three days and nights there.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d said Don Quixote. \u201cAnd did your worship eat anything all that time, se\u00f1or?\u201d asked the cousin. \u201cI never touched a morsel,\u201d answered Don Quixote, \u201cnor did I feel hunger, or think of it.\u201d \u201cAnd do the enchanted eat?\u201d said the cousin. \u201cThey neither eat,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cnor are they subject to the greater excrements, though it is thought that their nails, beards, and hair grow.\u201d \u201cAnd do the enchanted sleep, now, se\u00f1or?\u201d asked Sancho. \u201cCertainly not,\u201d replied Don Quixote; \u201cat least, during those three days I was with them not one of them closed an eye, nor did I either.\u201d \u201cThe proverb, \u2018Tell me what company thou keepest and I\u2019ll tell thee what thou art,\u2019 is to the point here,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cyour worship keeps company with enchanted people that are always fasting and watching; what wonder is it, then, that you neither eat nor sleep while you are with them? But forgive me, se\u00f1or, if I say that of all this you have told us now, may God take me\u2014I was just going to say the devil\u2014if I believe a single particle.\u201d \u201cWhat!\u201d said the cousin, \u201chas Se\u00f1or Don Quixote, then, been lying?"], "What does Cide Hamete Benengali say about Don Quixote\u2019s story from Montesino\u2019s Cave?": [" WHEREIN ARE RELATED A THOUSAND TRIFLING MATTERS, AS TRIVIAL AS THEY ARE NECESSARY TO THE RIGHT UNDERSTANDING OF THIS GREAT HISTORY p24a.jpg (137K) Full Size He who translated this great history from the original written by its first author, Cide Hamete Benengeli, says that on coming to the chapter giving the adventures of the cave of Montesinos he found written on the margin of it, in Hamete\u2019s own hand, these exact words: \u201cI cannot convince or persuade myself that everything that is written in the preceding chapter could have precisely happened to the valiant Don Quixote; and for this reason, that all the adventures that have occurred up to the present have been possible and probable; but as for this one of the cave, I see no way of accepting it as true, as it passes all reasonable bounds. For me to believe that Don Quixote could lie, he being the most truthful gentleman and the noblest knight of his time, is impossible; he would not have told a lie though he were shot to death with arrows. On the other hand, I reflect that he related and told the story with all the circumstances detailed, and that he could not in so short a space have fabricated such a vast complication of absurdities; if, then, this adventure seems apocryphal, it is no fault of mine; and so, without affirming its falsehood or its truth, I write it down. Decide for thyself in thy wisdom, reader; for I am not bound, nor is it in my power, to do more; though certain it is they say that at the time of his death he retracted, and said he had invented it, thinking it matched and tallied with the adventures he had read of in his histories.\u201d And then he goes on to say: The cousin was amazed as well at Sancho\u2019s boldness as at the patience of his master, and concluded that the good temper the latter displayed arose from the happiness he felt at having seen his lady Dulcinea, even enchanted as she was; because otherwise the words and language Sancho had addressed to him deserved a thrashing; for indeed he seemed to him to have been rather impudent to his master, to whom he now observed, \u201cI, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote of La Mancha, look upon the time I have spent in travelling with your worship as very well employed, for I have gained four things in the course of it; the first is that I have made your acquaintance, which I consider great good fortune; the second, that I have learned what the cave of Montesinos contains, together with the transformations of Guadiana and of the lakes of Ruidera; which will be of use to me for the Spanish Ovid that I have in hand; the third, to have discovered the antiquity of cards, that they were in use at least in the time of Charlemagne, as may be inferred from the words you say Durandarte uttered when, at the end of that long spell while Montesinos was talking to him, he woke up and said, \u2018Patience and shuffle.\u2019 This phrase and expression he could not have learned while he was enchanted, but only before he had become so, in France, and in the time of the aforesaid emperor Charlemagne.", " Don Quixote explained his wish, and begged him to ask his ape at once to tell him whether certain things which had happened to him in the cave of Montesinos were dreams or realities, for to him they appeared to partake of both.

The notary was there at the time, and he said that in no book of chivalry had he ever read of any knight-errant dying in his bed so calmly and so like a Christian as Don Quixote, who amid the tears and lamentations of all present yielded up his spirit, that is to say died. On perceiving it the curate begged the notary to bear witness that Alonso Quixano the Good, commonly called Don Quixote of La Mancha, had passed away from this present life, and died naturally; and said he desired this testimony in order to remove the possibility of any other author save Cide Hamete Benengeli bringing him to life again falsely and making interminable stories out of his achievements. Such was the end of the Ingenious Gentleman of La Mancha, whose village Cide Hamete would not indicate precisely, in order to leave all the towns and villages of La Mancha to contend among themselves for the right to adopt him and claim him as a son, as the seven cities of Greece contended for Homer. The lamentations of Sancho and the niece and housekeeper are omitted here, as well as the new epitaphs upon his tomb; Samson Carrasco, however, put the following lines: A doughty gentleman lies here; A stranger all his life to fear; Nor in his death could Death prevail, In that last hour, to make him quail.", " Sancho having finished his supper, and left the landlord in the X condition, repaired to the room where his master was, and as he came in said, \u201cMay I die, sirs, if the author of this book your worships have got has any mind that we should agree; as he calls me glutton (according to what your worships say) I wish he may not call me drunkard too.\u201d \u201cBut he does,\u201d said Don Jeronimo; \u201cI cannot remember, however, in what way, though I know his words are offensive, and what is more, lying, as I can see plainly by the physiognomy of the worthy Sancho before me.\u201d \u201cBelieve me,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cthe Sancho and the Don Quixote of this history must be different persons from those that appear in the one Cide Hamete Benengeli wrote, who are ourselves; my master valiant, wise, and true in love, and I simple, droll, and neither glutton nor drunkard.\u201d \u201cI believe it,\u201d said Don Juan; \u201cand were it possible, an order should be issued that no one should have the presumption to deal with anything relating to Don Quixote, save his original author Cide Hamete; just as Alexander commanded that no one should presume to paint his portrait save Apelles.\u201d p60b.jpg (336K) Full Size \u201cLet him who will paint me,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cbut let him not abuse me; for patience will often break down when they heap insults upon it.\u201d \u201cNone can be offered to Se\u00f1or Don Quixote,\u201d said Don Juan, \u201cthat he himself will not be able to avenge, if he does not ward it off with the shield of his patience, which, I take it, is great and strong.\u201d A considerable portion of the night passed in conversation of this sort, and though Don Juan wished Don Quixote to read more of the book to see what it was all about, he was not to be prevailed upon, saying that he treated it as read and pronounced it utterly silly; and, if by any chance it should come to its author\u2019s ears that he had it in his hand, he did not want him to flatter himself with the idea that he had read it; for our thoughts, and still more our eyes, should keep themselves aloof from what is obscene and filthy."], "What does Master Peter\u2019s ape puppet do?": [" Don Quixote at once asked the landlord what this Master Pedro was, and what was the show and what was the ape he had with him; which the landlord replied, \u201cThis is a famous puppet-showman, who for some time past has been going about this Mancha de Aragon, exhibiting a show of the release of Melisendra by the famous Don Gaiferos, one of the best and best-represented stories that have been seen in this part of the kingdom for many a year; he has also with him an ape with the most extraordinary gift ever seen in an ape or imagined in a human being; for if you ask him anything, he listens attentively to the question, and then jumps on his master\u2019s shoulder, and pressing close to his ear tells him the answer which Master Pedro then delivers. He says a great deal more about things past than about things to come; and though he does not always hit the truth in every case, most times he is not far wrong, so that he makes us fancy he has got the devil in him. He gets two reals for every question if the ape answers; I mean if his master answers for him after he has whispered into his ear; and so it is believed that this same Master Pedro is very rich. He is a \u2018gallant man\u2019 as they say in Italy, and good company, and leads the finest life in the world; talks more than six, drinks more than a dozen, and all by his tongue, and his ape, and his show.\u201d Master Pedro now came back, and in a cart followed the show and the ape\u2014a big one, without a tail and with buttocks as bare as felt, but not vicious-looking.", " Don Quixote explained his wish, and begged him to ask his ape at once to tell him whether certain things which had happened to him in the cave of Montesinos were dreams or realities, for to him they appeared to partake of both.

Don Quixote was not very well satisfied with the divinations of the ape, as he did not think it proper that an ape should divine anything, either past or future; so while Master Pedro was arranging the show, he retired with Sancho into a corner of the stable, where, without being overheard by anyone, he said to him, \u201cLook here, Sancho, I have been seriously thinking over this ape\u2019s extraordinary gift, and have come to the conclusion that beyond doubt this Master Pedro, his master, has a pact, tacit or express, with the devil.\u201d \u201cIf the packet is express from the devil,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cit must be a very dirty packet no doubt; but what good can it do Master Pedro to have such packets?\u201d \u201cThou dost not understand me, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cI only mean he must have made some compact with the devil to infuse this power into the ape, that he may get his living, and after he has grown rich he will give him his soul, which is what the enemy of mankind wants; this I am led to believe by observing that the ape only answers about things past or present, and the devil\u2019s knowledge extends no further; for the future he knows only by guesswork, and that not always; for it is reserved for God alone to know the times and the seasons, and for him there is neither past nor future; all is present.", " \u201cLet him have them, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cnot to catch the ape, but to get drunk; and two hundred would I give this minute for the good news, to anyone who could tell me positively, that the lady Do\u00f1a Melisandra and Se\u00f1or Don Gaiferos were now in France and with their own people.\u201d \u201cNo one could tell us that better than my ape,\u201d said Master Pedro; \u201cbut there\u2019s no devil that could catch him now; I suspect, however, that affection and hunger will drive him to come looking for me to-night; but to-morrow will soon be here and we shall see.\u201d In short, the puppet-show storm passed off, and all supped in peace and good fellowship at Don Quixote\u2019s expense, for he was the height of generosity. Before it was daylight the man with the lances and halberds took his departure, and soon after daybreak the cousin and the page came to bid Don Quixote farewell, the former returning home, the latter resuming his journey, towards which, to help him, Don Quixote gave him twelve reals. Master Pedro did not care to engage in any more palaver with Don Quixote, whom he knew right well; so he rose before the sun, and having got together the remains of his show and caught his ape, he too went off to seek his adventures. The landlord, who did not know Don Quixote, was as much astonished at his mad freaks as at his generosity. To conclude, Sancho, by his master\u2019s orders, paid him very liberally, and taking leave of him they quitted the inn at about eight in the morning and took to the road, where we will leave them to pursue their journey, for this is necessary in order to allow certain other matters to be set forth, which are required to clear up this famous history."], "According to the man with the weapons, what behavior has provoked war between two neighbouring villages?": [" This peace is the true end of war; and war is only another name for arms.

This poverty he suffers from in various ways, hunger, or cold, or nakedness, or all together; but for all that it is not so extreme but that he gets something to eat, though it may be at somewhat unseasonable hours and from the leavings of the rich; for the greatest misery of the student is what they themselves call \u2018going out for soup,\u2019 and there is always some neighbour\u2019s brazier or hearth for them, which, if it does not warm, at least tempers the cold to them, and lastly, they sleep comfortably at night under a roof.", " See now who offers to become one; no less than the illustrious bachelor Samson Carrasco, the perpetual joy and delight of the courts of the Salamancan schools, sound in body, discreet, patient under heat or cold, hunger or thirst, with all the qualifications requisite to make a knight-errant\u2019s squire! But heaven forbid that, to gratify my own inclination, I should shake or shatter this pillar of letters and vessel of the sciences, and cut down this towering palm of the fair and liberal arts. Let this new Samson remain in his own country, and, bringing honour to it, bring honour at the same time on the grey heads of his venerable parents; for I will be content with any squire that comes to hand, as Sancho does not deign to accompany me.\u201d \u201cI do deign,\u201d said Sancho, deeply moved and with tears in his eyes; \u201cit shall not be said of me, master mine,\u201d he continued, \u201c\u2018the bread eaten and the company dispersed.\u2019 Nay, I come of no ungrateful stock, for all the world knows, but particularly my own town, who the Panzas from whom I am descended were; and, what is more, I know and have learned, by many good words and deeds, your worship\u2019s desire to show me favour; and if I have been bargaining more or less about my wages, it was only to please my wife, who, when she sets herself to press a point, no hammer drives the hoops of a cask as she drives one to do what she wants; but, after all, a man must be a man, and a woman a woman; and as I am a man anyhow, which I can\u2019t deny, I will be one in my own house too, let who will take it amiss; and so there\u2019s nothing more to do but for your worship to make your will with its codicil in such a way that it can\u2019t be provoked, and let us set out at once, to save Se\u00f1or Samson\u2019s soul from suffering, as he says his conscience obliges him to persuade your worship to sally out upon the world a third time; so I offer again to serve your worship faithfully and loyally, as well and better than all the squires that served knights-errant in times past or present.\u201d The bachelor was filled with amazement when he heard Sancho\u2019s phraseology and style of talk, for though he had read the first part of his master\u2019s history he never thought that he could be so droll as he was there described; but now, hearing him talk of a \u201cwill and codicil that could not be provoked,\u201d instead of \u201cwill and codicil that could not be revoked,\u201d he believed all he had read of him, and set him down as one of the greatest simpletons of modern times; and he said to himself that two such lunatics as master and man the world had never seen.", " Upon Don Quixote\u2019s approach a peasant called out, \u201cOne of these two gentlemen who come here, and who don\u2019t know the parties, will tell us what we ought to do about our wager.\u201d \u201cThat I will, certainly,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand according to the rights of the case, if I can manage to understand it.\u201d \u201cWell, here it is, worthy sir,\u201d said the peasant; \u201ca man of this village who is so fat that he weighs twenty stone challenged another, a neighbour of his, who does not weigh more than nine, to run a race. The agreement was that they were to run a distance of a hundred paces with equal weights; and when the challenger was asked how the weights were to be equalised he said that the other, as he weighed nine stone, should put eleven in iron on his back, and that in this way the twenty stone of the thin man would equal the twenty stone of the fat one.\u201d \u201cNot at all,\u201d exclaimed Sancho at once, before Don Quixote could answer; \u201cit\u2019s for me, that only a few days ago left off being a governor and a judge, as all the world knows, to settle these doubtful questions and give an opinion in disputes of all sorts.\u201d \u201cAnswer in God\u2019s name, Sancho my friend,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cfor I am not fit to give crumbs to a cat, my wits are so confused and upset.\u201d With this permission Sancho said to the peasants who stood clustered round him, waiting with open mouths for the decision to come from his, \u201cBrothers, what the fat man requires is not in reason, nor has it a shadow of justice in it; because, if it be true, as they say, that the challenged may choose the weapons, the other has no right to choose such as will prevent and keep him from winning.", " Her husband Guillermo died of grief at the death of so good a wife, leaving his daughter Marcela, a child and rich, to the care of an uncle of hers, a priest and prebendary in our village. The girl grew up with such beauty that it reminded us of her mother\u2019s, which was very great, and yet it was thought that the daughter\u2019s would exceed it; and so when she reached the age of fourteen to fifteen years nobody beheld her but blessed God that had made her so beautiful, and the greater number were in love with her past redemption. Her uncle kept her in great seclusion and retirement, but for all that the fame of her great beauty spread so that, as well for it as for her great wealth, her uncle was asked, solicited, and importuned, to give her in marriage not only by those of our town but of those many leagues round, and by the persons of highest quality in them. But he, being a good Christian man, though he desired to give her in marriage at once, seeing her to be old enough, was unwilling to do so without her consent, not that he had any eye to the gain and profit which the custody of the girl\u2019s property brought him while he put off her marriage; and, faith, this was said in praise of the good priest in more than one set in the town. For I would have you know, Sir Errant, that in these little villages everything is talked about and everything is carped at, and rest assured, as I am, that the priest must be over and above good who forces his parishioners to speak well of him, especially in villages.\u201d \u201cThat is the truth,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cbut go on, for the story is very good, and you, good Pedro, tell it with very good grace.\u201d \u201cMay that of the Lord not be wanting to me,\u201d said Pedro; \u201cthat is the one to have."], "The villagers who bray like asses attack ___.": [" Besides which, you have been told that it is folly to take offence at merely hearing a bray. I remember when I was a boy I brayed as often as I had a fancy, without anyone hindering me, and so elegantly and naturally that when I brayed all the asses in the town would bray; but I was none the less for that the son of my parents who were greatly respected; and though I was envied because of the gift by more than one of the high and mighty ones of the town, I did not care two farthings for it; and that you may see I am telling the truth, wait a bit and listen, for this art, like swimming, once learnt is never forgotten;\u201d and then, taking hold of his nose, he began to bray so vigorously that all the valleys around rang again. One of those, however, that stood near him, fancying he was mocking them, lifted up a long staff he had in his hand and smote him such a blow with it that Sancho dropped helpless to the ground. Don Quixote, seeing him so roughly handled, attacked the man who had struck him lance in hand, but so many thrust themselves between them that he could not avenge him. Far from it, finding a shower of stones rained upon him, and crossbows and muskets unnumbered levelled at him, he wheeled Rocinante round and, as fast as his best gallop could take him, fled from the midst of them, commending himself to God with all his heart to deliver him out of this peril, in dread every step of some ball coming in at his back and coming out at his breast, and every minute drawing his breath to see whether it had gone from him.", " I tried to drive him before me and bring him to you, but he is already so wild and shy that when I went near him he made off into the thickest part of the forest. If you have a mind that we two should go back and look for him, let me put up this she-ass at my house and I\u2019ll be back at once.\u2019 \u2018You will be doing me a great kindness,\u2019 said the owner of the ass, \u2018and I\u2019ll try to pay it back in the same coin.\u2019 It is with all these circumstances, and in the very same way I am telling it now, that those who know all about the matter tell the story. Well then, the two regidors set off on foot, arm in arm, for the forest, and coming to the place where they hoped to find the ass they could not find him, nor was he to be seen anywhere about, search as they might. Seeing, then, that there was no sign of him, the regidor who had seen him said to the other, \u2018Look here, gossip; a plan has occurred to me, by which, beyond a doubt, we shall manage to discover the animal, even if he is stowed away in the bowels of the earth, not to say the forest. Here it is. I can bray to perfection, and if you can ever so little, the thing\u2019s as good as done.\u2019 \u2018Ever so little did you say, gossip?\u2019 said the other; \u2018by God, I\u2019ll not give in to anybody, not even to the asses themselves.\u2019 \u2018We\u2019ll soon see,\u2019 said the second regidor, \u2018for my plan is that you should go one side of the forest, and I the other, so as to go all round about it; and every now and then you will bray and I will bray; and it cannot be but that the ass will hear us, and answer us if he is in the forest.\u2019 To which the owner of the ass replied, \u2018It\u2019s an excellent plan, I declare, gossip, and worthy of your great genius;\u2019 and the two separating as agreed, it so fell out that they brayed almost at the same moment, and each, deceived by the braying of the other, ran to look, fancying the ass had turned up at last.", " halt! ye merry, jovial crew! I want to teach you how to treat asses and animals that serve the squires of knights-errant for steeds.\u201d So loud were the shouts of Don Quixote, that those in the cart heard and understood them, and, guessing by the words what the speaker\u2019s intention was, Death in an instant jumped out of the cart, and the emperor, the devil carter and the angel after him, nor did the queen or the god Cupid stay behind; and all armed themselves with stones and formed in line, prepared to receive Don Quixote on the points of their pebbles. Don Quixote, when he saw them drawn up in such a gallant array with uplifted arms ready for a mighty discharge of stones, checked Rocinante and began to consider in what way he could attack them with the least danger to himself. As he halted Sancho came up, and seeing him disposed to attack this well-ordered squadron, said to him, \u201cIt would be the height of madness to attempt such an enterprise; remember, se\u00f1or, that against sops from the brook, and plenty of them, there is no defensive armour in the world, except to stow oneself away under a brass bell; and besides, one should remember that it is rashness, and not valour, for a single man to attack an army that has Death in it, and where emperors fight in person, with angels, good and bad, to help them; and if this reflection will not make you keep quiet, perhaps it will to know for certain that among all these, though they look like kings, princes, and emperors, there is not a single knight-errant.\u201d \u201cNow indeed thou hast hit the point, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cwhich may and should turn me from the resolution I had already formed.", " At first he imagined some regiment of soldiers was passing that way, and to see them he spurred Rocinante and mounted the hill. On reaching the top he saw at the foot of it over two hundred men, as it seemed to him, armed with weapons of various sorts, lances, crossbows, partisans, halberds, and pikes, and a few muskets and a great many bucklers. He descended the slope and approached the band near enough to see distinctly the flags, make out the colours and distinguish the devices they bore, especially one on a standard or ensign of white satin, on which there was painted in a very life-like style an ass like a little sard, with its head up, its mouth open and its tongue out, as if it were in the act and attitude of braying; and round it were inscribed in large characters these two lines\u2014 They did not bray in vain, Our alcaldes twain. From this device Don Quixote concluded that these people must be from the braying town, and he said so to Sancho, explaining to him what was written on the standard. At the same time be observed that the man who had told them about the matter was wrong in saying that the two who brayed were regidors, for according to the lines of the standard they were alcaldes. To which Sancho replied, \u201cSe\u00f1or, there\u2019s nothing to stick at in that, for maybe the regidors who brayed then came to be alcaldes of their town afterwards, and so they may go by both titles; moreover, it has nothing to do with the truth of the story whether the brayers were alcaldes or regidors, provided at any rate they did bray; for an alcalde is just as likely to bray as a regidor.\u201d They perceived, in short, clearly that the town which had been twitted had turned out to do battle with some other that had jeered it more than was fair or neighbourly."], "What is the real social station of the character referred to as \u201cCountess Trifaldi\u201d?": [" \u201cWho, se\u00f1or?\u201d said Sancho; \u201cI meddle for I have a right to meddle, as a squire who has learned the rules of courtesy in the school of your worship, the most courteous and best-bred knight in the whole world of courtliness; and in these things, as I have heard your worship say, as much is lost by a card too many as by a card too few, and to one who has his ears open, few words.\u201d \u201cSancho is right,\u201d said the duke; \u201cwe\u2019ll see what the countess is like, and by that measure the courtesy that is due to her.\u201d And now the drums and fife made their entrance as before; and here the author brought this short chapter to an end and began the next, following up the same adventure, which is one of the most notable in the history. p37e.jpg (21K) CHAPTER XXXVIII. WHEREIN IS TOLD THE DISTRESSED DUENNA\u2019S TALE OF HER MISFORTUNES p38a.jpg (54K) Full Size Following the melancholy musicians there filed into the garden as many as twelve duennas, in two lines, all dressed in ample mourning robes apparently of milled serge, with hoods of fine white gauze so long that they allowed only the border of the robe to be seen. Behind them came the Countess Trifaldi, the squire Trifaldin of the White Beard leading her by the hand, clad in the finest unnapped black baize, such that, had it a nap, every tuft would have shown as big as a Martos chickpea; the tail, or skirt, or whatever it might be called, ended in three points which were borne up by the hands of three pages, likewise dressed in mourning, forming an elegant geometrical figure with the three acute angles made by the three points, from which all who saw the peaked skirt concluded that it must be because of it the countess was called Trifaldi, as though it were Countess of the Three Skirts; and Benengeli says it was so, and that by her right name she was called the Countess Lobuna, because wolves bred in great numbers in her country; and if, instead of wolves, they had been foxes, she would have been called the Countess Zorruna, as it was the custom in those parts for lords to take distinctive titles from the thing or things most abundant in their dominions; this countess, however, in honour of the new fashion of her skirt, dropped Lobuna and took up Trifaldi.", " So that, Sancho, it will not do for us to uncover ourselves, for he who has us in charge will be responsible for us; and perhaps we are gaining an altitude and mounting up to enable us to descend at one swoop on the kingdom of Kandy, as the saker or falcon does on the heron, so as to seize it however high it may soar; and though it seems to us not half an hour since we left the garden, believe me we must have travelled a great distance.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how that may be,\u201d said Sancho; \u201call I know is that if the Se\u00f1ora Magallanes or Magalona was satisfied with this croup, she could not have been very tender of flesh.\u201d The duke, the duchess, and all in the garden were listening to the conversation of the two heroes, and were beyond measure amused by it; and now, desirous of putting a finishing touch to this rare and well-contrived adventure, they applied a light to Clavile\u00f1o\u2019s tail with some tow, and the horse, being full of squibs and crackers, immediately blew up with a prodigious noise, and brought Don Quixote and Sancho Panza to the ground half singed. By this time the bearded band of duennas, the Trifaldi and all, had vanished from the garden, and those that remained lay stretched on the ground as if in a swoon. Don Quixote and Sancho got up rather shaken, and, looking about them, were filled with amazement at finding themselves in the same garden from which they had started, and seeing such a number of people stretched on the ground; and their astonishment was increased when at one side of the garden they perceived a tall lance planted in the ground, and hanging from it by two cords of green silk a smooth white parchment on which there was the following inscription in large gold letters: \u201cThe illustrious knight Don Quixote of La Mancha has, by merely attempting it, finished and concluded the adventure of the Countess Trifaldi, otherwise called the Distressed Duenna; Malambruno is now satisfied on every point, the chins of the duennas are now smooth and clean, and King Don Clavijo and Queen Antonomasia in their original form; and when the squirely flagellation shall have been completed, the white dove shall find herself delivered from the pestiferous gerfalcons that persecute her, and in the arms of her beloved mate; for such is the decree of the sage Merlin, arch-enchanter of enchanters.\u201d As soon as Don Quixote had read the inscription on the parchment he perceived clearly that it referred to the disenchantment of Dulcinea, and returning hearty thanks to heaven that he had with so little danger achieved so grand an exploit as to restore to their former complexion the countenances of those venerable duennas, he advanced towards the duke and duchess, who had not yet come to themselves, and taking the duke by the hand he said, \u201cBe of good cheer, worthy sir, be of good cheer; it\u2019s nothing at all; the adventure is now over and without any harm done, as the inscription fixed on this post shows plainly.\u201d The duke came to himself slowly and like one recovering consciousness after a heavy sleep, and the duchess and all who had fallen prostrate about the garden did the same, with such demonstrations of wonder and amazement that they would have almost persuaded one that what they pretended so adroitly in jest had happened to them in reality.", " \u201cDon\u2019t you see, you animal,\u201d continued Sancho, \u201cthat it will be well for me to drop into some profitable government that will lift us out of the mire, and marry Mari-Sancha to whom I like; and you yourself will find yourself called \u2018Do\u00f1a Teresa Panza,\u2019 and sitting in church on a fine carpet and cushions and draperies, in spite and in defiance of all the born ladies of the town? No, stay as you are, growing neither greater nor less, like a tapestry figure\u2014Let us say no more about it, for Sanchica shall be a countess, say what you will.\u201d \u201cAre you sure of all you say, husband?\u201d replied Teresa. \u201cWell, for all that, I am afraid this rank of countess for my daughter will be her ruin. You do as you like, make a duchess or a princess of her, but I can tell you it will not be with my will and consent. I was always a lover of equality, brother, and I can\u2019t bear to see people give themselves airs without any right. They called me Teresa at my baptism, a plain, simple name, without any additions or tags or fringes of Dons or Do\u00f1as; Cascajo was my father\u2019s name, and as I am your wife, I am called Teresa Panza, though by right I ought to be called Teresa Cascajo; but \u2018kings go where laws like,\u2019 and I am content with this name without having the \u2018Don\u2019 put on top of it to make it so heavy that I cannot carry it; and I don\u2019t want to make people talk about me when they see me go dressed like a countess or governor\u2019s wife; for they will say at once, \u2018See what airs the slut gives herself!", " No, no, not that; marriage must come first in any business of this sort that I take in hand. But there was one hitch in this case, which was that of inequality of rank, Don Clavijo being a private gentleman, and the Princess Antonomasia, as I said, heiress to the kingdom. The entanglement remained for some time a secret, kept hidden by my cunning precautions, until I perceived that a certain expansion of waist in Antonomasia must before long disclose it, the dread of which made us all there take counsel together, and it was agreed that before the mischief came to light, Don Clavijo should demand Antonomasia as his wife before the Vicar, in virtue of an agreement to marry him made by the princess, and drafted by my wit in such binding terms that the might of Samson could not have broken it. The necessary steps were taken; the Vicar saw the agreement, and took the lady\u2019s confession; she confessed everything in full, and he ordered her into the custody of a very worthy alguacil of the court.\u201d \u201cAre there alguacils of the court in Kandy, too,\u201d said Sancho at this, \u201cand poets, and seguidillas? I swear I think the world is the same all over! But make haste, Se\u00f1ora Trifaldi; for it is late, and I am dying to know the end of this long story.\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d replied the countess. p38e.jpg (22K) CHAPTER XXXIX.

But after all there is no real antagonism between the two classes; there is no reason why what pleases the one should not please the other, or why a translator who makes it his aim to treat \u201cDon Quixote\u201d with the respect due to a great classic, should not be as acceptable even to the careless reader as the one who treats it as a famous old jest-book. It is not a question of caviare to the general, or, if it is, the fault rests with him who makes so. The method by which Cervantes won the ear of the Spanish people ought, mutatis mutandis, to be equally effective with the great majority of English readers. At any rate, even if there are readers to whom it is a matter of indifference, fidelity to the method is as much a part of the translator\u2019s duty as fidelity to the matter. If he can please all parties, so much the better; but his first duty is to those who look to him for as faithful a representation of his author as it is in his power to give them, faithful to the letter so long as fidelity is practicable, faithful to the spirit so far as he can make it. My purpose here is not to dogmatise on the rules of translation, but to indicate those I have followed, or at least tried to the best of my ability to follow, in the present instance.", " \u201cDon\u2019t you see, you animal,\u201d continued Sancho, \u201cthat it will be well for me to drop into some profitable government that will lift us out of the mire, and marry Mari-Sancha to whom I like; and you yourself will find yourself called \u2018Do\u00f1a Teresa Panza,\u2019 and sitting in church on a fine carpet and cushions and draperies, in spite and in defiance of all the born ladies of the town?

A fortnight might have gone by, so the story goes, since the ass had been missing, when, as the regidor who had lost it was standing in the plaza, another regidor of the same town said to him, \u2018Pay me for good news, gossip; your ass has turned up.\u2019 \u2018That I will, and well, gossip,\u2019 said the other; \u2018but tell us, where has he turned up?\u2019 \u2018In the forest,\u2019 said the finder; \u2018I saw him this morning without pack-saddle or harness of any sort, and so lean that it went to one\u2019s heart to see him."], "In the story the Countess tells Don Quixote, what is the name of the giant that punishes the princess?": [" \u201cWho, se\u00f1or?\u201d said Sancho; \u201cI meddle for I have a right to meddle, as a squire who has learned the rules of courtesy in the school of your worship, the most courteous and best-bred knight in the whole world of courtliness; and in these things, as I have heard your worship say, as much is lost by a card too many as by a card too few, and to one who has his ears open, few words.\u201d \u201cSancho is right,\u201d said the duke; \u201cwe\u2019ll see what the countess is like, and by that measure the courtesy that is due to her.\u201d And now the drums and fife made their entrance as before; and here the author brought this short chapter to an end and began the next, following up the same adventure, which is one of the most notable in the history. p37e.jpg (21K) CHAPTER XXXVIII. WHEREIN IS TOLD THE DISTRESSED DUENNA\u2019S TALE OF HER MISFORTUNES p38a.jpg (54K) Full Size Following the melancholy musicians there filed into the garden as many as twelve duennas, in two lines, all dressed in ample mourning robes apparently of milled serge, with hoods of fine white gauze so long that they allowed only the border of the robe to be seen. Behind them came the Countess Trifaldi, the squire Trifaldin of the White Beard leading her by the hand, clad in the finest unnapped black baize, such that, had it a nap, every tuft would have shown as big as a Martos chickpea; the tail, or skirt, or whatever it might be called, ended in three points which were borne up by the hands of three pages, likewise dressed in mourning, forming an elegant geometrical figure with the three acute angles made by the three points, from which all who saw the peaked skirt concluded that it must be because of it the countess was called Trifaldi, as though it were Countess of the Three Skirts; and Benengeli says it was so, and that by her right name she was called the Countess Lobuna, because wolves bred in great numbers in her country; and if, instead of wolves, they had been foxes, she would have been called the Countess Zorruna, as it was the custom in those parts for lords to take distinctive titles from the thing or things most abundant in their dominions; this countess, however, in honour of the new fashion of her skirt, dropped Lobuna and took up Trifaldi.", " \u201cDon\u2019t you see, you animal,\u201d continued Sancho, \u201cthat it will be well for me to drop into some profitable government that will lift us out of the mire, and marry Mari-Sancha to whom I like; and you yourself will find yourself called \u2018Do\u00f1a Teresa Panza,\u2019 and sitting in church on a fine carpet and cushions and draperies, in spite and in defiance of all the born ladies of the town? No, stay as you are, growing neither greater nor less, like a tapestry figure\u2014Let us say no more about it, for Sanchica shall be a countess, say what you will.\u201d \u201cAre you sure of all you say, husband?\u201d replied Teresa. \u201cWell, for all that, I am afraid this rank of countess for my daughter will be her ruin. You do as you like, make a duchess or a princess of her, but I can tell you it will not be with my will and consent. I was always a lover of equality, brother, and I can\u2019t bear to see people give themselves airs without any right. They called me Teresa at my baptism, a plain, simple name, without any additions or tags or fringes of Dons or Do\u00f1as; Cascajo was my father\u2019s name, and as I am your wife, I am called Teresa Panza, though by right I ought to be called Teresa Cascajo; but \u2018kings go where laws like,\u2019 and I am content with this name without having the \u2018Don\u2019 put on top of it to make it so heavy that I cannot carry it; and I don\u2019t want to make people talk about me when they see me go dressed like a countess or governor\u2019s wife; for they will say at once, \u2018See what airs the slut gives herself!", " IN WHICH IS CONTINUED THE STORY OF THE FAMOUS PRINCESS MICOMICONA, WITH OTHER DROLL ADVENTURES c37a.jpg (159K) Full Size To all this Sancho listened with no little sorrow at heart to see how his hopes of dignity were fading away and vanishing in smoke, and how the fair Princess Micomicona had turned into Dorothea, and the giant into Don Fernando, while his master was sleeping tranquilly, totally unconscious of all that had come to pass. Dorothea was unable to persuade herself that her present happiness was not all a dream; Cardenio was in a similar state of mind, and Luscinda\u2019s thoughts ran in the same direction. Don Fernando gave thanks to Heaven for the favour shown to him and for having been rescued from the intricate labyrinth in which he had been brought so near the destruction of his good name and of his soul; and in short everybody in the inn was full of contentment and satisfaction at the happy issue of such a complicated and hopeless business. The curate as a sensible man made sound reflections upon the whole affair, and congratulated each upon his good fortune; but the one that was in the highest spirits and good humour was the landlady, because of the promise Cardenio and the curate had given her to pay for all the losses and damage she had sustained through Don Quixote\u2019s means. Sancho, as has been already said, was the only one who was distressed, unhappy, and dejected; and so with a long face he went in to his master, who had just awoke, and said to him: \u201cSir Rueful Countenance, your worship may as well sleep on as much as you like, without troubling yourself about killing any giant or restoring her kingdom to the princess; for that is all over and settled now.\u201d \u201cI should think it was,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cfor I have had the most prodigious and stupendous battle with the giant that I ever remember having had all the days of my life; and with one back-stroke\u2014swish!\u2014I brought his head tumbling to the ground, and so much blood gushed forth from him that it ran in rivulets over the earth like water.\u201d \u201cLike red wine, your worship had better say,\u201d replied Sancho; \u201cfor I would have you know, if you don\u2019t know it, that the dead giant is a hacked wine-skin, and the blood four-and-twenty gallons of red wine that it had in its belly, and the cut-off head is the bitch that bore me; and the devil take it all.\u201d \u201cWhat art thou talking about, fool?\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cart thou in thy senses?\u201d \u201cLet your worship get up,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cand you will see the nice business you have made of it, and what we have to pay; and you will see the queen turned into a private lady called Dorothea, and other things that will astonish you, if you understand them.\u201d \u201cI shall not be surprised at anything of the kind,\u201d returned Don Quixote; \u201cfor if thou dost remember the last time we were here I told thee that everything that happened here was a matter of enchantment, and it would be no wonder if it were the same now.\u201d \u201cI could believe all that,\u201d replied Sancho, \u201cif my blanketing was the same sort of thing also; only it wasn\u2019t, but real and genuine; for I saw the landlord, who is here to-day, holding one end of the blanket and jerking me up to the skies very neatly and smartly, and with as much laughter as strength; and when it comes to be a case of knowing people, I hold for my part, simple and sinner as I am, that there is no enchantment about it at all, but a great deal of bruising and bad luck.\u201d \u201cWell, well, God will give a remedy,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201chand me my clothes and let me go out, for I want to see these transformations and things thou speakest of.\u201d Sancho fetched him his clothes; and while he was dressing, the curate gave Don Fernando and the others present an account of Don Quixote\u2019s madness and of the stratagem they had made use of to withdraw him from that Pena Pobre where he fancied himself stationed because of his lady\u2019s scorn.", " \u201cFirst of all, I would have you know, sirs, that my name is\u2014\u201d and here she stopped for a moment, for she forgot the name the curate had given her; but he came to her relief, seeing what her difficulty was, and said, \u201cIt is no wonder, se\u00f1ora, that your highness should be confused and embarrassed in telling the tale of your misfortunes; for such afflictions often have the effect of depriving the sufferers of memory, so that they do not even remember their own names, as is the case now with your ladyship, who has forgotten that she is called the Princess Micomicona, lawful heiress of the great kingdom of Micomicon; and with this cue your highness may now recall to your sorrowful recollection all you may wish to tell us.\u201d \u201cThat is the truth,\u201d said the damsel; \u201cbut I think from this on I shall have no need of any prompting, and I shall bring my true story safe into port, and here it is. The king my father, who was called Tinacrio the Sapient, was very learned in what they call magic arts, and became aware by his craft that my mother, who was called Queen Jaramilla, was to die before he did, and that soon after he too was to depart this life, and I was to be left an orphan without father or mother. But all this, he declared, did not so much grieve or distress him as his certain knowledge that a prodigious giant, the lord of a great island close to our kingdom, Pandafilando of the Scowl by name\u2014for it is averred that, though his eyes are properly placed and straight, he always looks askew as if he squinted, and this he does out of malignity, to strike fear and terror into those he looks at\u2014that he knew, I say, that this giant on becoming aware of my orphan condition would overrun my kingdom with a mighty force and strip me of all, not leaving me even a small village to shelter me; but that I could avoid all this ruin and misfortune if I were willing to marry him; however, as far as he could see, he never expected that I would consent to a marriage so unequal; and he said no more than the truth in this, for it has never entered my mind to marry that giant, or any other, let him be ever so great or enormous."], "How do the Duke and Duchess trick Sancho and Don Quixote into thinking they have flown on a wooden horse?": [" \u201cSo much the better,\u201d said the duke, \u201cfor many droll things cannot be said in few words; but not to lose time in talking, come, great Knight of the Rueful Countenance\u2014\u201d \u201cOf the Lions, your highness must say,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cfor there is no Rueful Countenance nor any such character now.\u201d \u201cHe of the Lions be it,\u201d continued the duke; \u201cI say, let Sir Knight of the Lions come to a castle of mine close by, where he shall be given that reception which is due to so exalted a personage, and which the duchess and I are wont to give to all knights-errant who come there.\u201d By this time Sancho had fixed and girthed Rocinante\u2019s saddle, and Don Quixote having got on his back and the duke mounted a fine horse, they placed the duchess in the middle and set out for the castle. The duchess desired Sancho to come to her side, for she found infinite enjoyment in listening to his shrewd remarks. Sancho required no pressing, but pushed himself in between them and the duke, who thought it rare good fortune to receive such a knight-errant and such a homely squire in their castle. p30e.jpg (54K) CHAPTER XXXI.br/> WHICH TREATS OF MANY AND GREAT MATTERS p31a.jpg (155K) Full Size Supreme was the satisfaction that Sancho felt at seeing himself, as it seemed, an established favourite with the duchess, for he looked forward to finding in her castle what he had found in Don Diego\u2019s house and in Basilio\u2019s; he was always fond of good living, and always seized by the forelock any opportunity of feasting himself whenever it presented itself.", " He came to the duke\u2019s castle, and the duke informed him of the road and route Don Quixote had taken with the intention of being present at the jousts at Saragossa. He told him, too, of the jokes he had practised upon him, and of the device for the disenchantment of Dulcinea at the expense of Sancho\u2019s backside; and finally he gave him an account of the trick Sancho had played upon his master, making him believe that Dulcinea was enchanted and turned into a country wench; and of how the duchess, his wife, had persuaded Sancho that it was he himself who was deceived, inasmuch as Dulcinea was really enchanted; at which the bachelor laughed not a little, and marvelled as well at the sharpness and simplicity of Sancho as at the length to which Don Quixote\u2019s madness went. The duke begged of him if he found him (whether he overcame him or not) to return that way and let him know the result. This the bachelor did; he set out in quest of Don Quixote, and not finding him at Saragossa, he went on, and how he fared has been already told. He returned to the duke\u2019s castle and told him all, what the conditions of the combat were, and how Don Quixote was now, like a loyal knight-errant, returning to keep his promise of retiring to his village for a year, by which time, said the bachelor, he might perhaps be cured of his madness; for that was the object that had led him to adopt these disguises, as it was a sad thing for a gentleman of such good parts as Don Quixote to be a madman.", " The history informs us, then, that before they reached the country house or castle, the duke went on in advance and instructed all his servants how they were to treat Don Quixote; and so the instant he came up to the castle gates with the duchess, two lackeys or equerries, clad in what they call morning gowns of fine crimson satin reaching to their feet, hastened out, and catching Don Quixote in their arms before he saw or heard them, said to him, \u201cYour highness should go and take my lady the duchess off her horse.\u201d p31b.jpg (334K) Full Size Don Quixote obeyed, and great bandying of compliments followed between the two over the matter; but in the end the duchess\u2019s determination carried the day, and she refused to get down or dismount from her palfrey except in the arms of the duke, saying she did not consider herself worthy to impose so unnecessary a burden on so great a knight. At length the duke came out to take her down, and as they entered a spacious court two fair damsels came forward and threw over Don Quixote\u2019s shoulders a large mantle of the finest scarlet cloth, and at the same instant all the galleries of the court were lined with the men-servants and women-servants of the household, crying, \u201cWelcome, flower and cream of knight-errantry!\u201d while all or most of them flung pellets filled with scented water over Don Quixote and the duke and duchess; at all which Don Quixote was greatly astonished, and this was the first time that he thoroughly felt and believed himself to be a knight-errant in reality and not merely in fancy, now that he saw himself treated in the same way as he had read of such knights being treated in days of yore.", " They placed him in the midst of them, and with much pomp and stateliness they conducted him into another room, where there was a sumptuous table laid with but four covers. The duchess and the duke came out to the door of the room to receive him, and with them a grave ecclesiastic, one of those who rule noblemen\u2019s houses; one of those who, not being born magnates themselves, never know how to teach those who are how to behave as such; one of those who would have the greatness of great folk measured by their own narrowness of mind; one of those who, when they try to introduce economy into the household they rule, lead it into meanness. One of this sort, I say, must have been the grave churchman who came out with the duke and duchess to receive Don Quixote. A vast number of polite speeches were exchanged, and at length, taking Don Quixote between them, they proceeded to sit down to table. The duke pressed Don Quixote to take the head of the table, and, though he refused, the entreaties of the duke were so urgent that he had to accept it. The ecclesiastic took his seat opposite to him, and the duke and duchess those at the sides. All this time Sancho stood by, gaping with amazement at the honour he saw shown to his master by these illustrious persons; and observing all the ceremonious pressing that had passed between the duke and Don Quixote to induce him to take his seat at the head of the table, he said, \u201cIf your worship will give me leave I will tell you a story of what happened in my village about this matter of seats.\u201d The moment Sancho said this Don Quixote trembled, making sure that he was about to say something foolish."], "What does Don Quixote want Sancho to believe, in exchange for him believing Sancho\u2019s story about the goats in heaven?": [" And it so happened we came by where the seven goats are, and by God and upon my soul, as in my youth I was a goatherd in my own country, as soon as I saw them I felt a longing to be among them for a little, and if I had not given way to it I think I\u2019d have burst. So I come and take, and what do I do? without saying anything to anybody, not even to my master, softly and quietly I got down from Clavile\u00f1o and amused myself with the goats\u2014which are like violets, like flowers\u2014for nigh three-quarters of an hour; and Clavile\u00f1o never stirred or moved from one spot.\u201d \u201cAnd while the good Sancho was amusing himself with the goats,\u201d said the duke, \u201chow did Se\u00f1or Don Quixote amuse himself?\u201d To which Don Quixote replied, \u201cAs all these things and such like occurrences are out of the ordinary course of nature, it is no wonder that Sancho says what he does; for my own part I can only say that I did not uncover my eyes either above or below, nor did I see sky or earth or sea or shore. It is true I felt that I was passing through the region of the air, and even that I touched that of fire; but that we passed farther I cannot believe; for the region of fire being between the heaven of the moon and the last region of the air, we could not have reached that heaven where the seven goats Sancho speaks of are without being burned; and as we were not burned, either Sancho is lying or Sancho is dreaming.\u201d \u201cI am neither lying nor dreaming,\u201d said Sancho; \u201conly ask me the tokens of those same goats, and you\u2019ll see by that whether I\u2019m telling the truth or not.\u201d \u201cTell us them then, Sancho,\u201d said the duchess.", " \u201cTwo of them,\u201d said Sancho, \u201care green, two blood-red, two blue, and one a mixture of all colours.\u201d \u201cAn odd sort of goat, that,\u201d said the duke; \u201cin this earthly region of ours we have no such colours; I mean goats of such colours.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s very plain,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cof course there must be a difference between the goats of heaven and the goats of the earth.\u201d \u201cTell me, Sancho,\u201d said the duke, \u201cdid you see any he-goat among those goats?\u201d \u201cNo, se\u00f1or,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cbut I have heard say that none ever passed the horns of the moon.\u201d They did not care to ask him anything more about his journey, for they saw he was in the vein to go rambling all over the heavens giving an account of everything that went on there, without having ever stirred from the garden. Such, in short, was the end of the adventure of the Distressed Duenna, which gave the duke and duchess laughing matter not only for the time being, but for all their lives, and Sancho something to talk about for ages, if he lived so long; but Don Quixote, coming close to his ear, said to him, \u201cSancho, as you would have us believe what you saw in heaven, I require you to believe me as to what I saw in the cave of Montesinos; I say no more.\u201d p41e.jpg (38K) CHAPTER XLII. OF THE COUNSELS WHICH DON QUIXOTE GAVE SANCHO PANZA BEFORE HE SET OUT TO GOVERN THE ISLAND, TOGETHER WITH OTHER WELL-CONSIDERED MATTERS p42a.jpg (120K) Full Size The duke and duchess were so well pleased with the successful and droll result of the adventure of the Distressed One, that they resolved to carry on the joke, seeing what a fit subject they had to deal with for making it all pass for reality.", " The fisherman got into the boat and carried one goat over; he came back and carried another over; he came back again, and again brought over another\u2014let your worship keep count of the goats the fisherman is taking across, for if one escapes the memory there will be an end of the story, and it will be impossible to tell another word of it. To proceed, I must tell you the landing place on the other side was miry and slippery, and the fisherman lost a great deal of time in going and coming; still he returned for another goat, and another, and another.\u201d \u201cTake it for granted he brought them all across,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand don\u2019t keep going and coming in this way, or thou wilt not make an end of bringing them over this twelvemonth.\u201d \u201cHow many have gone across so far?\u201d said Sancho. \u201cHow the devil do I know?\u201d replied Don Quixote. \u201cThere it is,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cwhat I told you, that you must keep a good count; well then, by God, there is an end of the story, for there is no going any farther.\u201d \u201cHow can that be?\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cis it so essential to the story to know to a nicety the goats that have crossed over, that if there be a mistake of one in the reckoning, thou canst not go on with it?\u201d \u201cNo, se\u00f1or, not a bit,\u201d replied Sancho; \u201cfor when I asked your worship to tell me how many goats had crossed, and you answered you did not know, at that very instant all I had to say passed away out of my memory, and, faith, there was much virtue in it, and entertainment.\u201d \u201cSo, then,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cthe story has come to an end?\u201d \u201cAs much as my mother has,\u201d said Sancho.", " And so he goes on with his story, saying that the day Don Quixote gave the counsels to Sancho, the same afternoon after dinner he handed them to him in writing so that he might get someone to read them to him. They had scarcely, however, been given to him when he let them drop, and they fell into the hands of the duke, who showed them to the duchess and they were both amazed afresh at the madness and wit of Don Quixote. To carry on the joke, then, the same evening they despatched Sancho with a large following to the village that was to serve him for an island. It happened that the person who had him in charge was a majordomo of the duke\u2019s, a man of great discretion and humour\u2014and there can be no humour without discretion\u2014and the same who played the part of the Countess Trifaldi in the comical way that has been already described; and thus qualified, and instructed by his master and mistress as to how to deal with Sancho, he carried out their scheme admirably. Now it came to pass that as soon as Sancho saw this majordomo he seemed in his features to recognise those of the Trifaldi, and turning to his master, he said to him, \u201cSe\u00f1or, either the devil will carry me off, here on this spot, righteous and believing, or your worship will own to me that the face of this majordomo of the duke\u2019s here is the very face of the Distressed One.\u201d Don Quixote regarded the majordomo attentively, and having done so, said to Sancho, \u201cThere is no reason why the devil should carry thee off, Sancho, either righteous or believing\u2014and what thou meanest by that I know not; the face of the Distressed One is that of the majordomo, but for all that the majordomo is not the Distressed One; for his being so would involve a mighty contradiction; but this is not the time for going into questions of the sort, which would be involving ourselves in an inextricable labyrinth."], "In actuality, what is the \u201cisle\u201d that the Duke and Duchess send Sancho to govern?": [" \u201cWhat! Another word-catcher!\u201d said Sancho; \u201cif that\u2019s to be the way we shall not make an end in a lifetime.\u201d \u201cMay God shorten mine, Sancho,\u201d returned the bachelor, \u201cif you are not the second person in the history, and there are even some who would rather hear you talk than the cleverest in the whole book; though there are some, too, who say you showed yourself over-credulous in believing there was any possibility in the government of that island offered you by Se\u00f1or Don Quixote.\u201d \u201cThere is still sunshine on the wall,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cand when Sancho is somewhat more advanced in life, with the experience that years bring, he will be fitter and better qualified for being a governor than he is at present.\u201d \u201cBy God, master,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cthe island that I cannot govern with the years I have, I\u2019ll not be able to govern with the years of Methuselah; the difficulty is that the said island keeps its distance somewhere, I know not where; and not that there is any want of head in me to govern it.\u201d \u201cLeave it to God, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cfor all will be and perhaps better than you think; no leaf on the tree stirs but by God\u2019s will.\u201d \u201cThat is true,\u201d said Samson; \u201cand if it be God\u2019s will, there will not be any want of a thousand islands, much less one, for Sancho to govern.\u201d \u201cI have seen governors in these parts,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cthat are not to be compared to my shoe-sole; and for all that they are called \u2018your lordship\u2019 and served on silver.\u201d \u201cThose are not governors of islands,\u201d observed Samson, \u201cbut of other governments of an easier kind: those that govern islands must at least know grammar.\u201d \u201cI could manage the gram well enough,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cbut for the mar I have neither leaning nor liking, for I don\u2019t know what it is; but leaving this matter of the government in God\u2019s hands, to send me wherever it may be most to his service, I may tell you, se\u00f1or bachelor Samson Carrasco, it has pleased me beyond measure that the author of this history should have spoken of me in such a way that what is said of me gives no offence; for, on the faith of a true squire, if he had said anything about me that was at all unbecoming an old Christian, such as I am, the deaf would have heard of it.\u201d \u201cThat would be working miracles,\u201d said Samson.", " Well, then, as this is clear to my mind, I can venture to make him believe things that have neither head nor tail, like that affair of the answer to the letter, and that other of six or eight days ago, which is not yet in history, that is to say, the affair of the enchantment of my lady Dulcinea; for I made him believe she is enchanted, though there\u2019s no more truth in it than over the hills of \u00dabeda.\u201d The duchess begged him to tell her about the enchantment or deception, so Sancho told the whole story exactly as it had happened, and his hearers were not a little amused by it; and then resuming, the duchess said, \u201cIn consequence of what worthy Sancho has told me, a doubt starts up in my mind, and there comes a kind of whisper to my ear that says, \u2018If Don Quixote be mad, crazy, and cracked, and Sancho Panza his squire knows it, and, notwithstanding, serves and follows him, and goes trusting to his empty promises, there can be no doubt he must be still madder and sillier than his master; and that being so, it will be cast in your teeth, se\u00f1ora duchess, if you give the said Sancho an island to govern; for how will he who does not know how to govern himself know how to govern others?\u2019\u201d \u201cBy God, se\u00f1ora,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cbut that doubt comes timely; but your grace may say it out, and speak plainly, or as you like; for I know what you say is true, and if I were wise I should have left my master long ago; but this was my fate, this was my bad luck; I can\u2019t help it, I must follow him; we\u2019re from the same village, I\u2019ve eaten his bread, I\u2019m fond of him, I\u2019m grateful, he gave me his ass-colts, and above all I\u2019m faithful; so it\u2019s quite impossible for anything to separate us, except the pickaxe and shovel.", " \u201cTwo of them,\u201d said Sancho, \u201care green, two blood-red, two blue, and one a mixture of all colours.\u201d \u201cAn odd sort of goat, that,\u201d said the duke; \u201cin this earthly region of ours we have no such colours; I mean goats of such colours.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s very plain,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cof course there must be a difference between the goats of heaven and the goats of the earth.\u201d \u201cTell me, Sancho,\u201d said the duke, \u201cdid you see any he-goat among those goats?\u201d \u201cNo, se\u00f1or,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cbut I have heard say that none ever passed the horns of the moon.\u201d They did not care to ask him anything more about his journey, for they saw he was in the vein to go rambling all over the heavens giving an account of everything that went on there, without having ever stirred from the garden. Such, in short, was the end of the adventure of the Distressed Duenna, which gave the duke and duchess laughing matter not only for the time being, but for all their lives, and Sancho something to talk about for ages, if he lived so long; but Don Quixote, coming close to his ear, said to him, \u201cSancho, as you would have us believe what you saw in heaven, I require you to believe me as to what I saw in the cave of Montesinos; I say no more.\u201d p41e.jpg (38K) CHAPTER XLII. OF THE COUNSELS WHICH DON QUIXOTE GAVE SANCHO PANZA BEFORE HE SET OUT TO GOVERN THE ISLAND, TOGETHER WITH OTHER WELL-CONSIDERED MATTERS p42a.jpg (120K) Full Size The duke and duchess were so well pleased with the successful and droll result of the adventure of the Distressed One, that they resolved to carry on the joke, seeing what a fit subject they had to deal with for making it all pass for reality.", " \u201cSo much the better,\u201d said the duke, \u201cfor many droll things cannot be said in few words; but not to lose time in talking, come, great Knight of the Rueful Countenance\u2014\u201d \u201cOf the Lions, your highness must say,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cfor there is no Rueful Countenance nor any such character now.\u201d \u201cHe of the Lions be it,\u201d continued the duke; \u201cI say, let Sir Knight of the Lions come to a castle of mine close by, where he shall be given that reception which is due to so exalted a personage, and which the duchess and I are wont to give to all knights-errant who come there.\u201d By this time Sancho had fixed and girthed Rocinante\u2019s saddle, and Don Quixote having got on his back and the duke mounted a fine horse, they placed the duchess in the middle and set out for the castle. The duchess desired Sancho to come to her side, for she found infinite enjoyment in listening to his shrewd remarks. Sancho required no pressing, but pushed himself in between them and the duke, who thought it rare good fortune to receive such a knight-errant and such a homely squire in their castle. p30e.jpg (54K) CHAPTER XXXI.br/> WHICH TREATS OF MANY AND GREAT MATTERS p31a.jpg (155K) Full Size Supreme was the satisfaction that Sancho felt at seeing himself, as it seemed, an established favourite with the duchess, for he looked forward to finding in her castle what he had found in Don Diego\u2019s house and in Basilio\u2019s; he was always fond of good living, and always seized by the forelock any opportunity of feasting himself whenever it presented itself."], "What kind of advice does Don Quixote offer Sancho before the latter\u2019s departure to become a governor?": [" In fine, Don Quixote and Sancho embraced one another and made friends, and by the advice and with the approval of the great Carrasco, who was now their oracle, it was arranged that their departure should take place three days thence, by which time they could have all that was requisite for the journey ready, and procure a closed helmet, which Don Quixote said he must by all means take. Samson offered him one, as he knew a friend of his who had it would not refuse it to him, though it was more dingy with rust and mildew than bright and clean like burnished steel. The curses which both housekeeper and niece poured out on the bachelor were past counting; they tore their hair, they clawed their faces, and in the style of the hired mourners that were once in fashion, they raised a lamentation over the departure of their master and uncle, as if it had been his death. Samson\u2019s intention in persuading him to sally forth once more was to do what the history relates farther on; all by the advice of the curate and barber, with whom he had previously discussed the subject. Finally, then, during those three days, Don Quixote and Sancho provided themselves with what they considered necessary, and Sancho having pacified his wife, and Don Quixote his niece and housekeeper, at nightfall, unseen by anyone except the bachelor, who thought fit to accompany them half a league out of the village, they set out for El Toboso, Don Quixote on his good Rocinante and Sancho on his old Dapple, his alforjas furnished with certain matters in the way of victuals, and his purse with money that Don Quixote gave him to meet emergencies.", " Sancho I was born and Sancho I mean to die. But for all that, if heaven were to make me a fair offer of an island or something else of the kind, without much trouble and without much risk, I am not such a fool as to refuse it; for they say, too, \u2018when they offer thee a heifer, run with a halter; and \u2018when good luck comes to thee, take it in.\u2019\u201d \u201cBrother Sancho,\u201d said Carrasco, \u201cyou have spoken like a professor; but, for all that, put your trust in God and in Se\u00f1or Don Quixote, for he will give you a kingdom, not to say an island.\u201d \u201cIt is all the same, be it more or be it less,\u201d replied Sancho; \u201cthough I can tell Se\u00f1or Carrasco that my master would not throw the kingdom he might give me into a sack all in holes; for I have felt my own pulse and I find myself sound enough to rule kingdoms and govern islands; and I have before now told my master as much.\u201d \u201cTake care, Sancho,\u201d said Samson; \u201chonours change manners, and perhaps when you find yourself a governor you won\u2019t know the mother that bore you.\u201d \u201cThat may hold good of those that are born in the ditches,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cnot of those who have the fat of an old Christian four fingers deep on their souls, as I have. Nay, only look at my disposition, is that likely to show ingratitude to anyone?\u201d \u201cGod grant it,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cwe shall see when the government comes; and I seem to see it already.\u201d He then begged the bachelor, if he were a poet, to do him the favour of composing some verses for him conveying the farewell he meant to take of his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, and to see that a letter of her name was placed at the beginning of each line, so that, at the end of the verses, \u201cDulcinea del Toboso\u201d might be read by putting together the first letters.", " Depend upon it when your master comes to be emperor (as he will beyond a doubt from the course his affairs are taking), it will be no easy matter to wrest the dignity from him, and he will be sore and sorry at heart to have been so long without becoming one.\u201d \u201cSe\u00f1or,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cit is my belief it\u2019s a good thing to be in command, if it\u2019s only over a drove of cattle.\u201d \u201cMay I be buried with you, Sancho,\u201d said the duke, \u201cbut you know everything; I hope you will make as good a governor as your sagacity promises; and that is all I have to say; and now remember to-morrow is the day you must set out for the government of the island, and this evening they will provide you with the proper attire for you to wear, and all things requisite for your departure.\u201d \u201cLet them dress me as they like,\u201d said Sancho; \u201chowever I\u2019m dressed I\u2019ll be Sancho Panza.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d said the duke; \u201cbut one\u2019s dress must be suited to the office or rank one holds; for it would not do for a jurist to dress like a soldier, or a soldier like a priest. You, Sancho, shall go partly as a lawyer, partly as a captain, for, in the island I am giving you, arms are needed as much as letters, and letters as much as arms.\u201d \u201cOf letters I know but little,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cfor I don\u2019t even know the A B C; but it is enough for me to have the Christus in my memory to be a good governor. As for arms, I\u2019ll handle those they give me till I drop, and then, God be my help!\u201d \u201cWith so good a memory,\u201d said the duke, \u201cSancho cannot go wrong in anything.\u201d Here Don Quixote joined them; and learning what passed, and how soon Sancho was to go to his government, he with the duke\u2019s permission took him by the hand, and retired to his room with him for the purpose of giving him advice as to how he was to demean himself in his office.", " Peace, for the love of God! Blush for what you have said, and take my advice, and forgive me, and marry at once in the first village where there is a curate; if not, here is our licentiate who will do the business beautifully; remember, I am old enough to give advice, and this I am giving comes pat to the purpose; for a sparrow in the hand is better than a vulture on the wing, and he who has the good to his hand and chooses the bad, that the good he complains of may not come to him.\u201d \u201cLook here, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote. \u201cIf thou art advising me to marry, in order that immediately on slaying the giant I may become king, and be able to confer favours on thee, and give thee what I have promised, let me tell thee I shall be able very easily to satisfy thy desires without marrying; for before going into battle I will make it a stipulation that, if I come out of it victorious, even I do not marry, they shall give me a portion of the kingdom, that I may bestow it upon whomsoever I choose, and when they give it to me upon whom wouldst thou have me bestow it but upon thee?\u201d \u201cThat is plain speaking,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cbut let your worship take care to choose it on the seacoast, so that if I don\u2019t like the life, I may be able to ship off my black vassals and deal with them as I have said; don\u2019t mind going to see my lady Dulcinea now, but go and kill this giant and let us finish off this business; for by God it strikes me it will be one of great honour and great profit.\u201d \u201cI hold thou art in the right of it, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand I will take thy advice as to accompanying the princess before going to see Dulcinea; but I counsel thee not to say anything to anyone, or to those who are with us, about what we have considered and discussed, for as Dulcinea is so decorous that she does not wish her thoughts to be known it is not right that I or anyone for me should disclose them.\u201d \u201cWell then, if that be so,\u201d said Sancho, \u201chow is it that your worship makes all those you overcome by your arm go to present themselves before my lady Dulcinea, this being the same thing as signing your name to it that you love her and are her lover?"], "According to Cervantes, whose arrival must Sancho await before he begins governing?": [" Gustave Dor\u00e9 makes it an elaborate fountain such as no arriero ever watered his mules at in the corral of any venta in Spain, and thereby entirely misses the point aimed at by Cervantes. It is the mean, prosaic, commonplace character of all the surroundings and circumstances that gives a significance to Don Quixote\u2019s vigil and the ceremony that follows. Cervantes\u2019 humour is for the most part of that broader and simpler sort, the strength of which lies in the perception of the incongruous. It is the incongruity of Sancho in all his ways, words, and works, with the ideas and aims of his master, quite as much as the wonderful vitality and truth to nature of the character, that makes him the most humorous creation in the whole range of fiction. That unsmiling gravity of which Cervantes was the first great master, \u201cCervantes\u2019 serious air,\u201d which sits naturally on Swift alone, perhaps, of later humourists, is essential to this kind of humour, and here again Cervantes has suffered at the hands of his interpreters. Nothing, unless indeed the coarse buffoonery of Phillips, could be more out of place in an attempt to represent Cervantes, than a flippant, would-be facetious style, like that of Motteux\u2019s version for example, or the sprightly, jaunty air, French translators sometimes adopt. It is the grave matter-of-factness of the narrative, and the apparent unconsciousness of the author that he is saying anything ludicrous, anything but the merest commonplace, that give its peculiar flavour to the humour of Cervantes.", " He taunts Cervantes with being old, with having lost his hand, with having been in prison, with being poor, with being friendless, accuses him of envy of Lope\u2019s success, of petulance and querulousness, and so on; and it was in this that the sting lay. Avellaneda\u2019s reason for this personal attack is obvious enough. Whoever he may have been, it is clear that he was one of the dramatists of Lope\u2019s school, for he has the impudence to charge Cervantes with attacking him as well as Lope in his criticism on the drama. His identification has exercised the best critics and baffled all the ingenuity and research that has been brought to bear on it. Navarrete and Ticknor both incline to the belief that Cervantes knew who he was; but I must say I think the anger he shows suggests an invisible assailant; it is like the irritation of a man stung by a mosquito in the dark. Cervantes from certain solecisms of language pronounces him to be an Aragonese, and Pellicer, an Aragonese himself, supports this view and believes him, moreover, to have been an ecclesiastic, a Dominican probably. Any merit Avellaneda has is reflected from Cervantes, and he is too dull to reflect much. \u201cDull and dirty\u201d will always be, I imagine, the verdict of the vast majority of unprejudiced readers. He is, at best, a poor plagiarist; all he can do is to follow slavishly the lead given him by Cervantes; his only humour lies in making Don Quixote take inns for castles and fancy himself some legendary or historical personage, and Sancho mistake words, invert proverbs, and display his gluttony; all through he shows a proclivity to coarseness and dirt, and he has contrived to introduce two tales filthier than anything by the sixteenth century novellieri and without their sprightliness.", " But to suppose Cervantes deliberately setting himself to expound any such idea in two stout quarto volumes is to suppose something not only very unlike the age in which he lived, but altogether unlike Cervantes himself, who would have been the first to laugh at an attempt of the sort made by anyone else. The extraordinary influence of the romances of chivalry in his day is quite enough to account for the genesis of the book. Some idea of the prodigious development of this branch of literature in the sixteenth century may be obtained from the scrutiny of Chapter VII, if the reader bears in mind that only a portion of the romances belonging to by far the largest group are enumerated. As to its effect upon the nation, there is abundant evidence. From the time when the Amadises and Palmerins began to grow popular down to the very end of the century, there is a steady stream of invective, from men whose character and position lend weight to their words, against the romances of chivalry and the infatuation of their readers. Ridicule was the only besom to sweep away that dust. That this was the task Cervantes set himself, and that he had ample provocation to urge him to it, will be sufficiently clear to those who look into the evidence; as it will be also that it was not chivalry itself that he attacked and swept away. Of all the absurdities that, thanks to poetry, will be repeated to the end of time, there is no greater one than saying that \u201cCervantes smiled Spain\u2019s chivalry away.\u201d In the first place there was no chivalry for him to smile away.", " All traces of the personality of Cervantes had by that time disappeared. Any floating traditions that may once have existed, transmitted from men who had known him, had long since died out, and of other record there was none; for the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were incurious as to \u201cthe men of the time,\u201d a reproach against which the nineteenth has, at any rate, secured itself, if it has produced no Shakespeare or Cervantes. All that Mayans y Siscar, to whom the task was entrusted, or any of those who followed him, Rios, Pellicer, or Navarrete, could do was to eke out the few allusions Cervantes makes to himself in his various prefaces with such pieces of documentary evidence bearing upon his life as they could find. This, however, has been done by the last-named biographer to such good purpose that he has superseded all predecessors. Thoroughness is the chief characteristic of Navarrete\u2019s work. Besides sifting, testing, and methodising with rare patience and judgment what had been previously brought to light, he left, as the saying is, no stone unturned under which anything to illustrate his subject might possibly be found. Navarrete has done all that industry and acumen could do, and it is no fault of his if he has not given us what we want. What Hallam says of Shakespeare may be applied to the almost parallel case of Cervantes: \u201cIt is not the register of his baptism, or the draft of his will, or the orthography of his name that we seek; no letter of his writing, no record of his conversation, no character of him drawn ... by a contemporary has been produced.\u201d It is only natural, therefore, that the biographers of Cervantes, forced to make brick without straw, should have recourse largely to conjecture, and that conjecture should in some instances come by degrees to take the place of established fact."], "What honorific title does Sancho refuse as governor of the town?": [" Sancho I was born and Sancho I mean to die. But for all that, if heaven were to make me a fair offer of an island or something else of the kind, without much trouble and without much risk, I am not such a fool as to refuse it; for they say, too, \u2018when they offer thee a heifer, run with a halter; and \u2018when good luck comes to thee, take it in.\u2019\u201d \u201cBrother Sancho,\u201d said Carrasco, \u201cyou have spoken like a professor; but, for all that, put your trust in God and in Se\u00f1or Don Quixote, for he will give you a kingdom, not to say an island.\u201d \u201cIt is all the same, be it more or be it less,\u201d replied Sancho; \u201cthough I can tell Se\u00f1or Carrasco that my master would not throw the kingdom he might give me into a sack all in holes; for I have felt my own pulse and I find myself sound enough to rule kingdoms and govern islands; and I have before now told my master as much.\u201d \u201cTake care, Sancho,\u201d said Samson; \u201chonours change manners, and perhaps when you find yourself a governor you won\u2019t know the mother that bore you.\u201d \u201cThat may hold good of those that are born in the ditches,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cnot of those who have the fat of an old Christian four fingers deep on their souls, as I have. Nay, only look at my disposition, is that likely to show ingratitude to anyone?\u201d \u201cGod grant it,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cwe shall see when the government comes; and I seem to see it already.\u201d He then begged the bachelor, if he were a poet, to do him the favour of composing some verses for him conveying the farewell he meant to take of his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, and to see that a letter of her name was placed at the beginning of each line, so that, at the end of the verses, \u201cDulcinea del Toboso\u201d might be read by putting together the first letters.", " Thimbraeus here, Ph\u0153bus there, now archer, now physician, father of poetry, inventor of music; thou that always risest and, notwithstanding appearances, never settest! To thee, O Sun, by whose aid man begetteth man, to thee I appeal to help me and lighten the darkness of my wit that I may be able to proceed with scrupulous exactitude in giving an account of the great Sancho Panza\u2019s government; for without thee I feel myself weak, feeble, and uncertain. To come to the point, then\u2014Sancho with all his attendants arrived at a village of some thousand inhabitants, and one of the largest the duke possessed. They informed him that it was called the island of Barataria, either because the name of the village was Baratario, or because of the joke by way of which the government had been conferred upon him. On reaching the gates of the town, which was a walled one, the municipality came forth to meet him, the bells rang out a peal, and the inhabitants showed every sign of general satisfaction; and with great pomp they conducted him to the principal church to give thanks to God, and then with burlesque ceremonies they presented him with the keys of the town, and acknowledged him as perpetual governor of the island of Barataria. The costume, the beard, and the fat squat figure of the new governor astonished all those who were not in on the secret, and even all who were, and they were not a few.", " So having laid their plans and given instructions to their servants and vassals how to behave to Sancho in his government of the promised island, the next day, that following Clavile\u00f1o\u2019s flight, the duke told Sancho to prepare and get ready to go and be governor, for his islanders were already looking out for him as for the showers of May. Sancho made him an obeisance, and said, \u201cEver since I came down from heaven, and from the top of it beheld the earth, and saw how little it is, the great desire I had to be a governor has been partly cooled in me; for what is there grand in being ruler on a grain of mustard seed, or what dignity or authority in governing half a dozen men about as big as hazel nuts; for, so far as I could see, there were no more on the whole earth? If your lordship would be so good as to give me ever so small a bit of heaven, were it no more than half a league, I\u2019d rather have it than the best island in the world.\u201d \u201cRecollect, Sancho,\u201d said the duke, \u201cI cannot give a bit of heaven, no not so much as the breadth of my nail, to anyone; rewards and favours of that sort are reserved for God alone. What I can give I give you, and that is a real, genuine island, compact, well proportioned, and uncommonly fertile and fruitful, where, if you know how to use your opportunities, you may, with the help of the world\u2019s riches, gain those of heaven.\u201d \u201cWell then,\u201d said Sancho, \u201clet the island come; and I\u2019ll try and be such a governor, that in spite of scoundrels I\u2019ll go to heaven; and it\u2019s not from any craving to quit my own humble condition or better myself, but from the desire I have to try what it tastes like to be a governor.\u201d \u201cIf you once make trial of it, Sancho,\u201d said the duke, \u201cyou\u2019ll eat your fingers off after the government, so sweet a thing is it to command and be obeyed.", " \u201cProceed, se\u00f1ora,\u201d said the majordomo, \u201cand finish your story of what has happened to you, for your words and tears are keeping us all in suspense.\u201d \u201cI have but little more to say, though many a tear to shed,\u201d said the damsel; \u201cfor ill-placed desires can only be paid for in some such way.\u201d The maiden\u2019s beauty had made a deep impression on the head-carver\u2019s heart, and he again raised his lantern for another look at her, and thought they were not tears she was shedding, but seed-pearl or dew of the meadow, nay, he exalted them still higher, and made Oriental pearls of them, and fervently hoped her misfortune might not be so great a one as her tears and sobs seemed to indicate. The governor was losing patience at the length of time the girl was taking to tell her story, and told her not to keep them waiting any longer; for it was late, and there still remained a good deal of the town to be gone over. She, with broken sobs and half-suppressed sighs, went on to say, \u201cMy misfortune, my misadventure, is simply this, that I entreated my brother to dress me up as a man in a suit of his clothes, and take me some night, when our father was asleep, to see the whole town; he, overcome by my entreaties, consented, and dressing me in this suit and himself in clothes of mine that fitted him as if made for him (for he has not a hair on his chin, and might pass for a very beautiful young girl), to-night, about an hour ago, more or less, we left the house, and guided by our youthful and foolish impulse we made the circuit of the whole town, and then, as we were about to return home, we saw a great troop of people coming, and my brother said to me, \u2018Sister, this must be the round, stir your feet and put wings to them, and follow me as fast as you can, lest they recognise us, for that would be a bad business for us;\u2019 and so saying he turned about and began, I cannot say to run but to fly; in less than six paces I fell from fright, and then the officer of justice came up and carried me before your worships, where I find myself put to shame before all these people as whimsical and vicious.\u201d \u201cSo then, se\u00f1ora,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cno other mishap has befallen you, nor was it jealousy that made you leave home, as you said at the beginning of your story?\u201d \u201cNothing has happened me,\u201d said she, \u201cnor was it jealousy that brought me out, but merely a longing to see the world, which did not go beyond seeing the streets of this town.\u201d The appearance of the tipstaffs with her brother in custody, whom one of them had overtaken as he ran away from his sister, now fully confirmed the truth of what the damsel said."], "What is in the bag that the servants lower onto Don Quixote\u2019s balcony as he sings a ballad for Dulcinea?": [" p026.jpg (316K) Full Size As chance would have it, when he had got to this line there happened to come by a peasant from his own village, a neighbour of his, who had been with a load of wheat to the mill, and he, seeing the man stretched there, came up to him and asked him who he was and what was the matter with him that he complained so dolefully. Don Quixote was firmly persuaded that this was the Marquis of Mantua, his uncle, so the only answer he made was to go on with his ballad, in which he told the tale of his misfortune, and of the loves of the Emperor\u2019s son and his wife all exactly as the ballad sings it. The peasant stood amazed at hearing such nonsense, and relieving him of the visor, already battered to pieces by blows, he wiped his face, which was covered with dust, and as soon as he had done so he recognised him and said, \u201cSe\u00f1or Quixada\u201d (for so he appears to have been called when he was in his senses and had not yet changed from a quiet country gentleman into a knight-errant), \u201cwho has brought your worship to this pass?\u201d But to all questions the other only went on with his ballad. Seeing this, the good man removed as well as he could his breastplate and backpiece to see if he had any wound, but he could perceive no blood nor any mark whatever. He then contrived to raise him from the ground, and with no little difficulty hoisted him upon his ass, which seemed to him to be the easiest mount for him; and collecting the arms, even to the splinters of the lance, he tied them on Rocinante, and leading him by the bridle and the ass by the halter he took the road for the village, very sad to hear what absurd stuff Don Quixote was talking.", " Now let your worships turn your eyes to that tower that appears there, which is supposed to be one of the towers of the alcazar of Saragossa, now called the Aljaferia; that lady who appears on that balcony dressed in Moorish fashion is the peerless Melisendra, for many a time she used to gaze from thence upon the road to France, and seek consolation in her captivity by thinking of Paris and her husband. Observe, too, a new incident which now occurs, such as, perhaps, never was seen. Do you not see that Moor, who silently and stealthily, with his finger on his lip, approaches Melisendra from behind? Observe now how he prints a kiss upon her lips, and what a hurry she is in to spit, and wipe them with the white sleeve of her smock, and how she bewails herself, and tears her fair hair as though it were to blame for the wrong. Observe, too, that the stately Moor who is in that corridor is King Marsilio of Sansue\u00f1a, who, having seen the Moor\u2019s insolence, at once orders him (though his kinsman and a great favourite of his) to be seized and given two hundred lashes, while carried through the streets of the city according to custom, with criers going before him and officers of justice behind; and here you see them come out to execute the sentence, although the offence has been scarcely committed; for among the Moors there are no indictments nor remands as with us.\u201d Here Don Quixote called out, \u201cChild, child, go straight on with your story, and don\u2019t run into curves and slants, for to establish a fact clearly there is need of a great deal of proof and confirmation;\u201d and said Master Pedro from within, \u201cBoy, stick to your text and do as the gentleman bids you; it\u2019s the best plan; keep to your plain song, and don\u2019t attempt harmonies, for they are apt to break down from being over fine.\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d said the boy, and he went on to say, \u201cThis figure that you see here on horseback, covered with a Gascon cloak, is Don Gaiferos himself, whom his wife, now avenged of the insult of the amorous Moor, and taking her stand on the balcony of the tower with a calmer and more tranquil countenance, has perceived without recognising him; and she addresses her husband, supposing him to be some traveller, and holds with him all that conversation and colloquy in the ballad that runs\u2014 If you, sir knight, to France are bound, Oh!", " Sancho made a bag of his coat, and, getting together as much as he could, and as the bag would hold, he loaded his beast, and then hastened to obey his master\u2019s call, and helped him to remove the bachelor from under the mule; then putting him on her back he gave him the torch, and Don Quixote bade him follow the track of his companions, and beg pardon of them on his part for the wrong which he could not help doing them. And said Sancho, \u201cIf by chance these gentlemen should want to know who was the hero that served them so, your worship may tell them that he is the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, otherwise called the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.\u201d The bachelor then took his departure. I forgot to mention that before he did so he said to Don Quixote, \u201cRemember that you stand excommunicated for having laid violent hands on a holy thing, _juxta illud, si quis, suadente diabolo_.\u201d \u201cI do not understand that Latin,\u201d answered Don Quixote, \u201cbut I know well I did not lay hands, only this pike; besides, I did not think I was committing an assault upon priests or things of the Church, which, like a Catholic and faithful Christian as I am, I respect and revere, but upon phantoms and spectres of the other world; but even so, I remember how it fared with Cid Ruy Diaz when he broke the chair of the ambassador of that king before his Holiness the Pope, who excommunicated him for the same; and yet the good Roderick of Vivar bore himself that day like a very noble and valiant knight.\u201d On hearing this the bachelor took his departure, as has been said, without making any reply; and Don Quixote asked Sancho what had induced him to call him the \u201cKnight of the Rueful Countenance\u201d more then than at any other time.", " for Gaiferos ask\u2014 which I do not repeat here because prolixity begets disgust; suffice it to observe how Don Gaiferos discovers himself, and that by her joyful gestures Melisendra shows us she has recognised him; and what is more, we now see she lowers herself from the balcony to place herself on the haunches of her good husband\u2019s horse. But ah! unhappy lady, the edge of her petticoat has caught on one of the bars of the balcony and she is left hanging in the air, unable to reach the ground. But you see how compassionate heaven sends aid in our sorest need; Don Gaiferos advances, and without minding whether the rich petticoat is torn or not, he seizes her and by force brings her to the ground, and then with one jerk places her on the haunches of his horse, astraddle like a man, and bids her hold on tight and clasp her arms round his neck, crossing them on his breast so as not to fall, for the lady Melisendra was not used to that style of riding. You see, too, how the neighing of the horse shows his satisfaction with the gallant and beautiful burden he bears in his lord and lady. You see how they wheel round and quit the city, and in joy and gladness take the road to Paris. Go in peace, O peerless pair of true lovers! May you reach your longed-for fatherland in safety, and may fortune interpose no impediment to your prosperous journey; may the eyes of your friends and kinsmen behold you enjoying in peace and tranquillity the remaining days of your life\u2014and that they may be as many as those of Nestor!\u201d Here Master Pedro called out again and said, \u201cSimplicity, boy!"], "Following the arrival of the Duke\u2019s letter, what does Sancho fear that the town doctor is trying to do?": [" I quote this Latin to thee because I conclude that since thou hast been a governor thou wilt have learned it. Adieu; God keep thee from being an object of pity to anyone. Thy friend, DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA. Sancho listened to the letter with great attention, and it was praised and considered wise by all who heard it; he then rose up from table, and calling his secretary shut himself in with him in his own room, and without putting it off any longer set about answering his master Don Quixote at once; and he bade the secretary write down what he told him without adding or suppressing anything, which he did, and the answer was to the following effect. SANCHO PANZA\u2019S LETTER TO DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA. The pressure of business is so great upon me that I have no time to scratch my head or even to cut my nails; and I have them so long\u2014God send a remedy for it. I say this, master of my soul, that you may not be surprised if I have not until now sent you word of how I fare, well or ill, in this government, in which I am suffering more hunger than when we two were wandering through the woods and wastes. My lord the duke wrote to me the other day to warn me that certain spies had got into this island to kill me; but up to the present I have not found out any except a certain doctor who receives a salary in this town for killing all the governors that come here; he is called Doctor Pedro Recio, and is from Tirteafuera; so you see what a name he has to make me dread dying under his hands.", " But what I am of opinion the governor should eat now in order to preserve and fortify his health is a hundred or so of wafer cakes and a few thin slices of conserve of quinces, which will settle his stomach and help his digestion.\u201d Sancho on hearing this threw himself back in his chair and surveyed the doctor steadily, and in a solemn tone asked him what his name was and where he had studied. He replied, \u201cMy name, se\u00f1or governor, is Doctor Pedro Recio de Aguero I am a native of a place called Tirteafuera which lies between Caracuel and Almod\u00f3var del Campo, on the right-hand side, and I have the degree of doctor from the university of Osuna.\u201d To which Sancho, glowing all over with rage, returned, \u201cThen let Doctor Pedro Recio de Malaguero, native of Tirteafuera, a place that\u2019s on the right-hand side as we go from Caracuel to Almod\u00f3var del Campo, graduate of Osuna, get out of my presence at once; or I swear by the sun I\u2019ll take a cudgel, and by dint of blows, beginning with him, I\u2019ll not leave a doctor in the whole island; at least of those I know to be ignorant; for as to learned, wise, sensible physicians, them I will reverence and honour as divine persons. Once more I say let Pedro Recio get out of this or I\u2019ll take this chair I am sitting on and break it over his head. And if they call me to account for it, I\u2019ll clear myself by saying I served God in killing a bad doctor\u2014a general executioner.", " On reading the letter my voice failed me, and still more when I heard my father say, \u2018Two days hence thou wilt depart, Cardenio, in accordance with the duke\u2019s wish, and give thanks to God who is opening a road to thee by which thou mayest attain what I know thou dost deserve; and to these words he added others of fatherly counsel. The time for my departure arrived; I spoke one night to Luscinda, I told her all that had occurred, as I did also to her father, entreating him to allow some delay, and to defer the disposal of her hand until I should see what the Duke Ricardo sought of me: he gave me the promise, and she confirmed it with vows and swoonings unnumbered. Finally, I presented myself to the duke, and was received and treated by him so kindly that very soon envy began to do its work, the old servants growing envious of me, and regarding the duke\u2019s inclination to show me favour as an injury to themselves. But the one to whom my arrival gave the greatest pleasure was the duke\u2019s second son, Fernando by name, a gallant youth, of noble, generous, and amorous disposition, who very soon made so intimate a friend of me that it was remarked by everybody; for though the elder was attached to me, and showed me kindness, he did not carry his affectionate treatment to the same length as Don Fernando. It so happened, then, that as between friends no secret remains unshared, and as the favour I enjoyed with Don Fernando had grown into friendship, he made all his thoughts known to me, and in particular a love affair which troubled his mind a little.", " Then having Dapple saddled, he, with great pain and difficulty, got up on him, and addressing himself to the majordomo, the secretary, the head-carver, and Pedro Recio the doctor and several others who stood by, he said, \u201cMake way, gentlemen, and let me go back to my old freedom; let me go look for my past life, and raise myself up from this present death. I was not born to be a governor or protect islands or cities from the enemies that choose to attack them. Ploughing and digging, vinedressing and pruning, are more in my way than defending provinces or kingdoms. Saint Peter is very well at Rome; I mean each of us is best following the trade he was born to. A reaping-hook fits my hand better than a governor\u2019s sceptre; I\u2019d rather have my fill of gazpacho than be subject to the misery of a meddling doctor who kills me with hunger, and I\u2019d rather lie in summer under the shade of an oak, and in winter wrap myself in a double sheepskin jacket in freedom, than go to bed between holland sheets and dress in sables under the restraint of a government. God be with your worships, and tell my lord the duke that \u2018naked I was born, naked I find myself, I neither lose nor gain;\u2019 I mean that without a farthing I came into this government, and without a farthing I go out of it, very different from the way governors commonly leave other islands. Stand aside and let me go; I have to plaster myself, for I believe every one of my ribs is crushed, thanks to the enemies that have been trampling over me to-night.\u201d \u201cThat is unnecessary, se\u00f1or governor,\u201d said Doctor Recio, \u201cfor I will give your worship a draught against falls and bruises that will soon make you as sound and strong as ever; and as for your diet I promise your worship to behave better, and let you eat plentifully of whatever you like.\u201d \u201cYou spoke late,\u201d said Sancho."], "As governor, Sancho encounters a girl dressed up as a boy. Whose guard is she attempting to escape?": [" Don Quixote asked why this man carried so many more chains than the others. The guard replied that it was because he alone had committed more crimes than all the rest put together, and was so daring and such a villain, that though they marched him in that fashion they did not feel sure of him, but were in dread of his making his escape. \u201cWhat crimes can he have committed,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cif they have not deserved a heavier punishment than being sent to the galleys?\u201d \u201cHe goes for ten years,\u201d replied the guard, \u201cwhich is the same thing as civil death, and all that need be said is that this good fellow is the famous Gines de Pasamonte, otherwise called Ginesillo de Parapilla.\u201d \u201cGently, se\u00f1or commissary,\u201d said the galley slave at this, \u201clet us have no fixing of names or surnames; my name is Gines, not Ginesillo, and my family name is Pasamonte, not Parapilla as you say; let each one mind his own business, and he will be doing enough.\u201d \u201cSpeak with less impertinence, master thief of extra measure,\u201d replied the commissary, \u201cif you don\u2019t want me to make you hold your tongue in spite of your teeth.\u201d \u201cIt is easy to see,\u201d returned the galley slave, \u201cthat man goes as God pleases, but someone shall know some day whether I am called Ginesillo de Parapilla or not.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t they call you so, you liar?\u201d said the guard. \u201cThey do,\u201d returned Gines, \u201cbut I will make them give over calling me so, or I will be shaved, where, I only say behind my teeth.", " Among other things, he said the governor was against him, not to lose the presents his relations made him for reporting him still mad but with lucid intervals; and that the worst foe he had in his misfortune was his large property; for in order to enjoy it his enemies disparaged and threw doubts upon the mercy our Lord had shown him in turning him from a brute beast into a man. In short, he spoke in such a way that he cast suspicion on the governor, and made his relations appear covetous and heartless, and himself so rational that the chaplain determined to take him away with him that the Archbishop might see him, and ascertain for himself the truth of the matter. Yielding to this conviction, the worthy chaplain begged the governor to have the clothes in which the licentiate had entered the house given to him. The governor again bade him beware of what he was doing, as the licentiate was beyond a doubt still mad; but all his cautions and warnings were unavailing to dissuade the chaplain from taking him away. The governor, seeing that it was the order of the Archbishop, obeyed, and they dressed the licentiate in his own clothes, which were new and decent. He, as soon as he saw himself clothed like one in his senses, and divested of the appearance of a madman, entreated the chaplain to permit him in charity to go and take leave of his comrades the madmen. The chaplain said he would go with him to see what madmen there were in the house; so they went upstairs, and with them some of those who were present.", " I would not ask anything more than that this youth should go back and leave me; perhaps with not seeing him, and the long distance we shall have to travel, the pain I suffer now may become easier; though I daresay the remedy I propose will do me very little good. I don\u2019t know how the devil this has come about, or how this love I have for him got in; I such a young girl, and he such a mere boy; for I verily believe we are both of an age, and I am not sixteen yet; for I will be sixteen Michaelmas Day, next, my father says.\u201d Dorothea could not help laughing to hear how like a child Do\u00f1a Clara spoke. \u201cLet us go to sleep now, se\u00f1ora,\u201d said she, \u201cfor the little of the night that I fancy is left to us: God will soon send us daylight, and we will set all to rights, or it will go hard with me.\u201d With this they fell asleep, and deep silence reigned all through the inn. The only persons not asleep were the landlady\u2019s daughter and her servant Maritornes, who, knowing the weak point of Don Quixote\u2019s humour, and that he was outside the inn mounting guard in armour and on horseback, resolved, the pair of them, to play some trick upon him, or at any rate to amuse themselves for a while by listening to his nonsense. As it so happened there was not a window in the whole inn that looked outwards except a hole in the wall of a straw-loft through which they used to throw out the straw. At this hole the two demi-damsels posted themselves, and observed Don Quixote on his horse, leaning on his pike and from time to time sending forth such deep and doleful sighs, that he seemed to pluck up his soul by the roots with each of them; and they could hear him, too, saying in a soft, tender, loving tone, \u201cOh my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, perfection of all beauty, summit and crown of discretion, treasure house of grace, depositary of virtue, and finally, ideal of all that is good, honourable, and delectable in this world!", " The governor bade him take it out and hand it to the complainant; he obeyed trembling; the woman took it, and making a thousand salaams to all and praying to God for the long life and health of the se\u00f1or governor who had such regard for distressed orphans and virgins, she hurried out of court with the purse grasped in both her hands, first looking, however, to see if the money it contained was silver. As soon as she was gone Sancho said to the cattle dealer, whose tears were already starting and whose eyes and heart were following his purse, \u201cGood fellow, go after that woman and take the purse from her, by force even, and come back with it here;\u201d and he did not say it to one who was a fool or deaf, for the man was off like a flash of lightning, and ran to do as he was bid. All the bystanders waited anxiously to see the end of the case, and presently both man and woman came back at even closer grips than before, she with her petticoat up and the purse in the lap of it, and he struggling hard to take it from her, but all to no purpose, so stout was the woman\u2019s defence, she all the while crying out, \u201cJustice from God and the world! see here, se\u00f1or governor, the shamelessness and boldness of this villain, who in the middle of the town, in the middle of the street, wanted to take from me the purse your worship bade him give me.\u201d \u201cAnd did he take it?\u201d asked the governor. \u201cTake it!\u201d said the woman; \u201cI\u2019d let my life be taken from me sooner than the purse."], "Who slaps and pinches Don Quixote and Dona Rodriguez after eavesdropping on their conversation?": [" \u201cWith this good fellow here,\u201d said the duenna, \u201cwho has particularly requested me to go and put an ass of his that is at the castle gate into the stable, holding it up to me as an example that they did the same I don\u2019t know where\u2014that some ladies waited on one Lancelot, and duennas on his hack; and what is more, to wind up with, he called me old.\u201d \u201cThat,\u201d said the duchess, \u201cI should have considered the greatest affront that could be offered me;\u201d and addressing Sancho, she said to him, \u201cYou must know, friend Sancho, that Do\u00f1a Rodriguez is very youthful, and that she wears that hood more for authority and custom\u2019s sake than because of her years.\u201d \u201cMay all the rest of mine be unlucky,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cif I meant it that way; I only spoke because the affection I have for my ass is so great, and I thought I could not commend him to a more kind-hearted person than the lady Do\u00f1a Rodriguez.\u201d Don Quixote, who was listening, said to him, \u201cIs this proper conversation for the place, Sancho?\u201d \u201cSe\u00f1or,\u201d replied Sancho, \u201cevery one must mention what he wants wherever he may be; I thought of Dapple here, and I spoke of him here; if I had thought of him in the stable I would have spoken there.\u201d On which the duke observed, \u201cSancho is quite right, and there is no reason at all to find fault with him; Dapple shall be fed to his heart\u2019s content, and Sancho may rest easy, for he shall be treated like himself.\u201d While this conversation, amusing to all except Don Quixote, was proceeding, they ascended the staircase and ushered Don Quixote into a chamber hung with rich cloth of gold and brocade; six damsels relieved him of his armour and waited on him like pages, all of them prepared and instructed by the duke and duchess as to what they were to do, and how they were to treat Don Quixote, so that he might see and believe they were treating him like a knight-errant.", " what\u2019s this I see?\u201d let fall the candle in her fright, and then finding herself in the dark, turned about to make off, but stumbling on her skirts in her consternation, she measured her length with a mighty fall. p48c.jpg (249K) Full Size Don Quixote in his trepidation began saying, \u201cI conjure thee, phantom, or whatever thou art, tell me what thou art and what thou wouldst with me. If thou art a soul in torment, say so, and all that my powers can do I will do for thee; for I am a Catholic Christian and love to do good to all the world, and to this end I have embraced the order of knight-errantry to which I belong, the province of which extends to doing good even to souls in purgatory.\u201d The unfortunate duenna hearing herself thus conjured, by her own fear guessed Don Quixote\u2019s and in a low plaintive voice answered, \u201cSe\u00f1or Don Quixote\u2014if so be you are indeed Don Quixote\u2014I am no phantom or spectre or soul in purgatory, as you seem to think, but Do\u00f1a Rodriguez, duenna of honour to my lady the duchess, and I come to you with one of those grievances your worship is wont to redress.\u201d \u201cTell me, Se\u00f1ora Do\u00f1a Rodriguez,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cdo you perchance come to transact any go-between business? Because I must tell you I am not available for anybody\u2019s purpose, thanks to the peerless beauty of my lady Dulcinea del Toboso. In short, Se\u00f1ora Do\u00f1a Rodriguez, if you will leave out and put aside all love messages, you may go and light your candle and come back, and we will discuss all the commands you have for me and whatever you wish, saving only, as I said, all seductive communications.\u201d \u201cI carry nobody\u2019s messages, se\u00f1or,\u201d said the duenna; \u201clittle you know me.", " On reaching it the youth threw a pebble up at a grating, and immediately a woman-servant who was waiting for them came down and opened the door to them, and they went in, leaving the party marvelling as much at their grace and beauty as at the fancy they had for seeing the world by night and without quitting the village; which, however, they set down to their youth. The head-carver was left with a heart pierced through and through, and he made up his mind on the spot to demand the damsel in marriage of her father on the morrow, making sure she would not be refused him as he was a servant of the duke\u2019s; and even to Sancho ideas and schemes of marrying the youth to his daughter Sanchica suggested themselves, and he resolved to open the negotiation at the proper season, persuading himself that no husband could be refused to a governor\u2019s daughter. And so the night\u2019s round came to an end, and a couple of days later the government, whereby all his plans were overthrown and swept away, as will be seen farther on. p49e.jpg (55K) CHAPTER L.

I\u2019d sooner see them all bearded, from the highest to the lowest, and from the most prudish to the most affected.\u201d \u201cYou are very hard on duennas, Sancho my friend,\u201d said the duchess; \u201cyou incline very much to the opinion of the Toledo apothecary. But indeed you are wrong; there are duennas in my house that may serve as patterns of duennas; and here is my Do\u00f1a Rodriguez, who will not allow me to say otherwise.\u201d \u201cYour excellence may say it if you like,\u201d said the Rodriguez; \u201cfor God knows the truth of everything; and whether we duennas are good or bad, bearded or smooth, we are our mothers\u2019 daughters like other women; and as God sent us into the world, he knows why he did, and on his mercy I rely, and not on anybody\u2019s beard.\u201d \u201cWell, Se\u00f1ora Rodriguez, Se\u00f1ora Trifaldi, and present company,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cI trust in Heaven that it will look with kindly eyes upon your troubles, for Sancho will do as I bid him.

To come to the point, the son of a very rich farmer, living in a village of my lord the duke\u2019s not very far from here, fell in love with this girl of mine; and in short, how I know not, they came together, and under the promise of marrying her he made a fool of my daughter, and will not keep his word. And though my lord the duke is aware of it (for I have complained to him, not once but many and many a time, and entreated him to order the farmer to marry my daughter), he turns a deaf ear and will scarcely listen to me; the reason being that as the deceiver\u2019s father is so rich, and lends him money, and is constantly going security for his debts, he does not like to offend or annoy him in any way.", " Finding herself then in the presence of no more, the damsel went on to say, \u201cI am the daughter, sirs, of Pedro Perez Mazorca, the wool-farmer of this town, who is in the habit of coming very often to my father\u2019s house.\u201d \u201cThat won\u2019t do, se\u00f1ora,\u201d said the majordomo; \u201cfor I know Pedro Perez very well, and I know he has no child at all, either son or daughter; and besides, though you say he is your father, you add then that he comes very often to your father\u2019s house.\u201d \u201cI had already noticed that,\u201d said Sancho. \u201cI am confused just now, sirs,\u201d said the damsel, \u201cand I don\u2019t know what I am saying; but the truth is that I am the daughter of Diego de la Llana, whom you must all know.\u201d \u201cAy, that will do,\u201d said the majordomo; \u201cfor I know Diego de la Llana, and know that he is a gentleman of position and a rich man, and that he has a son and a daughter, and that since he was left a widower nobody in all this town can speak of having seen his daughter\u2019s face; for he keeps her so closely shut up that he does not give even the sun a chance of seeing her; and for all that report says she is extremely beautiful.\u201d \u201cIt is true,\u201d said the damsel, \u201cand I am that daughter; whether report lies or not as to my beauty, you, sirs, will have decided by this time, as you have seen me;\u201d and with this she began to weep bitterly. On seeing this the secretary leant over to the head-carver\u2019s ear, and said to him in a low voice, \u201cSomething serious has no doubt happened this poor maiden, that she goes wandering from home in such a dress and at such an hour, and one of her rank too.\u201d \u201cThere can be no doubt about it,\u201d returned the carver, \u201cand moreover her tears confirm your suspicion.\u201d Sancho gave her the best comfort he could, and entreated her to tell them without any fear what had happened her, as they would all earnestly and by every means in their power endeavour to relieve her.", " \u201cNo, se\u00f1or, certainly not,\u201d said the farmer. \u201cWe\u2019ve got that much settled,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cget on, brother, for it\u2019s more bed-time than business-time.\u201d \u201cWell then,\u201d said the farmer, \u201cthis son of mine who is going to be a bachelor, fell in love in the said town with a damsel called Clara Perlerina, daughter of Andres Perlerino, a very rich farmer; and this name of Perlerines does not come to them by ancestry or descent, but because all the family are paralytics, and for a better name they call them Perlerines; though to tell the truth the damsel is as fair as an Oriental pearl, and like a flower of the field, if you look at her on the right side; on the left not so much, for on that side she wants an eye that she lost by small-pox; and though her face is thickly and deeply pitted, those who love her say they are not pits that are there, but the graves where the hearts of her lovers are buried. She is so cleanly that not to soil her face she carries her nose turned up, as they say, so that one would fancy it was running away from her mouth; and with all this she looks extremely well, for she has a wide mouth; and but for wanting ten or a dozen teeth and grinders she might compare and compete with the comeliest. Of her lips I say nothing, for they are so fine and thin that, if lips might be reeled, one might make a skein of them; but being of a different colour from ordinary lips they are wonderful, for they are mottled, blue, green, and purple\u2014let my lord the governor pardon me for painting so minutely the charms of her who some time or other will be my daughter; for I love her, and I don\u2019t find her amiss.\u201d \u201cPaint what you will,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cI enjoy your painting, and if I had dined there could be no dessert more to my taste than your portrait.\u201d \u201cThat I have still to furnish,\u201d said the farmer; \u201cbut a time will come when we may be able if we are not now; and I can tell you, se\u00f1or, if I could paint her gracefulness and her tall figure, it would astonish you; but that is impossible because she is bent double with her knees up to her mouth; but for all that it is easy to see that if she could stand up she\u2019d knock her head against the ceiling; and she would have given her hand to my bachelor ere this, only that she can\u2019t stretch it out, for it\u2019s contracted; but still one can see its elegance and fine make by its long furrowed nails.\u201d \u201cThat will do, brother,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cconsider you have painted her from head to foot; what is it you want now?", " However, tell this good man to come in; but take care first of all that he is not some spy or one of my assassins.\u201d \u201cNo, my lord,\u201d said the page, \u201cfor he looks like a simple fellow, and either I know very little or he is as good as good bread.\u201d \u201cThere is nothing to be afraid of,\u201d said the majordomo, \u201cfor we are all here.\u201d \u201cWould it be possible, carver,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cnow that Doctor Pedro Recio is not here, to let me eat something solid and substantial, if it were even a piece of bread and an onion?\u201d \u201cTo-night at supper,\u201d said the carver, \u201cthe shortcomings of the dinner shall be made good, and your lordship shall be fully contented.\u201d \u201cGod grant it,\u201d said Sancho. The farmer now came in, a well-favoured man that one might see a thousand leagues off was an honest fellow and a good soul. The first thing he said was, \u201cWhich is the lord governor here?\u201d \u201cWhich should it be,\u201d said the secretary, \u201cbut he who is seated in the chair?\u201d \u201cThen I humble myself before him,\u201d said the farmer; and going on his knees he asked for his hand, to kiss it. Sancho refused it, and bade him stand up and say what he wanted. The farmer obeyed, and then said, \u201cI am a farmer, se\u00f1or, a native of Miguelturra, a village two leagues from Ciudad Real.\u201d \u201cAnother Tirteafuera!\u201d said Sancho; \u201csay on, brother; I know Miguelturra very well I can tell you, for it\u2019s not very far from my own town.\u201d \u201cThe case is this, se\u00f1or,\u201d continued the farmer, \u201cthat by God\u2019s mercy I am married with the leave and licence of the holy Roman Catholic Church; I have two sons, students, and the younger is studying to become bachelor, and the elder to be licentiate; I am a widower, for my wife died, or more properly speaking, a bad doctor killed her on my hands, giving her a purge when she was with child; and if it had pleased God that the child had been born, and was a boy, I would have put him to study for doctor, that he might not envy his brothers the bachelor and the licentiate.\u201d \u201cSo that if your wife had not died, or had not been killed, you would not now be a widower,\u201d said Sancho."], "What does the mock battle in which Sancho participates as governor convince him of?": [" So having laid their plans and given instructions to their servants and vassals how to behave to Sancho in his government of the promised island, the next day, that following Clavile\u00f1o\u2019s flight, the duke told Sancho to prepare and get ready to go and be governor, for his islanders were already looking out for him as for the showers of May. Sancho made him an obeisance, and said, \u201cEver since I came down from heaven, and from the top of it beheld the earth, and saw how little it is, the great desire I had to be a governor has been partly cooled in me; for what is there grand in being ruler on a grain of mustard seed, or what dignity or authority in governing half a dozen men about as big as hazel nuts; for, so far as I could see, there were no more on the whole earth? If your lordship would be so good as to give me ever so small a bit of heaven, were it no more than half a league, I\u2019d rather have it than the best island in the world.\u201d \u201cRecollect, Sancho,\u201d said the duke, \u201cI cannot give a bit of heaven, no not so much as the breadth of my nail, to anyone; rewards and favours of that sort are reserved for God alone. What I can give I give you, and that is a real, genuine island, compact, well proportioned, and uncommonly fertile and fruitful, where, if you know how to use your opportunities, you may, with the help of the world\u2019s riches, gain those of heaven.\u201d \u201cWell then,\u201d said Sancho, \u201clet the island come; and I\u2019ll try and be such a governor, that in spite of scoundrels I\u2019ll go to heaven; and it\u2019s not from any craving to quit my own humble condition or better myself, but from the desire I have to try what it tastes like to be a governor.\u201d \u201cIf you once make trial of it, Sancho,\u201d said the duke, \u201cyou\u2019ll eat your fingers off after the government, so sweet a thing is it to command and be obeyed.", " The duke embraced Sancho and told him he was heartily sorry he had given up the government so soon, but that he would see that he was provided with some other post on his estate less onerous and more profitable. The duchess also embraced him, and gave orders that he should be taken good care of, as it was plain to see he had been badly treated and worse bruised. p55e.jpg (18K) CHAPTER LVI.br/> OF THE PRODIGIOUS AND UNPARALLELED BATTLE THAT TOOK PLACE BETWEEN DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA AND THE LACQUEY TOSILOS IN DEFENCE OF THE DAUGHTER OF DO\u00d1A RODRIGUEZ p56a.jpg (158K) Full Size The duke and duchess had no reason to regret the joke that had been played upon Sancho Panza in giving him the government; especially as their majordomo returned the same day, and gave them a minute account of almost every word and deed that Sancho uttered or did during the time; and to wind up with, eloquently described to them the attack upon the island and Sancho\u2019s fright and departure, with which they were not a little amused. After this the history goes on to say that the day fixed for the battle arrived, and that the duke, after having repeatedly instructed his lacquey Tosilos how to deal with Don Quixote so as to vanquish him without killing or wounding him, gave orders to have the heads removed from the lances, telling Don Quixote that Christian charity, on which he plumed himself, could not suffer the battle to be fought with so much risk and danger to life; and that he must be content with the offer of a battlefield on his territory (though that was against the decree of the holy Council, which prohibits all challenges of the sort) and not push such an arduous venture to its extreme limits.", " Among other things, he said the governor was against him, not to lose the presents his relations made him for reporting him still mad but with lucid intervals; and that the worst foe he had in his misfortune was his large property; for in order to enjoy it his enemies disparaged and threw doubts upon the mercy our Lord had shown him in turning him from a brute beast into a man. In short, he spoke in such a way that he cast suspicion on the governor, and made his relations appear covetous and heartless, and himself so rational that the chaplain determined to take him away with him that the Archbishop might see him, and ascertain for himself the truth of the matter. Yielding to this conviction, the worthy chaplain begged the governor to have the clothes in which the licentiate had entered the house given to him. The governor again bade him beware of what he was doing, as the licentiate was beyond a doubt still mad; but all his cautions and warnings were unavailing to dissuade the chaplain from taking him away. The governor, seeing that it was the order of the Archbishop, obeyed, and they dressed the licentiate in his own clothes, which were new and decent. He, as soon as he saw himself clothed like one in his senses, and divested of the appearance of a madman, entreated the chaplain to permit him in charity to go and take leave of his comrades the madmen. The chaplain said he would go with him to see what madmen there were in the house; so they went upstairs, and with them some of those who were present.", " Sancho was left crushed, Don Quixote scared, Dapple belaboured and Rocinante in no very sound condition. p58c.jpg (399K) Full Size They all got up, however, at length, and Don Quixote in great haste, stumbling here and falling there, started off running after the drove, shouting out, \u201cHold! stay! ye rascally rabble, a single knight awaits you, and he is not of the temper or opinion of those who say, \u2018For a flying enemy make a bridge of silver.\u2019\u201d The retreating party in their haste, however, did not stop for that, or heed his menaces any more than last year\u2019s clouds. Weariness brought Don Quixote to a halt, and more enraged than avenged he sat down on the road to wait until Sancho, Rocinante and Dapple came up. When they reached him master and man mounted once more, and without going back to bid farewell to the mock or imitation Arcadia, and more in humiliation than contentment, they continued their journey. p58e.jpg (68K) Full Size CHAPTER LIX. WHEREIN IS RELATED THE STRANGE THING, WHICH MAY BE REGARDED AS AN ADVENTURE, THAT HAPPENED DON QUIXOTE p59a.jpg (126K) Full Size A clear limpid spring which they discovered in a cool grove relieved Don Quixote and Sancho of the dust and fatigue due to the unpolite behaviour of the bulls, and by the side of this, having turned Dapple and Rocinante loose without headstall or bridle, the forlorn pair, master and man, seated themselves. Sancho had recourse to the larder of his alforjas and took out of them what he called the prog; Don Quixote rinsed his mouth and bathed his face, by which cooling process his flagging energies were revived."], "What object does Don Antonio Moreno claim is enchanted and will answer any question asked of it?": [" \u201cHow many of us are here?\u201d asked Don Antonio once more; and it was answered him in the same way softly, \u201cThou and thy wife, with two friends of thine and two of hers, and a famous knight called Don Quixote of La Mancha, and a squire of his, Sancho Panza by name.\u201d Now there was fresh astonishment; now everyone\u2019s hair was standing on end with awe; and Don Antonio retiring from the head exclaimed, \u201cThis suffices to show me that I have not been deceived by him who sold thee to me, O sage head, talking head, answering head, wonderful head! Let someone else go and put what question he likes to it.\u201d And as women are commonly impulsive and inquisitive, the first to come forward was one of the two friends of Don Antonio\u2019s wife, and her question was, \u201cTell me, Head, what shall I do to be very beautiful?\u201d and the answer she got was, \u201cBe very modest.\u201d \u201cI question thee no further,\u201d said the fair querist. Her companion then came up and said, \u201cI should like to know, Head, whether my husband loves me or not;\u201d the answer given to her was, \u201cThink how he uses thee, and thou mayest guess;\u201d and the married lady went off saying, \u201cThat answer did not need a question; for of course the treatment one receives shows the disposition of him from whom it is received.\u201d Then one of Don Antonio\u2019s two friends advanced and asked it, \u201cWho am I?\u201d \u201cThou knowest,\u201d was the answer. \u201cThat is not what I ask thee,\u201d said the gentleman, \u201cbut to tell me if thou knowest me.\u201d \u201cYes, I know thee, thou art Don Pedro Noriz,\u201d was the reply.", " If it had been the shoe-fling you were at I could take your place, for I can do the shoe-fling like a gerfalcon; but I\u2019m no good at dancing.\u201d With these and other observations Sancho set the whole ball-room laughing, and then put his master to bed, covering him up well so that he might sweat out any chill caught after his dancing. The next day Don Antonio thought he might as well make trial of the enchanted head, and with Don Quixote, Sancho, and two others, friends of his, besides the two ladies that had tired out Don Quixote at the ball, who had remained for the night with Don Antonio\u2019s wife, he locked himself up in the chamber where the head was. He explained to them the property it possessed and entrusted the secret to them, telling them that now for the first time he was going to try the virtue of the enchanted head; but except Don Antonio\u2019s two friends no one else was privy to the mystery of the enchantment, and if Don Antonio had not first revealed it to them they would have been inevitably reduced to the same state of amazement as the rest, so artfully and skilfully was it contrived. The first to approach the ear of the head was Don Antonio himself, and in a low voice but not so low as not to be audible to all, he said to it, \u201cHead, tell me by the virtue that lies in thee what am I at this moment thinking of?\u201d The head, without any movement of the lips, answered in a clear and distinct voice, so as to be heard by all, \u201cI cannot judge of thoughts.\u201d All were thunderstruck at this, and all the more so as they saw that there was nobody anywhere near the table or in the whole room that could have answered.", " Why, the schoolboys know that from the time they were babes. Well then, you must know I mean have you had any desire to do what cannot be avoided?\u201d \u201cAh! now I understand thee, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cyes, often, and even this minute; get me out of this strait, or all will not go right.\u201d c48e.jpg (32K) CHAPTER XLIX. WHICH TREATS OF THE SHREWD CONVERSATION WHICH SANCHO PANZA HELD WITH HIS MASTER DON QUIXOTE c49a.jpg (181K) Full Size \u201cAha, I have caught you,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cthis is what in my heart and soul I was longing to know. Come now, se\u00f1or, can you deny what is commonly said around us, when a person is out of humour, \u2018I don\u2019t know what ails so-and-so, that he neither eats, nor drinks, nor sleeps, nor gives a proper answer to any question; one would think he was enchanted\u2019? From which it is to be gathered that those who do not eat, or drink, or sleep, or do any of the natural acts I am speaking of\u2014that such persons are enchanted; but not those that have the desire your worship has, and drink when drink is given them, and eat when there is anything to eat, and answer every question that is asked them.\u201d \u201cWhat thou sayest is true, Sancho,\u201d replied Don Quixote; \u201cbut I have already told thee there are many sorts of enchantments, and it may be that in the course of time they have been changed one for another, and that now it may be the way with enchanted people to do all that I do, though they did not do so before; so it is vain to argue or draw inferences against the usage of the time.", " Don Antonio traversed the whole apartment with Don Quixote and walked round the table several times, and then said, \u201cNow, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote, that I am satisfied that no one is listening to us, and that the door is shut, I will tell you of one of the rarest adventures, or more properly speaking strange things, that can be imagined, on condition that you will keep what I say to you in the remotest recesses of secrecy.\u201d \u201cI swear it,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand for greater security I will put a flag-stone over it; for I would have you know, Se\u00f1or Don Antonio\u201d (he had by this time learned his name), \u201cthat you are addressing one who, though he has ears to hear, has no tongue to speak; so that you may safely transfer whatever you have in your bosom into mine, and rely upon it that you have consigned it to the depths of silence.\u201d \u201cIn reliance upon that promise,\u201d said Don Antonio, \u201cI will astonish you with what you shall see and hear, and relieve myself of some of the vexation it gives me to have no one to whom I can confide my secrets, for they are not of a sort to be entrusted to everybody.\u201d Don Quixote was puzzled, wondering what could be the object of such precautions; whereupon Don Antonio taking his hand passed it over the bronze head and the whole table and the pedestal of jasper on which it stood, and then said, \u201cThis head, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote, has been made and fabricated by one of the greatest magicians and wizards the world ever saw, a Pole, I believe, by birth, and a pupil of the famous Escotillo of whom such marvellous stories are told."], "Whose daughter captains the pirate ship that Don Quixote and Sancho encounter while sailing on the galley ship?": [" And if you have any desire to shorten the journey and put yourself easily in the way of salvation, come with me, and I will show you how to become a knight-errant, a calling wherein so many hardships and mishaps are encountered that if they be taken as penances they will lodge you in heaven in a trice.\u201d Roque laughed at Don Quixote\u2019s exhortation, and changing the conversation he related the tragic affair of Claudia Jeronima, at which Sancho was extremely grieved; for he had not found the young woman\u2019s beauty, boldness, and spirit at all amiss. And now the squires despatched to make the prize came up, bringing with them two gentlemen on horseback, two pilgrims on foot, and a coach full of women with some six servants on foot and on horseback in attendance on them, and a couple of muleteers whom the gentlemen had with them. The squires made a ring round them, both victors and vanquished maintaining profound silence, waiting for the great Roque Guinart to speak. He asked the gentlemen who they were, whither they were going, and what money they carried with them; \u201cSe\u00f1or,\u201d replied one of them, \u201cwe are two captains of Spanish infantry; our companies are at Naples, and we are on our way to embark in four galleys which they say are at Barcelona under orders for Sicily; and we have about two or three hundred crowns, with which we are, according to our notions, rich and contented, for a soldier\u2019s poverty does not allow a more extensive hoard.\u201d Roque asked the pilgrims the same questions he had put to the captains, and was answered that they were going to take ship for Rome, and that between them they might have about sixty reals.", " They came to the side of the ship to ask who we were, whither we were bound, and whence we came, but as they asked this in French our renegade said, \u201cLet no one answer, for no doubt these are French corsairs who plunder all comers.\u201d c41f.jpg (268K) Full Size Acting on this warning no one answered a word, but after we had gone a little ahead, and the vessel was now lying to leeward, suddenly they fired two guns, and apparently both loaded with chain-shot, for with one they cut our mast in half and brought down both it and the sail into the sea, and the other, discharged at the same moment, sent a ball into our vessel amidships, staving her in completely, but without doing any further damage. We, however, finding ourselves sinking began to shout for help and call upon those in the ship to pick us up as we were beginning to fill. They then lay to, and lowering a skiff or boat, as many as a dozen Frenchmen, well armed with match-locks, and their matches burning, got into it and came alongside; and seeing how few we were, and that our vessel was going down, they took us in, telling us that this had come to us through our incivility in not giving them an answer. Our renegade took the trunk containing Zoraida\u2019s wealth and dropped it into the sea without anyone perceiving what he did. In short we went on board with the Frenchmen, who, after having ascertained all they wanted to know about us, rifled us of everything we had, as if they had been our bitterest enemies, and from Zoraida they took even the anklets she wore on her feet; but the distress they caused her did not distress me so much as the fear I was in that from robbing her of her rich and precious jewels they would proceed to rob her of the most precious jewel that she valued more than all.", " Seeing this the general swore he would not leave one of those he found on board the vessel alive, but as he bore down furiously upon her she slipped away from him underneath the oars. The galley shot a good way ahead; those on board the vessel saw their case was desperate, and while the galley was coming about they made sail, and by sailing and rowing once more tried to sheer off; but their activity did not do them as much good as their rashness did them harm, for the galley coming up with them in a little more than half a mile threw her oars over them and took the whole of them alive. The other two galleys now joined company and all four returned with the prize to the beach, where a vast multitude stood waiting for them, eager to see what they brought back. The general anchored close in, and perceived that the viceroy of the city was on the shore. He ordered the skiff to push off to fetch him, and the yard to be lowered for the purpose of hanging forthwith the rais and the rest of the men taken on board the vessel, about six-and-thirty in number, all smart fellows and most of them Turkish musketeers. He asked which was the rais of the brigantine, and was answered in Spanish by one of the prisoners (who afterwards proved to be a Spanish renegade), \u201cThis young man, se\u00f1or that you see here is our rais,\u201d and he pointed to one of the handsomest and most gallant-looking youths that could be imagined.", " He asked also who was in the coach, whither they were bound and what money they had, and one of the men on horseback replied, \u201cThe persons in the coach are my lady Do\u00f1a Guiomar de Qui\u00f1ones, wife of the regent of the Vicaria at Naples, her little daughter, a handmaid and a duenna; we six servants are in attendance upon her, and the money amounts to six hundred crowns.\u201d \u201cSo then,\u201d said Roque Guinart, \u201cwe have got here nine hundred crowns and sixty reals; my soldiers must number some sixty; see how much there falls to each, for I am a bad arithmetician.\u201d As soon as the robbers heard this they raised a shout of \u201cLong life to Roque Guinart, in spite of the lladres that seek his ruin!\u201d The captains showed plainly the concern they felt, the regent\u2019s lady was downcast, and the pilgrims did not at all enjoy seeing their property confiscated. Roque kept them in suspense in this way for a while; but he had no desire to prolong their distress, which might be seen a bowshot off, and turning to the captains he said, \u201cSirs, will your worships be pleased of your courtesy to lend me sixty crowns, and her ladyship the regent\u2019s wife eighty, to satisfy this band that follows me, for \u2018it is by his singing the abbot gets his dinner;\u2019 and then you may at once proceed on your journey, free and unhindered, with a safe-conduct which I shall give you, so that if you come across any other bands of mine that I have scattered in these parts, they may do you no harm; for I have no intention of doing injury to soldiers, or to any woman, especially one of quality.\u201d Profuse and hearty were the expressions of gratitude with which the captains thanked Roque for his courtesy and generosity; for such they regarded his leaving them their own money."], "What does the Knight of the White Moon\u2019s demand that Don Quixote do if he should lose their fight?": [" The viceroy upon this, seeing that the pair of them were evidently preparing to come to the charge, put himself between them, asking them what it was that led them to engage in combat all of a sudden in this way. The Knight of the White Moon replied that it was a question of precedence of beauty; and briefly told him what he had said to Don Quixote, and how the conditions of the defiance agreed upon on both sides had been accepted.

The duke could not make out the reason why the battle did not go on; but the marshal of the field hastened to him to let him know what Tosilos said, and he was amazed and extremely angry at it. In the meantime Tosilos advanced to where Do\u00f1a Rodriguez sat and said in a loud voice, \u201cSe\u00f1ora, I am willing to marry your daughter, and I have no wish to obtain by strife and fighting what I can obtain in peace and without any risk to my life.\u201d The valiant Don Quixote heard him, and said, \u201cAs that is the case I am released and absolved from my promise; let them marry by all means, and as \u2018God our Lord has given her, may Saint Peter add his blessing.\u2019\u201d The duke had now descended to the courtyard of the castle, and going up to Tosilos he said to him, \u201cIs it true, sir knight, that you yield yourself vanquished, and that moved by scruples of conscience you wish to marry this damsel?\u201d \u201cIt is, se\u00f1or,\u201d replied Tosilos.", " A knight that he overcame some time back, called the Knight of the Mirrors, they turned into the shape of the bachelor Samson Carrasco of our town and a great friend of ours; and my lady Dulcinea del Toboso they have turned into a common country wench; so I suspect this lacquey will have to live and die a lacquey all the days of his life.\u201d Here the Rodriguez\u2019s daughter exclaimed, \u201cLet him be who he may, this man that claims me for a wife; I am thankful to him for the same, for I had rather be the lawful wife of a lacquey than the cheated mistress of a gentleman; though he who played me false is nothing of the kind.\u201d To be brief, all the talk and all that had happened ended in Tosilos being shut up until it was seen how his transformation turned out. All hailed Don Quixote as victor, but the greater number were vexed and disappointed at finding that the combatants they had been so anxiously waiting for had not battered one another to pieces, just as the boys are disappointed when the man they are waiting to see hanged does not come out, because the prosecution or the court has pardoned him. The people dispersed, the duke and Don Quixote returned to the castle, they locked up Tosilos, Do\u00f1a Rodriguez and her daughter remained perfectly contented when they saw that any way the affair must end in marriage, and Tosilos wanted nothing else. p56e.jpg (46K) CHAPTER LVII.

After this the history goes on to say that the day fixed for the battle arrived, and that the duke, after having repeatedly instructed his lacquey Tosilos how to deal with Don Quixote so as to vanquish him without killing or wounding him, gave orders to have the heads removed from the lances, telling Don Quixote that Christian charity, on which he plumed himself, could not suffer the battle to be fought with so much risk and danger to life; and that he must be content with the offer of a battlefield on his territory (though that was against the decree of the holy Council, which prohibits all challenges of the sort) and not push such an arduous venture to its extreme limits.", " \u201cAnd he does well,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cfor what thou hast to give to the mouse, give to the cat, and it will save thee all trouble.\u201d Tosilos meanwhile was trying to unlace his helmet, and he begged them to come to his help at once, as his power of breathing was failing him, and he could not remain so long shut up in that confined space. They removed it in all haste, and his lacquey features were revealed to public gaze. At this sight Do\u00f1a Rodriguez and her daughter raised a mighty outcry, exclaiming, \u201cThis is a trick! This is a trick! They have put Tosilos, my lord the duke\u2019s lacquey, upon us in place of the real husband. The justice of God and the king against such trickery, not to say roguery!\u201d \u201cDo not distress yourselves, ladies,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cfor this is no trickery or roguery; or if it is, it is not the duke who is at the bottom of it, but those wicked enchanters who persecute me, and who, jealous of my reaping the glory of this victory, have turned your husband\u2019s features into those of this person, who you say is a lacquey of the duke\u2019s; take my advice, and notwithstanding the malice of my enemies marry him, for beyond a doubt he is the one you wish for a husband.\u201d When the duke heard this all his anger was near vanishing in a fit of laughter, and he said, \u201cThe things that happen to Se\u00f1or Don Quixote are so extraordinary that I am ready to believe this lacquey of mine is not one; but let us adopt this plan and device; let us put off the marriage for, say, a fortnight, and let us keep this person about whom we are uncertain in close confinement, and perhaps in the course of that time he may return to his original shape; for the spite which the enchanters entertain against Se\u00f1or Don Quixote cannot last so long, especially as it is of so little advantage to them to practise these deceptions and transformations.\u201d \u201cOh, se\u00f1or,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cthose scoundrels are well used to changing whatever concerns my master from one thing into another."], "What does Don Quixote continually ask Sancho to do for the sake of reversing Dulcinea\u2019s enchantment?": [" So thou mayest set thy mind at rest as to the idea that they are what thou sayest, for they are as much so as I am a Turk. But touching thy desire to ask me something, say on, and I will answer thee, though thou shouldst ask questions from this till to-morrow morning.\u201d \u201cMay Our Lady be good to me!\u201d said Sancho, lifting up his voice; \u201cand is it possible that your worship is so thick of skull and so short of brains that you cannot see that what I say is the simple truth, and that malice has more to do with your imprisonment and misfortune than enchantment? But as it is so, I will prove plainly to you that you are not enchanted. Now tell me, so may God deliver you from this affliction, and so may you find yourself when you least expect it in the arms of my lady Dulcinea\u2014\u201d \u201cLeave off conjuring me,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand ask what thou wouldst know; I have already told thee I will answer with all possible precision.\u201d \u201cThat is what I want,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cand what I would know, and have you tell me, without adding or leaving out anything, but telling the whole truth as one expects it to be told, and as it is told, by all who profess arms, as your worship professes them, under the title of knights-errant\u2014\u201d \u201cI tell thee I will not lie in any particular,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cfinish thy question; for in truth thou weariest me with all these asseverations, requirements, and precautions, Sancho.\u201d \u201cWell, I rely on the goodness and truth of my master,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cand so, because it bears upon what we are talking about, I would ask, speaking with all reverence, whether since your worship has been shut up and, as you think, enchanted in this cage, you have felt any desire or inclination to go anywhere, as the saying is?\u201d \u201cI do not understand \u2018going anywhere,\u2019\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cexplain thyself more clearly, Sancho, if thou wouldst have me give an answer to the point.\u201d \u201cIs it possible,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cthat your worship does not understand \u2018going anywhere\u2019?", " We may therefore believe, without any hesitation, that since, as you say, sir knight, everything in this castle goes and is brought about by means of enchantment, Sancho, I say, may possibly have seen, through this diabolical medium, what he says he saw so much to the detriment of my modesty.\u201d \u201cI swear by God Omnipotent,\u201d exclaimed Don Quixote at this, \u201cyour highness has hit the point; and that some vile illusion must have come before this sinner of a Sancho, that made him see what it would have been impossible to see by any other means than enchantments; for I know well enough, from the poor fellow\u2019s goodness and harmlessness, that he is incapable of bearing false witness against anybody.\u201d \u201cTrue, no doubt,\u201d said Don Fernando, \u201cfor which reason, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote, you ought to forgive him and restore him to the bosom of your favour, _sicut erat in principio_, before illusions of this sort had taken away his senses.\u201d Don Quixote said he was ready to pardon him, and the curate went for Sancho, who came in very humbly, and falling on his knees begged for the hand of his master, who having presented it to him and allowed him to kiss it, gave him his blessing and said, \u201cNow, Sancho my son, thou wilt be convinced of the truth of what I have many a time told thee, that everything in this castle is done by means of enchantment.\u201d \u201cSo it is, I believe,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cexcept the affair of the blanket, which came to pass in reality by ordinary means.\u201d \u201cBelieve it not,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cfor had it been so, I would have avenged thee that instant, or even now; but neither then nor now could I, nor have I seen anyone upon whom to avenge thy wrong.\u201d They were all eager to know what the affair of the blanket was, and the landlord gave them a minute account of Sancho\u2019s flights, at which they laughed not a little, and at which Sancho would have been no less out of countenance had not his master once more assured him it was all enchantment.", " And it seems to me that, in governments, to make a beginning is everything; and maybe, after having been governor a fortnight, I\u2019ll take kindly to the work and know more about it than the field labour I have been brought up to.\u201d \u201cYou are right, Sancho,\u201d said the duchess, \u201cfor no one is born ready taught, and the bishops are made out of men and not out of stones. But to return to the subject we were discussing just now, the enchantment of the lady Dulcinea, I look upon it as certain, and something more than evident, that Sancho\u2019s idea of practising a deception upon his master, making him believe that the peasant girl was Dulcinea and that if he did not recognise her it must be because she was enchanted, was all a device of one of the enchanters that persecute Don Quixote. For in truth and earnest, I know from good authority that the coarse country wench who jumped up on the ass was and is Dulcinea del Toboso, and that worthy Sancho, though he fancies himself the deceiver, is the one that is deceived; and that there is no more reason to doubt the truth of this, than of anything else we never saw. Se\u00f1or Sancho Panza must know that we too have enchanters here that are well disposed to us, and tell us what goes on in the world, plainly and distinctly, without subterfuge or deception; and believe me, Sancho, that agile country lass was and is Dulcinea del Toboso, who is as much enchanted as the mother that bore her; and when we least expect it, we shall see her in her own proper form, and then Sancho will be disabused of the error he is under at present.\u201d \u201cAll that\u2019s very possible,\u201d said Sancho Panza; \u201cand now I\u2019m willing to believe what my master says about what he saw in the cave of Montesinos, where he says he saw the lady Dulcinea del Toboso in the very same dress and apparel that I said I had seen her in when I enchanted her all to please myself.", " But one thing, se\u00f1or, troubles me more than all the rest, and that is thinking what is to be done when your worship conquers some giant, or some other knight, and orders him to go and present himself before the beauty of the lady Dulcinea. Where is this poor giant, or this poor wretch of a vanquished knight, to find her? I think I can see them wandering all over El Toboso, looking like noddies, and asking for my lady Dulcinea; and even if they meet her in the middle of the street they won\u2019t know her any more than they would my father.\u201d \u201cPerhaps, Sancho,\u201d returned Don Quixote, \u201cthe enchantment does not go so far as to deprive conquered and presented giants and knights of the power of recognising Dulcinea; we will try by experiment with one or two of the first I vanquish and send to her, whether they see her or not, by commanding them to return and give me an account of what happened to them in this respect.\u201d \u201cI declare, I think what your worship has proposed is excellent,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cand that by this plan we shall find out what we want to know; and if it be that it is only from your worship she is hidden, the misfortune will be more yours than hers; but so long as the lady Dulcinea is well and happy, we on our part will make the best of it, and get on as well as we can, seeking our adventures, and leaving Time to take his own course; for he is the best physician for these and greater ailments.\u201d Don Quixote was about to reply to Sancho Panza, but he was prevented by a cart crossing the road full of the most diverse and strange personages and figures that could be imagined."], "Where do the ten horsemen take Don Quixote and Sancho after capturing them?": [" And now the horsemen in livery came galloping up with shouts and outlandish cries and cheers to where Don Quixote stood amazed and wondering; and one of them, he to whom Roque had sent word, addressing him exclaimed, \u201cWelcome to our city, mirror, beacon, star and cynosure of all knight-errantry in its widest extent! Welcome, I say, valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha; not the false, the fictitious, the apocryphal, that these latter days have offered us in lying histories, but the true, the legitimate, the real one that Cide Hamete Benengeli, flower of historians, has described to us!\u201d Don Quixote made no answer, nor did the horsemen wait for one, but wheeling again with all their followers, they began curvetting round Don Quixote, who, turning to Sancho, said, \u201cThese gentlemen have plainly recognised us; I will wager they have read our history, and even that newly printed one by the Aragonese.\u201d The cavalier who had addressed Don Quixote again approached him and said, \u201cCome with us, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote, for we are all of us your servants and great friends of Roque Guinart\u2019s;\u201d to which Don Quixote returned, \u201cIf courtesy breeds courtesy, yours, sir knight, is daughter or very nearly akin to the great Roque\u2019s; carry me where you please; I will have no will but yours, especially if you deign to employ it in your service.\u201d p61c.jpg (448K) Full Size The cavalier replied with words no less polite, and then, all closing in around him, they set out with him for the city, to the music of the clarions and the drums.", " I asked no loan of anybody, nor did I try to fill my pocket; and though I meant to make some useful laws, I made hardly any, as I was afraid they would not be kept; for in that case it comes to the same thing to make them or not to make them. I quitted the island, as I said, without any escort except my ass; I fell into a pit, I pushed on through it, until this morning by the light of the sun I saw an outlet, but not so easy a one but that, had not heaven sent me my master Don Quixote, I\u2019d have stayed there till the end of the world. So now my lord and lady duke and duchess, here is your governor Sancho Panza, who in the bare ten days he has held the government has come by the knowledge that he would not give anything to be governor, not to say of an island, but of the whole world; and that point being settled, kissing your worships\u2019 feet, and imitating the game of the boys when they say, \u2018leap thou, and give me one,\u2019 I take a leap out of the government and pass into the service of my master Don Quixote; for after all, though in it I eat my bread in fear and trembling, at any rate I take my fill; and for my part, so long as I\u2019m full, it\u2019s all alike to me whether it\u2019s with carrots or with partridges.\u201d Here Sancho brought his long speech to an end, Don Quixote having been the whole time in dread of his uttering a host of absurdities; and when he found him leave off with so few, he thanked heaven in his heart.", " And now, about an hour after midnight, they reached a castle which Don Quixote saw at once was the duke\u2019s, where they had been but a short time before. \u201cGod bless me!\u201d said he, as he recognised the mansion, \u201cwhat does this mean? It is all courtesy and politeness in this house; but with the vanquished good turns into evil, and evil into worse.\u201d They entered the chief court of the castle and found it prepared and fitted up in a style that added to their amazement and doubled their fears, as will be seen in the following chapter. p68e.jpg (49K) CHAPTER LXIX. OF THE STRANGEST AND MOST EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURE THAT BEFELL DON QUIXOTE IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF THIS GREAT HISTORY p69a.jpg (141K) Full Size The horsemen dismounted, and, together with the men on foot, without a moment\u2019s delay taking up Sancho and Don Quixote bodily, they carried them into the court, all round which near a hundred torches fixed in sockets were burning, besides above five hundred lamps in the corridors, so that in spite of the night, which was somewhat dark, the want of daylight could not be perceived. In the middle of the court was a catafalque, raised about two yards above the ground and covered completely by an immense canopy of black velvet, and on the steps all round it white wax tapers burned in more than a hundred silver candlesticks. Upon the catafalque was seen the dead body of a damsel so lovely that by her beauty she made death itself look beautiful.", " It was done, and in the middle of it they found ten gold-crowns. All were filled with amazement, and looked upon their governor as another Solomon. They asked him how he had come to the conclusion that the ten crowns were in the cane; he replied, that observing how the old man who swore gave the stick to his opponent while he was taking the oath, and swore that he had really and truly given him the crowns, and how as soon as he had done swearing he asked for the stick again, it came into his head that the sum demanded must be inside it; and from this he said it might be seen that God sometimes guides those who govern in their judgments, even though they may be fools; besides he had himself heard the curate of his village mention just such another case, and he had so good a memory, that if it was not that he forgot everything he wished to remember, there would not be such a memory in all the island. To conclude, the old men went off, one crestfallen, and the other in high contentment, all who were present were astonished, and he who was recording the words, deeds, and movements of Sancho could not make up his mind whether he was to look upon him and set him down as a fool or as a man of sense. As soon as this case was disposed of, there came into court a woman holding on with a tight grip to a man dressed like a well-to-do cattle dealer, and she came forward making a great outcry and exclaiming, \u201cJustice, se\u00f1or governor, justice!"], "According to the Duke\u2019s musician, what do people call the practice of stealing one another\u2019s literary work?": [" \u201cWhy, there\u2019s a ballad that says they put King Rodrigo alive into a tomb full of toads, and adders, and lizards, and that two days afterwards the king, in a plaintive, feeble voice, cried out from within the tomb- They gnaw me now, they gnaw me now, There where I most did sin. And according to that the gentleman has good reason to say he would rather be a labouring man than a king, if vermin are to eat him.\u201d The duchess could not help laughing at the simplicity of her duenna, or wondering at the language and proverbs of Sancho, to whom she said, \u201cWorthy Sancho knows very well that when once a knight has made a promise he strives to keep it, though it should cost him his life. My lord and husband the duke, though not one of the errant sort, is none the less a knight for that reason, and will keep his word about the promised island, in spite of the envy and malice of the world. Let Sancho be of good cheer; for when he least expects it he will find himself seated on the throne of his island and seat of dignity, and will take possession of his government that he may discard it for another of three-bordered brocade. The charge I give him is to be careful how he governs his vassals, bearing in mind that they are all loyal and well-born.\u201d \u201cAs to governing them well,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cthere\u2019s no need of charging me to do that, for I\u2019m kind-hearted by nature, and full of compassion for the poor; there\u2019s no stealing the loaf from him who kneads and bakes;\u2019 and by my faith it won\u2019t do to throw false dice with me; I am an old dog, and I know all about \u2018tus, tus;\u2019 I can be wide-awake if need be, and I don\u2019t let clouds come before my eyes, for I know where the shoe pinches me; I say so, because with me the good will have support and protection, and the bad neither footing nor access.", " I was born to belong to Dulcinea del Toboso, and the fates, if there are any, dedicated me to her; and to suppose that any other beauty can take the place she occupies in my heart is to suppose an impossibility. This frank declaration should suffice to make you retire within the bounds of your modesty, for no one can bind himself to do impossibilities.\u201d Hearing this, Altisidora, with a show of anger and agitation, exclaimed, \u201cGod\u2019s life! Don Stockfish, soul of a mortar, stone of a date, more obstinate and obdurate than a clown asked a favour when he has his mind made up, if I fall upon you I\u2019ll tear your eyes out! Do you fancy, Don Vanquished, Don Cudgelled, that I died for your sake? All that you have seen to-night has been make-believe; I\u2019m not the woman to let the black of my nail suffer for such a camel, much less die!\u201d \u201cThat I can well believe,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cfor all that about lovers pining to death is absurd; they may talk of it, but as for doing it\u2014Judas may believe that!\u201d While they were talking, the musician, singer, and poet, who had sung the two stanzas given above came in, and making a profound obeisance to Don Quixote said, \u201cWill your worship, sir knight, reckon and retain me in the number of your most faithful servants, for I have long been a great admirer of yours, as well because of your fame as because of your achievements?\u201d \u201cWill your worship tell me who you are,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cso that my courtesy may be answerable to your deserts?\u201d The young man replied that he was the musician and songster of the night before.", " They placed him in the midst of them, and with much pomp and stateliness they conducted him into another room, where there was a sumptuous table laid with but four covers. The duchess and the duke came out to the door of the room to receive him, and with them a grave ecclesiastic, one of those who rule noblemen\u2019s houses; one of those who, not being born magnates themselves, never know how to teach those who are how to behave as such; one of those who would have the greatness of great folk measured by their own narrowness of mind; one of those who, when they try to introduce economy into the household they rule, lead it into meanness. One of this sort, I say, must have been the grave churchman who came out with the duke and duchess to receive Don Quixote. A vast number of polite speeches were exchanged, and at length, taking Don Quixote between them, they proceeded to sit down to table. The duke pressed Don Quixote to take the head of the table, and, though he refused, the entreaties of the duke were so urgent that he had to accept it. The ecclesiastic took his seat opposite to him, and the duke and duchess those at the sides. All this time Sancho stood by, gaping with amazement at the honour he saw shown to his master by these illustrious persons; and observing all the ceremonious pressing that had passed between the duke and Don Quixote to induce him to take his seat at the head of the table, he said, \u201cIf your worship will give me leave I will tell you a story of what happened in my village about this matter of seats.\u201d The moment Sancho said this Don Quixote trembled, making sure that he was about to say something foolish.", " On reading the letter my voice failed me, and still more when I heard my father say, \u2018Two days hence thou wilt depart, Cardenio, in accordance with the duke\u2019s wish, and give thanks to God who is opening a road to thee by which thou mayest attain what I know thou dost deserve; and to these words he added others of fatherly counsel. The time for my departure arrived; I spoke one night to Luscinda, I told her all that had occurred, as I did also to her father, entreating him to allow some delay, and to defer the disposal of her hand until I should see what the Duke Ricardo sought of me: he gave me the promise, and she confirmed it with vows and swoonings unnumbered. Finally, I presented myself to the duke, and was received and treated by him so kindly that very soon envy began to do its work, the old servants growing envious of me, and regarding the duke\u2019s inclination to show me favour as an injury to themselves. But the one to whom my arrival gave the greatest pleasure was the duke\u2019s second son, Fernando by name, a gallant youth, of noble, generous, and amorous disposition, who very soon made so intimate a friend of me that it was remarked by everybody; for though the elder was attached to me, and showed me kindness, he did not carry his affectionate treatment to the same length as Don Fernando. It so happened, then, that as between friends no secret remains unshared, and as the favour I enjoyed with Don Fernando had grown into friendship, he made all his thoughts known to me, and in particular a love affair which troubled his mind a little."], "Don Quixote remembers Don Alvero Tarfe from ___.": [" p71e.jpg (42K) CHAPTER LXXII. OF HOW DON QUIXOTE AND SANCHO REACHED THEIR VILLAGE p72a.jpg (155K) Full Size All that day Don Quixote and Sancho remained in the village and inn waiting for night, the one to finish off his task of scourging in the open country, the other to see it accomplished, for therein lay the accomplishment of his wishes. Meanwhile there arrived at the hostelry a traveller on horseback with three or four servants, one of whom said to him who appeared to be the master, \u201cHere, Se\u00f1or Don \u00c1lvaro Tarfe, your worship may take your siesta to-day; the quarters seem clean and cool.\u201d When he heard this Don Quixote said to Sancho, \u201cLook here, Sancho; on turning over the leaves of that book of the Second Part of my history I think I came casually upon this name of Don \u00c1lvaro Tarfe.\u201d \u201cVery likely,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cwe had better let him dismount, and by-and-by we can ask about it.\u201d The gentleman dismounted, and the landlady gave him a room on the ground floor opposite Don Quixote\u2019s and adorned with painted serge hangings of the same sort. The newly arrived gentleman put on a summer coat, and coming out to the gateway of the hostelry, which was wide and cool, addressing Don Quixote, who was pacing up and down there, he asked, \u201cIn what direction is your worship bound, gentle sir?\u201d \u201cTo a village near this which is my own village,\u201d replied Don Quixote; \u201cand your worship, where are you bound for?\u201d \u201cI am going to Granada, se\u00f1or,\u201d said the gentleman, \u201cto my own country.\u201d \u201cAnd a goodly country,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cbut will your worship do me the favour of telling me your name, for it strikes me it is of more importance to me to know it than I can tell you.\u201d \u201cMy name is Don \u00c1lvaro Tarfe,\u201d replied the traveller.", " To which Don Quixote returned, \u201cI have no doubt whatever that your worship is that Don \u00c1lvaro Tarfe who appears in print in the Second Part of the history of Don Quixote of La Mancha, lately printed and published by a new author.\u201d \u201cI am the same,\u201d replied the gentleman; \u201cand that same Don Quixote, the principal personage in the said history, was a very great friend of mine, and it was I who took him away from home, or at least induced him to come to some jousts that were to be held at Saragossa, whither I was going myself; indeed, I showed him many kindnesses, and saved him from having his shoulders touched up by the executioner because of his extreme rashness.\u201d \u201cTell me, Se\u00f1or Don \u00c1lvaro,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cam I at all like that Don Quixote you talk of?\u201d \u201cNo indeed,\u201d replied the traveller, \u201cnot a bit.\u201d \u201cAnd that Don Quixote\u2014\u201d said our one, \u201chad he with him a squire called Sancho Panza?\u201d \u201cHe had,\u201d said Don \u00c1lvaro; \u201cbut though he had the name of being very droll, I never heard him say anything that had any drollery in it.\u201d \u201cThat I can well believe,\u201d said Sancho at this, \u201cfor to come out with drolleries is not in everybody\u2019s line; and that Sancho your worship speaks of, gentle sir, must be some great scoundrel, dunderhead, and thief, all in one; for I am the real Sancho Panza, and I have more drolleries than if it rained them; let your worship only try; come along with me for a year or so, and you will find they fall from me at every turn, and so rich and so plentiful that though mostly I don\u2019t know what I am saying I make everybody that hears me laugh.", " And the real Don Quixote of La Mancha, the famous, the valiant, the wise, the lover, the righter of wrongs, the guardian of minors and orphans, the protector of widows, the killer of damsels, he who has for his sole mistress the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, is this gentleman before you, my master; all other Don Quixotes and all other Sancho Panzas are dreams and mockeries.\u201d \u201cBy God I believe it,\u201d said Don \u00c1lvaro; \u201cfor you have uttered more drolleries, my friend, in the few words you have spoken than the other Sancho Panza in all I ever heard from him, and they were not a few. He was more greedy than well-spoken, and more dull than droll; and I am convinced that the enchanters who persecute Don Quixote the Good have been trying to persecute me with Don Quixote the Bad. But I don\u2019t know what to say, for I am ready to swear I left him shut up in the Casa del Nuncio at Toledo, and here another Don Quixote turns up, though a very different one from mine.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I am good,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cbut I can safely say I am not \u2018the Bad;\u2019 and to prove it, let me tell you, Se\u00f1or Don \u00c1lvaro Tarfe, I have never in my life been in Saragossa; so far from that, when it was told me that this imaginary Don Quixote had been present at the jousts in that city, I declined to enter it, in order to drag his falsehood before the face of the world; and so I went on straight to Barcelona, the treasure-house of courtesy, haven of strangers, asylum of the poor, home of the valiant, champion of the wronged, pleasant exchange of firm friendships, and city unrivalled in site and beauty.", " By this dinner-time arrived, and Don Quixote and Don \u00c1lvaro dined together. The alcalde of the village came by chance into the inn together with a notary, and Don Quixote laid a petition before him, showing that it was requisite for his rights that Don \u00c1lvaro Tarfe, the gentleman there present, should make a declaration before him that he did not know Don Quixote of La Mancha, also there present, and that he was not the one that was in print in a history entitled \u201cSecond Part of Don Quixote of La Mancha, by one Avellaneda of Tordesillas.\u201d The alcalde finally put it in legal form, and the declaration was made with all the formalities required in such cases, at which Don Quixote and Sancho were in high delight, as if a declaration of the sort was of any great importance to them, and as if their words and deeds did not plainly show the difference between the two Don Quixotes and the two Sanchos. Many civilities and offers of service were exchanged by Don \u00c1lvaro and Don Quixote, in the course of which the great Manchegan displayed such good taste that he disabused Don \u00c1lvaro of the error he was under; and he, on his part, felt convinced he must have been enchanted, now that he had been brought in contact with two such opposite Don Quixotes. Evening came, they set out from the village, and after about half a league two roads branched off, one leading to Don Quixote\u2019s village, the other the road Don \u00c1lvaro was to follow."], "What does Don Quixote disavow before dying of fever?": [" This doctor says of himself that he does not cure diseases when there are any, but prevents them coming, and the medicines he uses are diet and more diet until he brings one down to bare bones; as if leanness was not worse than fever. In short he is killing me with hunger, and I am dying myself of vexation; for when I thought I was coming to this government to get my meat hot and my drink cool, and take my ease between holland sheets on feather beds, I find I have come to do penance as if I was a hermit; and as I don\u2019t do it willingly I suspect that in the end the devil will carry me off. So far I have not handled any dues or taken any bribes, and I don\u2019t know what to think of it; for here they tell me that the governors that come to this island, before entering it have plenty of money either given to them or lent to them by the people of the town, and that this is the usual custom not only here but with all who enter upon governments. Last night going the rounds I came upon a fair damsel in man\u2019s clothes, and a brother of hers dressed as a woman; my head-carver has fallen in love with the girl, and has in his own mind chosen her for a wife, so he says, and I have chosen the youth for a son-in-law; to-day we are going to explain our intentions to the father of the pair, who is one Diego de la Llana, a gentleman and an old Christian as much as you please. I have visited the market-places, as your worship advises me, and yesterday I found a stall-keeper selling new hazel nuts and proved her to have mixed a bushel of old empty rotten nuts with a bushel of new; I confiscated the whole for the children of the charity-school, who will know how to distinguish them well enough, and I sentenced her not to come into the market-place for a fortnight; they told me I did bravely.", " c24e.jpg (69K) Full Size CHAPTER XXV. WHICH TREATS OF THE STRANGE THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO THE STOUT KNIGHT OF LA MANCHA IN THE SIERRA MORENA, AND OF HIS IMITATION OF THE PENANCE OF BELTENEBROS c25a.jpg (168K) Full Size Don Quixote took leave of the goatherd, and once more mounting Rocinante bade Sancho follow him, which he having no ass, did very discontentedly. They proceeded slowly, making their way into the most rugged part of the mountain, Sancho all the while dying to have a talk with his master, and longing for him to begin, so that there should be no breach of the injunction laid upon him; but unable to keep silence so long he said to him: \u201cSe\u00f1or Don Quixote, give me your worship\u2019s blessing and dismissal, for I\u2019d like to go home at once to my wife and children with whom I can at any rate talk and converse as much as I like; for to want me to go through these solitudes day and night and not speak to you when I have a mind is burying me alive. If luck would have it that animals spoke as they did in the days of Guisopete, it would not be so bad, because I could talk to Rocinante about whatever came into my head, and so put up with my ill-fortune; but it is a hard case, and not to be borne with patience, to go seeking adventures all one\u2019s life and get nothing but kicks and blanketings, brickbats and punches, and with all this to have to sew up one\u2019s mouth without daring to say what is in one\u2019s heart, just as if one were dumb.\u201d \u201cI understand thee, Sancho,\u201d replied Don Quixote; \u201cthou art dying to have the interdict I placed upon thy tongue removed; consider it removed, and say what thou wilt while we are wandering in these mountains.\u201d \u201cSo be it,\u201d said Sancho; \u201clet me speak now, for God knows what will happen by-and-by; and to take advantage of the permit at once, I ask, what made your worship stand up so for that Queen Majimasa, or whatever her name is, or what did it matter whether that abbot was a friend of hers or not?", " Why, to make choice of evils, it\u2019s better to be a knight-errant than a shepherd! Look here, se\u00f1or; take my advice\u2014and I\u2019m not giving it to you full of bread and wine, but fasting, and with fifty years upon my head\u2014stay at home, look after your affairs, go often to confession, be good to the poor, and upon my soul be it if any evil comes to you.\u201d \u201cHold your peace, my daughters,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cI know very well what my duty is; help me to bed, for I don\u2019t feel very well; and rest assured that, knight-errant now or wandering shepherd to be, I shall never fail to have a care for your interests, as you will see in the end.\u201d And the good wenches (for that they undoubtedly were), the housekeeper and niece, helped him to bed, where they gave him something to eat and made him as comfortable as possible.

For\u2014whether it was of the dejection the thought of his defeat produced, or of heaven\u2019s will that so ordered it\u2014a fever settled upon him and kept him in his bed for six days, during which he was often visited by his friends the curate, the bachelor, and the barber, while his good squire Sancho Panza never quitted his bedside.", " Come, my son, let us go look for some place where I may hide, while thou dost return, as thou sayest, to seek, and speak with my lady, from whose discretion and courtesy I look for favours more than miraculous.\u201d Sancho was in a fever to get his master out of the town, lest he should discover the falsehood of the reply he had brought to him in the Sierra Morena on behalf of Dulcinea; so he hastened their departure, which they took at once, and two miles out of the village they found a forest or thicket wherein Don Quixote ensconced himself, while Sancho returned to the city to speak to Dulcinea, in which embassy things befell him which demand fresh attention and a new chapter. p09e.jpg (34K) CHAPTER X.

But after all, though still under the same fear and apprehension, he has recorded it without adding to the story or leaving out a particle of the truth, and entirely disregarding the charges of falsehood that might be brought against him; and he was right, for the truth may run fine but will not break, and always rises above falsehood as oil above water; and so, going on with his story, he says that as soon as Don Quixote had ensconced himself in the forest, oak grove, or wood near El Toboso, he bade Sancho return to the city, and not come into his presence again without having first spoken on his behalf to his lady, and begged of her that it might be her good pleasure to permit herself to be seen by her enslaved knight, and deign to bestow her blessing upon him, so that he might thereby hope for a happy issue in all his encounters and difficult enterprises."]}
