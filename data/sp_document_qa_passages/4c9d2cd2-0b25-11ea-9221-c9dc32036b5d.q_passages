{"Who is the Knightof the White Moon?": [" In the end they carried him into the city in a hand-chair which the viceroy sent for, and thither the viceroy himself returned, eager to ascertain who this Knight of the White Moon was who had left Don Quixote in such a sad plight. p64e.jpg (44K) Full Size CHAPTER LXV. WHEREIN IS MADE KNOWN WHO THE KNIGHT OF THE WHITE MOON WAS; LIKEWISE DON GREGORIO\u2019S RELEASE, AND OTHER EVENTS p65a.jpg (149K) Full Size Don Antonio Moreno followed the Knight of the White Moon, and a number of boys followed him too, nay pursued him, until they had him fairly housed in a hostel in the heart of the city. Don Antonio, eager to make his acquaintance, entered also; a squire came out to meet him and remove his armour, and he shut himself into a lower room, still attended by Don Antonio, whose bread would not bake until he had found out who he was. He of the White Moon, seeing then that the gentleman would not leave him, said, \u201cI know very well, se\u00f1or, what you have come for; it is to find out who I am; and as there is no reason why I should conceal it from you, while my servant here is taking off my armour I will tell you the true state of the case, without leaving out anything.", " The viceroy went over to Don Antonio, and asked in a low voice did he know who the Knight of the White Moon was, or was it some joke they were playing on Don Quixote. Don Antonio replied that he neither knew who he was nor whether the defiance was in joke or in earnest. This answer left the viceroy in a state of perplexity, not knowing whether he ought to let the combat go on or not; but unable to persuade himself that it was anything but a joke he fell back, saying, \u201cIf there be no other way out of it, gallant knights, except to confess or die, and Don Quixote is inflexible, and your worship of the White Moon still more so, in God\u2019s hand be it, and fall on.\u201d He of the White Moon thanked the viceroy in courteous and well-chosen words for the permission he gave them, and so did Don Quixote, who then, commending himself with all his heart to heaven and to his Dulcinea, as was his custom on the eve of any combat that awaited him, proceeded to take a little more distance, as he saw his antagonist was doing the same; then, without blast of trumpet or other warlike instrument to give them the signal to charge, both at the same instant wheeled their horses; and he of the White Moon, being the swifter, met Don Quixote after having traversed two-thirds of the course, and there encountered him with such violence that, without touching him with his lance (for he held it high, to all appearance purposely), he hurled Don Quixote and Rocinante to the earth, a perilous fall.", " Take, therefore, the side of the field you choose, and I will do the same; and to whom God shall give it may Saint Peter add his blessing.\u201d The Knight of the White Moon had been seen from the city, and it was told the viceroy how he was in conversation with Don Quixote. The viceroy, fancying it must be some fresh adventure got up by Don Antonio Moreno or some other gentleman of the city, hurried out at once to the beach accompanied by Don Antonio and several other gentlemen, just as Don Quixote was wheeling Rocinante round in order to take up the necessary distance. The viceroy upon this, seeing that the pair of them were evidently preparing to come to the charge, put himself between them, asking them what it was that led them to engage in combat all of a sudden in this way. The Knight of the White Moon replied that it was a question of precedence of beauty; and briefly told him what he had said to Don Quixote, and how the conditions of the defiance agreed upon on both sides had been accepted.", " Two days afterwards the renegade put to sea in a light vessel of six oars a-side manned by a stout crew, and two days later the galleys made sail eastward, the general having begged the viceroy to let him know all about the release of Don Gregorio and about Ana Felix, and the viceroy promised to do as he requested. One morning as Don Quixote went out for a stroll along the beach, arrayed in full armour (for, as he often said, that was \u201chis only gear, his only rest the fray,\u201d and he never was without it for a moment), he saw coming towards him a knight, also in full armour, with a shining moon painted on his shield, who, on approaching sufficiently near to be heard, said in a loud voice, addressing himself to Don Quixote, \u201cIllustrious knight, and never sufficiently extolled Don Quixote of La Mancha, I am the Knight of the White Moon, whose unheard-of achievements will perhaps have recalled him to thy memory."], "How many expeditionsdoes Don Quixote make without Sancho Panza?": [" c15c.jpg (362K) Full Size Then, seeing the mischief they had done, the Yanguesans with all the haste they could loaded their team and pursued their journey, leaving the two adventurers a sorry sight and in sorrier mood.

Don Quixote merely observed him steadily, longing for him to leap from the cart and come to close quarters with him, when he hoped to hew him in pieces. So far did his unparalleled madness go; but the noble lion, more courteous than arrogant, not troubling himself about silly bravado, after having looked all round, as has been said, turned about and presented his hind-quarters to Don Quixote, and very coolly and tranquilly lay down again in the cage.", " Tom Cecial, seeing how ill they had succeeded, and what a sorry end their expedition had come to, said to the bachelor, \u201cSure enough, Se\u00f1or Samson Carrasco, we are served right; it is easy enough to plan and set about an enterprise, but it is often a difficult matter to come well out of it.

I\u2019d like to know now which is the madder, he who is so because he cannot help it, or he who is so of his own choice?\u201d To which Samson replied, \u201cThe difference between the two sorts of madmen is, that he who is so will he nil he, will be one always, while he who is so of his own accord can leave off being one whenever he likes.\u201d \u201cIn that case,\u201d said Tom Cecial, \u201cI was a madman of my own accord when I volunteered to become your squire, and, of my own accord, I\u2019ll leave off being one and go home.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s your affair,\u201d returned Samson, \u201cbut to suppose that I am going home until I have given Don Quixote a thrashing is absurd; and it is not any wish that he may recover his senses that will make me hunt him out now, but a wish for the sore pain I am in with my ribs won\u2019t let me entertain more charitable thoughts.\u201d Thus discoursing, the pair proceeded until they reached a town where it was their good luck to find a bone-setter, with whose help the unfortunate Samson was cured.", " Let each look to himself and not try to make out white black, and black white; for each of us is as God made him, aye, and often worse.\u201d \u201cI will take care,\u201d said Carrasco, \u201cto impress upon the author of the history that, if he prints it again, he must not forget what worthy Sancho has said, for it will raise it a good span higher.\u201d \u201cIs there anything else to correct in the history, se\u00f1or bachelor?\u201d asked Don Quixote. \u201cNo doubt there is,\u201d replied he; \u201cbut not anything that will be of the same importance as those I have mentioned.\u201d \u201cDoes the author promise a second part at all?\u201d said Don Quixote. \u201cHe does promise one,\u201d replied Samson; \u201cbut he says he has not found it, nor does he know who has got it; and we cannot say whether it will appear or not; and so, on that head, as some say that no second part has ever been good, and others that enough has been already written about Don Quixote, it is thought there will be no second part; though some, who are jovial rather than saturnine, say, \u2018Let us have more Quixotades, let Don Quixote charge and Sancho chatter, and no matter what it may turn out, we shall be satisfied with that.\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd what does the author mean to do?\u201d said Don Quixote.", " The chaplain said he would go with him to see what madmen there were in the house; so they went upstairs, and with them some of those who were present. Approaching a cage in which there was a furious madman, though just at that moment calm and quiet, the licentiate said to him, \u2018Brother, think if you have any commands for me, for I am going home, as God has been pleased, in his infinite goodness and mercy, without any merit of mine, to restore me my reason. I am now cured and in my senses, for with God\u2019s power nothing is impossible. Have strong hope and trust in him, for as he has restored me to my original condition, so likewise he will restore you if you trust in him.

Samson embraced him, and entreated him to let him hear of his good or evil fortunes, so that he might rejoice over the former or condole with him over the latter, as the laws of friendship required. Don Quixote promised him he would do so, and Samson returned to the village, and the other two took the road for the great city of El Toboso. p07e.jpg (24K) CHAPTER VIII.", " But one thing, se\u00f1or, troubles me more than all the rest, and that is thinking what is to be done when your worship conquers some giant, or some other knight, and orders him to go and present himself before the beauty of the lady Dulcinea. Where is this poor giant, or this poor wretch of a vanquished knight, to find her? I think I can see them wandering all over El Toboso, looking like noddies, and asking for my lady Dulcinea; and even if they meet her in the middle of the street they won\u2019t know her any more than they would my father.\u201d \u201cPerhaps, Sancho,\u201d returned Don Quixote, \u201cthe enchantment does not go so far as to deprive conquered and presented giants and knights of the power of recognising Dulcinea; we will try by experiment with one or two of the first I vanquish and send to her, whether they see her or not, by commanding them to return and give me an account of what happened to them in this respect.\u201d \u201cI declare, I think what your worship has proposed is excellent,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cand that by this plan we shall find out what we want to know; and if it be that it is only from your worship she is hidden, the misfortune will be more yours than hers; but so long as the lady Dulcinea is well and happy, we on our part will make the best of it, and get on as well as we can, seeking our adventures, and leaving Time to take his own course; for he is the best physician for these and greater ailments.\u201d Don Quixote was about to reply to Sancho Panza, but he was prevented by a cart crossing the road full of the most diverse and strange personages and figures that could be imagined.", " But what will you say when I tell you now how, among the countless other marvellous things Montesinos showed me (of which at leisure and at the proper time I will give thee an account in the course of our journey, for they would not be all in place here), he showed me three country girls who went skipping and capering like goats over the pleasant fields there, and the instant I beheld them I knew one to be the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, and the other two those same country girls that were with her and that we spoke to on the road from El Toboso! I asked Montesinos if he knew them, and he told me he did not, but he thought they must be some enchanted ladies of distinction, for it was only a few days before that they had made their appearance in those meadows; but I was not to be surprised at that, because there were a great many other ladies there of times past and present, enchanted in various strange shapes, and among them he had recognised Queen Guinevere and her dame Quinta\u00f1ona, she who poured out the wine for Lancelot when he came from Britain.\u201d When Sancho Panza heard his master say this he was ready to take leave of his senses, or die with laughter; for, as he knew the real truth about the pretended enchantment of Dulcinea, in which he himself had been the enchanter and concocter of all the evidence, he made up his mind at last that, beyond all doubt, his master was out of his wits and stark mad, so he said to him, \u201cIt was an evil hour, a worse season, and a sorrowful day, when your worship, dear master mine, went down to the other world, and an unlucky moment when you met with Se\u00f1or Montesinos, who has sent you back to us like this.", " Se\u00f1or Sancho Panza must know that we too have enchanters here that are well disposed to us, and tell us what goes on in the world, plainly and distinctly, without subterfuge or deception; and believe me, Sancho, that agile country lass was and is Dulcinea del Toboso, who is as much enchanted as the mother that bore her; and when we least expect it, we shall see her in her own proper form, and then Sancho will be disabused of the error he is under at present.\u201d \u201cAll that\u2019s very possible,\u201d said Sancho Panza; \u201cand now I\u2019m willing to believe what my master says about what he saw in the cave of Montesinos, where he says he saw the lady Dulcinea del Toboso in the very same dress and apparel that I said I had seen her in when I enchanted her all to please myself. It must be all exactly the other way, as your ladyship says; because it is impossible to suppose that out of my poor wit such a cunning trick could be concocted in a moment, nor do I think my master is so mad that by my weak and feeble persuasion he could be made to believe a thing so out of all reason."], "How does the Duchessknow who Don Quixote and Sancho Panza are?": [" c15c.jpg (362K) Full Size Then, seeing the mischief they had done, the Yanguesans with all the haste they could loaded their team and pursued their journey, leaving the two adventurers a sorry sight and in sorrier mood.

Anselmo was deep in love with a high-born and beautiful maiden of the same city, the daughter of parents so estimable, and so estimable herself, that he resolved, with the approval of his friend Lothario, without whom he did nothing, to ask her of them in marriage, and did so, Lothario being the bearer of the demand, and conducting the negotiation so much to the satisfaction of his friend that in a short time he was in possession of the object of his desires, and Camilla so happy in having won Anselmo for her husband, that she gave thanks unceasingly to heaven and to Lothario, by whose means such good fortune had fallen to her.", " To all this and much more that Anselmo said to Lothario to persuade him to come to his house as he had been in the habit of doing, Lothario replied with so much prudence, sense, and judgment, that Anselmo was satisfied of his friend\u2019s good intentions, and it was agreed that on two days in the week, and on holidays, Lothario should come to dine with him; but though this arrangement was made between them Lothario resolved to observe it no further than he considered to be in accordance with the honour of his friend, whose good name was more to him than his own. He said, and justly, that a married man upon whom heaven had bestowed a beautiful wife should consider as carefully what friends he brought to his house as what female friends his wife associated with, for what cannot be done or arranged in the market-place, in church, at public festivals or at stations (opportunities that husbands cannot always deny their wives), may be easily managed in the house of the female friend or relative in whom most confidence is reposed.", " Anselmo took his departure, and Camilla and Lothario were left alone at the table, for the rest of the household had gone to dinner. Lothario saw himself in the lists according to his friend\u2019s wish, and facing an enemy that could by her beauty alone vanquish a squadron of armed knights; judge whether he had good reason to fear; but what he did was to lean his elbow on the arm of the chair, and his cheek upon his hand, and, asking Camilla\u2019s pardon for his ill manners, he said he wished to take a little sleep until Anselmo returned. Camilla in reply said he could repose more at his ease in the reception-room than in his chair, and begged of him to go in and sleep there; but Lothario declined, and there he remained asleep until the return of Anselmo, who finding Camilla in her own room, and Lothario asleep, imagined that he had stayed away so long as to have afforded them time enough for conversation and even for sleep, and was all impatience until Lothario should wake up, that he might go out with him and question him as to his success.", " Lothario said, too, that every married man should have some friend who would point out to him any negligence he might be guilty of in his conduct, for it will sometimes happen that owing to the deep affection the husband bears his wife either he does not caution her, or, not to vex her, refrains from telling her to do or not to do certain things, doing or avoiding which may be a matter of honour or reproach to him; and errors of this kind he could easily correct if warned by a friend. But where is such a friend to be found as Lothario would have, so judicious, so loyal, and so true? Of a truth I know not; Lothario alone was such a one, for with the utmost care and vigilance he watched over the honour of his friend, and strove to diminish, cut down, and reduce the number of days for going to his house according to their agreement, lest the visits of a young man, wealthy, high-born, and with the attractions he was conscious of possessing, at the house of a woman so beautiful as Camilla, should be regarded with suspicion by the inquisitive and malicious eyes of the idle public."], "When he sees them,what does Don Quixote think the fulling mills are?": [" I say this because, if I mistake not, there comes towards us one who wears on his head the helmet of Mambrino, concerning which I took the oath thou rememberest.\u201d \u201cMind what you say, your worship, and still more what you do,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cfor I don\u2019t want any more fulling mills to finish off fulling and knocking our senses out.\u201d \u201cThe devil take thee, man,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cwhat has a helmet to do with fulling mills?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d replied Sancho, \u201cbut, faith, if I might speak as I used, perhaps I could give such reasons that your worship would see you were mistaken in what you say.\u201d \u201cHow can I be mistaken in what I say, unbelieving traitor?\u201d returned Don Quixote; \u201ctell me, seest thou not yonder knight coming towards us on a dappled grey steed, who has upon his head a helmet of gold?\u201d \u201cWhat I see and make out,\u201d answered Sancho, \u201cis only a man on a grey ass like my own, who has something that shines on his head.\u201d \u201cWell, that is the helmet of Mambrino,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cstand to one side and leave me alone with him; thou shalt see how, without saying a word, to save time, I shall bring this adventure to an issue and possess myself of the helmet I have so longed for.\u201d \u201cI will take care to stand aside,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cbut God grant, I say once more, that it may be marjoram and not fulling mills.\u201d \u201cI have told thee, brother, on no account to mention those fulling mills to me again,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cor I vow\u2014and I say no more\u2014I\u2019ll full the soul out of you.\u201d Sancho held his peace in dread lest his master should carry out the vow he had hurled like a bowl at him.", " WHICH TREATS OF THE EXALTED ADVENTURE AND RICH PRIZE OF MAMBRINO\u2019S HELMET, TOGETHER WITH OTHER THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO OUR INVINCIBLE KNIGHT c20a.jpg (73K) Full Size It now began to rain a little, and Sancho was for going into the fulling mills, but Don Quixote had taken such an abhorrence to them on account of the late joke that he would not enter them on any account; so turning aside to right they came upon another road, different from that which they had taken the night before. Shortly afterwards Don Quixote perceived a man on horseback who wore on his head something that shone like gold, and the moment he saw him he turned to Sancho and said: \u201cI think, Sancho, there is no proverb that is not true, all being maxims drawn from experience itself, the mother of all the sciences, especially that one that says, \u2018Where one door shuts, another opens.\u2019 I say so because if last night fortune shut the door of the adventure we were looking for against us, cheating us with the fulling mills, it now opens wide another one for another better and more certain adventure, and if I do not contrive to enter it, it will be my own fault, and I cannot lay it to my ignorance of fulling mills, or the darkness of the night.", " Don Quixote, then, seeing that Sancho was turning him into ridicule, was so mortified and vexed that he lifted up his pike and smote him two such blows that if, instead of catching them on his shoulders, he had caught them on his head there would have been no wages to pay, unless indeed to his heirs. Sancho seeing that he was getting an awkward return in earnest for his jest, and fearing his master might carry it still further, said to him very humbly, \u201cCalm yourself, sir, for by God I am only joking.\u201d \u201cWell, then, if you are joking I am not,\u201d replied Don Quixote. \u201cLook here, my lively gentleman, if these, instead of being fulling hammers, had been some perilous adventure, have I not, think you, shown the courage required for the attempt and achievement? Am I, perchance, being, as I am, a gentleman, bound to know and distinguish sounds and tell whether they come from fulling mills or not; and that, when perhaps, as is the case, I have never in my life seen any as you have, low boor as you are, that have been born and bred among them?", " p29b.jpg (314K) Full Size \u201cWhat persons or what castle art thou talking of, madman?

The notary was there at the time, and he said that in no book of chivalry had he ever read of any knight-errant dying in his bed so calmly and so like a Christian as Don Quixote, who amid the tears and lamentations of all present yielded up his spirit, that is to say died. On perceiving it the curate begged the notary to bear witness that Alonso Quixano the Good, commonly called Don Quixote of La Mancha, had passed away from this present life, and died naturally; and said he desired this testimony in order to remove the possibility of any other author save Cide Hamete Benengeli bringing him to life again falsely and making interminable stories out of his achievements. Such was the end of the Ingenious Gentleman of La Mancha, whose village Cide Hamete would not indicate precisely, in order to leave all the towns and villages of La Mancha to contend among themselves for the right to adopt him and claim him as a son, as the seven cities of Greece contended for Homer.", " p26e.jpg (34K) CHAPTER XXVII.

He says, then, that he who has read the First Part of this history will remember well enough the Gines de Pasamonte whom, with other galley slaves, Don Quixote set free in the Sierra Morena: a kindness for which he afterwards got poor thanks and worse payment from that evil-minded, ill-conditioned set.", " Exceedingly great was the amusement the two gentlemen derived from hearing Don Quixote recount the strange incidents of his history; and if they were amazed by his absurdities they were equally amazed by the elegant style in which he delivered them. On the one hand they regarded him as a man of wit and sense, and on the other he seemed to them a maundering blockhead, and they could not make up their minds whereabouts between wisdom and folly they ought to place him. Sancho having finished his supper, and left the landlord in the X condition, repaired to the room where his master was, and as he came in said, \u201cMay I die, sirs, if the author of this book your worships have got has any mind that we should agree; as he calls me glutton (according to what your worships say) I wish he may not call me drunkard too.\u201d \u201cBut he does,\u201d said Don Jeronimo; \u201cI cannot remember, however, in what way, though I know his words are offensive, and what is more, lying, as I can see plainly by the physiognomy of the worthy Sancho before me.\u201d \u201cBelieve me,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cthe Sancho and the Don Quixote of this history must be different persons from those that appear in the one Cide Hamete Benengeli wrote, who are ourselves; my master valiant, wise, and true in love, and I simple, droll, and neither glutton nor drunkard.\u201d \u201cI believe it,\u201d said Don Juan; \u201cand were it possible, an order should be issued that no one should have the presumption to deal with anything relating to Don Quixote, save his original author Cide Hamete; just as Alexander commanded that no one should presume to paint his portrait save Apelles.\u201d p60b.jpg (336K) Full Size \u201cLet him who will paint me,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cbut let him not abuse me; for patience will often break down when they heap insults upon it.\u201d \u201cNone can be offered to Se\u00f1or Don Quixote,\u201d said Don Juan, \u201cthat he himself will not be able to avenge, if he does not ward it off with the shield of his patience, which, I take it, is great and strong.\u201d A considerable portion of the night passed in conversation of this sort, and though Don Juan wished Don Quixote to read more of the book to see what it was all about, he was not to be prevailed upon, saying that he treated it as read and pronounced it utterly silly; and, if by any chance it should come to its author\u2019s ears that he had it in his hand, he did not want him to flatter himself with the idea that he had read it; for our thoughts, and still more our eyes, should keep themselves aloof from what is obscene and filthy."], "What does theDuke give Sancho Panza?": [" c15c.jpg (362K) Full Size Then, seeing the mischief they had done, the Yanguesans with all the haste they could loaded their team and pursued their journey, leaving the two adventurers a sorry sight and in sorrier mood.

Sancho stayed behind with the stew. and invested with plenary delegated authority seated himself at the head of the table, and the landlord sat down with him, for he was no less fond of cow-heel and calves\u2019 feet than Sancho was. While at supper Don Juan asked Don Quixote what news he had of the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, was she married, had she been brought to bed, or was she with child, or did she in maidenhood, still preserving her modesty and delicacy, cherish the remembrance of the tender passion of Se\u00f1or Don Quixote? To this he replied, \u201cDulcinea is a maiden still, and my passion more firmly rooted than ever, our intercourse unsatisfactory as before, and her beauty transformed into that of a foul country wench;\u201d and then he proceeded to give them a full and particular account of the enchantment of Dulcinea, and of what had happened him in the cave of Montesinos, together with what the sage Merlin had prescribed for her disenchantment, namely the scourging of Sancho.", " It must be a condition, too, that I am not to be bound to draw blood with the scourge, and that if any of the lashes happen to be fly-flappers they are to count.

So you have no cause to be uneasy about stripes too many or too few; heaven forbid I should cheat anyone of even a hair of his head.\u201d \u201cWell then, in God\u2019s hands be it,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cin the hard case I\u2019m in I give in; I say I accept the penance on the conditions laid down.\u201d The instant Sancho uttered these last words the music of the clarions struck up once more, and again a host of muskets were discharged, and Don Quixote hung on Sancho\u2019s neck kissing him again and again on the forehead and cheeks.", " And it seems to me that, in governments, to make a beginning is everything; and maybe, after having been governor a fortnight, I\u2019ll take kindly to the work and know more about it than the field labour I have been brought up to.\u201d \u201cYou are right, Sancho,\u201d said the duchess, \u201cfor no one is born ready taught, and the bishops are made out of men and not out of stones. But to return to the subject we were discussing just now, the enchantment of the lady Dulcinea, I look upon it as certain, and something more than evident, that Sancho\u2019s idea of practising a deception upon his master, making him believe that the peasant girl was Dulcinea and that if he did not recognise her it must be because she was enchanted, was all a device of one of the enchanters that persecute Don Quixote. For in truth and earnest, I know from good authority that the coarse country wench who jumped up on the ass was and is Dulcinea del Toboso, and that worthy Sancho, though he fancies himself the deceiver, is the one that is deceived; and that there is no more reason to doubt the truth of this, than of anything else we never saw."], "Why do the officersof the Holy Brotherhood want to arrest Don Quixote?": [" Sancho followed him at his ass\u2019s best trot, but Rocinante stepped out so that, seeing himself left behind, he was forced to call to his master to wait for him.

Infamous beings, who by your vile grovelling intellects deserve that heaven should not make known to you the virtue that lies in knight-errantry, or show you the sin and ignorance in which ye lie when ye refuse to respect the shadow, not to say the presence, of any knight-errant! Come now; band, not of officers, but of thieves; footpads with the licence of the Holy Brotherhood; tell me who was the ignoramus who signed a warrant of arrest against such a knight as I am? Who was he that did not know that knights-errant are independent of all jurisdictions, that their law is their sword, their charter their prowess, and their edicts their will?", " The ass and Rocinante, Sancho and Don Quixote, were all that were left upon the spot; the ass with drooping head, serious, shaking his ears from time to time as if he thought the storm of stones that assailed them was not yet over; Rocinante stretched beside his master, for he too had been brought to the ground by a stone; Sancho stripped, and trembling with fear of the Holy Brotherhood; and Don Quixote fuming to find himself so served by the very persons for whom he had done so much. c22e.jpg (44K) CHAPTER XXIII.

If I had believed thy words, I should have avoided this trouble; but it is done now, it is only to have patience and take warning for the future.\u201d c23b.jpg (318K) Full Size \u201cYour worship will take warning as much as I am a Turk,\u201d returned Sancho; \u201cbut, as you say this mischief might have been avoided if you had believed me, believe me now, and a still greater one will be avoided; for I tell you chivalry is of no account with the Holy Brotherhood, and they don\u2019t care two maravedis for all the knights-errant in the world; and I can tell you I fancy I hear their arrows whistling past my ears this minute.\u201d \u201cThou art a coward by nature, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cbut lest thou shouldst say I am obstinate, and that I never do as thou dost advise, this once I will take thy advice, and withdraw out of reach of that fury thou so dreadest; but it must be on one condition, that never, in life or in death, thou art to say to anyone that I retired or withdrew from this danger out of fear, but only in compliance with thy entreaties; for if thou sayest otherwise thou wilt lie therein, and from this time to that, and from that to this, I give thee lie, and say thou liest and wilt lie every time thou thinkest or sayest it; and answer me not again; for at the mere thought that I am withdrawing or retiring from any danger, above all from this, which does seem to carry some little shadow of fear with it, I am ready to take my stand here and await alone, not only that Holy Brotherhood you talk of and dread, but the brothers of the twelve tribes of Israel, and the Seven Maccabees, and Castor and Pollux, and all the brothers and brotherhoods in the world.\u201d \u201cSe\u00f1or,\u201d replied Sancho, \u201cto retire is not to flee, and there is no wisdom in waiting when danger outweighs hope, and it is the part of wise men to preserve themselves to-day for to-morrow, and not risk all in one day; and let me tell you, though I am a clown and a boor, I have got some notion of what they call safe conduct; so repent not of having taken my advice, but mount Rocinante if you can, and if not I will help you; and follow me, for my mother-wit tells me we have more need of legs than hands just now.\u201d Don Quixote mounted without replying, and, Sancho leading the way on his ass, they entered the side of the Sierra Morena, which was close by, as it was Sancho\u2019s design to cross it entirely and come out again at El Viso or Almod\u00f3var del Campo, and hide for some days among its crags so as to escape the search of the Brotherhood should they come to look for them.", " On learning the rank of Don Fernando and the resolution of Don Luis the four then settled it between themselves that three of them should return to tell his father how matters stood, and that the other should remain to wait upon Don Luis, and not leave him until they came back for him, or his father\u2019s orders were known. Thus by the authority of Agramante and the wisdom of King Sobrino all this complication of disputes was arranged; but the enemy of concord and hater of peace, feeling himself slighted and made a fool of, and seeing how little he had gained after having involved them all in such an elaborate entanglement, resolved to try his hand once more by stirring up fresh quarrels and disturbances. It came about in this wise: the officers were pacified on learning the rank of those with whom they had been engaged, and withdrew from the contest, considering that whatever the result might be they were likely to get the worst of the battle; but one of them, the one who had been thrashed and kicked by Don Fernando, recollected that among some warrants he carried for the arrest of certain delinquents, he had one against Don Quixote, whom the Holy Brotherhood had ordered to be arrested for setting the galley slaves free, as Sancho had, with very good reason, apprehended."], "Who is Cardenio?": [" In theirs the listeners felt as much pity as wonder at her misfortunes; but as the curate was just about to offer her some consolation and advice Cardenio forestalled him, saying, \u201cSo then, se\u00f1ora, you are the fair Dorothea, the only daughter of the rich Clenardo?\u201d Dorothea was astonished at hearing her father\u2019s name, and at the miserable appearance of him who mentioned it, for it has been already said how wretchedly clad Cardenio was; so she said to him: \u201cAnd who may you be, brother, who seem to know my father\u2019s name so well? For so far, if I remember rightly, I have not mentioned it in the whole story of my misfortunes.\u201d \u201cI am that unhappy being, se\u00f1ora,\u201d replied Cardenio, \u201cwhom, as you have said, Luscinda declared to be her husband; I am the unfortunate Cardenio, whom the wrong-doing of him who has brought you to your present condition has reduced to the state you see me in, bare, ragged, bereft of all human comfort, and what is worse, of reason, for I only possess it when Heaven is pleased for some short space to restore it to me.", " The instant she recognised him, with a prolonged plaintive cry drawn from the depths of her heart, she fell backwards fainting, and but for the barber being close by to catch her in his arms, she would have fallen completely to the ground. The curate at once hastened to uncover her face and throw water on it, and as he did so Don Fernando, for he it was who held the other in his arms, recognised her and stood as if death-stricken by the sight; not, however, relaxing his grasp of Luscinda, for it was she that was struggling to release herself from his hold, having recognised Cardenio by his voice, as he had recognised her. Cardenio also heard Dorothea\u2019s cry as she fell fainting, and imagining that it came from his Luscinda burst forth in terror from the room, and the first thing he saw was Don Fernando with Luscinda in his arms. Don Fernando, too, knew Cardenio at once; and all three, Luscinda, Cardenio, and Dorothea, stood in silent amazement scarcely knowing what had happened to them.", " Even Sancho Panza was weeping; though afterwards he said he only wept because he saw that Dorothea was not as he fancied the queen Micomicona, of whom he expected such great favours. Their wonder as well as their weeping lasted some time, and then Cardenio and Luscinda went and fell on their knees before Don Fernando, returning him thanks for the favour he had rendered them in language so grateful that he knew not how to answer them, and raising them up embraced them with every mark of affection and courtesy. He then asked Dorothea how she had managed to reach a place so far removed from her own home, and she in a few fitting words told all that she had previously related to Cardenio, with which Don Fernando and his companions were so delighted that they wished the story had been longer; so charmingly did Dorothea describe her misadventures. When she had finished Don Fernando recounted what had befallen him in the city after he had found in Luscinda\u2019s bosom the paper in which she declared that she was Cardenio\u2019s wife, and never could be his.", " And as we have this consolation springing from no very visionary hope or wild fancy, I entreat you, se\u00f1ora, to form new resolutions in your better mind, as I mean to do in mine, preparing yourself to look forward to happier fortunes; for I swear to you by the faith of a gentleman and a Christian not to desert you until I see you in possession of Don Fernando, and if I cannot by words induce him to recognise his obligation to you, in that case to avail myself of the right which my rank as a gentleman gives me, and with just cause challenge him on account of the injury he has done you, not regarding my own wrongs, which I shall leave to Heaven to avenge, while I on earth devote myself to yours.\u201d Cardenio\u2019s words completed the astonishment of Dorothea, and not knowing how to return thanks for such an offer, she attempted to kiss his feet; but Cardenio would not permit it, and the licentiate replied for both, commended the sound reasoning of Cardenio, and lastly, begged, advised, and urged them to come with him to his village, where they might furnish themselves with what they needed, and take measures to discover Don Fernando, or restore Dorothea to her parents, or do what seemed to them most advisable."], "What does CountessTrifaldi have that she does not want?": [" \u201cI told you already to go gently, master commissary,\u201d said Pasamonte; \u201ctheir lordships yonder never gave you that staff to ill-treat us wretches here, but to conduct and take us where his majesty orders you; if not, by the life of-never mind\u2014; it may be that some day the stains made in the inn will come out in the scouring; let everyone hold his tongue and behave well and speak better; and now let us march on, for we have had quite enough of this entertainment.\u201d The commissary lifted his staff to strike Pasamonte in return for his threats, but Don Quixote came between them, and begged him not to ill-use him, as it was not too much to allow one who had his hands tied to have his tongue a trifle free; and turning to the whole chain of them he said: \u201cFrom all you have told me, dear brethren, make out clearly that though they have punished you for your faults, the punishments you are about to endure do not give you much pleasure, and that you go to them very much against the grain and against your will, and that perhaps this one\u2019s want of courage under torture, that one\u2019s want of money, the other\u2019s want of advocacy, and lastly the perverted judgment of the judge may have been the cause of your ruin and of your failure to obtain the justice you had on your side.", " Hence the cogitation and abstraction you found me in, and reason enough, what you have heard from me.\u201d Hearing this, my friend, giving himself a slap on the forehead and breaking into a hearty laugh, exclaimed, \u201cBefore God, Brother, now am I disabused of an error in which I have been living all this long time I have known you, all through which I have taken you to be shrewd and sensible in all you do; but now I see you are as far from that as the heaven is from the earth. It is possible that things of so little moment and so easy to set right can occupy and perplex a ripe wit like yours, fit to break through and crush far greater obstacles? By my faith, this comes, not of any want of ability, but of too much indolence and too little knowledge of life. Do you want to know if I am telling the truth? Well, then, attend to me, and you will see how, in the opening and shutting of an eye, I sweep away all your difficulties, and supply all those deficiencies which you say check and discourage you from bringing before the world the story of your famous Don Quixote, the light and mirror of all knight-errantry.\u201d \u201cSay on,\u201d said I, listening to his talk; \u201chow do you propose to make up for my diffidence, and reduce to order this chaos of perplexity I am in?\u201d To which he made answer, \u201cYour first difficulty about the sonnets, epigrams, or complimentary verses which you want for the beginning, and which ought to be by persons of importance and rank, can be removed if you yourself take a little trouble to make them; you can afterwards baptise them, and put any name you like to them, fathering them on Prester John of the Indies or the Emperor of Trebizond, who, to my knowledge, were said to have been famous poets: and even if they were not, and any pedants or bachelors should attack you and question the fact, never care two maravedis for that, for even if they prove a lie against you they cannot cut off the hand you wrote it with.", " \u201cIn that case,\u201d said the canon, \u201ctake all the beasts there, and bring the sumpter mule back.\u201d While this was going on, Sancho, perceiving that he could speak to his master without having the curate and the barber, of whom he had his suspicions, present all the time, approached the cage in which Don Quixote was placed, and said, \u201cSe\u00f1or, to ease my conscience I want to tell you the state of the case as to your enchantment, and that is that these two here, with their faces covered, are the curate of our village and the barber; and I suspect they have hit upon this plan of carrying you off in this fashion, out of pure envy because your worship surpasses them in doing famous deeds; and if this be the truth it follows that you are not enchanted, but hoodwinked and made a fool of. And to prove this I want to ask you one thing; and if you answer me as I believe you will answer, you will be able to lay your finger on the trick, and you will see that you are not enchanted but gone wrong in your wits.\u201d \u201cAsk what thou wilt, Sancho my son,\u201d returned Don Quixote, \u201cfor I will satisfy thee and answer all thou requirest.", " Come to the point without all this beating about the bush, and all these scraps and additions.\u201d \u201cI want your worship, se\u00f1or,\u201d said the farmer, \u201cto do me the favour of giving me a letter of recommendation to the girl\u2019s father, begging him to be so good as to let this marriage take place, as we are not ill-matched either in the gifts of fortune or of nature; for to tell the truth, se\u00f1or governor, my son is possessed of a devil, and there is not a day but the evil spirits torment him three or four times; and from having once fallen into the fire, he has his face puckered up like a piece of parchment, and his eyes watery and always running; but he has the disposition of an angel, and if it was not for belabouring and pummelling himself he\u2019d be a saint.\u201d \u201cIs there anything else you want, good man?\u201d said Sancho. \u201cThere\u2019s another thing I\u2019d like,\u201d said the farmer, \u201cbut I\u2019m afraid to mention it; however, out it must; for after all I can\u2019t let it be rotting in my breast, come what may."], "Who pretendsto be Princess Micomicona?": [" He added that when Luscinda found herself in his power she lost all consciousness, and after returning to herself did nothing but weep and sigh without speaking a word; and thus in silence and tears they reached that inn, which for him was reaching heaven where all the mischances of earth are over and at an end. c36b.jpg (319K) Full Size c36e.jpg (36K) CHAPTER XXXVII. IN WHICH IS CONTINUED THE STORY OF THE FAMOUS PRINCESS MICOMICONA, WITH OTHER DROLL ADVENTURES c37a.jpg (159K) Full Size To all this Sancho listened with no little sorrow at heart to see how his hopes of dignity were fading away and vanishing in smoke, and how the fair Princess Micomicona had turned into Dorothea, and the giant into Don Fernando, while his master was sleeping tranquilly, totally unconscious of all that had come to pass. Dorothea was unable to persuade herself that her present happiness was not all a dream; Cardenio was in a similar state of mind, and Luscinda\u2019s thoughts ran in the same direction.", " The king will grant it very readily, and the knight will courteously kiss his hands for the favour done to him; and that night he will take leave of his lady the princess at the grating of the chamber where she sleeps, which looks upon a garden, and at which he has already many times conversed with her, the go-between and confidante in the matter being a damsel much trusted by the princess. He will sigh, she will swoon, the damsel will fetch water, much distressed because morning approaches, and for the honour of her lady he would not that they were discovered; at last the princess will come to herself and will present her white hands through the grating to the knight, who will kiss them a thousand and a thousand times, bathing them with his tears. It will be arranged between them how they are to inform each other of their good or evil fortunes, and the princess will entreat him to make his absence as short as possible, which he will promise to do with many oaths; once more he kisses her hands, and takes his leave in such grief that he is well-nigh ready to die.", " He came along singing the ballad that says- Ill did ye fare, ye men of France, In Roncesvalles chase- \u201cMay I die, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote, when he heard him, \u201cif any good will come to us to-night! Dost thou not hear what that clown is singing?\u201d \u201cI do,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cbut what has Roncesvalles chase to do with what we have in hand? He might just as well be singing the ballad of Calainos, for any good or ill that can come to us in our business.\u201d By this time the labourer had come up, and Don Quixote asked him, \u201cCan you tell me, worthy friend, and God speed you, whereabouts here is the palace of the peerless princess Do\u00f1a Dulcinea del Toboso?\u201d \u201cSe\u00f1or,\u201d replied the lad, \u201cI am a stranger, and I have been only a few days in the town, doing farm work for a rich farmer. In that house opposite there live the curate of the village and the sacristan, and both or either of them will be able to give your worship some account of this lady princess, for they have a list of all the people of El Toboso; though it is my belief there is not a princess living in the whole of it; many ladies there are, of quality, and in her own house each of them may be a princess.\u201d \u201cWell, then, she I am inquiring for will be one of these, my friend,\u201d said Don Quixote.", " And if that\u2019s the case, what do they mean by wanting me to believe that he is enchanted? For I have heard many a one say that enchanted people neither eat, nor sleep, nor talk; and my master, if you don\u2019t stop him, will talk more than thirty lawyers.\u201d Then turning to the curate he exclaimed, \u201cAh, se\u00f1or curate, se\u00f1or curate! do you think I don\u2019t know you? Do you think I don\u2019t guess and see the drift of these new enchantments? Well then, I can tell you I know you, for all your face is covered, and I can tell you I am up to you, however you may hide your tricks. After all, where envy reigns virtue cannot live, and where there is niggardliness there can be no liberality. Ill betide the devil! if it had not been for your worship my master would be married to the Princess Micomicona this minute, and I should be a count at least; for no less was to be expected, as well from the goodness of my master, him of the Rueful Countenance, as from the greatness of my services."], "How does Sanchoprove that Don Quixote is not actually enchanted in the cage?": [" I know and feel that I am enchanted, and that is enough to ease my conscience; for it would weigh heavily on it if I thought that I was not enchanted, and that in a faint-hearted and cowardly way I allowed myself to lie in this cage, defrauding multitudes of the succour I might afford to those in need and distress, who at this very moment may be in sore want of my aid and protection.\u201d \u201cStill for all that,\u201d replied Sancho, \u201cI say that, for your greater and fuller satisfaction, it would be well if your worship were to try to get out of this prison (and I promise to do all in my power to help, and even to take you out of it), and see if you could once more mount your good Rocinante, who seems to be enchanted too, he is so melancholy and dejected; and then we might try our chance in looking for adventures again; and if we have no luck there will be time enough to go back to the cage; in which, on the faith of a good and loyal squire, I promise to shut myself up along with your worship, if so be you are so unfortunate, or I so stupid, as not to be able to carry out my plan.\u201d \u201cI am content to do as thou sayest, brother Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand when thou seest an opportunity for effecting my release I will obey thee absolutely; but thou wilt see, Sancho, how mistaken thou art in thy conception of my misfortune.\u201d The knight-errant and the ill-errant squire kept up their conversation till they reached the place where the curate, the canon, and the barber, who had already dismounted, were waiting for them.", " The first thing he did was to turn round in the cage in which he lay, and protrude his claws, and stretch himself thoroughly; he next opened his mouth, and yawned very leisurely, and with near two palms\u2019 length of tongue that he had thrust forth, he licked the dust out of his eyes and washed his face; having done this, he put his head out of the cage and looked all round with eyes like glowing coals, a spectacle and demeanour to strike terror into temerity itself. Don Quixote merely observed him steadily, longing for him to leap from the cart and come to close quarters with him, when he hoped to hew him in pieces. So far did his unparalleled madness go; but the noble lion, more courteous than arrogant, not troubling himself about silly bravado, after having looked all round, as has been said, turned about and presented his hind-quarters to Don Quixote, and very coolly and tranquilly lay down again in the cage.", " The carter at once unyoked the oxen and left them to roam at large about the pleasant green spot, the freshness of which seemed to invite, not enchanted people like Don Quixote, but wide-awake, sensible folk like his squire, who begged the curate to allow his master to leave the cage for a little; for if they did not let him out, the prison might not be as clean as the propriety of such a gentleman as his master required. The curate understood him, and said he would very gladly comply with his request, only that he feared his master, finding himself at liberty, would take to his old courses and make off where nobody could ever find him again. \u201cI will answer for his not running away,\u201d said Sancho. \u201cAnd I also,\u201d said the canon, \u201cespecially if he gives me his word as a knight not to leave us without our consent.\u201d Don Quixote, who was listening to all this, said, \u201cI give it;\u2014moreover one who is enchanted as I am cannot do as he likes with himself; for he who had enchanted him could prevent his moving from one place for three ages, and if he attempted to escape would bring him back flying.\u201d\u2014And that being so, they might as well release him, particularly as it would be to the advantage of all; for, if they did not let him out, he protested he would be unable to avoid offending their nostrils unless they kept their distance.", " \u201cIn that case,\u201d said the canon, \u201ctake all the beasts there, and bring the sumpter mule back.\u201d While this was going on, Sancho, perceiving that he could speak to his master without having the curate and the barber, of whom he had his suspicions, present all the time, approached the cage in which Don Quixote was placed, and said, \u201cSe\u00f1or, to ease my conscience I want to tell you the state of the case as to your enchantment, and that is that these two here, with their faces covered, are the curate of our village and the barber; and I suspect they have hit upon this plan of carrying you off in this fashion, out of pure envy because your worship surpasses them in doing famous deeds; and if this be the truth it follows that you are not enchanted, but hoodwinked and made a fool of. And to prove this I want to ask you one thing; and if you answer me as I believe you will answer, you will be able to lay your finger on the trick, and you will see that you are not enchanted but gone wrong in your wits.\u201d \u201cAsk what thou wilt, Sancho my son,\u201d returned Don Quixote, \u201cfor I will satisfy thee and answer all thou requirest."], "Who wrote thefalse Second Part of Don Quixote, in which DonAlvaro brings Don Quixote to be cured?": [" Let each look to himself and not try to make out white black, and black white; for each of us is as God made him, aye, and often worse.\u201d \u201cI will take care,\u201d said Carrasco, \u201cto impress upon the author of the history that, if he prints it again, he must not forget what worthy Sancho has said, for it will raise it a good span higher.\u201d \u201cIs there anything else to correct in the history, se\u00f1or bachelor?\u201d asked Don Quixote. \u201cNo doubt there is,\u201d replied he; \u201cbut not anything that will be of the same importance as those I have mentioned.\u201d \u201cDoes the author promise a second part at all?\u201d said Don Quixote. \u201cHe does promise one,\u201d replied Samson; \u201cbut he says he has not found it, nor does he know who has got it; and we cannot say whether it will appear or not; and so, on that head, as some say that no second part has ever been good, and others that enough has been already written about Don Quixote, it is thought there will be no second part; though some, who are jovial rather than saturnine, say, \u2018Let us have more Quixotades, let Don Quixote charge and Sancho chatter, and no matter what it may turn out, we shall be satisfied with that.\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd what does the author mean to do?\u201d said Don Quixote.", " Take courage! take courage! for despondency in misfortune breaks down health and brings on death.\u2019 \u201cTo all these words of the licentiate another madman in a cage opposite that of the furious one was listening; and raising himself up from an old mat on which he lay stark naked, he asked in a loud voice who it was that was going away cured and in his senses. The licentiate answered, \u2018It is I, brother, who am going; I have now no need to remain here any longer, for which I return infinite thanks to Heaven that has had so great mercy upon me.\u2019 \u201c\u2018Mind what you are saying, licentiate; don\u2019t let the devil deceive you,\u2019 replied the madman. \u2018Keep quiet, stay where you are, and you will save yourself the trouble of coming back.\u2019 \u201c\u2018I know I am cured,\u2019 returned the licentiate, \u2018and that I shall not have to go stations again.\u2019 \u201c\u2018You cured!\u2019 said the madman; \u2018well, we shall see; God be with you; but I swear to you by Jupiter, whose majesty I represent on earth, that for this crime alone, which Seville is committing to-day in releasing you from this house, and treating you as if you were in your senses, I shall have to inflict such a punishment on it as will be remembered for ages and ages, amen.", " Supper-time having come, then, Don Quixote betook himself to his room, the landlord brought in the stew-pan just as it was, and he sat himself down to sup very resolutely. It seems that in another room, which was next to Don Quixote\u2019s, with nothing but a thin partition to separate it, he overheard these words, \u201cAs you live, Se\u00f1or Don Jeronimo, while they are bringing supper, let us read another chapter of the Second Part of \u2018Don Quixote of La Mancha.\u2019\u201d The instant Don Quixote heard his own name he started to his feet and listened with open ears to catch what they said about him, and heard the Don Jeronimo who had been addressed say in reply, \u201cWhy would you have us read that absurd stuff, Don Juan, when it is impossible for anyone who has read the First Part of the history of \u2018Don Quixote of La Mancha\u2019 to take any pleasure in reading this Second Part?\u201d \u201cFor all that,\u201d said he who was addressed as Don Juan, \u201cwe shall do well to read it, for there is no book so bad but it has something good in it.", " It might naturally have been expected that, with such proofs before him that he had hit the taste of the public, Cervantes would have at once set about redeeming his rather vague promise of a second volume. But, to all appearance, nothing was farther from his thoughts. He had still by him one or two short tales of the same vintage as those he had inserted in \u201cDon Quixote\u201d and instead of continuing the adventures of Don Quixote, he set to work to write more of these \u201cNovelas Exemplares\u201d as he afterwards called them, with a view to making a book of them. The novels were published in the summer of 1613, with a dedication to the Conde de Lemos, the Maecenas of the day, and with one of those chatty confidential prefaces Cervantes was so fond of. In this, eight years and a half after the First Part of \u201cDon Quixote\u201d had appeared, we get the first hint of a forthcoming Second Part. \u201cYou shall see shortly,\u201d he says, \u201cthe further exploits of Don Quixote and humours of Sancho Panza.\u201d His idea of \u201cshortly\u201d was a somewhat elastic one, for, as we know by the date to Sancho\u2019s letter, he had barely one-half of the book completed that time twelvemonth."], "How does DonQuixote die?": [" This thought blunts my teeth, paralyses my jaws, cramps my hands, and robs me of all appetite for food; so much so that I have a mind to let myself die of hunger, the cruelest death of all deaths.\u201d \u201cSo then,\u201d said Sancho, munching hard all the time, \u201cyour worship does not agree with the proverb that says, \u2018Let Martha die, but let her die with a full belly.\u2019 I, at any rate, have no mind to kill myself; so far from that, I mean to do as the cobbler does, who stretches the leather with his teeth until he makes it reach as far as he wants. I\u2019ll stretch out my life by eating until it reaches the end heaven has fixed for it; and let me tell you, se\u00f1or, there\u2019s no greater folly than to think of dying of despair as your worship does; take my advice, and after eating lie down and sleep a bit on this green grass-mattress, and you will see that when you awake you\u2019ll feel something better.\u201d Don Quixote did as he recommended, for it struck him that Sancho\u2019s reasoning was more like a philosopher\u2019s than a blockhead\u2019s, and said he, \u201cSancho, if thou wilt do for me what I am going to tell thee my ease of mind would be more assured and my heaviness of heart not so great; and it is this; to go aside a little while I am sleeping in accordance with thy advice, and, making bare thy carcase to the air, to give thyself three or four hundred lashes with Rocinante\u2019s reins, on account of the three thousand and odd thou art to give thyself for the disenchantment of Dulcinea; for it is a great pity that the poor lady should be left enchanted through thy carelessness and negligence.\u201d \u201cThere is a good deal to be said on that point,\u201d said Sancho; \u201clet us both go to sleep now, and after that, God has decreed what will happen.", " Here must we perish with hunger, my ass and myself, if indeed we don\u2019t die first, he of his bruises and injuries, and I of grief and sorrow. At any rate I\u2019ll not be as lucky as my master Don Quixote of La Mancha, when he went down into the cave of that enchanted Montesinos, where he found people to make more of him than if he had been in his own house; for it seems he came in for a table laid out and a bed ready made. There he saw fair and pleasant visions, but here I\u2019ll see, I imagine, toads and adders. Unlucky wretch that I am, what an end my follies and fancies have come to! They\u2019ll take up my bones out of this, when it is heaven\u2019s will that I\u2019m found, picked clean, white and polished, and my good Dapple\u2019s with them, and by that, perhaps, it will be found out who we are, at least by such as have heard that Sancho Panza never separated from his ass, nor his ass from Sancho Panza. Unlucky wretches, I say again, that our hard fate should not let us die in our own country and among our own people, where if there was no help for our misfortune, at any rate there would be someone to grieve for it and to close our eyes as we passed away!", " I shall die, if I am to die; but it must be after full vengeance upon him who has brought me here to weep over audacity that no fault of mine gave birth to.\u201d Leonela required much pressing before she would go to summon Lothario, but at last she went, and while awaiting her return Camilla continued, as if speaking to herself, \u201cGood God! would it not have been more prudent to have repulsed Lothario, as I have done many a time before, than to allow him, as I am now doing, to think me unchaste and vile, even for the short time I must wait until I undeceive him? No doubt it would have been better; but I should not be avenged, nor the honour of my husband vindicated, should he find so clear and easy an escape from the strait into which his depravity has led him. Let the traitor pay with his life for the temerity of his wanton wishes, and let the world know (if haply it shall ever come to know) that Camilla not only preserved her allegiance to her husband, but avenged him of the man who dared to wrong him.", " The judges held a consultation over the oath, and they said, \u2018If we let this man pass free he has sworn falsely, and by the law he ought to die; but if we hang him, as he swore he was going to die on that gallows, and therefore swore the truth, by the same law he ought to go free.\u2019 It is asked of your worship, se\u00f1or governor, what are the judges to do with this man? For they are still in doubt and perplexity; and having heard of your worship\u2019s acute and exalted intellect, they have sent me to entreat your worship on their behalf to give your opinion on this very intricate and puzzling case.\u201d To this Sancho made answer, \u201cIndeed those gentlemen the judges that send you to me might have spared themselves the trouble, for I have more of the obtuse than the acute in me; but repeat the case over again, so that I may understand it, and then perhaps I may be able to hit the point.\u201d The querist repeated again and again what he had said before, and then Sancho said, \u201cIt seems to me I can set the matter right in a moment, and in this way; the man swears that he is going to die upon the gallows; but if he dies upon it, he has sworn the truth, and by the law enacted deserves to go free and pass over the bridge; but if they don\u2019t hang him, then he has sworn falsely, and by the same law deserves to be hanged.\u201d \u201cIt is as the se\u00f1or governor says,\u201d said the messenger; \u201cand as regards a complete comprehension of the case, there is nothing left to desire or hesitate about.\u201d \u201cWell then I say,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cthat of this man they should let pass the part that has sworn truly, and hang the part that has lied; and in this way the conditions of the passage will be fully complied with.\u201d \u201cBut then, se\u00f1or governor,\u201d replied the querist, \u201cthe man will have to be divided into two parts; and if he is divided of course he will die; and so none of the requirements of the law will be carried out, and it is absolutely necessary to comply with it.\u201d \u201cLook here, my good sir,\u201d said Sancho; \u201ceither I\u2019m a numskull or else there is the same reason for this passenger dying as for his living and passing over the bridge; for if the truth saves him the falsehood equally condemns him; and that being the case it is my opinion you should say to the gentlemen who sent you to me that as the arguments for condemning him and for absolving him are exactly balanced, they should let him pass freely, as it is always more praiseworthy to do good than to do evil; this I would give signed with my name if I knew how to sign; and what I have said in this case is not out of my own head, but one of the many precepts my master Don Quixote gave me the night before I left to become governor of this island, that came into my mind, and it was this, that when there was any doubt about the justice of a case I should lean to mercy; and it is God\u2019s will that I should recollect it now, for it fits this case as if it was made for it.\u201d \u201cThat is true,\u201d said the majordomo; \u201cand I maintain that Lycurgus himself, who gave laws to the Lacedemonians, could not have pronounced a better decision than the great Panza has given; let the morning\u2019s audience close with this, and I will see that the se\u00f1or governor has dinner entirely to his liking.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s all I ask for\u2014fair play,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cgive me my dinner, and then let it rain cases and questions on me, and I\u2019ll despatch them in a twinkling.\u201d The majordomo kept his word, for he felt it against his conscience to kill so wise a governor by hunger; particularly as he intended to have done with him that same night, playing off the last joke he was commissioned to practise upon him."], "Why does Sanchowhip the trees?": [" p60c.jpg (250K) Full Size Sancho rose and removed some distance from the spot, but as he was about to place himself leaning against another tree he felt something touch his head, and putting up his hands encountered somebody\u2019s two feet with shoes and stockings on them. He trembled with fear and made for another tree, where the very same thing happened to him, and he fell a-shouting, calling upon Don Quixote to come and protect him. Don Quixote did so, and asked him what had happened to him, and what he was afraid of. Sancho replied that all the trees were full of men\u2019s feet and legs. Don Quixote felt them, and guessed at once what it was, and said to Sancho, \u201cThou hast nothing to be afraid of, for these feet and legs that thou feelest but canst not see belong no doubt to some outlaws and freebooters that have been hanged on these trees; for the authorities in these parts are wont to hang them up by twenties and thirties when they catch them; whereby I conjecture that I must be near Barcelona;\u201d and it was, in fact, as he supposed; with the first light they looked up and saw that the fruit hanging on those trees were freebooters\u2019 bodies.", " If she returns to her lost shape (and it cannot be but that she will) her misfortune will have been good fortune, and my defeat a most happy triumph. But look here, Sancho; when wilt thou begin the scourging? For if thou wilt make short work of it, I will give thee a hundred reals over and above.\u201d \u201cWhen?\u201d said Sancho; \u201cthis night without fail. Let your worship order it so that we pass it out of doors and in the open air, and I\u2019ll scarify myself.\u201d Night, longed for by Don Quixote with the greatest anxiety in the world, came at last, though it seemed to him that the wheels of Apollo\u2019s car had broken down, and that the day was drawing itself out longer than usual, just as is the case with lovers, who never make the reckoning of their desires agree with time. They made their way at length in among some pleasant trees that stood a little distance from the road, and there vacating Rocinante\u2019s saddle and Dapple\u2019s pack-saddle, they stretched themselves on the green grass and made their supper off Sancho\u2019s stores, and he making a powerful and flexible whip out of Dapple\u2019s halter and headstall retreated about twenty paces from his master among some beech trees.", " Many civilities and offers of service were exchanged by Don \u00c1lvaro and Don Quixote, in the course of which the great Manchegan displayed such good taste that he disabused Don \u00c1lvaro of the error he was under; and he, on his part, felt convinced he must have been enchanted, now that he had been brought in contact with two such opposite Don Quixotes. Evening came, they set out from the village, and after about half a league two roads branched off, one leading to Don Quixote\u2019s village, the other the road Don \u00c1lvaro was to follow. In this short interval Don Quixote told him of his unfortunate defeat, and of Dulcinea\u2019s enchantment and the remedy, all which threw Don \u00c1lvaro into fresh amazement, and embracing Don Quixote and Sancho, he went his way, and Don Quixote went his. That night he passed among trees again in order to give Sancho an opportunity of working out his penance, which he did in the same fashion as the night before, at the expense of the bark of the beech trees much more than of his back, of which he took such good care that the lashes would not have knocked off a fly had there been one there.", " I was born free, and that I might live in freedom I chose the solitude of the fields; in the trees of the mountains I find society, the clear waters of the brooks are my mirrors, and to the trees and waters I make known my thoughts and charms. I am a fire afar off, a sword laid aside. Those whom I have inspired with love by letting them see me, I have by words undeceived, and if their longings live on hope\u2014and I have given none to Chrysostom or to any other\u2014it cannot justly be said that the death of any is my doing, for it was rather his own obstinacy than my cruelty that killed him; and if it be made a charge against me that his wishes were honourable, and that therefore I was bound to yield to them, I answer that when on this very spot where now his grave is made he declared to me his purity of purpose, I told him that mine was to live in perpetual solitude, and that the earth alone should enjoy the fruits of my retirement and the spoils of my beauty; and if, after this open avowal, he chose to persist against hope and steer against the wind, what wonder is it that he should sink in the depths of his infatuation?"], "Why does Cervantesend the First Part?": [" The words in the preface to the First Part of \u201cDon Quixote\u201d are generally held to be conclusive that he conceived the idea of the book, and wrote the beginning of it at least, in a prison, and that he may have done so is extremely likely. There is a tradition that Cervantes read some portions of his work to a select audience at the Duke of Bejar\u2019s, which may have helped to make the book known; but the obvious conclusion is that the First Part of \u201cDon Quixote\u201d lay on his hands some time before he could find a publisher bold enough to undertake a venture of so novel a character; and so little faith in it had Francisco Robles of Madrid, to whom at last he sold it, that he did not care to incur the expense of securing the copyright for Aragon or Portugal, contenting himself with that for Castile. The printing was finished in December, and the book came out with the new year, 1605. It is often said that \u201cDon Quixote\u201d was at first received coldly.", " He is a much more important and prominent figure in the Second Part than in the First; indeed, it is his matchless mendacity about Dulcinea that to a great extent supplies the action of the story. His development in this respect is as remarkable as in any other. In the First Part he displays a great natural gift of lying. His lies are not of the highly imaginative sort that liars in fiction commonly indulge in; like Falstaff\u2019s, they resemble the father that begets them; they are simple, homely, plump lies; plain working lies, in short. But in the service of such a master as Don Quixote he develops rapidly, as we see when he comes to palm off the three country wenches as Dulcinea and her ladies in waiting. It is worth noticing how, flushed by his success in this instance, he is tempted afterwards to try a flight beyond his powers in his account of the journey on Clavile\u00f1o. In the Second Part it is the spirit rather than the incidents of the chivalry romances that is the subject of the burlesque.", " Supper-time having come, then, Don Quixote betook himself to his room, the landlord brought in the stew-pan just as it was, and he sat himself down to sup very resolutely. It seems that in another room, which was next to Don Quixote\u2019s, with nothing but a thin partition to separate it, he overheard these words, \u201cAs you live, Se\u00f1or Don Jeronimo, while they are bringing supper, let us read another chapter of the Second Part of \u2018Don Quixote of La Mancha.\u2019\u201d The instant Don Quixote heard his own name he started to his feet and listened with open ears to catch what they said about him, and heard the Don Jeronimo who had been addressed say in reply, \u201cWhy would you have us read that absurd stuff, Don Juan, when it is impossible for anyone who has read the First Part of the history of \u2018Don Quixote of La Mancha\u2019 to take any pleasure in reading this Second Part?\u201d \u201cFor all that,\u201d said he who was addressed as Don Juan, \u201cwe shall do well to read it, for there is no book so bad but it has something good in it.", " It might naturally have been expected that, with such proofs before him that he had hit the taste of the public, Cervantes would have at once set about redeeming his rather vague promise of a second volume. But, to all appearance, nothing was farther from his thoughts. He had still by him one or two short tales of the same vintage as those he had inserted in \u201cDon Quixote\u201d and instead of continuing the adventures of Don Quixote, he set to work to write more of these \u201cNovelas Exemplares\u201d as he afterwards called them, with a view to making a book of them.

OF THE INTERVIEW THE CURATE AND THE BARBER HAD WITH DON QUIXOTE ABOUT HIS MALADY p01a.jpg (156K) Full Size Cide Hamete Benengeli, in the Second Part of this history, and third sally of Don Quixote, says that the curate and the barber remained nearly a month without seeing him, lest they should recall or bring back to his recollection what had taken place. They did not, however, omit to visit his niece and housekeeper, and charge them to be careful to treat him with attention, and give him comforting things to eat, and such as were good for the heart and the brain, whence, it was plain to see, all his misfortune proceeded. The niece and housekeeper replied that they did so, and meant to do so with all possible care and assiduity, for they could perceive that their master was now and then beginning to show signs of being in his right mind.", " Supper-time having come, then, Don Quixote betook himself to his room, the landlord brought in the stew-pan just as it was, and he sat himself down to sup very resolutely.

IN WHICH IS RELATED THE NOVEL OF \u201cTHE ILL-ADVISED CURIOSITY\u201d In Florence, a rich and famous city of Italy in the province called Tuscany, there lived two gentlemen of wealth and quality, Anselmo and Lothario, such great friends that by way of distinction they were called by all that knew them \u201cThe Two Friends.\u201d They were unmarried, young, of the same age and of the same tastes, which was enough to account for the reciprocal friendship between them.", " The curate thanked him, and opening them he saw at the beginning of the manuscript the words, \u201cNovel of Rinconete and Cortadillo,\u201d by which he perceived that it was a novel, and as that of \u201cThe Ill-advised Curiosity\u201d had been good he concluded this would be so too, as they were both probably by the same author; so he kept it, intending to read it when he had an opportunity. He then mounted and his friend the barber did the same, both masked, so as not to be recognised by Don Quixote, and set out following in the rear of the cart. The order of march was this: first went the cart with the owner leading it; at each side of it marched the officers of the Brotherhood, as has been said, with their muskets; then followed Sancho Panza on his ass, leading Rocinante by the bridle; and behind all came the curate and the barber on their mighty mules, with faces covered, as aforesaid, and a grave and serious air, measuring their pace to suit the slow steps of the oxen.", " But enough of that for the present; let us go and see Master Pedro\u2019s show, for I am sure there must be something novel in it.\u201d \u201cSomething!\u201d said Master Pedro; \u201cthis show of mine has sixty thousand novel things in it; let me tell you, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote, it is one of the best-worth-seeing things in the world this day; but _operibus credite et non verbis_, and now let\u2019s get to work, for it is growing late, and we have a great deal to do and to say and show.\u201d Don Quixote and Sancho obeyed him and went to where the show was already put up and uncovered, set all around with lighted wax tapers which made it look splendid and bright. When they came to it Master Pedro ensconced himself inside it, for it was he who had to work the puppets, and a boy, a servant of his, posted himself outside to act as showman and explain the mysteries of the exhibition, having a wand in his hand to point to the figures as they came out."], "What does DonQuixote decide to do during his retirement?": [" Don Antonio reported to the viceroy what Carrasco told him, and the viceroy was not very well pleased to hear it, for with Don Quixote\u2019s retirement there was an end to the amusement of all who knew anything of his mad doings. Six days did Don Quixote keep his bed, dejected, melancholy, moody and out of sorts, brooding over the unhappy event of his defeat. Sancho strove to comfort him, and among other things he said to him, \u201cHold up your head, se\u00f1or, and be of good cheer if you can, and give thanks to heaven that if you have had a tumble to the ground you have not come off with a broken rib; and, as you know that \u2018where they give they take,\u2019 and that \u2018there are not always fletches where there are pegs,\u2019 a fig for the doctor, for there\u2019s no need of him to cure this ailment. Let us go home, and give over going about in search of adventures in strange lands and places; rightly looked at, it is I that am the greater loser, though it is your worship that has had the worse usage.", " There is no need of saying whether Camilla was agitated or not, for so great was her fear and dismay, that, making sure, as she had good reason to do, that Leonela would tell Anselmo all she knew of her faithlessness, she had not the courage to wait and see if her suspicions were confirmed; and that same night, as soon as she thought that Anselmo was asleep, she packed up the most valuable jewels she had and some money, and without being observed by anybody escaped from the house and betook herself to Lothario\u2019s, to whom she related what had occurred, imploring him to convey her to some place of safety or fly with her where they might be safe from Anselmo. The state of perplexity to which Camilla reduced Lothario was such that he was unable to utter a word in reply, still less to decide upon what he should do. At length he resolved to conduct her to a convent of which a sister of his was prioress; Camilla agreed to this, and with the speed which the circumstances demanded, Lothario took her to the convent and left her there, and then himself quitted the city without letting anyone know of his departure.", " \u201cIn this case,\u201d said he, \u201cit will be only to say \u2018yes,\u2019 and no consequences can follow the utterance of the word, for the nuptial couch of this marriage must be the grave.\u201d Camacho was listening to all this, perplexed and bewildered and not knowing what to say or do; but so urgent were the entreaties of Basilio\u2019s friends, imploring him to allow Quiteria to give him her hand, so that his soul, quitting this life in despair, should not be lost, that they moved, nay, forced him, to say that if Quiteria were willing to give it he was satisfied, as it was only putting off the fulfillment of his wishes for a moment. At once all assailed Quiteria and pressed her, some with prayers, and others with tears, and others with persuasive arguments, to give her hand to poor Basilio; but she, harder than marble and more unmoved than any statue, seemed unable or unwilling to utter a word, nor would she have given any reply had not the priest bade her decide quickly what she meant to do, as Basilio now had his soul at his teeth, and there was no time for hesitation.", " The patience with which she endures the hardships that poverty brings with it, and the eagerness she shows to become a Christian, are such that they fill me with admiration, and bind me to serve her all my life; though the happiness I feel in seeing myself hers, and her mine, is disturbed and marred by not knowing whether I shall find any corner to shelter her in my own country, or whether time and death may not have made such changes in the fortunes and lives of my father and brothers, that I shall hardly find anyone who knows me, if they are not alive. I have no more of my story to tell you, gentlemen; whether it be an interesting or a curious one let your better judgments decide; all I can say is I would gladly have told it to you more briefly; although my fear of wearying you has made me leave out more than one circumstance. c41g.jpg (33K) CHAPTER XLII. WHICH TREATS OF WHAT FURTHER TOOK PLACE IN THE INN, AND OF SEVERAL OTHER THINGS WORTH KNOWING c42a.jpg (139K) Full Size With these words the captive held his peace, and Don Fernando said to him, \u201cIn truth, captain, the manner in which you have related this remarkable adventure has been such as befitted the novelty and strangeness of the matter."], "Why does DonQuixote sing to Altisidora?": [" At last he went to bed, out of spirits and heavy at heart, as much because he missed Sancho as because of the irreparable disaster to his stockings, the stitches of which he would have even taken up with silk of another colour, which is one of the greatest signs of poverty a gentleman can show in the course of his never-failing embarrassments. He put out the candles; but the night was warm and he could not sleep; he rose from his bed and opened slightly a grated window that looked out on a beautiful garden, and as he did so he perceived and heard people walking and talking in the garden. He set himself to listen attentively, and those below raised their voices so that he could hear these words: \u201cUrge me not to sing, Emerencia, for thou knowest that ever since this stranger entered the castle and my eyes beheld him, I cannot sing but only weep; besides my lady is a light rather than a heavy sleeper, and I would not for all the wealth of the world that she found us here; and even if she were asleep and did not waken, my singing would be in vain, if this strange \u00c6neas, who has come into my neighbourhood to flout me, sleeps on and wakens not to hear it.\u201d \u201cHeed not that, dear Altisidora,\u201d replied a voice; \u201cthe duchess is no doubt asleep, and everybody in the house save the lord of thy heart and disturber of thy soul; for just now I perceived him open the grated window of his chamber, so he must be awake; sing, my poor sufferer, in a low sweet tone to the accompaniment of thy harp; and even if the duchess hears us we can lay the blame on the heat of the night.\u201d \u201cThat is not the point, Emerencia,\u201d replied Altisidora, \u201cit is that I would not that my singing should lay bare my heart, and that I should be thought a light and wanton maiden by those who know not the mighty power of love; but come what may; better a blush on the cheeks than a sore in the heart;\u201d and here a harp softly touched made itself heard.", " \u201cLess politeness and less paint, se\u00f1ora duenna,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cby God your hands smell of vinegar-wash.\u201d In line, all the duennas smacked him and several others of the household pinched him; but what he could not stand was being pricked by the pins; and so, apparently out of patience, he started up out of his chair, and seizing a lighted torch that stood near him fell upon the duennas and the whole set of his tormentors, exclaiming, \u201cBegone, ye ministers of hell; I\u2019m not made of brass not to feel such out-of-the-way tortures.\u201d At this instant Altisidora, who probably was tired of having been so long lying on her back, turned on her side; seeing which the bystanders cried out almost with one voice, \u201cAltisidora is alive! Altisidora lives!\u201d Rhadamanthus bade Sancho put away his wrath, as the object they had in view was now attained. When Don Quixote saw Altisidora move, he went on his knees to Sancho saying to him, \u201cNow is the time, son of my bowels, not to call thee my squire, for thee to give thyself some of those lashes thou art bound to lay on for the disenchantment of Dulcinea.", " Sancho likewise held his peace and ate acorns, and paid repeated visits to the second wine-skin, which they had hung up on a cork tree to keep the wine cool. Don Quixote was longer in talking than the supper in finishing, at the end of which one of the goatherds said, \u201cThat your worship, se\u00f1or knight-errant, may say with more truth that we show you hospitality with ready good-will, we will give you amusement and pleasure by making one of our comrades sing: he will be here before long, and he is a very intelligent youth and deep in love, and what is more he can read and write and play on the rebeck to perfection.\u201d The goatherd had hardly done speaking, when the notes of the rebeck reached their ears; and shortly after, the player came up, a very good-looking young man of about two-and-twenty. His comrades asked him if he had supped, and on his replying that he had, he who had already made the offer said to him: \u201cIn that case, Antonio, thou mayest as well do us the pleasure of singing a little, that the gentleman, our guest, may see that even in the mountains and woods there are musicians: we have told him of thy accomplishments, and we want thee to show them and prove that we say true; so, as thou livest, pray sit down and sing that ballad about thy love that thy uncle the prebendary made thee, and that was so much liked in the town.\u201d \u201cWith all my heart,\u201d said the young man, and without waiting for more pressing he seated himself on the trunk of a felled oak, and tuning his rebeck, presently began to sing to these words.", " He threw over him his scarlet mantle, put on his head a montera of green velvet trimmed with silver edging, flung across his shoulder the baldric with his good trenchant sword, took up a large rosary that he always carried with him, and with great solemnity and precision of gait proceeded to the antechamber where the duke and duchess were already dressed and waiting for him. But as he passed through a gallery, Altisidora and the other damsel, her friend, were lying in wait for him, and the instant Altisidora saw him she pretended to faint, while her friend caught her in her lap, and began hastily unlacing the bosom of her dress. Don Quixote observed it, and approaching them said, \u201cI know very well what this seizure arises from.\u201d \u201cI know not from what,\u201d replied the friend, \u201cfor Altisidora is the healthiest damsel in all this house, and I have never heard her complain all the time I have known her."], "What initially causes Don Quixote\u2019s obsession with chivalry?": [" Of all the absurdities that, thanks to poetry, will be repeated to the end of time, there is no greater one than saying that \u201cCervantes smiled Spain\u2019s chivalry away.\u201d In the first place there was no chivalry for him to smile away. Spain\u2019s chivalry had been dead for more than a century. Its work was done when Granada fell, and as chivalry was essentially republican in its nature, it could not live under the rule that Ferdinand substituted for the free institutions of mediaeval Spain. What he did smile away was not chivalry but a degrading mockery of it. The true nature of the \u201cright arm\u201d and the \u201cbright array,\u201d before which, according to the poet, \u201cthe world gave ground,\u201d and which Cervantes\u2019 single laugh demolished, may be gathered from the words of one of his own countrymen, Don Felix Pacheco, as reported by Captain George Carleton, in his \u201cMilitary Memoirs from 1672 to 1713.\u201d \u201cBefore the appearance in the world of that labour of Cervantes,\u201d he said, \u201cit was next to an impossibility for a man to walk the streets with any delight or without danger.", " Who can have robbed it of the beauty that gladdened it, of the grace and gaiety that charmed it, of the modesty that shed a lustre upon it?\u201d \u201cWho?\u201d replied Don Quixote; \u201cwho could it be but some malignant enchanter of the many that persecute me out of envy\u2014that accursed race born into the world to obscure and bring to naught the achievements of the good, and glorify and exalt the deeds of the wicked? Enchanters have persecuted me, enchanters persecute me still, and enchanters will continue to persecute me until they have sunk me and my lofty chivalry in the deep abyss of oblivion; and they injure and wound me where they know I feel it most. For to deprive a knight-errant of his lady is to deprive him of the eyes he sees with, of the sun that gives him light, of the food whereby he lives. Many a time before have I said it, and I say it now once more, a knight-errant without a lady is like a tree without leaves, a building without a foundation, or a shadow without the body that causes it.\u201d \u201cThere is no denying it,\u201d said the duchess; \u201cbut still, if we are to believe the history of Don Quixote that has come out here lately with general applause, it is to be inferred from it, if I mistake not, that you never saw the lady Dulcinea, and that the said lady is nothing in the world but an imaginary lady, one that you yourself begot and gave birth to in your brain, and adorned with whatever charms and perfections you chose.\u201d \u201cThere is a good deal to be said on that point,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cGod knows whether there be any Dulcinea or not in the world, or whether she is imaginary or not imaginary; these are things the proof of which must not be pushed to extreme lengths.", " Whether thus adorned she would have been beautiful or not, and what she must have been in her prosperity, may be imagined from the beauty remaining to her after so many hardships; for, as everyone knows, the beauty of some women has its times and its seasons, and is increased or diminished by chance causes; and naturally the emotions of the mind will heighten or impair it, though indeed more frequently they totally destroy it. In a word she presented herself before me that day attired with the utmost splendour, and supremely beautiful; at any rate, she seemed to me the most beautiful object I had ever seen; and when, besides, I thought of all I owed to her I felt as though I had before me some heavenly being come to earth to bring me relief and happiness. As she approached her father told her in his own language that I was a captive belonging to his friend the Arnaut Mami, and that I had come for salad.", " To these five, as it were capital causes, there may be added some others that may be just and reasonable, and make it a duty to take up arms; but to take them up for trifles and things to laugh at and be amused by rather than offended, looks as though he who did so was altogether wanting in common sense. Moreover, to take an unjust revenge (and there cannot be any just one) is directly opposed to the sacred law that we acknowledge, wherein we are commanded to do good to our enemies and to love them that hate us; a command which, though it seems somewhat difficult to obey, is only so to those who have in them less of God than of the world, and more of the flesh than of the spirit; for Jesus Christ, God and true man, who never lied, and could not and cannot lie, said, as our law-giver, that his yoke was easy and his burden light; he would not, therefore, have laid any command upon us that it was impossible to obey."], "Which character bears the brunt of the punishments that Don Quixote incurs?": [" But turn thine eyes to the other side, and thou shalt see in front and in the van of this other army the ever victorious and never vanquished Timonel of Carcajona, prince of New Biscay, who comes in armour with arms quartered azure, vert, white, and yellow, and bears on his shield a cat or on a field tawny with a motto which says _Miau_, which is the beginning of the name of his lady, who according to report is the peerless Miaulina, daughter of the duke Alfeniquen of the Algarve; the other, who burdens and presses the loins of that powerful charger and bears arms white as snow and a shield blank and without any device, is a novice knight, a Frenchman by birth, Pierres Papin by name, lord of the baronies of Utrique; that other, who with iron-shod heels strikes the flanks of that nimble parti-coloured zebra, and for arms bears azure vair, is the mighty duke of Nerbia, Espartafilardo del Bosque, who bears for device on his shield an asparagus plant with a motto in Castilian that says, _\u2018Rastrea mi suerte\u2019_.\u201d And so he went on naming a number of knights of one squadron or the other out of his imagination, and to all he assigned off-hand their arms, colours, devices, and mottoes, carried away by the illusions of his unheard-of craze; and without a pause, he continued, \u201cPeople of divers nations compose this squadron in front; here are those that drink of the sweet waters of the famous Xanthus, those that scour the woody Massilian plains, those that sift the pure fine gold of Arabia Felix, those that enjoy the famed cool banks of the crystal Thermodon, those that in many and various ways divert the streams of the golden Pactolus, the Numidians, faithless in their promises, the Persians renowned in archery, the Parthians and the Medes that fight as they fly, the Arabs that ever shift their dwellings, the Scythians as cruel as they are fair, the Ethiopians with pierced lips, and an infinity of other nations whose features I recognise and descry, though I cannot recall their names.", " \u201cI told you already to go gently, master commissary,\u201d said Pasamonte; \u201ctheir lordships yonder never gave you that staff to ill-treat us wretches here, but to conduct and take us where his majesty orders you; if not, by the life of-never mind\u2014; it may be that some day the stains made in the inn will come out in the scouring; let everyone hold his tongue and behave well and speak better; and now let us march on, for we have had quite enough of this entertainment.\u201d The commissary lifted his staff to strike Pasamonte in return for his threats, but Don Quixote came between them, and begged him not to ill-use him, as it was not too much to allow one who had his hands tied to have his tongue a trifle free; and turning to the whole chain of them he said: \u201cFrom all you have told me, dear brethren, make out clearly that though they have punished you for your faults, the punishments you are about to endure do not give you much pleasure, and that you go to them very much against the grain and against your will, and that perhaps this one\u2019s want of courage under torture, that one\u2019s want of money, the other\u2019s want of advocacy, and lastly the perverted judgment of the judge may have been the cause of your ruin and of your failure to obtain the justice you had on your side.", " Some idea of the prodigious development of this branch of literature in the sixteenth century may be obtained from the scrutiny of Chapter VII, if the reader bears in mind that only a portion of the romances belonging to by far the largest group are enumerated. As to its effect upon the nation, there is abundant evidence. From the time when the Amadises and Palmerins began to grow popular down to the very end of the century, there is a steady stream of invective, from men whose character and position lend weight to their words, against the romances of chivalry and the infatuation of their readers. Ridicule was the only besom to sweep away that dust. That this was the task Cervantes set himself, and that he had ample provocation to urge him to it, will be sufficiently clear to those who look into the evidence; as it will be also that it was not chivalry itself that he attacked and swept away.", " Like a good many critics now-a-days, they forget that screams are not criticism, and that it is only vulgar tastes that are influenced by strings of superlatives, three-piled hyperboles, and pompous epithets. But what strikes one as particularly strange is that while they deal in extravagant eulogies, and ascribe all manner of imaginary ideas and qualities to Cervantes, they show no perception of the quality that ninety-nine out of a hundred of his readers would rate highest in him, and hold to be the one that raises him above all rivalry. To speak of \u201cDon Quixote\u201d as if it were merely a humorous book would be a manifest misdescription. Cervantes at times makes it a kind of commonplace book for occasional essays and criticisms, or for the observations and reflections and gathered wisdom of a long and stirring life. It is a mine of shrewd observation on mankind and human nature. Among modern novels there may be, here and there, more elaborate studies of character, but there is no book richer in individualised character."], "What does the narrator rail against at the beginning of part two of Don Quixote?": [" The canon agreed, and going on ahead with his servants, listened with attention to the account of the character, life, madness, and ways of Don Quixote, given him by the curate, who described to him briefly the beginning and origin of his craze, and told him the whole story of his adventures up to his being confined in the cage, together with the plan they had of taking him home to try if by any means they could discover a cure for his madness. The canon and his servants were surprised anew when they heard Don Quixote\u2019s strange story, and when it was finished he said, \u201cTo tell the truth, se\u00f1or curate, I for my part consider what they call books of chivalry to be mischievous to the State; and though, led by idle and false taste, I have read the beginnings of almost all that have been printed, I never could manage to read any one of them from beginning to end; for it seems to me they are all more or less the same thing; and one has nothing more in it than another; this no more than that.", " Of all this there will be nothing in my book, for I have nothing to quote in the margin or to note at the end, and still less do I know what authors I follow in it, to place them at the beginning, as all do, under the letters A, B, C, beginning with Aristotle and ending with Xenophon, or Zoilus, or Zeuxis, though one was a slanderer and the other a painter. Also my book must do without sonnets at the beginning, at least sonnets whose authors are dukes, marquises, counts, bishops, ladies, or famous poets. Though if I were to ask two or three obliging friends, I know they would give me them, and such as the productions of those that have the highest reputation in our Spain could not equal. \u201cIn short, my friend,\u201d I continued, \u201cI am determined that Se\u00f1or Don Quixote shall remain buried in the archives of his own La Mancha until Heaven provide someone to garnish him with all those things he stands in need of; because I find myself, through my shallowness and want of learning, unequal to supplying them, and because I am by nature shy and careless about hunting for authors to say what I myself can say without them.", " \u201cTo be in love is folly?\u201d\u2014R. \u201cNo great sense.\u201d B. \u201cYou\u2019re metaphysical.\u201d\u2014R. \u201cFrom want of food.\u201d B. \u201cRail at the squire, then.\u201d\u2014R. \u201cWhy, what\u2019s the good?

There is a tradition that Cervantes read some portions of his work to a select audience at the Duke of Bejar\u2019s, which may have helped to make the book known; but the obvious conclusion is that the First Part of \u201cDon Quixote\u201d lay on his hands some time before he could find a publisher bold enough to undertake a venture of so novel a character; and so little faith in it had Francisco Robles of Madrid, to whom at last he sold it, that he did not care to incur the expense of securing the copyright for Aragon or Portugal, contenting himself with that for Castile. The printing was finished in December, and the book came out with the new year, 1605. It is often said that \u201cDon Quixote\u201d was at first received coldly."], "What is Don Quixote\u2019s primary goal in part two of the novel?": [" While they were talking Cardenio had taken up the novel and begun to read it, and forming the same opinion of it as the curate, he begged him to read it so that they might all hear it. \u201cI would read it,\u201d said the curate, \u201cif the time would not be better spent in sleeping.\u201d \u201cIt will be rest enough for me,\u201d said Dorothea, \u201cto while away the time by listening to some tale, for my spirits are not yet tranquil enough to let me sleep when it would be seasonable.\u201d \u201cWell then, in that case,\u201d said the curate, \u201cI will read it, if it were only out of curiosity; perhaps it may contain something pleasant.\u201d Master Nicholas added his entreaties to the same effect, and Sancho too; seeing which, and considering that he would give pleasure to all, and receive it himself, the curate said, \u201cWell then, attend to me everyone, for the novel begins thus.\u201d c32e.jpg (11K) CHAPTER XXXIII. IN WHICH IS RELATED THE NOVEL OF \u201cTHE ILL-ADVISED CURIOSITY\u201d In Florence, a rich and famous city of Italy in the province called Tuscany, there lived two gentlemen of wealth and quality, Anselmo and Lothario, such great friends that by way of distinction they were called by all that knew them \u201cThe Two Friends.\u201d They were unmarried, young, of the same age and of the same tastes, which was enough to account for the reciprocal friendship between them.", " The landlord was carrying away the valise and the books, but the curate said to him, \u201cWait; I want to see what those papers are that are written in such a good hand.\u201d The landlord taking them out handed them to him to read, and he perceived they were a work of about eight sheets of manuscript, with, in large letters at the beginning, the title of \u201cNovel of the Ill-advised Curiosity.\u201d The curate read three or four lines to himself, and said, \u201cI must say the title of this novel does not seem to me a bad one, and I feel an inclination to read it all.\u201d To which the landlord replied, \u201cThen your reverence will do well to read it, for I can tell you that some guests who have read it here have been much pleased with it, and have begged it of me very earnestly; but I would not give it, meaning to return it to the person who forgot the valise, books, and papers here, for maybe he will return here some time or other; and though I know I shall miss the books, faith I mean to return them; for though I am an innkeeper, still I am a Christian.\u201d \u201cYou are very right, friend,\u201d said the curate; \u201cbut for all that, if the novel pleases me you must let me copy it.\u201d \u201cWith all my heart,\u201d replied the host.", " Nay; see whether by bodily strength it be possible to learn or divine the intentions of the enemy, his plans, stratagems, or obstacles, or to ward off impending mischief; for all these are the work of the mind, and in them the body has no share whatever. Since, therefore, arms have need of the mind, as much as letters, let us see now which of the two minds, that of the man of letters or that of the warrior, has most to do; and this will be seen by the end and goal that each seeks to attain; for that purpose is the more estimable which has for its aim the nobler object. The end and goal of letters\u2014I am not speaking now of divine letters, the aim of which is to raise and direct the soul to Heaven; for with an end so infinite no other can be compared\u2014I speak of human letters, the end of which is to establish distributive justice, give to every man that which is his, and see and take care that good laws are observed: an end undoubtedly noble, lofty, and deserving of high praise, but not such as should be given to that sought by arms, which have for their end and object peace, the greatest boon that men can desire in this life.", " Lothario commended his purpose, and promised on his own part to aid him in raising a monument so glorious. And so Anselmo was left the most charmingly hoodwinked man there could be in the world. He himself, persuaded he was conducting the instrument of his glory, led home by the hand of him who had been the utter destruction of his good name; whom Camilla received with averted countenance, though with smiles in her heart. The deception was carried on for some time, until at the end of a few months Fortune turned her wheel and the guilt which had been until then so skilfully concealed was published abroad, and Anselmo paid with his life the penalty of his ill-advised curiosity.

They asked Julius C\u00e6sar, the valiant Roman emperor, what was the best death. He answered, that which is unexpected, which comes suddenly and unforeseen; and though he answered like a pagan, and one without the knowledge of the true God, yet, as far as sparing our feelings is concerned, he was right; for suppose you are killed in the first engagement or skirmish, whether by a cannon ball or blown up by mine, what matters it? It is only dying, and all is over; and according to Terence, a soldier shows better dead in battle, than alive and safe in flight; and the good soldier wins fame in proportion as he is obedient to his captains and those in command over him.", " c38e.jpg (18K) CHAPTER XXXIX. WHEREIN THE CAPTIVE RELATES HIS LIFE AND ADVENTURES c39a.jpg (137K) Full Size My family had its origin in a village in the mountains of Leon, and nature had been kinder and more generous to it than fortune; though in the general poverty of those communities my father passed for being even a rich man; and he would have been so in reality had he been as clever in preserving his property as he was in spending it. This tendency of his to be liberal and profuse he had acquired from having been a soldier in his youth, for the soldier\u2019s life is a school in which the niggard becomes free-handed and the free-handed prodigal; and if any soldiers are to be found who are misers, they are monsters of rare occurrence. My father went beyond liberality and bordered on prodigality, a disposition by no means advantageous to a married man who has children to succeed to his name and position.", " Meanwhile the knight has taken his departure; he fights in the war, conquers the king\u2019s enemy, wins many cities, triumphs in many battles, returns to the court, sees his lady where he was wont to see her, and it is agreed that he shall demand her in marriage of her parents as the reward of his services; the king is unwilling to give her, as he knows not who he is, but nevertheless, whether carried off or in whatever other way it may be, the princess comes to be his bride, and her father comes to regard it as very good fortune; for it so happens that this knight is proved to be the son of a valiant king of some kingdom, I know not what, for I fancy it is not likely to be on the map. The father dies, the princess inherits, and in two words the knight becomes king. And here comes in at once the bestowal of rewards upon his squire and all who have aided him in rising to so exalted a rank. He marries his squire to a damsel of the princess\u2019s, who will be, no doubt, the one who was confidante in their amour, and is daughter of a very great duke.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what I want, and no mistake about it!\u201d said Sancho."], "What is Don Quixote\u2019s goal in life?": [" Nay; see whether by bodily strength it be possible to learn or divine the intentions of the enemy, his plans, stratagems, or obstacles, or to ward off impending mischief; for all these are the work of the mind, and in them the body has no share whatever.

The end and goal of letters\u2014I am not speaking now of divine letters, the aim of which is to raise and direct the soul to Heaven; for with an end so infinite no other can be compared\u2014I speak of human letters, the end of which is to establish distributive justice, give to every man that which is his, and see and take care that good laws are observed: an end undoubtedly noble, lofty, and deserving of high praise, but not such as should be given to that sought by arms, which have for their end and object peace, the greatest boon that men can desire in this life.", " To those who cannot distinguish between the one kind and the other, no doubt \u201cDon Quixote\u201d is a sad book; no doubt to some minds it is very sad that a man who had just uttered so beautiful a sentiment as that \u201cit is a hard case to make slaves of those whom God and Nature made free,\u201d should be ungratefully pelted by the scoundrels his crazy philanthropy had let loose on society; but to others of a more judicial cast it will be a matter of regret that reckless self-sufficient enthusiasm is not oftener requited in some such way for all the mischief it does in the world. A very slight examination of the structure of \u201cDon Quixote\u201d will suffice to show that Cervantes had no deep design or elaborate plan in his mind when he began the book. When he wrote those lines in which \u201cwith a few strokes of a great master he sets before us the pauper gentleman,\u201d he had no idea of the goal to which his imagination was leading him.", " One solitary distant star Is all I have to guide me, A brighter orb than those of old That Palinurus lighted. And vaguely drifting am I borne, I know not where it leads me; I fix my gaze on it alone, Of all beside it heedless. But over-cautious prudery, And coyness cold and cruel, When most I need it, these, like clouds, Its longed-for light refuse me. Bright star, goal of my yearning eyes As thou above me beamest, When thou shalt hide thee from my sight I\u2019ll know that death is near me. The singer had got so far when it struck Dorothea that it was not fair to let Clara miss hearing such a sweet voice, so, shaking her from side to side, she woke her, saying: \u201cForgive me, child, for waking thee, but I do so that thou mayest have the pleasure of hearing the best voice thou hast ever heard, perhaps, in all thy life.\u201d Clara awoke quite drowsy, and not understanding at the moment what Dorothea said, asked her what it was; she repeated what she had said, and Clara became attentive at once; but she had hardly heard two lines, as the singer continued, when a strange trembling seized her, as if she were suffering from a severe attack of quartan ague, and throwing her arms round Dorothea she said: \u201cAh, dear lady of my soul and life!", " why did you wake me? The greatest kindness fortune could do me now would be to close my eyes and ears so as neither to see or hear that unhappy musician.\u201d \u201cWhat art thou talking about, child?\u201d said Dorothea. \u201cWhy, they say this singer is a muleteer!\u201d \u201cNay, he is the lord of many places,\u201d replied Clara, \u201cand that one in my heart which he holds so firmly shall never be taken from him, unless he be willing to surrender it.\u201d Dorothea was amazed at the ardent language of the girl, for it seemed to be far beyond such experience of life as her tender years gave any promise of, so she said to her: \u201cYou speak in such a way that I cannot understand you, Se\u00f1ora Clara; explain yourself more clearly, and tell me what is this you are saying about hearts and places and this musician whose voice has so moved you? But do not tell me anything now; I do not want to lose the pleasure I get from listening to the singer by giving my attention to your transports, for I perceive he is beginning to sing a new strain and a new air.\u201d \u201cLet him, in Heaven\u2019s name,\u201d returned Clara; and not to hear him she stopped both ears with her hands, at which Dorothea was again surprised; but turning her attention to the song she found that it ran in this fashion: Sweet Hope, my stay, That onward to the goal of thy intent Dost make thy way, Heedless of hindrance or impediment, Have thou no fear If at each step thou findest death is near."], "What aspect of Sancho Panza\u2019s speech indicates his peasant origins?": [" p029.jpg (285K) Full Size Nor was Don Quixote less so, for what with blows and bruises he could not sit upright on the ass, and from time to time he sent up sighs to heaven, so that once more he drove the peasant to ask what ailed him. And it could have been only the devil himself that put into his head tales to match his own adventures, for now, forgetting Baldwin, he bethought himself of the Moor Abindarraez, when the Alcaide of Antequera, Rodrigo de Narvaez, took him prisoner and carried him away to his castle; so that when the peasant again asked him how he was and what ailed him, he gave him for reply the same words and phrases that the captive Abindarraez gave to Rodrigo de Narvaez, just as he had read the story in the \u201cDiana\u201d of Jorge de Montemayor where it is written, applying it to his own case so aptly that the peasant went along cursing his fate that he had to listen to such a lot of nonsense; from which, however, he came to the conclusion that his neighbour was mad, and so made all haste to reach the village to escape the wearisomeness of this harangue of Don Quixote\u2019s; who, at the end of it, said, \u201cSe\u00f1or Don Rodrigo de Narvaez, your worship must know that this fair Xarifa I have mentioned is now the lovely Dulcinea del Toboso, for whom I have done, am doing, and will do the most famous deeds of chivalry that in this world have been seen, are to be seen, or ever shall be seen.\u201d To this the peasant answered, \u201cSe\u00f1or\u2014sinner that I am!\u2014cannot your worship see that I am not Don Rodrigo de Narvaez nor the Marquis of Mantua, but Pedro Alonso your neighbour, and that your worship is neither Baldwin nor Abindarraez, but the worthy gentleman Se\u00f1or Quixada?\u201d \u201cI know who I am,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cand I know that I may be not only those I have named, but all the Twelve Peers of France and even all the Nine Worthies, since my achievements surpass all that they have done all together and each of them on his own account.\u201d With this talk and more of the same kind they reached the village just as night was beginning to fall, but the peasant waited until it was a little later that the belaboured gentleman might not be seen riding in such a miserable trim.", " The costume, the beard, and the fat squat figure of the new governor astonished all those who were not in on the secret, and even all who were, and they were not a few. Finally, leading him out of the church they carried him to the judgment seat and seated him on it, and the duke\u2019s majordomo said to him, \u201cIt is an ancient custom in this island, se\u00f1or governor, that he who comes to take possession of this famous island is bound to answer a question which shall be put to him, and which must be a somewhat knotty and difficult one; and by his answer the people take the measure of their new governor\u2019s wit, and hail with joy or deplore his arrival accordingly.\u201d While the majordomo was making this speech Sancho was gazing at several large letters inscribed on the wall opposite his seat, and as he could not read he asked what that was that was painted on the wall. The answer was, \u201cSe\u00f1or, there is written and recorded the day on which your lordship took possession of this island, and the inscription says, \u2018This day, the so-and-so of such-and-such a month and year, Se\u00f1or Don Sancho Panza took possession of this island; many years may he enjoy it.\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd whom do they call Don Sancho Panza?\u201d asked Sancho.", " for her dress and her silence lead us to imagine that she is what we could wish she was not.\u201d \u201cIn dress and outwardly,\u201d said he, \u201cshe is a Moor, but at heart she is a thoroughly good Christian, for she has the greatest desire to become one.\u201d \u201cThen she has not been baptised?\u201d returned Luscinda. \u201cThere has been no opportunity for that,\u201d replied the captive, \u201csince she left Algiers, her native country and home; and up to the present she has not found herself in any such imminent danger of death as to make it necessary to baptise her before she has been instructed in all the ceremonies our holy mother Church ordains; but, please God, ere long she shall be baptised with the solemnity befitting her which is higher than her dress or mine indicates.\u201d By these words he excited a desire in all who heard him, to know who the Moorish lady and the captive were, but no one liked to ask just then, seeing that it was a fitter moment for helping them to rest themselves than for questioning them about their lives.", " I quitted the island, as I said, without any escort except my ass; I fell into a pit, I pushed on through it, until this morning by the light of the sun I saw an outlet, but not so easy a one but that, had not heaven sent me my master Don Quixote, I\u2019d have stayed there till the end of the world. So now my lord and lady duke and duchess, here is your governor Sancho Panza, who in the bare ten days he has held the government has come by the knowledge that he would not give anything to be governor, not to say of an island, but of the whole world; and that point being settled, kissing your worships\u2019 feet, and imitating the game of the boys when they say, \u2018leap thou, and give me one,\u2019 I take a leap out of the government and pass into the service of my master Don Quixote; for after all, though in it I eat my bread in fear and trembling, at any rate I take my fill; and for my part, so long as I\u2019m full, it\u2019s all alike to me whether it\u2019s with carrots or with partridges.\u201d Here Sancho brought his long speech to an end, Don Quixote having been the whole time in dread of his uttering a host of absurdities; and when he found him leave off with so few, he thanked heaven in his heart."], "What are the names of Don Quixote\u2019s horse and Sancho Panza\u2019s donkey, respectively?": [" This craving drove him to draw near to the inn, still undecided whether to go in or not, and as he was hesitating there came out two persons who at once recognised him, and said one to the other: \u201cSe\u00f1or licentiate, is not he on the horse there Sancho Panza who, our adventurer\u2019s housekeeper told us, went off with her master as esquire?\u201d \u201cSo it is,\u201d said the licentiate, \u201cand that is our friend Don Quixote\u2019s horse;\u201d and if they knew him so well it was because they were the curate and the barber of his own village, the same who had carried out the scrutiny and sentence upon the books; and as soon as they recognised Sancho Panza and Rocinante, being anxious to hear of Don Quixote, they approached, and calling him by his name the curate said, \u201cFriend Sancho Panza, where is your master?\u201d Sancho recognised them at once, and determined to keep secret the place and circumstances where and under which he had left his master, so he replied that his master was engaged in a certain quarter on a certain matter of great importance to him which he could not disclose for the eyes in his head.", " Nor ends his glory here, for his good steed Doth Brillador and Bayard far exceed; As mettled steeds compared with Rocinante, The reputation they have won is scanty.

Night set in, they quickened their pace, and the fears of the two prisoners grew greater, especially as they heard themselves assailed with\u2014\u201cGet on, ye Troglodytes;\u201d \u201cSilence, ye barbarians;\u201d \u201cMarch, ye cannibals;\u201d \u201cNo murmuring, ye Scythians;\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t open your eyes, ye murderous Polyphemes, ye blood-thirsty lions,\u201d and suchlike names with which their captors harassed the ears of the wretched master and man.

He then mounted and his friend the barber did the same, both masked, so as not to be recognised by Don Quixote, and set out following in the rear of the cart. The order of march was this: first went the cart with the owner leading it; at each side of it marched the officers of the Brotherhood, as has been said, with their muskets; then followed Sancho Panza on his ass, leading Rocinante by the bridle; and behind all came the curate and the barber on their mighty mules, with faces covered, as aforesaid, and a grave and serious air, measuring their pace to suit the slow steps of the oxen.", " The landlord was carrying away the valise and the books, but the curate said to him, \u201cWait; I want to see what those papers are that are written in such a good hand.\u201d The landlord taking them out handed them to him to read, and he perceived they were a work of about eight sheets of manuscript, with, in large letters at the beginning, the title of \u201cNovel of the Ill-advised Curiosity.\u201d The curate read three or four lines to himself, and said, \u201cI must say the title of this novel does not seem to me a bad one, and I feel an inclination to read it all.\u201d To which the landlord replied, \u201cThen your reverence will do well to read it, for I can tell you that some guests who have read it here have been much pleased with it, and have begged it of me very earnestly; but I would not give it, meaning to return it to the person who forgot the valise, books, and papers here, for maybe he will return here some time or other; and though I know I shall miss the books, faith I mean to return them; for though I am an innkeeper, still I am a Christian.\u201d \u201cYou are very right, friend,\u201d said the curate; \u201cbut for all that, if the novel pleases me you must let me copy it.\u201d \u201cWith all my heart,\u201d replied the host.", " While they were talking Cardenio had taken up the novel and begun to read it, and forming the same opinion of it as the curate, he begged him to read it so that they might all hear it. \u201cI would read it,\u201d said the curate, \u201cif the time would not be better spent in sleeping.\u201d \u201cIt will be rest enough for me,\u201d said Dorothea, \u201cto while away the time by listening to some tale, for my spirits are not yet tranquil enough to let me sleep when it would be seasonable.\u201d \u201cWell then, in that case,\u201d said the curate, \u201cI will read it, if it were only out of curiosity; perhaps it may contain something pleasant.\u201d Master Nicholas added his entreaties to the same effect, and Sancho too; seeing which, and considering that he would give pleasure to all, and receive it himself, the curate said, \u201cWell then, attend to me everyone, for the novel begins thus.\u201d c32e.jpg (11K) CHAPTER XXXIII.

THE AUTHOR\u2019S PREFACE Idle reader: thou mayest believe me without any oath that I would this book, as it is the child of my brain, were the fairest, gayest, and cleverest that could be imagined. But I could not counteract Nature\u2019s law that everything shall beget its like; and what, then, could this sterile, illtilled wit of mine beget but the story of a dry, shrivelled, whimsical offspring, full of thoughts of all sorts and such as never came into any other imagination\u2014just what might be begotten in a prison, where every misery is lodged and every doleful sound makes its dwelling?"], "Which character(s) invent fictional adventures for Don Quixote as a form of entertainment?": [" Sancho shrugged his shoulders, obeyed, and sat down, and all the duchess\u2019s damsels and duennas gathered round him, waiting in profound silence to hear what he would say. It was the duchess, however, who spoke first, saying: \u201cNow that we are alone, and that there is nobody here to overhear us, I should be glad if the se\u00f1or governor would relieve me of certain doubts I have, rising out of the history of the great Don Quixote that is now in print. One is: inasmuch as worthy Sancho never saw Dulcinea, I mean the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, nor took Don Quixote\u2019s letter to her, for it was left in the memorandum book in the Sierra Morena, how did he dare to invent the answer and all that about finding her sifting wheat, the whole story being a deception and falsehood, and so much to the prejudice of the peerless Dulcinea\u2019s good name, a thing that is not at all becoming the character and fidelity of a good squire?\u201d p33b.jpg (326K) Full Size At these words, Sancho, without uttering one in reply, got up from his chair, and with noiseless steps, with his body bent and his finger on his lips, went all round the room lifting up the hangings; and this done, he came back to his seat and said, \u201cNow, se\u00f1ora, that I have seen that there is no one except the bystanders listening to us on the sly, I will answer what you have asked me, and all you may ask me, without fear or dread.", " Of his end and death he could learn no particulars, nor would he have ascertained it or known of it, if good fortune had not produced an old physician for him who had in his possession a leaden box, which, according to his account, had been discovered among the crumbling foundations of an ancient hermitage that was being rebuilt; in which box were found certain parchment manuscripts in Gothic character, but in Castilian verse, containing many of his achievements, and setting forth the beauty of Dulcinea, the form of Rocinante, the fidelity of Sancho Panza, and the burial of Don Quixote himself, together with sundry epitaphs and eulogies on his life and character; but all that could be read and deciphered were those which the trustworthy author of this new and unparalleled history here presents. And the said author asks of those that shall read it nothing in return for the vast toil which it has cost him in examining and searching the Manchegan archives in order to bring it to light, save that they give him the same credit that people of sense give to the books of chivalry that pervade the world and are so popular; for with this he will consider himself amply paid and fully satisfied, and will be encouraged to seek out and produce other histories, if not as truthful, at least equal in invention and not less entertaining.", " On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield\u2019s, it would be in every sense of the word impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not even seen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, and since then I may say vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr. Duffield\u2019s reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes. From the foregoing history of our translations of \u201cDon Quixote,\u201d it will be seen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrative with its full complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in a form that amuses them, care very little whether that form is the one in which Cervantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there are many who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it, so far at least as differences of idiom and circumstances permit, and who will give a preference to the conscientious translator, even though he may have acquitted himself somewhat awkwardly.", " The canon agreed, and going on ahead with his servants, listened with attention to the account of the character, life, madness, and ways of Don Quixote, given him by the curate, who described to him briefly the beginning and origin of his craze, and told him the whole story of his adventures up to his being confined in the cage, together with the plan they had of taking him home to try if by any means they could discover a cure for his madness. The canon and his servants were surprised anew when they heard Don Quixote\u2019s strange story, and when it was finished he said, \u201cTo tell the truth, se\u00f1or curate, I for my part consider what they call books of chivalry to be mischievous to the State; and though, led by idle and false taste, I have read the beginnings of almost all that have been printed, I never could manage to read any one of them from beginning to end; for it seems to me they are all more or less the same thing; and one has nothing more in it than another; this no more than that."], "What claim does Cervantes make for his narrative in the Prologue?": [" It is the mean, prosaic, commonplace character of all the surroundings and circumstances that gives a significance to Don Quixote\u2019s vigil and the ceremony that follows. Cervantes\u2019 humour is for the most part of that broader and simpler sort, the strength of which lies in the perception of the incongruous. It is the incongruity of Sancho in all his ways, words, and works, with the ideas and aims of his master, quite as much as the wonderful vitality and truth to nature of the character, that makes him the most humorous creation in the whole range of fiction. That unsmiling gravity of which Cervantes was the first great master, \u201cCervantes\u2019 serious air,\u201d which sits naturally on Swift alone, perhaps, of later humourists, is essential to this kind of humour, and here again Cervantes has suffered at the hands of his interpreters. Nothing, unless indeed the coarse buffoonery of Phillips, could be more out of place in an attempt to represent Cervantes, than a flippant, would-be facetious style, like that of Motteux\u2019s version for example, or the sprightly, jaunty air, French translators sometimes adopt.", " On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield\u2019s, it would be in every sense of the word impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not even seen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, and since then I may say vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr. Duffield\u2019s reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes. From the foregoing history of our translations of \u201cDon Quixote,\u201d it will be seen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrative with its full complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in a form that amuses them, care very little whether that form is the one in which Cervantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there are many who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it, so far at least as differences of idiom and circumstances permit, and who will give a preference to the conscientious translator, even though he may have acquitted himself somewhat awkwardly.", " He was already on board heavily ironed, when the Dey at length agreed to reduce his demand by one-half, and Father Gil by borrowing was able to make up the amount, and on September 19, 1580, after a captivity of five years all but a week, Cervantes was at last set free. Before long he discovered that Blanco de Paz, who claimed to be an officer of the Inquisition, was now concocting on false evidence a charge of misconduct to be brought against him on his return to Spain. To checkmate him Cervantes drew up a series of twenty-five questions, covering the whole period of his captivity, upon which he requested Father Gil to take the depositions of credible witnesses before a notary. Eleven witnesses taken from among the principal captives in Algiers deposed to all the facts above stated and to a great deal more besides. There is something touching in the admiration, love, and gratitude we see struggling to find expression in the formal language of the notary, as they testify one after another to the good deeds of Cervantes, how he comforted and helped the weak-hearted, how he kept up their drooping courage, how he shared his poor purse with this deponent, and how \u201cin him this deponent found father and mother.\u201d On his return to Spain he found his old regiment about to march for Portugal to support Philip\u2019s claim to the crown, and utterly penniless now, had no choice but to rejoin it.", " It is the grave matter-of-factness of the narrative, and the apparent unconsciousness of the author that he is saying anything ludicrous, anything but the merest commonplace, that give its peculiar flavour to the humour of Cervantes. His, in fact, is the exact opposite of the humour of Sterne and the self-conscious humourists. Even when Uncle Toby is at his best, you are always aware of \u201cthe man Sterne\u201d behind him, watching you over his shoulder to see what effect he is producing. Cervantes always leaves you alone with Don Quixote and Sancho. He and Swift and the great humourists always keep themselves out of sight, or, more properly speaking, never think about themselves at all, unlike our latter-day school of humourists, who seem to have revived the old horse-collar method, and try to raise a laugh by some grotesque assumption of ignorance, imbecility, or bad taste. It is true that to do full justice to Spanish humour in any other language is well-nigh an impossibility."], "Where is Don Quixote from?": [" What displeases me most in it is that it represents Don Quixote as now cured of his love for Dulcinea del Toboso.\u201d On hearing this Don Quixote, full of wrath and indignation, lifted up his voice and said, \u201cWhoever he may be who says that Don Quixote of La Mancha has forgotten or can forget Dulcinea del Toboso, I will teach him with equal arms that what he says is very far from the truth; for neither can the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso be forgotten, nor can forgetfulness have a place in Don Quixote; his motto is constancy, and his profession to maintain the same with his life and never wrong it.\u201d \u201cWho is this that answers us?\u201d said they in the next room. \u201cWho should it be,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cbut Don Quixote of La Mancha himself, who will make good all he has said and all he will say; for pledges don\u2019t trouble a good payer.\u201d Sancho had hardly uttered these words when two gentlemen, for such they seemed to be, entered the room, and one of them, throwing his arms round Don Quixote\u2019s neck, said to him, \u201cYour appearance cannot leave any question as to your name, nor can your name fail to identify your appearance; unquestionably, se\u00f1or, you are the real Don Quixote of La Mancha, cynosure and morning star of knight-errantry, despite and in defiance of him who has sought to usurp your name and bring to naught your achievements, as the author of this book which I here present to you has done;\u201d and with this he put a book which his companion carried into the hands of Don Quixote, who took it, and without replying began to run his eye over it; but he presently returned it saying, \u201cIn the little I have seen I have discovered three things in this author that deserve to be censured.", " In the meantime Sancho had recounted to them several of the adventures and accidents that had happened his master. That afternoon they took Don Quixote out for a stroll, not in his armour but in street costume, with a surcoat of tawny cloth upon him, that at that season would have made ice itself sweat. Orders were left with the servants to entertain Sancho so as not to let him leave the house. Don Quixote was mounted, not on Rocinante, but upon a tall mule of easy pace and handsomely caparisoned. They put the surcoat on him, and on the back, without his perceiving it, they stitched a parchment on which they wrote in large letters, \u201cThis is Don Quixote of La Mancha.\u201d As they set out upon their excursion the placard attracted the eyes of all who chanced to see him, and as they read out, \u201cThis is Don Quixote of La Mancha,\u201d Don Quixote was amazed to see how many people gazed at him, called him by his name, and recognised him, and turning to Don Antonio, who rode at his side, he observed to him, \u201cGreat are the privileges knight-errantry involves, for it makes him who professes it known and famous in every region of the earth; see, Don Antonio, even the very boys of this city know me without ever having seen me.\u201d \u201cTrue, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote,\u201d returned Don Antonio; \u201cfor as fire cannot be hidden or kept secret, virtue cannot escape being recognised; and that which is attained by the profession of arms shines distinguished above all others.\u201d It came to pass, however, that as Don Quixote was proceeding amid the acclamations that have been described, a Castilian, reading the inscription on his back, cried out in a loud voice, \u201cThe devil take thee for a Don Quixote of La Mancha!", " They asked him whither he meant to direct his steps. He replied, to Saragossa, to take part in the harness jousts which were held in that city every year. Don Juan told him that the new history described how Don Quixote, let him be who he might, took part there in a tilting at the ring, utterly devoid of invention, poor in mottoes, very poor in costume, though rich in sillinesses. \u201cFor that very reason,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cI will not set foot in Saragossa; and by that means I shall expose to the world the lie of this new history writer, and people will see that I am not the Don Quixote he speaks of.\u201d \u201cYou will do quite right,\u201d said Don Jeronimo; \u201cand there are other jousts at Barcelona in which Se\u00f1or Don Quixote may display his prowess.\u201d \u201cThat is what I mean to do,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cand as it is now time, I pray your worships to give me leave to retire to bed, and to place and retain me among the number of your greatest friends and servants.\u201d \u201cAnd me too,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cmaybe I\u2019ll be good for something.\u201d With this they exchanged farewells, and Don Quixote and Sancho retired to their room, leaving Don Juan and Don Jeronimo amazed to see the medley he made of his good sense and his craziness; and they felt thoroughly convinced that these, and not those their Aragonese author described, were the genuine Don Quixote and Sancho.", " The newly arrived gentleman put on a summer coat, and coming out to the gateway of the hostelry, which was wide and cool, addressing Don Quixote, who was pacing up and down there, he asked, \u201cIn what direction is your worship bound, gentle sir?\u201d \u201cTo a village near this which is my own village,\u201d replied Don Quixote; \u201cand your worship, where are you bound for?\u201d \u201cI am going to Granada, se\u00f1or,\u201d said the gentleman, \u201cto my own country.\u201d \u201cAnd a goodly country,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cbut will your worship do me the favour of telling me your name, for it strikes me it is of more importance to me to know it than I can tell you.\u201d \u201cMy name is Don \u00c1lvaro Tarfe,\u201d replied the traveller. To which Don Quixote returned, \u201cI have no doubt whatever that your worship is that Don \u00c1lvaro Tarfe who appears in print in the Second Part of the history of Don Quixote of La Mancha, lately printed and published by a new author.\u201d \u201cI am the same,\u201d replied the gentleman; \u201cand that same Don Quixote, the principal personage in the said history, was a very great friend of mine, and it was I who took him away from home, or at least induced him to come to some jousts that were to be held at Saragossa, whither I was going myself; indeed, I showed him many kindnesses, and saved him from having his shoulders touched up by the executioner because of his extreme rashness.\u201d \u201cTell me, Se\u00f1or Don \u00c1lvaro,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cam I at all like that Don Quixote you talk of?\u201d \u201cNo indeed,\u201d replied the traveller, \u201cnot a bit.\u201d \u201cAnd that Don Quixote\u2014\u201d said our one, \u201chad he with him a squire called Sancho Panza?\u201d \u201cHe had,\u201d said Don \u00c1lvaro; \u201cbut though he had the name of being very droll, I never heard him say anything that had any drollery in it.\u201d \u201cThat I can well believe,\u201d said Sancho at this, \u201cfor to come out with drolleries is not in everybody\u2019s line; and that Sancho your worship speaks of, gentle sir, must be some great scoundrel, dunderhead, and thief, all in one; for I am the real Sancho Panza, and I have more drolleries than if it rained them; let your worship only try; come along with me for a year or so, and you will find they fall from me at every turn, and so rich and so plentiful that though mostly I don\u2019t know what I am saying I make everybody that hears me laugh."], "Why does Don Quixote refuse to remove his helmet after the two \u201cprincesses\u201d remove his other armor at the inn?": [" They left him and went in, and presently the barber brought him out something to eat. By-and-by, after they had between them carefully thought over what they should do to carry out their object, the curate hit upon an idea very well adapted to humour Don Quixote, and effect their purpose; and his notion, which he explained to the barber, was that he himself should assume the disguise of a wandering damsel, while the other should try as best he could to pass for a squire, and that they should thus proceed to where Don Quixote was, and he, pretending to be an aggrieved and distressed damsel, should ask a favour of him, which as a valiant knight-errant he could not refuse to grant; and the favour he meant to ask him was that he should accompany her whither she would conduct him, in order to redress a wrong which a wicked knight had done her, while at the same time she should entreat him not to require her to remove her mask, nor ask her any question touching her circumstances until he had righted her with the wicked knight.", " p12b.jpg (298K) Full Size In conversation of this kind they passed a good part of the night, but Sancho felt a desire to let down the curtains of his eyes, as he used to say when he wanted to go to sleep; and stripping Dapple he left him at liberty to graze his fill. He did not remove Rocinante\u2019s saddle, as his master\u2019s express orders were, that so long as they were in the field or not sleeping under a roof Rocinante was not to be stripped\u2014the ancient usage established and observed by knights-errant being to take off the bridle and hang it on the saddle-bow, but to remove the saddle from the horse\u2014never! Sancho acted accordingly, and gave him the same liberty he had given Dapple, between whom and Rocinante there was a friendship so unequalled and so strong, that it is handed down by tradition from father to son, that the author of this veracious history devoted some special chapters to it, which, in order to preserve the propriety and decorum due to a history so heroic, he did not insert therein; although at times he forgets this resolution of his and describes how eagerly the two beasts would scratch one another when they were together and how, when they were tired or full, Rocinante would lay his neck across Dapple\u2019s, stretching half a yard or more on the other side, and the pair would stand thus, gazing thoughtfully on the ground, for three days, or at least so long as they were left alone, or hunger did not drive them to go and look for food.", " For I would have thee know, Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen by chance to be in hand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in the law of the duel in express words: if, for instance, the cobbler strikes another with the last which he has in his hand, though it be in fact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason that he whom he struck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst imagine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have therefore suffered any indignity; for the arms those men carried, with which they pounded us, were nothing more than their stakes, and not one of them, so far as I remember, carried rapier, sword, or dagger.\u201d \u201cThey gave me no time to see that much,\u201d answered Sancho, \u201cfor hardly had I laid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders with their sticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes and the strength out of my feet, stretching me where I now lie, and where thinking of whether all those stake-strokes were an indignity or not gives me no uneasiness, which the pain of the blows does, for they will remain as deeply impressed on my memory as on my shoulders.\u201d \u201cFor all that let me tell thee, brother Panza,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cthat there is no recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain which death does not remove.\u201d \u201cAnd what greater misfortune can there be,\u201d replied Panza, \u201cthan the one that waits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it?", " These two disputes, which were the most important and gravest, being settled, it only remained for the servants of Don Luis to consent that three of them should return while one was left to accompany him whither Don Fernando desired to take him; and good luck and better fortune, having already begun to solve difficulties and remove obstructions in favour of the lovers and warriors of the inn, were pleased to persevere and bring everything to a happy issue; for the servants agreed to do as Don Luis wished; which gave Do\u00f1a Clara such happiness that no one could have looked into her face just then without seeing the joy of her heart. Zoraida, though she did not fully comprehend all she saw, was grave or gay without knowing why, as she watched and studied the various countenances, but particularly her Spaniard\u2019s, whom she followed with her eyes and clung to with her soul. The gift and compensation which the curate gave the barber had not escaped the landlord\u2019s notice, and he demanded Don Quixote\u2019s reckoning, together with the amount of the damage to his wine-skins, and the loss of his wine, swearing that neither Rocinante nor Sancho\u2019s ass should leave the inn until he had been paid to the very last farthing."], "Who knights Don Quixote?": [" So that, se\u00f1or, it is better to be an humble little friar of no matter what order, than a valiant knight-errant; with God a couple of dozen of penance lashings are of more avail than two thousand lance-thrusts, be they given to giants, or monsters, or dragons.\u201d \u201cAll that is true,\u201d returned Don Quixote, \u201cbut we cannot all be friars, and many are the ways by which God takes his own to heaven; chivalry is a religion, there are sainted knights in glory.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cbut I have heard say that there are more friars in heaven than knights-errant.\u201d \u201cThat,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cis because those in religious orders are more numerous than knights.\u201d \u201cThe errants are many,\u201d said Sancho. \u201cMany,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cbut few they who deserve the name of knights.\u201d With these, and other discussions of the same sort, they passed that night and the following day, without anything worth mention happening to them, whereat Don Quixote was not a little dejected; but at length the next day, at daybreak, they descried the great city of El Toboso, at the sight of which Don Quixote\u2019s spirits rose and Sancho\u2019s fell, for he did not know Dulcinea\u2019s house, nor in all his life had he ever seen her, any more than his master; so that they were both uneasy, the one to see her, the other at not having seen her, and Sancho was at a loss to know what he was to do when his master sent him to El Toboso.", " In the meantime the curate had made an arrangement with the officers that they should bear them company as far as his village, he paying them so much a day. Cardenio hung the buckler on one side of the bow of Rocinante\u2019s saddle and the basin on the other, and by signs commanded Sancho to mount his ass and take Rocinante\u2019s bridle, and at each side of the cart he placed two officers with their muskets; but before the cart was put in motion, out came the landlady and her daughter and Maritornes to bid Don Quixote farewell, pretending to weep with grief at his misfortune; and to them Don Quixote said: \u201cWeep not, good ladies, for all these mishaps are the lot of those who follow the profession I profess; and if these reverses did not befall me I should not esteem myself a famous knight-errant; for such things never happen to knights of little renown and fame, because nobody in the world thinks about them; to valiant knights they do, for these are envied for their virtue and valour by many princes and other knights who compass the destruction of the worthy by base means.", " To be brief, last of all she has commanded me to go through all the provinces of Spain and compel all the knights-errant wandering therein to confess that she surpasses all women alive to-day in beauty, and that I am the most valiant and the most deeply enamoured knight on earth; in support of which claim I have already travelled over the greater part of Spain, and have there vanquished several knights who have dared to contradict me; but what I most plume and pride myself upon is having vanquished in single combat that so famous knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, and made him confess that my Casildea is more beautiful than his Dulcinea; and in this one victory I hold myself to have conquered all the knights in the world; for this Don Quixote that I speak of has vanquished them all, and I having vanquished him, his glory, his fame, and his honour have passed and are transferred to my person; for The more the vanquished hath of fair renown, The greater glory gilds the victor\u2019s crown.", " Blessed be heaven! for by means of this history of your noble and genuine chivalrous deeds, which you say has been printed, the countless stories of fictitious knights-errant with which the world is filled, so much to the injury of morality and the prejudice and discredit of good histories, will have been driven into oblivion.\u201d \u201cThere is a good deal to be said on that point,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cas to whether the histories of the knights-errant are fiction or not.\u201d \u201cWhy, is there anyone who doubts that those histories are false?\u201d said the man in green. \u201cI doubt it,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cbut never mind that just now; if our journey lasts long enough, I trust in God I shall show your worship that you do wrong in going with the stream of those who regard it as a matter of certainty that they are not true.\u201d From this last observation of Don Quixote\u2019s, the traveller began to have a suspicion that he was some crazy being, and was waiting for him to confirm it by something further; but before they could turn to any new subject Don Quixote begged him to tell him who he was, since he himself had rendered account of his station and life."], "When Don Quixote leaves, what does the farmer do to the young boy he has been whipping?": [" The farmer now came in, a well-favoured man that one might see a thousand leagues off was an honest fellow and a good soul. The first thing he said was, \u201cWhich is the lord governor here?\u201d \u201cWhich should it be,\u201d said the secretary, \u201cbut he who is seated in the chair?\u201d \u201cThen I humble myself before him,\u201d said the farmer; and going on his knees he asked for his hand, to kiss it. Sancho refused it, and bade him stand up and say what he wanted. The farmer obeyed, and then said, \u201cI am a farmer, se\u00f1or, a native of Miguelturra, a village two leagues from Ciudad Real.\u201d \u201cAnother Tirteafuera!\u201d said Sancho; \u201csay on, brother; I know Miguelturra very well I can tell you, for it\u2019s not very far from my own town.\u201d \u201cThe case is this, se\u00f1or,\u201d continued the farmer, \u201cthat by God\u2019s mercy I am married with the leave and licence of the holy Roman Catholic Church; I have two sons, students, and the younger is studying to become bachelor, and the elder to be licentiate; I am a widower, for my wife died, or more properly speaking, a bad doctor killed her on my hands, giving her a purge when she was with child; and if it had pleased God that the child had been born, and was a boy, I would have put him to study for doctor, that he might not envy his brothers the bachelor and the licentiate.\u201d \u201cSo that if your wife had not died, or had not been killed, you would not now be a widower,\u201d said Sancho.", " Rise as thou livest, and retire a little distance, and with a good heart and cheerful courage give thyself three or four hundred lashes on account of Dulcinea\u2019s disenchantment score; and this I entreat of thee, making it a request, for I have no desire to come to grips with thee a second time, as I know thou hast a heavy hand. As soon as thou hast laid them on we will pass the rest of the night, I singing my separation, thou thy constancy, making a beginning at once with the pastoral life we are to follow at our village.\u201d \u201cSe\u00f1or,\u201d replied Sancho, \u201cI\u2019m no monk to get up out of the middle of my sleep and scourge myself, nor does it seem to me that one can pass from one extreme of the pain of whipping to the other of music. Will your worship let me sleep, and not worry me about whipping myself? or you\u2019ll make me swear never to touch a hair of my doublet, not to say my flesh.\u201d \u201cO hard heart!\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cO pitiless squire!", " \u201cNo, se\u00f1or, certainly not,\u201d said the farmer. \u201cWe\u2019ve got that much settled,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cget on, brother, for it\u2019s more bed-time than business-time.\u201d \u201cWell then,\u201d said the farmer, \u201cthis son of mine who is going to be a bachelor, fell in love in the said town with a damsel called Clara Perlerina, daughter of Andres Perlerino, a very rich farmer; and this name of Perlerines does not come to them by ancestry or descent, but because all the family are paralytics, and for a better name they call them Perlerines; though to tell the truth the damsel is as fair as an Oriental pearl, and like a flower of the field, if you look at her on the right side; on the left not so much, for on that side she wants an eye that she lost by small-pox; and though her face is thickly and deeply pitted, those who love her say they are not pits that are there, but the graves where the hearts of her lovers are buried.", " Body o\u2019 me, se\u00f1or! is your worship in a condition now to inquire into other people\u2019s thoughts, above all love thoughts?\u201d \u201cLook ye, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cthere is a great difference between what is done out of love and what is done out of gratitude. A knight may very possibly be proof against love; but it is impossible, strictly speaking, for him to be ungrateful. Altisidora, to all appearance, loved me truly; she gave me the three kerchiefs thou knowest of; she wept at my departure, she cursed me, she abused me, casting shame to the winds she bewailed herself in public; all signs that she adored me; for the wrath of lovers always ends in curses. I had no hopes to give her, nor treasures to offer her, for mine are given to Dulcinea, and the treasures of knights-errant are like those of the fairies,\u2019 illusory and deceptive; all I can give her is the place in my memory I keep for her, without prejudice, however, to that which I hold devoted to Dulcinea, whom thou art wronging by thy remissness in whipping thyself and scourging that flesh\u2014would that I saw it eaten by wolves\u2014which would rather keep itself for the worms than for the relief of that poor lady.\u201d \u201cSe\u00f1or,\u201d replied Sancho, \u201cif the truth is to be told, I cannot persuade myself that the whipping of my backside has anything to do with the disenchantment of the enchanted; it is like saying, \u2018If your head aches rub ointment on your knees;\u2019 at any rate I\u2019ll make bold to swear that in all the histories dealing with knight-errantry that your worship has read you have never come across anybody disenchanted by whipping; but whether or no I\u2019ll whip myself when I have a fancy for it, and the opportunity serves for scourging myself comfortably.\u201d \u201cGod grant it,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cand heaven give thee grace to take it to heart and own the obligation thou art under to help my lady, who is thine also, inasmuch as thou art mine.\u201d As they pursued their journey talking in this way they came to the very same spot where they had been trampled on by the bulls."], "Which friends does Don Quixote find at his house upon his return home?": [" To all this and much more that Anselmo said to Lothario to persuade him to come to his house as he had been in the habit of doing, Lothario replied with so much prudence, sense, and judgment, that Anselmo was satisfied of his friend\u2019s good intentions, and it was agreed that on two days in the week, and on holidays, Lothario should come to dine with him; but though this arrangement was made between them Lothario resolved to observe it no further than he considered to be in accordance with the honour of his friend, whose good name was more to him than his own. He said, and justly, that a married man upon whom heaven had bestowed a beautiful wife should consider as carefully what friends he brought to his house as what female friends his wife associated with, for what cannot be done or arranged in the market-place, in church, at public festivals or at stations (opportunities that husbands cannot always deny their wives), may be easily managed in the house of the female friend or relative in whom most confidence is reposed.", " The first few days, those of a wedding being usually days of merry-making, Lothario frequented his friend Anselmo\u2019s house as he had been wont, striving to do honour to him and to the occasion, and to gratify him in every way he could; but when the wedding days were over and the succession of visits and congratulations had slackened, he began purposely to leave off going to the house of Anselmo, for it seemed to him, as it naturally would to all men of sense, that friends\u2019 houses ought not to be visited after marriage with the same frequency as in their masters\u2019 bachelor days: because, though true and genuine friendship cannot and should not be in any way suspicious, still a married man\u2019s honour is a thing of such delicacy that it is held liable to injury from brothers, much more from friends. Anselmo remarked the cessation of Lothario\u2019s visits, and complained of it to him, saying that if he had known that marriage was to keep him from enjoying his society as he used, he would have never married; and that, if by the thorough harmony that subsisted between them while he was a bachelor they had earned such a sweet name as that of \u201cThe Two Friends,\u201d he should not allow a title so rare and so delightful to be lost through a needless anxiety to act circumspectly; and so he entreated him, if such a phrase was allowable between them, to be once more master of his house and to come in and go out as formerly, assuring him that his wife Camilla had no other desire or inclination than that which he would wish her to have, and that knowing how sincerely they loved one another she was grieved to see such coldness in him.", " Are we going, do you fancy, to the house of our wenches, like gallants who come and knock and go in at any hour, however late it may be?\u201d \u201cLet us first of all find out the palace for certain,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cand then I will tell thee, Sancho, what we had best do; but look, Sancho, for either I see badly, or that dark mass that one sees from here should be Dulcinea\u2019s palace.\u201d \u201cThen let your worship lead the way,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cperhaps it may be so; though I see it with my eyes and touch it with my hands, I\u2019ll believe it as much as I believe it is daylight now.\u201d Don Quixote took the lead, and having gone a matter of two hundred paces he came upon the mass that produced the shade, and found it was a great tower, and then he perceived that the building in question was no palace, but the chief church of the town, and said he, \u201cIt\u2019s the church we have lit upon, Sancho.\u201d \u201cSo I see,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cand God grant we may not light upon our graves; it is no good sign to find oneself wandering in a graveyard at this time of night; and that, after my telling your worship, if I don\u2019t mistake, that the house of this lady will be in an alley without an outlet.\u201d \u201cThe curse of God on thee for a blockhead!\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cwhere hast thou ever heard of castles and royal palaces being built in alleys without an outlet?\u201d \u201cSe\u00f1or,\u201d replied Sancho, \u201cevery country has a way of its own; perhaps here in El Toboso it is the way to build palaces and grand buildings in alleys; so I entreat your worship to let me search about among these streets or alleys before me, and perhaps, in some corner or other, I may stumble on this palace\u2014and I wish I saw the dogs eating it for leading us such a dance.\u201d \u201cSpeak respectfully of what belongs to my lady, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201clet us keep the feast in peace, and not throw the rope after the bucket.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll hold my tongue,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cbut how am I to take it patiently when your worship wants me, with only once seeing the house of our mistress, to know always, and find it in the middle of the night, when your worship can\u2019t find it, who must have seen it thousands of times?\u201d \u201cThou wilt drive me to desperation, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote.", " CHAPTER XXXIV. IN WHICH IS CONTINUED THE NOVEL OF \u201cTHE ILL-ADVISED CURIOSITY\u201d \u201cIt is commonly said that an army looks ill without its general and a castle without its castellan, and I say that a young married woman looks still worse without her husband unless there are very good reasons for it. I find myself so ill at ease without you, and so incapable of enduring this separation, that unless you return quickly I shall have to go for relief to my parents\u2019 house, even if I leave yours without a protector; for the one you left me, if indeed he deserved that title, has, I think, more regard to his own pleasure than to what concerns you: as you are possessed of discernment I need say no more to you, nor indeed is it fitting I should say more.\u201d Anselmo received this letter, and from it he gathered that Lothario had already begun his task and that Camilla must have replied to him as he would have wished; and delighted beyond measure at such intelligence he sent word to her not to leave his house on any account, as he would very shortly return."], "What do the barber and the priest sort through and destroy in Don Quixote\u2019s home?": [" IN WHICH THE DOUBTFUL QUESTION OF MAMBRINO\u2019S HELMET AND THE PACK-SADDLE IS FINALLY SETTLED, WITH OTHER ADVENTURES THAT OCCURRED IN TRUTH AND EARNEST c45a.jpg (154K) Full Size \u201cWhat do you think now, gentlemen,\u201d said the barber, \u201cof what these gentles say, when they want to make out that this is a helmet?\u201d \u201cAnd whoever says the contrary,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cI will let him know he lies if he is a knight, and if he is a squire that he lies again a thousand times.\u201d Our own barber, who was present at all this, and understood Don Quixote\u2019s humour so thoroughly, took it into his head to back up his delusion and carry on the joke for the general amusement; so addressing the other barber he said: \u201cSe\u00f1or barber, or whatever you are, you must know that I belong to your profession too, and have had a licence to practise for more than twenty years, and I know the implements of the barber craft, every one of them, perfectly well; and I was likewise a soldier for some time in the days of my youth, and I know also what a helmet is, and a morion, and a headpiece with a visor, and other things pertaining to soldiering, I meant to say to soldiers\u2019 arms; and I say\u2014saving better opinions and always with submission to sounder judgments\u2014that this piece we have now before us, which this worthy gentleman has in his hands, not only is no barber\u2019s basin, but is as far from being one as white is from black, and truth from falsehood; I say, moreover, that this, although it is a helmet, is not a complete helmet.\u201d \u201cCertainly not,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cfor half of it is wanting, that is to say the beaver.\u201d \u201cIt is quite true,\u201d said the curate, who saw the object of his friend the barber; and Cardenio, Don Fernando and his companions agreed with him, and even the Judge, if his thoughts had not been so full of Don Luis\u2019s affair, would have helped to carry on the joke; but he was so taken up with the serious matters he had on his mind that he paid little or no attention to these facetious proceedings.", " \u201cI don\u2019t choose to tell it here, now,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand have it reach the ears of the lords of the council to-morrow morning, and some other carry off the thanks and rewards of my trouble.\u201d \u201cFor my part,\u201d said the barber, \u201cI give my word here and before God that I will not repeat what your worship says, to King, Rook or earthly man\u2014an oath I learned from the ballad of the curate, who, in the prelude, told the king of the thief who had robbed him of the hundred gold crowns and his pacing mule.\u201d \u201cI am not versed in stories,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cbut I know the oath is a good one, because I know the barber to be an honest fellow.\u201d \u201cEven if he were not,\u201d said the curate, \u201cI will go bail and answer for him that in this matter he will be as silent as a dummy, under pain of paying any penalty that may be pronounced.\u201d \u201cAnd who will be security for you, se\u00f1or curate?\u201d said Don Quixote. \u201cMy profession,\u201d replied the curate, \u201cwhich is to keep secrets.\u201d \u201cOds body!\u201d said Don Quixote at this, \u201cwhat more has his Majesty to do but to command, by public proclamation, all the knights-errant that are scattered over Spain to assemble on a fixed day in the capital, for even if no more than half a dozen come, there may be one among them who alone will suffice to destroy the entire might of the Turk.", " I have the basin in my sack all dinted, and I am taking it home to have it mended, to trim my beard in it, if, by God\u2019s grace, I am allowed to see my wife and children some day or other.\u201d \u201cLook here, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cby him thou didst swear by just now I swear thou hast the most limited understanding that any squire in the world has or ever had. Is it possible that all this time thou hast been going about with me thou hast never found out that all things belonging to knights-errant seem to be illusions and nonsense and ravings, and to go always by contraries? And not because it really is so, but because there is always a swarm of enchanters in attendance upon us that change and alter everything with us, and turn things as they please, and according as they are disposed to aid or destroy us; thus what seems to thee a barber\u2019s basin seems to me Mambrino\u2019s helmet, and to another it will seem something else; and rare foresight it was in the sage who is on my side to make what is really and truly Mambrino\u2019s helmet seem a basin to everybody, for, being held in such estimation as it is, all the world would pursue me to rob me of it; but when they see it is only a barber\u2019s basin they do not take the trouble to obtain it; as was plainly shown by him who tried to break it, and left it on the ground without taking it, for, by my faith, had he known it he would never have left it behind.", " They took leave of all, and of the good Maritornes, who, sinner as she was, promised to pray a rosary of prayers that God might grant them success in such an arduous and Christian undertaking as that they had in hand. But hardly had he sallied forth from the inn when it struck the curate that he was doing wrong in rigging himself out in that fashion, as it was an indecorous thing for a priest to dress himself that way even though much might depend upon it; and saying so to the barber he begged him to change dresses, as it was fitter he should be the distressed damsel, while he himself would play the squire\u2019s part, which would be less derogatory to his dignity; otherwise he was resolved to have nothing more to do with the matter, and let the devil take Don Quixote. Just at this moment Sancho came up, and on seeing the pair in such a costume he was unable to restrain his laughter; the barber, however, agreed to do as the curate wished, and, altering their plan, the curate went on to instruct him how to play his part and what to say to Don Quixote to induce and compel him to come with them and give up his fancy for the place he had chosen for his idle penance."], "What does Don Quixote promise Sancho on the condition he leave his wife and become Quixote\u2019s squire?": [" The Biscayan was so bewildered that he was unable to answer a word, and it would have gone hard with him, so blind was Don Quixote, had not the ladies in the coach, who had hitherto been watching the combat in great terror, hastened to where he stood and implored him with earnest entreaties to grant them the great grace and favour of sparing their squire\u2019s life; to which Don Quixote replied with much gravity and dignity, \u201cIn truth, fair ladies, I am well content to do what ye ask of me; but it must be on one condition and understanding, which is that this knight promise me to go to the village of El Toboso, and on my behalf present himself before the peerless lady Dulcinea, that she deal with him as shall be most pleasing to her.\u201d The terrified and disconsolate ladies, without discussing Don Quixote\u2019s demand or asking who Dulcinea might be, promised that their squire should do all that had been commanded.", " What gown have you brought me back? What shoes for your children?\u201d \u201cI bring nothing of that sort, wife,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cthough I bring other things of more consequence and value.\u201d \u201cI am very glad of that,\u201d returned his wife; \u201cshow me these things of more value and consequence, my friend; for I want to see them to cheer my heart that has been so sad and heavy all these ages that you have been away.\u201d \u201cI will show them to you at home, wife,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cbe content for the present; for if it please God that we should again go on our travels in search of adventures, you will soon see me a count, or governor of an island, and that not one of those everyday ones, but the best that is to be had.\u201d \u201cHeaven grant it, husband,\u201d said she, \u201cfor indeed we have need of it. But tell me, what\u2019s this about islands, for I don\u2019t understand it?\u201d \u201cHoney is not for the mouth of the ass,\u201d returned Sancho; \u201call in good time thou shalt see, wife\u2014nay, thou wilt be surprised to hear thyself called \u2018your ladyship\u2019 by all thy vassals.\u201d \u201cWhat are you talking about, Sancho, with your ladyships, islands, and vassals?\u201d returned Teresa Panza\u2014for so Sancho\u2019s wife was called, though they were not relations, for in La Mancha it is customary for wives to take their husbands\u2019 surnames.", " She, in her fear, not knowing what she was saying, exclaimed, \u201cDo not kill me, se\u00f1or, for I can tell you things more important than any you can imagine.\u201d \u201cTell me then at once or thou diest,\u201d said Anselmo. \u201cIt would be impossible for me now,\u201d said Leonela, \u201cI am so agitated: leave me till to-morrow, and then you shall hear from me what will fill you with astonishment; but rest assured that he who leaped through the window is a young man of this city, who has given me his promise to become my husband.\u201d Anselmo was appeased with this, and was content to wait the time she asked of him, for he never expected to hear anything against Camilla, so satisfied and sure of her virtue was he; and so he quitted the room, and left Leonela locked in, telling her she should not come out until she had told him all she had to make known to him. He went at once to see Camilla, and tell her, as he did, all that had passed between him and her handmaid, and the promise she had given him to inform him matters of serious importance.", " \u201cIt must be, by some means or other,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cfor unless the name stands there plain and manifest, no woman would believe the verses were made for her.\u201d They agreed upon this, and that the departure should take place in three days from that time. Don Quixote charged the bachelor to keep it a secret, especially from the curate and Master Nicholas, and from his niece and the housekeeper, lest they should prevent the execution of his praiseworthy and valiant purpose. Carrasco promised all, and then took his leave, charging Don Quixote to inform him of his good or evil fortunes whenever he had an opportunity; and thus they bade each other farewell, and Sancho went away to make the necessary preparations for their expedition. p04e.jpg (55K) CHAPTER V. OF THE SHREWD AND DROLL CONVERSATION THAT PASSED BETWEEN SANCHO PANZA AND HIS WIFE TERESA PANZA, AND OTHER MATTERS WORTHY OF BEING DULY RECORDED p05a.jpg (129K) Full Size The translator of this history, when he comes to write this fifth chapter, says that he considers it apocryphal, because in it Sancho Panza speaks in a style unlike that which might have been expected from his limited intelligence, and says things so subtle that he does not think it possible he could have conceived them; however, desirous of doing what his task imposed upon him, he was unwilling to leave it untranslated, and therefore he went on to say: Sancho came home in such glee and spirits that his wife noticed his happiness a bowshot off, so much so that it made her ask him, \u201cWhat have you got, Sancho friend, that you are so glad?\u201d To which he replied, \u201cWife, if it were God\u2019s will, I should be very glad not to be so well pleased as I show myself.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand you, husband,\u201d said she, \u201cand I don\u2019t know what you mean by saying you would be glad, if it were God\u2019s will, not to be well pleased; for, fool as I am, I don\u2019t know how one can find pleasure in not having it.\u201d \u201cHark ye, Teresa,\u201d replied Sancho, \u201cI am glad because I have made up my mind to go back to the service of my master Don Quixote, who means to go out a third time to seek for adventures; and I am going with him again, for my necessities will have it so, and also the hope that cheers me with the thought that I may find another hundred crowns like those we have spent; though it makes me sad to have to leave thee and the children; and if God would be pleased to let me have my daily bread, dry-shod and at home, without taking me out into the byways and cross-roads\u2014and he could do it at small cost by merely willing it\u2014it is clear my happiness would be more solid and lasting, for the happiness I have is mingled with sorrow at leaving thee; so that I was right in saying I would be glad, if it were God\u2019s will, not to be well pleased.\u201d \u201cLook here, Sancho,\u201d said Teresa; \u201cever since you joined on to a knight-errant you talk in such a roundabout way that there is no understanding you.\u201d \u201cIt is enough that God understands me, wife,\u201d replied Sancho; \u201cfor he is the understander of all things; that will do; but mind, sister, you must look to Dapple carefully for the next three days, so that he may be fit to take arms; double his feed, and see to the pack-saddle and other harness, for it is not to a wedding we are bound, but to go round the world, and play at give and take with giants and dragons and monsters, and hear hissings and roarings and bellowings and howlings; and even all this would be lavender, if we had not to reckon with Yanguesans and enchanted Moors.\u201d \u201cI know well enough, husband,\u201d said Teresa, \u201cthat squires-errant don\u2019t eat their bread for nothing, and so I will be always praying to our Lord to deliver you speedily from all that hard fortune.\u201d \u201cI can tell you, wife,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cif I did not expect to see myself governor of an island before long, I would drop down dead on the spot.\u201d \u201cNay, then, husband,\u201d said Teresa; \u201clet the hen live, though it be with her pip, live, and let the devil take all the governments in the world; you came out of your mother\u2019s womb without a government, you have lived until now without a government, and when it is God\u2019s will you will go, or be carried, to your grave without a government."], "Which large objects does Don Quixote mistake for giants?": [" OF THE GOOD FORTUNE WHICH THE VALIANT DON QUIXOTE HAD IN THE TERRIBLE AND UNDREAMT-OF ADVENTURE OF THE WINDMILLS, WITH OTHER OCCURRENCES WORTHY TO BE FITLY RECORDED c08a.jpg (142K) Full Size At this point they came in sight of thirty or forty windmills that there are on that plain, and as soon as Don Quixote saw them he said to his squire, \u201cFortune is arranging matters for us better than we could have shaped our desires ourselves, for look there, friend Sancho Panza, where thirty or more monstrous giants present themselves, all of whom I mean to engage in battle and slay, and with whose spoils we shall begin to make our fortunes; for this is righteous warfare, and it is God\u2019s good service to sweep so evil a breed from off the face of the earth.\u201d \u201cWhat giants?\u201d said Sancho Panza. \u201cThose thou seest there,\u201d answered his master, \u201cwith the long arms, and some have them nearly two leagues long.\u201d \u201cLook, your worship,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cwhat we see there are not giants but windmills, and what seem to be their arms are the sails that turned by the wind make the millstone go.\u201d \u201cIt is easy to see,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cthat thou art not used to this business of adventures; those are giants; and if thou art afraid, away with thee out of this and betake thyself to prayer while I engage them in fierce and unequal combat.\u201d So saying, he gave the spur to his steed Rocinante, heedless of the cries his squire Sancho sent after him, warning him that most certainly they were windmills and not giants he was going to attack.", " \u201cWith regard to giants,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201copinions differ as to whether there ever were any or not in the world; but the Holy Scripture, which cannot err by a jot from the truth, shows us that there were, when it gives us the history of that big Philistine, Goliath, who was seven cubits and a half in height, which is a huge size. Likewise, in the island of Sicily, there have been found leg-bones and arm-bones so large that their size makes it plain that their owners were giants, and as tall as great towers; geometry puts this fact beyond a doubt. But, for all that, I cannot speak with certainty as to the size of Morgante, though I suspect he cannot have been very tall; and I am inclined to be of this opinion because I find in the history in which his deeds are particularly mentioned, that he frequently slept under a roof and as he found houses to contain him, it is clear that his bulk could not have been anything excessive.\u201d \u201cThat is true,\u201d said the curate, and yielding to the enjoyment of hearing such nonsense, he asked him what was his notion of the features of Reinaldos of Montalban, and Don Roland and the rest of the Twelve Peers of France, for they were all knights-errant.", " This Don Quixote, or Don Simpleton, or whatever his name is, cannot, I imagine, be such a blockhead as your excellence would have him, holding out encouragement to him to go on with his vagaries and follies.\u201d Then turning to address Don Quixote he said, \u201cAnd you, num-skull, who put it into your head that you are a knight-errant, and vanquish giants and capture miscreants? Go your ways in a good hour, and in a good hour be it said to you. Go home and bring up your children if you have any, and attend to your business, and give over going wandering about the world, gaping and making a laughing-stock of yourself to all who know you and all who don\u2019t. Where, in heaven\u2019s name, have you discovered that there are or ever were knights-errant? Where are there giants in Spain or miscreants in La Mancha, or enchanted Dulcineas, or all the rest of the silly things they tell about you?\u201d Don Quixote listened attentively to the reverend gentleman\u2019s words, and as soon as he perceived he had done speaking, regardless of the presence of the duke and duchess, he sprang to his feet with angry looks and an agitated countenance, and said\u2014But the reply deserves a chapter to itself.", " \u201cHold!\u201d said he, \u201cfor I am badly wounded through my horse\u2019s fault; carry me to bed, and if possible send for the wise Urganda to cure and see to my wounds.\u201d \u201cSee there! plague on it!\u201d cried the housekeeper at this: \u201cdid not my heart tell the truth as to which foot my master went lame of? To bed with your worship at once, and we will contrive to cure you here without fetching that Hurgada. A curse I say once more, and a hundred times more, on those books of chivalry that have brought your worship to such a pass.\u201d They carried him to bed at once, and after searching for his wounds could find none, but he said they were all bruises from having had a severe fall with his horse Rocinante when in combat with ten giants, the biggest and the boldest to be found on earth. \u201cSo, so!\u201d said the curate, \u201care there giants in the dance? By the sign of the Cross I will burn them to-morrow before the day is over.\u201d They put a host of questions to Don Quixote, but his only answer to all was\u2014give him something to eat, and leave him to sleep, for that was what he needed most."], "From whom does Cervantes claim to have bought the manuscript of Don Quixote?": [" It is the mean, prosaic, commonplace character of all the surroundings and circumstances that gives a significance to Don Quixote\u2019s vigil and the ceremony that follows. Cervantes\u2019 humour is for the most part of that broader and simpler sort, the strength of which lies in the perception of the incongruous. It is the incongruity of Sancho in all his ways, words, and works, with the ideas and aims of his master, quite as much as the wonderful vitality and truth to nature of the character, that makes him the most humorous creation in the whole range of fiction. That unsmiling gravity of which Cervantes was the first great master, \u201cCervantes\u2019 serious air,\u201d which sits naturally on Swift alone, perhaps, of later humourists, is essential to this kind of humour, and here again Cervantes has suffered at the hands of his interpreters. Nothing, unless indeed the coarse buffoonery of Phillips, could be more out of place in an attempt to represent Cervantes, than a flippant, would-be facetious style, like that of Motteux\u2019s version for example, or the sprightly, jaunty air, French translators sometimes adopt.", " It did the best it could; it read his book and liked it and bought it, and encouraged the bookseller to pay him well for others. It has been also made a reproach to Spain that she has erected no monument to the man she is proudest of; no monument, that is to say, of him; for the bronze statue in the little garden of the Plaza de las Cort\u00e9s, a fair work of art no doubt, and unexceptionable had it been set up to the local poet in the market-place of some provincial town, is not worthy of Cervantes or of Madrid. But what need has Cervantes of \u201csuch weak witness of his name;\u201d or what could a monument do in his case except testify to the self-glorification of those who had put it up? Si monumentum quoeris, circumspice. The nearest bookseller\u2019s shop will show what bathos there would be in a monument to the author of \u201cDon Quixote.\u201d Nine editions of the First Part of \u201cDon Quixote\u201d had already appeared before Cervantes died, thirty thousand copies in all, according to his own estimate, and a tenth was printed at Barcelona the year after his death.", " The family of Cervantes is commonly said to have been of Galician origin, and unquestionably it was in possession of lands in Galicia at a very early date; but I think the balance of the evidence tends to show that the \u201csolar,\u201d the original site of the family, was at Cervatos in the north-west corner of Old Castile, close to the junction of Castile, Leon, and the Asturias. As it happens, there is a complete history of the Cervantes family from the tenth century down to the seventeenth extant under the title of \u201cIllustrious Ancestry, Glorious Deeds, and Noble Posterity of the Famous Nuno Alfonso, Alcaide of Toledo,\u201d written in 1648 by the industrious genealogist Rodrigo Mendez Silva, who availed himself of a manuscript genealogy by Juan de Mena, the poet laureate and historiographer of John II. The origin of the name Cervantes is curious. Nuno Alfonso was almost as distinguished in the struggle against the Moors in the reign of Alfonso VII as the Cid had been half a century before in that of Alfonso VI, and was rewarded by divers grants of land in the neighbourhood of Toledo.", " He was already on board heavily ironed, when the Dey at length agreed to reduce his demand by one-half, and Father Gil by borrowing was able to make up the amount, and on September 19, 1580, after a captivity of five years all but a week, Cervantes was at last set free. Before long he discovered that Blanco de Paz, who claimed to be an officer of the Inquisition, was now concocting on false evidence a charge of misconduct to be brought against him on his return to Spain. To checkmate him Cervantes drew up a series of twenty-five questions, covering the whole period of his captivity, upon which he requested Father Gil to take the depositions of credible witnesses before a notary. Eleven witnesses taken from among the principal captives in Algiers deposed to all the facts above stated and to a great deal more besides. There is something touching in the admiration, love, and gratitude we see struggling to find expression in the formal language of the notary, as they testify one after another to the good deeds of Cervantes, how he comforted and helped the weak-hearted, how he kept up their drooping courage, how he shared his poor purse with this deponent, and how \u201cin him this deponent found father and mother.\u201d On his return to Spain he found his old regiment about to march for Portugal to support Philip\u2019s claim to the crown, and utterly penniless now, had no choice but to rejoin it."], "What reason does Don Quixote give to the goatherds for the existence of knights?": [" But anxious to find quarters for the night, they with all despatch made an end of their poor dry fare, mounted at once, and made haste to reach some habitation before night set in; but daylight and the hope of succeeding in their object failed them close by the huts of some goatherds, so they determined to pass the night there, and it was as much to Sancho\u2019s discontent not to have reached a house, as it was to his master\u2019s satisfaction to sleep under the open heaven, for he fancied that each time this happened to him he performed an act of ownership that helped to prove his chivalry. c10e.jpg (57K) CHAPTER XI.

In defence of these, as time advanced and wickedness increased, the order of knights-errant was instituted, to defend maidens, to protect widows and to succour the orphans and the needy. To this order I belong, brother goatherds, to whom I return thanks for the hospitality and kindly welcome ye offer me and my squire; for though by natural law all living are bound to show favour to knights-errant, yet, seeing that without knowing this obligation ye have welcomed and feasted me, it is right that with all the good-will in my power I should thank you for yours.\u201d c11b.jpg (349K) Full Size All this long harangue (which might very well have been spared) our knight delivered because the acorns they gave him reminded him of the golden age; and the whim seized him to address all this unnecessary argument to the goatherds, who listened to him gaping in amazement without saying a word in reply.", " \u201cWhence it arises,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat when we see any person well dressed and making a figure with rich garments and retinue of servants, it seems to lead and impel us perforce to respect him, though memory may at the same moment recall to us some lowly condition in which we have seen him, but which, whether it may have been poverty or low birth, being now a thing of the past, has no existence; while the only thing that has any existence is what we see before us; and if this person whom fortune has raised from his original lowly state (these were the very words the padre used) to his present height of prosperity, be well bred, generous, courteous to all, without seeking to vie with those whose nobility is of ancient date, depend upon it, Teresa, no one will remember what he was, and everyone will respect what he is, except indeed the envious, from whom no fair fortune is safe.\u201d \u201cI do not understand you, husband,\u201d replied Teresa; \u201cdo as you like, and don\u2019t break my head with any more speechifying and rethoric; and if you have revolved to do what you say\u2014\u201d \u201cResolved, you should say, woman,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cnot revolved.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t set yourself to wrangle with me, husband,\u201d said Teresa; \u201cI speak as God pleases, and don\u2019t deal in out-of-the-way phrases; and I say if you are bent upon having a government, take your son Sancho with you, and teach him from this time on how to hold a government; for sons ought to inherit and learn the trades of their fathers.\u201d \u201cAs soon as I have the government,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cI will send for him by post, and I will send thee money, of which I shall have no lack, for there is never any want of people to lend it to governors when they have not got it; and do thou dress him so as to hide what he is and make him look what he is to be.\u201d \u201cYou send the money,\u201d said Teresa, \u201cand I\u2019ll dress him up for you as fine as you please.\u201d \u201cThen we are agreed that our daughter is to be a countess,\u201d said Sancho.", " She laughed greatly when I told her how your worship was called The Knight of the Rueful Countenance; I asked her if that Biscayan the other day had been there; and she told me he had, and that he was an honest fellow; I asked her too about the galley slaves, but she said she had not seen any as yet.\u201d \u201cSo far all goes well,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cbut tell me what jewel was it that she gave thee on taking thy leave, in return for thy tidings of me? For it is a usual and ancient custom with knights and ladies errant to give the squires, damsels, or dwarfs who bring tidings of their ladies to the knights, or of their knights to the ladies, some rich jewel as a guerdon for good news, and acknowledgment of the message.\u201d \u201cThat is very likely,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cand a good custom it was, to my mind; but that must have been in days gone by, for now it would seem to be the custom only to give a piece of bread and cheese; because that was what my lady Dulcinea gave me over the top of the yard-wall when I took leave of her; and more by token it was sheep\u2019s-milk cheese.\u201d \u201cShe is generous in the extreme,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand if she did not give thee a jewel of gold, no doubt it must have been because she had not one to hand there to give thee; but sleeves are good after Easter; I shall see her and all shall be made right."], "Who dies from a broken heart after the beautiful shepherdess Marcela refuses his love?": [" Heaven has made me, so you say, beautiful, and so much so that in spite of yourselves my beauty leads you to love me; and for the love you show me you say, and even urge, that I am bound to love you. By that natural understanding which God has given me I know that everything beautiful attracts love, but I cannot see how, by reason of being loved, that which is loved for its beauty is bound to love that which loves it; besides, it may happen that the lover of that which is beautiful may be ugly, and ugliness being detestable, it is very absurd to say, \u201cI love thee because thou art beautiful, thou must love me though I be ugly.\u201d But supposing the beauty equal on both sides, it does not follow that the inclinations must be therefore alike, for it is not every beauty that excites love, some but pleasing the eye without winning the affection; and if every sort of beauty excited love and won the heart, the will would wander vaguely to and fro unable to make choice of any; for as there is an infinity of beautiful objects there must be an infinity of inclinations, and true love, I have heard it said, is indivisible, and must be voluntary and not compelled.", " Seeing his good intention, the travellers were unwilling to press him further, and once more bidding him farewell, they left him and pursued their journey, in the course of which they did not fail to discuss the story of Marcela and Chrysostom as well as the madness of Don Quixote. He, on his part, resolved to go in quest of the shepherdess Marcela, and make offer to her of all the service he could render her; but things did not fall out with him as he expected, according to what is related in the course of this veracious history, of which the Second Part ends here. c14e.jpg (31K) CHAPTER XV.

Let the three-headed guardian of the gate, And all the monstrous progeny of hell, The doleful concert join: a lover dead Methinks can have no fitter obsequies. Lay of despair, grieve not when thou art gone Forth from this sorrowing heart: my misery Brings fortune to the cause that gave thee birth; Then banish sadness even in the tomb. The \u201cLay of Chrysostom\u201d met with the approbation of the listeners, though the reader said it did not seem to him to agree with what he had heard of Marcela\u2019s reserve and propriety, for Chrysostom complained in it of jealousy, suspicion, and absence, all to the prejudice of the good name and fame of Marcela; to which Ambrosio replied as one who knew well his friend\u2019s most secret thoughts, \u201cSe\u00f1or, to remove that doubt I should tell you that when the unhappy man wrote this lay he was away from Marcela, from whom he had voluntarily separated himself, to try if absence would act with him as it is wont; and as everything distresses and every fear haunts the banished lover, so imaginary jealousies and suspicions, dreaded as if they were true, tormented Chrysostom; and thus the truth of what report declares of the virtue of Marcela remains unshaken, and with her envy itself should not and cannot find any fault save that of being cruel, somewhat haughty, and very scornful.\u201d \u201cThat is true,\u201d said Vivaldo; and as he was about to read another paper of those he had preserved from the fire, he was stopped by a marvellous vision (for such it seemed) that unexpectedly presented itself to their eyes; for on the summit of the rock where they were digging the grave there appeared the shepherdess Marcela, so beautiful that her beauty exceeded its reputation.", " For, said he\u2014and he said quite right\u2014parents are not to settle children in life against their will. But when one least looked for it, lo and behold! one day the demure Marcela makes her appearance turned shepherdess; and, in spite of her uncle and all those of the town that strove to dissuade her, took to going a-field with the other shepherd-lasses of the village, and tending her own flock. And so, since she appeared in public, and her beauty came to be seen openly, I could not well tell you how many rich youths, gentlemen and peasants, have adopted the costume of Chrysostom, and go about these fields making love to her. One of these, as has been already said, was our deceased friend, of whom they say that he did not love but adore her. But you must not suppose, because Marcela chose a life of such liberty and independence, and of so little or rather no retirement, that she has given any occasion, or even the semblance of one, for disparagement of her purity and modesty; on the contrary, such and so great is the vigilance with which she watches over her honour, that of all those that court and woo her not one has boasted, or can with truth boast, that she has given him any hope however small of obtaining his desire."], "At the funeral of Chrysostom, which of the deceased\u2019s requests does the traveler Vivaldo propose ignoring?": [" Each of them carried a stout holly staff in his hand, and along with them there came two men of quality on horseback in handsome travelling dress, with three servants on foot accompanying them. Courteous salutations were exchanged on meeting, and inquiring one of the other which way each party was going, they learned that all were bound for the scene of the burial, so they went on all together. One of those on horseback addressing his companion said to him, \u201cIt seems to me, Se\u00f1or Vivaldo, that we may reckon as well spent the delay we shall incur in seeing this remarkable funeral, for remarkable it cannot but be judging by the strange things these shepherds have told us, of both the dead shepherd and homicide shepherdess.\u201d \u201cSo I think too,\u201d replied Vivaldo, \u201cand I would delay not to say a day, but four, for the sake of seeing it.\u201d Don Quixote asked them what it was they had heard of Marcela and Chrysostom.", " When the villagers saw the two scholars so unexpectedly appearing in shepherd\u2019s dress, they were lost in wonder, and could not guess what had led them to make so extraordinary a change. About this time the father of our Chrysostom died, and he was left heir to a large amount of property in chattels as well as in land, no small number of cattle and sheep, and a large sum of money, of all of which the young man was left dissolute owner, and indeed he was deserving of it all, for he was a very good comrade, and kind-hearted, and a friend of worthy folk, and had a countenance like a benediction. Presently it came to be known that he had changed his dress with no other object than to wander about these wastes after that shepherdess Marcela our lad mentioned a while ago, with whom the deceased Chrysostom had fallen in love. And I must tell you now, for it is well you should know it, who this girl is; perhaps, and even without any perhaps, you will not have heard anything like it all the days of your life, though you should live more years than sarna.\u201d \u201cSay Sarra,\u201d said Don Quixote, unable to endure the goatherd\u2019s confusion of words.", " The traveller answered that the same morning they had met these shepherds, and seeing them dressed in this mournful fashion they had asked them the reason of their appearing in such a guise; which one of them gave, describing the strange behaviour and beauty of a shepherdess called Marcela, and the loves of many who courted her, together with the death of that Chrysostom to whose burial they were going. In short, he repeated all that Pedro had related to Don Quixote. This conversation dropped, and another was commenced by him who was called Vivaldo asking Don Quixote what was the reason that led him to go armed in that fashion in a country so peaceful. To which Don Quixote replied, \u201cThe pursuit of my calling does not allow or permit me to go in any other fashion; easy life, enjoyment, and repose were invented for soft courtiers, but toil, unrest, and arms were invented and made for those alone whom the world calls knights-errant, of whom I, though unworthy, am the least of all.\u201d The instant they heard this all set him down as mad, and the better to settle the point and discover what kind of madness his was, Vivaldo proceeded to ask him what knights-errant meant.", " On the contrary, by granting life to those papers, let the cruelty of Marcela live for ever, to serve as a warning in ages to come to all men to shun and avoid falling into like danger; or I and all of us who have come here know already the story of this your love-stricken and heart-broken friend, and we know, too, your friendship, and the cause of his death, and the directions he gave at the close of his life; from which sad story may be gathered how great was the cruelty of Marcela, the love of Chrysostom, and the loyalty of your friendship, together with the end awaiting those who pursue rashly the path that insane passion opens to their eyes. Last night we learned the death of Chrysostom and that he was to be buried here, and out of curiosity and pity we left our direct road and resolved to come and see with our eyes that which when heard of had so moved our compassion, and in consideration of that compassion and our desire to prove it if we might by condolence, we beg of you, excellent Ambrosia, or at least I on my own account entreat you, that instead of burning those papers you allow me to carry away some of them.\u201d And without waiting for the shepherd\u2019s answer, he stretched out his hand and took up some of those that were nearest to him; seeing which Ambrosio said, \u201cOut of courtesy, se\u00f1or, I will grant your request as to those you have taken, but it is idle to expect me to abstain from burning the remainder.\u201d Vivaldo, who was eager to see what the papers contained, opened one of them at once, and saw that its title was \u201cLay of Despair.\u201d Ambrosio hearing it said, \u201cThat is the last paper the unhappy man wrote; and that you may see, se\u00f1or, to what an end his misfortunes brought him, read it so that you may be heard, for you will have time enough for that while we are waiting for the grave to be dug.\u201d \u201cI will do so very willingly,\u201d said Vivaldo; and as all the bystanders were equally eager they gathered round him, and he, reading in a loud voice, found that it ran as follows."], "How does Don Quixote respond to Marcela\u2019s statement that she never led anyone on and only wishes to stay chaste?": [" And now it is the time; from Hell\u2019s abyss Come thirsting Tantalus, come Sisyphus Heaving the cruel stone, come Tityus With vulture, and with wheel Ixion come, And come the sisters of the ceaseless toil; And all into this breast transfer their pains, And (if such tribute to despair be due) Chant in their deepest tones a doleful dirge Over a corse unworthy of a shroud.

Here the goatherd brought his song to an end, and though Don Quixote entreated him to sing more, Sancho had no mind that way, being more inclined for sleep than for listening to songs; so said he to his master, \u201cYour worship will do well to settle at once where you mean to pass the night, for the labour these good men are at all day does not allow them to spend the night in singing.\u201d \u201cI understand thee, Sancho,\u201d replied Don Quixote; \u201cI perceive clearly that those visits to the wine-skin demand compensation in sleep rather than in music.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s sweet to us all, blessed be God,\u201d said Sancho. \u201cI do not deny it,\u201d replied Don Quixote; \u201cbut settle thyself where thou wilt; those of my calling are more becomingly employed in watching than in sleeping; still it would be as well if thou wert to dress this ear for me again, for it is giving me more pain than it need.\u201d Sancho did as he bade him, but one of the goatherds, seeing the wound, told him not to be uneasy, as he would apply a remedy with which it would be soon healed; and gathering some leaves of rosemary, of which there was a great quantity there, he chewed them and mixed them with a little salt, and applying them to the ear he secured them firmly with a bandage, assuring him that no other treatment would be required, and so it proved.", " But now in this hateful age of ours not one is safe, not though some new labyrinth like that of Crete conceal and surround her; even there the pestilence of gallantry will make its way to them through chinks or on the air by the zeal of its accursed importunity, and, despite of all seclusion, lead them to ruin. In defence of these, as time advanced and wickedness increased, the order of knights-errant was instituted, to defend maidens, to protect widows and to succour the orphans and the needy. To this order I belong, brother goatherds, to whom I return thanks for the hospitality and kindly welcome ye offer me and my squire; for though by natural law all living are bound to show favour to knights-errant, yet, seeing that without knowing this obligation ye have welcomed and feasted me, it is right that with all the good-will in my power I should thank you for yours.\u201d c11b.jpg (349K) Full Size All this long harangue (which might very well have been spared) our knight delivered because the acorns they gave him reminded him of the golden age; and the whim seized him to address all this unnecessary argument to the goatherds, who listened to him gaping in amazement without saying a word in reply.", " he as rich as she is fair; and she the fairest on earth!\u201d Hearing this, Don Quixote said to himself, \u201cIt is easy to see these folk have never seen my Dulcinea del Toboso; for if they had they would be more moderate in their praises of this Quiteria of theirs.\u201d Shortly after this, several bands of dancers of various sorts began to enter the arcade at different points, and among them one of sword-dancers composed of some four-and-twenty lads of gallant and high-spirited mien, clad in the finest and whitest of linen, and with handkerchiefs embroidered in various colours with fine silk; and one of those on the mares asked an active youth who led them if any of the dancers had been wounded. \u201cAs yet, thank God, no one has been wounded,\u201d said he, \u201cwe are all safe and sound;\u201d and he at once began to execute complicated figures with the rest of his comrades, with so many turns and so great dexterity, that although Don Quixote was well used to see dances of the same kind, he thought he had never seen any so good as this."], "How does the Duchess already know about Don Quixote, even before she and the Duke encounter him in the woods?": [" One of this sort, I say, must have been the grave churchman who came out with the duke and duchess to receive Don Quixote. A vast number of polite speeches were exchanged, and at length, taking Don Quixote between them, they proceeded to sit down to table. The duke pressed Don Quixote to take the head of the table, and, though he refused, the entreaties of the duke were so urgent that he had to accept it. The ecclesiastic took his seat opposite to him, and the duke and duchess those at the sides. All this time Sancho stood by, gaping with amazement at the honour he saw shown to his master by these illustrious persons; and observing all the ceremonious pressing that had passed between the duke and Don Quixote to induce him to take his seat at the head of the table, he said, \u201cIf your worship will give me leave I will tell you a story of what happened in my village about this matter of seats.\u201d The moment Sancho said this Don Quixote trembled, making sure that he was about to say something foolish.", " \u201cSo much the better,\u201d said the duke, \u201cfor many droll things cannot be said in few words; but not to lose time in talking, come, great Knight of the Rueful Countenance\u2014\u201d \u201cOf the Lions, your highness must say,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cfor there is no Rueful Countenance nor any such character now.\u201d \u201cHe of the Lions be it,\u201d continued the duke; \u201cI say, let Sir Knight of the Lions come to a castle of mine close by, where he shall be given that reception which is due to so exalted a personage, and which the duchess and I are wont to give to all knights-errant who come there.\u201d By this time Sancho had fixed and girthed Rocinante\u2019s saddle, and Don Quixote having got on his back and the duke mounted a fine horse, they placed the duchess in the middle and set out for the castle. The duchess desired Sancho to come to her side, for she found infinite enjoyment in listening to his shrewd remarks. Sancho required no pressing, but pushed himself in between them and the duke, who thought it rare good fortune to receive such a knight-errant and such a homely squire in their castle.", " And now, to complete the enjoyment of the feast and bring the dinner to a satisfactory end, lo and behold the page who had carried the letters and presents to Teresa Panza, the wife of the governor Sancho, entered the hall; and the duke and duchess were very well pleased to see him, being anxious to know the result of his journey; but when they asked him the page said in reply that he could not give it before so many people or in a few words, and begged their excellences to be pleased to let it wait for a private opportunity, and in the meantime amuse themselves with these letters; and taking out the letters he placed them in the duchess\u2019s hand. One bore by way of address, _Letter for my lady the Duchess So-and-so, of I don\u2019t know where; and the other To my husband Sancho Panza, governor of the island of Barataria, whom God prosper longer than me_. The duchess\u2019s bread would not bake, as the saying is, until she had read her letter; and having looked over it herself and seen that it might be read aloud for the duke and all present to hear, she read out as follows.", " He crossed the courtyard at a walk, and coming to where the duennas were placed stopped to look at her who demanded him for a husband; the marshal of the field summoned Don Quixote, who had already presented himself in the courtyard, and standing by the side of Tosilos he addressed the duennas, and asked them if they consented that Don Quixote of La Mancha should do battle for their right. They said they did, and that whatever he should do in that behalf they declared rightly done, final and valid. By this time the duke and duchess had taken their places in a gallery commanding the enclosure, which was filled to overflowing with a multitude of people eager to see this perilous and unparalleled encounter. The conditions of the combat were that if Don Quixote proved the victor his antagonist was to marry the daughter of Do\u00f1a Rodriguez; but if he should be vanquished his opponent was released from the promise that was claimed against him and from all obligations to give satisfaction."], "How does the Duke and Duchess\u2019 behaviour during the reception make Don Quixote feel?": [" \u201cSo much the better,\u201d said the duke, \u201cfor many droll things cannot be said in few words; but not to lose time in talking, come, great Knight of the Rueful Countenance\u2014\u201d \u201cOf the Lions, your highness must say,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cfor there is no Rueful Countenance nor any such character now.\u201d \u201cHe of the Lions be it,\u201d continued the duke; \u201cI say, let Sir Knight of the Lions come to a castle of mine close by, where he shall be given that reception which is due to so exalted a personage, and which the duchess and I are wont to give to all knights-errant who come there.\u201d By this time Sancho had fixed and girthed Rocinante\u2019s saddle, and Don Quixote having got on his back and the duke mounted a fine horse, they placed the duchess in the middle and set out for the castle. The duchess desired Sancho to come to her side, for she found infinite enjoyment in listening to his shrewd remarks. Sancho required no pressing, but pushed himself in between them and the duke, who thought it rare good fortune to receive such a knight-errant and such a homely squire in their castle.", " One of this sort, I say, must have been the grave churchman who came out with the duke and duchess to receive Don Quixote. A vast number of polite speeches were exchanged, and at length, taking Don Quixote between them, they proceeded to sit down to table. The duke pressed Don Quixote to take the head of the table, and, though he refused, the entreaties of the duke were so urgent that he had to accept it. The ecclesiastic took his seat opposite to him, and the duke and duchess those at the sides. All this time Sancho stood by, gaping with amazement at the honour he saw shown to his master by these illustrious persons; and observing all the ceremonious pressing that had passed between the duke and Don Quixote to induce him to take his seat at the head of the table, he said, \u201cIf your worship will give me leave I will tell you a story of what happened in my village about this matter of seats.\u201d The moment Sancho said this Don Quixote trembled, making sure that he was about to say something foolish.", " Thy husband, the governor, SANCHO PANZA When she had done reading the letter the duchess said to Sancho, \u201cOn two points the worthy governor goes rather astray; one is in saying or hinting that this government has been bestowed upon him for the lashes that he is to give himself, when he knows (and he cannot deny it) that when my lord the duke promised it to him nobody ever dreamt of such a thing as lashes; the other is that he shows himself here to be very covetous; and I would not have him a money-seeker, for \u2018covetousness bursts the bag,\u2019 and the covetous governor does ungoverned justice.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t mean it that way, se\u00f1ora,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cand if you think the letter doesn\u2019t run as it ought to do, it\u2019s only to tear it up and make another; and maybe it will be a worse one if it is left to my gumption.\u201d \u201cNo, no,\u201d said the duchess, \u201cthis one will do, and I wish the duke to see it.\u201d With this they betook themselves to a garden where they were to dine, and the duchess showed Sancho\u2019s letter to the duke, who was highly delighted with it.", " And now, to complete the enjoyment of the feast and bring the dinner to a satisfactory end, lo and behold the page who had carried the letters and presents to Teresa Panza, the wife of the governor Sancho, entered the hall; and the duke and duchess were very well pleased to see him, being anxious to know the result of his journey; but when they asked him the page said in reply that he could not give it before so many people or in a few words, and begged their excellences to be pleased to let it wait for a private opportunity, and in the meantime amuse themselves with these letters; and taking out the letters he placed them in the duchess\u2019s hand. One bore by way of address, _Letter for my lady the Duchess So-and-so, of I don\u2019t know where; and the other To my husband Sancho Panza, governor of the island of Barataria, whom God prosper longer than me_. The duchess\u2019s bread would not bake, as the saying is, until she had read her letter; and having looked over it herself and seen that it might be read aloud for the duke and all present to hear, she read out as follows."], "Why does the Duchess take a particular liking to Sancho?": [" For I would have you know, Sir Errant, that in these little villages everything is talked about and everything is carped at, and rest assured, as I am, that the priest must be over and above good who forces his parishioners to speak well of him, especially in villages.\u201d \u201cThat is the truth,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cbut go on, for the story is very good, and you, good Pedro, tell it with very good grace.\u201d \u201cMay that of the Lord not be wanting to me,\u201d said Pedro; \u201cthat is the one to have. To proceed; you must know that though the uncle put before his niece and described to her the qualities of each one in particular of the many who had asked her in marriage, begging her to marry and make a choice according to her own taste, she never gave any other answer than that she had no desire to marry just yet, and that being so young she did not think herself fit to bear the burden of matrimony. At these, to all appearance, reasonable excuses that she made, her uncle ceased to urge her, and waited till she was somewhat more advanced in age and could mate herself to her own liking.", " For by God and upon my soul I want it badly; and if they gave me a scrape of the razor besides I\u2019d take it as a still greater kindness.\u201d \u201cWhat are you saying to yourself, Sancho?\u201d asked the duchess. \u201cI was saying, se\u00f1ora,\u201d he replied, \u201cthat in the courts of other princes, when the cloth is taken away, I have always heard say they give water for the hands, but not lye for the beard; and that shows it is good to live long that you may see much; to be sure, they say too that he who lives a long life must undergo much evil, though to undergo a washing of that sort is pleasure rather than pain.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be uneasy, friend Sancho,\u201d said the duchess; \u201cI will take care that my damsels wash you, and even put you in the tub if necessary.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be content with the beard,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cat any rate for the present; and as for the future, God has decreed what is to be.\u201d \u201cAttend to worthy Sancho\u2019s request, seneschal,\u201d said the duchess, \u201cand do exactly what he wishes.\u201d The seneschal replied that Se\u00f1or Sancho should be obeyed in everything; and with that he went away to dinner and took Sancho along with him, while the duke and duchess and Don Quixote remained at table discussing a great variety of things, but all bearing on the calling of arms and knight-errantry.", " \u201cWhat is Dapple?\u201d said the duchess. \u201cMy ass,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cwhich, not to mention him by that name, I\u2019m accustomed to call Dapple; I begged this lady duenna here to take care of him when I came into the castle, and she got as angry as if I had said she was ugly or old, though it ought to be more natural and proper for duennas to feed asses than to ornament chambers. God bless me! what a spite a gentleman of my village had against these ladies!\u201d \u201cHe must have been some clown,\u201d said Do\u00f1a Rodriguez the duenna; \u201cfor if he had been a gentleman and well-born he would have exalted them higher than the horns of the moon.\u201d \u201cThat will do,\u201d said the duchess; \u201cno more of this; hush, Do\u00f1a Rodriguez, and let Se\u00f1or Panza rest easy and leave the treatment of Dapple in my charge, for as he is a treasure of Sancho\u2019s, I\u2019ll put him on the apple of my eye.\u201d \u201cIt will be enough for him to be in the stable,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cfor neither he nor I are worthy to rest a moment in the apple of your highness\u2019s eye, and I\u2019d as soon stab myself as consent to it; for though my master says that in civilities it is better to lose by a card too many than a card too few, when it comes to civilities to asses we must mind what we are about and keep within due bounds.\u201d \u201cTake him to your government, Sancho,\u201d said the duchess, \u201cand there you will be able to make as much of him as you like, and even release him from work and pension him off.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t think, se\u00f1ora duchess, that you have said anything absurd,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cI have seen more than two asses go to governments, and for me to take mine with me would be nothing new.\u201d Sancho\u2019s words made the duchess laugh again and gave her fresh amusement, and dismissing him to sleep she went away to tell the duke the conversation she had had with him, and between them they plotted and arranged to play a joke upon Don Quixote that was to be a rare one and entirely in knight-errantry style, and in that same style they practised several upon him, so much in keeping and so clever that they form the best adventures this great history contains.", " Sancho replied that, though he certainly had the habit of sleeping four or five hours in the heat of the day in summer, to serve her excellence he would try with all his might not to sleep even one that day, and that he would come in obedience to her command, and with that he went off. The duke gave fresh orders with respect to treating Don Quixote as a knight-errant, without departing even in smallest particular from the style in which, as the stories tell us, they used to treat the knights of old. p32e.jpg (16K) CHAPTER XXXIII. OF THE DELECTABLE DISCOURSE WHICH THE DUCHESS AND HER DAMSELS HELD WITH SANCHO PANZA, WELL WORTH READING AND NOTING p33a.jpg (138K) Full Size The history records that Sancho did not sleep that afternoon, but in order to keep his word came, before he had well done dinner, to visit the duchess, who, finding enjoyment in listening to him, made him sit down beside her on a low seat, though Sancho, out of pure good breeding, wanted not to sit down; the duchess, however, told him he was to sit down as governor and talk as squire, as in both respects he was worthy of even the chair of the Cid Ruy Diaz the Campeador."], "When Sancho confides that he deceived Don Quixote about Dulcinea\u2019s transformation, how does the Duchess respond?": [" And it seems to me that, in governments, to make a beginning is everything; and maybe, after having been governor a fortnight, I\u2019ll take kindly to the work and know more about it than the field labour I have been brought up to.\u201d \u201cYou are right, Sancho,\u201d said the duchess, \u201cfor no one is born ready taught, and the bishops are made out of men and not out of stones. But to return to the subject we were discussing just now, the enchantment of the lady Dulcinea, I look upon it as certain, and something more than evident, that Sancho\u2019s idea of practising a deception upon his master, making him believe that the peasant girl was Dulcinea and that if he did not recognise her it must be because she was enchanted, was all a device of one of the enchanters that persecute Don Quixote. For in truth and earnest, I know from good authority that the coarse country wench who jumped up on the ass was and is Dulcinea del Toboso, and that worthy Sancho, though he fancies himself the deceiver, is the one that is deceived; and that there is no more reason to doubt the truth of this, than of anything else we never saw.", " And to prove it, thou knowest already, Sancho, by experience which cannot lie or deceive, how easy it is for enchanters to change one countenance into another, turning fair into foul, and foul into fair; for it is not two days since thou sawest with thine own eyes the beauty and elegance of the peerless Dulcinea in all its perfection and natural harmony, while I saw her in the repulsive and mean form of a coarse country wench, with cataracts in her eyes and a foul smell in her mouth; and when the perverse enchanter ventured to effect so wicked a transformation, it is no wonder if he effected that of Samson Carrasco and thy gossip in order to snatch the glory of victory out of my grasp. For all that, however, I console myself, because, after all, in whatever shape he may have been, I have been victorious over my enemy.\u201d \u201cGod knows what\u2019s the truth of it all,\u201d said Sancho; and knowing as he did that the transformation of Dulcinea had been a device and imposition of his own, his master\u2019s illusions were not satisfactory to him; but he did not like to reply lest he should say something that might disclose his trickery.", " He told him, too, of the jokes he had practised upon him, and of the device for the disenchantment of Dulcinea at the expense of Sancho\u2019s backside; and finally he gave him an account of the trick Sancho had played upon his master, making him believe that Dulcinea was enchanted and turned into a country wench; and of how the duchess, his wife, had persuaded Sancho that it was he himself who was deceived, inasmuch as Dulcinea was really enchanted; at which the bachelor laughed not a little, and marvelled as well at the sharpness and simplicity of Sancho as at the length to which Don Quixote\u2019s madness went. The duke begged of him if he found him (whether he overcame him or not) to return that way and let him know the result. This the bachelor did; he set out in quest of Don Quixote, and not finding him at Saragossa, he went on, and how he fared has been already told. He returned to the duke\u2019s castle and told him all, what the conditions of the combat were, and how Don Quixote was now, like a loyal knight-errant, returning to keep his promise of retiring to his village for a year, by which time, said the bachelor, he might perhaps be cured of his madness; for that was the object that had led him to adopt these disguises, as it was a sad thing for a gentleman of such good parts as Don Quixote to be a madman.", " The duchess asked Sancho the next day if he had made a beginning with his penance task which he had to perform for the disenchantment of Dulcinea. He said he had, and had given himself five lashes overnight. The duchess asked him what he had given them with. He said with his hand. \u201cThat,\u201d said the duchess, \u201cis more like giving oneself slaps than lashes; I am sure the sage Merlin will not be satisfied with such tenderness; worthy Sancho must make a scourge with claws, or a cat-o\u2019-nine tails, that will make itself felt; for it\u2019s with blood that letters enter, and the release of so great a lady as Dulcinea will not be granted so cheaply, or at such a paltry price; and remember, Sancho, that works of charity done in a lukewarm and half-hearted way are without merit and of no avail.\u201d To which Sancho replied, \u201cIf your ladyship will give me a proper scourge or cord, I\u2019ll lay on with it, provided it does not hurt too much; for you must know, boor as I am, my flesh is more cotton than hemp, and it won\u2019t do for me to destroy myself for the good of anybody else.\u201d \u201cSo be it by all means,\u201d said the duchess; \u201cto-morrow I\u2019ll give you a scourge that will be just the thing for you, and will accommodate itself to the tenderness of your flesh, as if it was its own sister.\u201d Then said Sancho, \u201cYour highness must know, dear lady of my soul, that I have a letter written to my wife, Teresa Panza, giving her an account of all that has happened me since I left her; I have it here in my bosom, and there\u2019s nothing wanting but to put the address to it; I\u2019d be glad if your discretion would read it, for I think it runs in the governor style; I mean the way governors ought to write.\u201d \u201cAnd who dictated it?\u201d asked the duchess."], "When the Duke and Duchess take Don Quixote and Sancho boar hunting, the group encounters ox-drawn wagons carrying ___.": [" The duchess dismounted, and with a sharp boar-spear in her hand posted herself where she knew the wild boars were in the habit of passing. The duke and Don Quixote likewise dismounted and placed themselves one at each side of her. Sancho took up a position in the rear of all without dismounting from Dapple, whom he dared not desert lest some mischief should befall him. Scarcely had they taken their stand in a line with several of their servants, when they saw a huge boar, closely pressed by the hounds and followed by the huntsmen, making towards them, grinding his teeth and tusks, and scattering foam from his mouth. As soon as he saw him Don Quixote, bracing his shield on his arm, and drawing his sword, advanced to meet him; the duke with boar-spear did the same; but the duchess would have gone in front of them all had not the duke prevented her. Sancho alone, deserting Dapple at the sight of the mighty beast, took to his heels as hard as he could and strove in vain to mount a tall oak.", " One of this sort, I say, must have been the grave churchman who came out with the duke and duchess to receive Don Quixote. A vast number of polite speeches were exchanged, and at length, taking Don Quixote between them, they proceeded to sit down to table. The duke pressed Don Quixote to take the head of the table, and, though he refused, the entreaties of the duke were so urgent that he had to accept it.

Meanwhile they had slung the mighty boar across the back of a mule, and having covered it with sprigs of rosemary and branches of myrtle, they bore it away as the spoils of victory to some large field-tents which had been pitched in the middle of the wood, where they found the tables laid and dinner served, in such grand and sumptuous style that it was easy to see the rank and magnificence of those who had provided it. Sancho, as he showed the rents in his torn suit to the duchess, observed, \u201cIf we had been hunting hares, or after small birds, my coat would have been safe from being in the plight it\u2019s in; I don\u2019t know what pleasure one can find in lying in wait for an animal that may take your life with his tusk if he gets at you.", " \u201cSo much the better,\u201d said the duke, \u201cfor many droll things cannot be said in few words; but not to lose time in talking, come, great Knight of the Rueful Countenance\u2014\u201d \u201cOf the Lions, your highness must say,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cfor there is no Rueful Countenance nor any such character now.\u201d \u201cHe of the Lions be it,\u201d continued the duke; \u201cI say, let Sir Knight of the Lions come to a castle of mine close by, where he shall be given that reception which is due to so exalted a personage, and which the duchess and I are wont to give to all knights-errant who come there.\u201d By this time Sancho had fixed and girthed Rocinante\u2019s saddle, and Don Quixote having got on his back and the duke mounted a fine horse, they placed the duchess in the middle and set out for the castle. The duchess desired Sancho to come to her side, for she found infinite enjoyment in listening to his shrewd remarks. Sancho required no pressing, but pushed himself in between them and the duke, who thought it rare good fortune to receive such a knight-errant and such a homely squire in their castle."], "What does Don Quixote take to wearing on his head in place of a proper helmet?": [" I say this because, if I mistake not, there comes towards us one who wears on his head the helmet of Mambrino, concerning which I took the oath thou rememberest.\u201d \u201cMind what you say, your worship, and still more what you do,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cfor I don\u2019t want any more fulling mills to finish off fulling and knocking our senses out.\u201d \u201cThe devil take thee, man,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cwhat has a helmet to do with fulling mills?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d replied Sancho, \u201cbut, faith, if I might speak as I used, perhaps I could give such reasons that your worship would see you were mistaken in what you say.\u201d \u201cHow can I be mistaken in what I say, unbelieving traitor?\u201d returned Don Quixote; \u201ctell me, seest thou not yonder knight coming towards us on a dappled grey steed, who has upon his head a helmet of gold?\u201d \u201cWhat I see and make out,\u201d answered Sancho, \u201cis only a man on a grey ass like my own, who has something that shines on his head.\u201d \u201cWell, that is the helmet of Mambrino,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cstand to one side and leave me alone with him; thou shalt see how, without saying a word, to save time, I shall bring this adventure to an issue and possess myself of the helmet I have so longed for.\u201d \u201cI will take care to stand aside,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cbut God grant, I say once more, that it may be marjoram and not fulling mills.\u201d \u201cI have told thee, brother, on no account to mention those fulling mills to me again,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cor I vow\u2014and I say no more\u2014I\u2019ll full the soul out of you.\u201d Sancho held his peace in dread lest his master should carry out the vow he had hurled like a bowl at him.", " With the pack-saddle I do not concern myself; but I may tell you on that head that my squire Sancho asked my permission to strip off the caparison of this vanquished poltroon\u2019s steed, and with it adorn his own; I allowed him, and he took it; and as to its having been changed from a caparison into a pack-saddle, I can give no explanation except the usual one, that such transformations will take place in adventures of chivalry. To confirm all which, run, Sancho my son, and fetch hither the helmet which this good fellow calls a basin.\u201d \u201cEgad, master,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cif we have no other proof of our case than what your worship puts forward, Mambrino\u2019s helmet is just as much a basin as this good fellow\u2019s caparison is a pack-saddle.\u201d \u201cDo as I bid thee,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cit cannot be that everything in this castle goes by enchantment.\u201d Sancho hastened to where the basin was, and brought it back with him, and when Don Quixote saw it, he took hold of it and said: \u201cYour worships may see with what a face this squire can assert that this is a basin and not the helmet I told you of; and I swear by the order of chivalry I profess, that this helmet is the identical one I took from him, without anything added to or taken from it.\u201d \u201cThere is no doubt of that,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cfor from the time my master won it until now he has only fought one battle in it, when he let loose those unlucky men in chains; and if it had not been for this basin-helmet he would not have come off over well that time, for there was plenty of stone-throwing in that affair.\u201d c44e.jpg (13K) CHAPTER XLV.", " IN WHICH THE DOUBTFUL QUESTION OF MAMBRINO\u2019S HELMET AND THE PACK-SADDLE IS FINALLY SETTLED, WITH OTHER ADVENTURES THAT OCCURRED IN TRUTH AND EARNEST c45a.jpg (154K) Full Size \u201cWhat do you think now, gentlemen,\u201d said the barber, \u201cof what these gentles say, when they want to make out that this is a helmet?\u201d \u201cAnd whoever says the contrary,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cI will let him know he lies if he is a knight, and if he is a squire that he lies again a thousand times.\u201d Our own barber, who was present at all this, and understood Don Quixote\u2019s humour so thoroughly, took it into his head to back up his delusion and carry on the joke for the general amusement; so addressing the other barber he said: \u201cSe\u00f1or barber, or whatever you are, you must know that I belong to your profession too, and have had a licence to practise for more than twenty years, and I know the implements of the barber craft, every one of them, perfectly well; and I was likewise a soldier for some time in the days of my youth, and I know also what a helmet is, and a morion, and a headpiece with a visor, and other things pertaining to soldiering, I meant to say to soldiers\u2019 arms; and I say\u2014saving better opinions and always with submission to sounder judgments\u2014that this piece we have now before us, which this worthy gentleman has in his hands, not only is no barber\u2019s basin, but is as far from being one as white is from black, and truth from falsehood; I say, moreover, that this, although it is a helmet, is not a complete helmet.\u201d \u201cCertainly not,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cfor half of it is wanting, that is to say the beaver.\u201d \u201cIt is quite true,\u201d said the curate, who saw the object of his friend the barber; and Cardenio, Don Fernando and his companions agreed with him, and even the Judge, if his thoughts had not been so full of Don Luis\u2019s affair, would have helped to carry on the joke; but he was so taken up with the serious matters he had on his mind that he paid little or no attention to these facetious proceedings.", " \u201cSinner that I am!\u201d said Sancho, \u201cthen why does your worship put off making it and teaching it to me?\u201d \u201cPeace, friend,\u201d answered Don Quixote; \u201cgreater secrets I mean to teach thee and greater favours to bestow upon thee; and for the present let us see to the dressing, for my ear pains me more than I could wish.\u201d Sancho took out some lint and ointment from the alforjas; but when Don Quixote came to see his helmet shattered, he was like to lose his senses, and clapping his hand upon his sword and raising his eyes to heaven, he said, \u201cI swear by the Creator of all things and the four Gospels in their fullest extent, to do as the great Marquis of Mantua did when he swore to avenge the death of his nephew Baldwin (and that was not to eat bread from a table-cloth, nor embrace his wife, and other points which, though I cannot now call them to mind, I here grant as expressed) until I take complete vengeance upon him who has committed such an offence against me.\u201d Hearing this, Sancho said to him, \u201cYour worship should bear in mind, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote, that if the knight has done what was commanded him in going to present himself before my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, he will have done all that he was bound to do, and does not deserve further punishment unless he commits some new offence.\u201d \u201cThou hast said well and hit the point,\u201d answered Don Quixote; and so I recall the oath in so far as relates to taking fresh vengeance on him, but I make and confirm it anew to lead the life I have said until such time as I take by force from some knight another helmet such as this and as good; and think not, Sancho, that I am raising smoke with straw in doing so, for I have one to imitate in the matter, since the very same thing to a hair happened in the case of Mambrino\u2019s helmet, which cost Sacripante so dear.\u201d \u201cSe\u00f1or,\u201d replied Sancho, \u201clet your worship send all such oaths to the devil, for they are very pernicious to salvation and prejudicial to the conscience; just tell me now, if for several days to come we fall in with no man armed with a helmet, what are we to do?"], "What prompts Don Quixote to free the galley slaves?": [" But the best of it is, the story goes in the neighbourhood that those who attacked us belong to a number of galley slaves who, they say, were set free almost on the very same spot by a man of such valour that, in spite of the commissary and of the guards, he released the whole of them; and beyond all doubt he must have been out of his senses, or he must be as great a scoundrel as they, or some man without heart or conscience to let the wolf loose among the sheep, the fox among the hens, the fly among the honey. He has defrauded justice, and opposed his king and lawful master, for he opposed his just commands; he has, I say, robbed the galleys of their feet, stirred up the Holy Brotherhood which for many years past has been quiet, and, lastly, has done a deed by which his soul may be lost without any gain to his body.\u201d Sancho had told the curate and the barber of the adventure of the galley slaves, which, so much to his glory, his master had achieved, and hence the curate in alluding to it made the most of it to see what would be said or done by Don Quixote; who changed colour at every word, not daring to say that it was he who had been the liberator of those worthy people.", " Such was the confusion, that the guards, now rushing at the galley slaves who were breaking loose, now to attack Don Quixote who was waiting for them, did nothing at all that was of any use. Sancho, on his part, gave a helping hand to release Gines de Pasamonte, who was the first to leap forth upon the plain free and unfettered, and who, attacking the prostrate commissary, took from him his sword and the musket, with which, aiming at one and levelling at another, he, without ever discharging it, drove every one of the guards off the field, for they took to flight, as well to escape Pasamonte\u2019s musket, as the showers of stones the now released galley slaves were raining upon them. Sancho was greatly grieved at the affair, because he anticipated that those who had fled would report the matter to the Holy Brotherhood, who at the summons of the alarm-bell would at once sally forth in quest of the offenders; and he said so to his master, and entreated him to leave the place at once, and go into hiding in the sierra that was close by.", " \u201cThen if so,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201chere is a case for the exercise of my office, to put down force and to succour and help the wretched.\u201d \u201cRecollect, your worship,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cJustice, which is the king himself, is not using force or doing wrong to such persons, but punishing them for their crimes.\u201d The chain of galley slaves had by this time come up, and Don Quixote in very courteous language asked those who were in custody of it to be good enough to tell him the reason or reasons for which they were conducting these people in this manner. One of the guards on horseback answered that they were galley slaves belonging to his majesty, that they were going to the galleys, and that was all that was to be said and all he had any business to know. c22b.jpg (298K) Full Size \u201cNevertheless,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cI should like to know from each of them separately the reason of his misfortune;\u201d to this he added more to the same effect to induce them to tell him what he wanted so civilly that the other mounted guard said to him: \u201cThough we have here the register and certificate of the sentence of every one of these wretches, this is no time to take them out or read them; come and ask themselves; they can tell if they choose, and they will, for these fellows take a pleasure in doing and talking about rascalities.\u201d With this permission, which Don Quixote would have taken even had they not granted it, he approached the chain and asked the first for what offences he was now in such a sorry case.", " But chance, directing things otherwise, so ordered it that just as the chief galley came close enough for those on board the vessel to hear the shouts from her calling on them to surrender, two Toraquis, that is to say two Turks, both drunken, that with a dozen more were on board the brigantine, discharged their muskets, killing two of the soldiers that lined the sides of our vessel. Seeing this the general swore he would not leave one of those he found on board the vessel alive, but as he bore down furiously upon her she slipped away from him underneath the oars. The galley shot a good way ahead; those on board the vessel saw their case was desperate, and while the galley was coming about they made sail, and by sailing and rowing once more tried to sheer off; but their activity did not do them as much good as their rashness did them harm, for the galley coming up with them in a little more than half a mile threw her oars over them and took the whole of them alive."], "What is the most apparent sign of madness in the \u201cRagged Knight of the Sorry Countenance\u201d?": [" As soon as he had done he made signs to them to follow him, which they did, and he led them to a green plot which lay a little farther off round the corner of a rock. On reaching it he stretched himself upon the grass, and the others did the same, all keeping silence, until the Ragged One, settling himself in his place, said: \u201cIf it is your wish, sirs, that I should disclose in a few words the surpassing extent of my misfortunes, you must promise not to break the thread of my sad story with any question or other interruption, for the instant you do so the tale I tell will come to an end.\u201d These words of the Ragged One reminded Don Quixote of the tale his squire had told him, when he failed to keep count of the goats that had crossed the river and the story remained unfinished; but to return to the Ragged One, he went on to say: \u201cI give you this warning because I wish to pass briefly over the story of my misfortunes, for recalling them to memory only serves to add fresh ones, and the less you question me the sooner shall I make an end of the recital, though I shall not omit to relate anything of importance in order fully to satisfy your curiosity.\u201d Don Quixote gave the promise for himself and the others, and with this assurance he began as follows: \u201cMy name is Cardenio, my birthplace one of the best cities of this Andalusia, my family noble, my parents rich, my misfortune so great that my parents must have wept and my family grieved over it without being able by their wealth to lighten it; for the gifts of fortune can do little to relieve reverses sent by Heaven.", " To be brief, the first to speak after embracing was the Ragged One, and he said what will be told farther on. c23i.jpg (53K) Full Size CHAPTER XXIV. IN WHICH IS CONTINUED THE ADVENTURE OF THE SIERRA MORENA c24a.jpg (151K) Full Size The history relates that it was with the greatest attention Don Quixote listened to the ragged knight of the Sierra, who began by saying: \u201cOf a surety, se\u00f1or, whoever you are, for I know you not, I thank you for the proofs of kindness and courtesy you have shown me, and would I were in a condition to requite with something more than good-will that which you have displayed towards me in the cordial reception you have given me; but my fate does not afford me any other means of returning kindnesses done me save the hearty desire to repay them.\u201d \u201cMine,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cis to be of service to you, so much so that I had resolved not to quit these mountains until I had found you, and learned of you whether there is any kind of relief to be found for that sorrow under which from the strangeness of your life you seem to labour; and to search for you with all possible diligence, if search had been necessary.", " This same Knight of the Lions, who was called not long since the Knight of the Rueful Countenance, sends by me to say may it please your highness to give him leave that, with your permission, approbation, and consent, he may come and carry out his wishes, which are, as he says and I believe, to serve your exalted loftiness and beauty; and if you give it, your ladyship will do a thing which will redound to your honour, and he will receive a most distinguished favour and happiness.\u201d \u201cYou have indeed, squire,\u201d said the lady, \u201cdelivered your message with all the formalities such messages require; rise up, for it is not right that the squire of a knight so great as he of the Rueful Countenance, of whom we have heard a great deal here, should remain on his knees; rise, my friend, and bid your master welcome to the services of myself and the duke my husband, in a country house we have here.\u201d Sancho got up, charmed as much by the beauty of the good lady as by her high-bred air and her courtesy, but, above all, by what she had said about having heard of his master, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance; for if she did not call him Knight of the Lions it was no doubt because he had so lately taken the name.", " But chance arranged matters better than he expected or hoped, for at that very moment, in a gorge on the mountain that opened where they stood, the youth he wished to find made his appearance, coming along talking to himself in a way that would have been unintelligible near at hand, much more at a distance. His garb was what has been described, save that as he drew near, Don Quixote perceived that a tattered doublet which he wore was amber-tanned, from which he concluded that one who wore such garments could not be of very low rank. Approaching them, the youth greeted them in a harsh and hoarse voice but with great courtesy. Don Quixote returned his salutation with equal politeness, and dismounting from Rocinante advanced with well-bred bearing and grace to embrace him, and held him for some time close in his arms as if he had known him for a long time. The other, whom we may call the Ragged One of the Sorry Countenance, as Don Quixote was of the Rueful, after submitting to the embrace pushed him back a little and, placing his hands on Don Quixote\u2019s shoulders, stood gazing at him as if seeking to see whether he knew him, not less amazed, perhaps, at the sight of the face, figure, and armour of Don Quixote than Don Quixote was at the sight of him."], "Before he went mad with heartsickness, who was Cardenio, the \u201cRagged Knight of the Sorry Countenance\u201d?": [" In theirs the listeners felt as much pity as wonder at her misfortunes; but as the curate was just about to offer her some consolation and advice Cardenio forestalled him, saying, \u201cSo then, se\u00f1ora, you are the fair Dorothea, the only daughter of the rich Clenardo?\u201d Dorothea was astonished at hearing her father\u2019s name, and at the miserable appearance of him who mentioned it, for it has been already said how wretchedly clad Cardenio was; so she said to him: \u201cAnd who may you be, brother, who seem to know my father\u2019s name so well? For so far, if I remember rightly, I have not mentioned it in the whole story of my misfortunes.\u201d \u201cI am that unhappy being, se\u00f1ora,\u201d replied Cardenio, \u201cwhom, as you have said, Luscinda declared to be her husband; I am the unfortunate Cardenio, whom the wrong-doing of him who has brought you to your present condition has reduced to the state you see me in, bare, ragged, bereft of all human comfort, and what is worse, of reason, for I only possess it when Heaven is pleased for some short space to restore it to me.", " As soon as he had done he made signs to them to follow him, which they did, and he led them to a green plot which lay a little farther off round the corner of a rock.

The caballeros say they do not want to have hidalgos setting up in opposition to them, particularly squire hidalgos who polish their own shoes and darn their black stockings with green silk.\u201d \u201cThat,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cdoes not apply to me, for I always go well dressed and never patched; ragged I may be, but ragged more from the wear and tear of arms than of time.\u201d \u201cAs to your worship\u2019s valour, courtesy, accomplishments, and task, there is a variety of opinions. Some say, \u2018mad but droll;\u2019 others, \u2018valiant but unlucky;\u2019 others, \u2018courteous but meddling,\u2019 and then they go into such a number of things that they don\u2019t leave a whole bone either in your worship or in myself.\u201d \u201cRecollect, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cthat wherever virtue exists in an eminent degree it is persecuted.", " And though I have no intention of imitating Roland, or Orlando, or Rotolando (for he went by all these names), step by step in all the mad things he did, said, and thought, I will make a rough copy to the best of my power of all that seems to me most essential; but perhaps I shall content myself with the simple imitation of Amadis, who without giving way to any mischievous madness but merely to tears and sorrow, gained as much fame as the most famous.\u201d \u201cIt seems to me,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cthat the knights who behaved in this way had provocation and cause for those follies and penances; but what cause has your worship for going mad? What lady has rejected you, or what evidence have you found to prove that the lady Dulcinea del Toboso has been trifling with Moor or Christian?\u201d \u201cThere is the point,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cand that is the beauty of this business of mine; no thanks to a knight-errant for going mad when he has cause; the thing is to turn crazy without any provocation, and let my lady know, if I do this in the dry, what I would do in the moist; moreover I have abundant cause in the long separation I have endured from my lady till death, Dulcinea del Toboso; for as thou didst hear that shepherd Ambrosio say the other day, in absence all ills are felt and feared; and so, friend Sancho, waste no time in advising me against so rare, so happy, and so unheard-of an imitation; mad I am, and mad I must be until thou returnest with the answer to a letter that I mean to send by thee to my lady Dulcinea; and if it be such as my constancy deserves, my insanity and penance will come to an end; and if it be to the opposite effect, I shall become mad in earnest, and, being so, I shall suffer no more; thus in whatever way she may answer I shall escape from the struggle and affliction in which thou wilt leave me, enjoying in my senses the boon thou bearest me, or as a madman not feeling the evil thou bringest me."], "What does Don Quixote assert when Sancho derides his plan to do penance and imagine Dulcinea\u2019s infidelity?": [" But one thing, se\u00f1or, troubles me more than all the rest, and that is thinking what is to be done when your worship conquers some giant, or some other knight, and orders him to go and present himself before the beauty of the lady Dulcinea. Where is this poor giant, or this poor wretch of a vanquished knight, to find her? I think I can see them wandering all over El Toboso, looking like noddies, and asking for my lady Dulcinea; and even if they meet her in the middle of the street they won\u2019t know her any more than they would my father.\u201d \u201cPerhaps, Sancho,\u201d returned Don Quixote, \u201cthe enchantment does not go so far as to deprive conquered and presented giants and knights of the power of recognising Dulcinea; we will try by experiment with one or two of the first I vanquish and send to her, whether they see her or not, by commanding them to return and give me an account of what happened to them in this respect.\u201d \u201cI declare, I think what your worship has proposed is excellent,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cand that by this plan we shall find out what we want to know; and if it be that it is only from your worship she is hidden, the misfortune will be more yours than hers; but so long as the lady Dulcinea is well and happy, we on our part will make the best of it, and get on as well as we can, seeking our adventures, and leaving Time to take his own course; for he is the best physician for these and greater ailments.\u201d Don Quixote was about to reply to Sancho Panza, but he was prevented by a cart crossing the road full of the most diverse and strange personages and figures that could be imagined.", " Say, what being is there in this world, who entering the gate of this castle at this moment, and seeing us as we are here, would suppose or imagine us to be what we are? Who would say that this lady who is beside me was the great queen that we all know her to be, or that I am that Knight of the Rueful Countenance, trumpeted far and wide by the mouth of Fame? Now, there can be no doubt that this art and calling surpasses all those that mankind has invented, and is the more deserving of being held in honour in proportion as it is the more exposed to peril. Away with those who assert that letters have the preeminence over arms; I will tell them, whosoever they may be, that they know not what they say. For the reason which such persons commonly assign, and upon which they chiefly rest, is, that the labours of the mind are greater than those of the body, and that arms give employment to the body alone; as if the calling were a porter\u2019s trade, for which nothing more is required than sturdy strength; or as if, in what we who profess them call arms, there were not included acts of vigour for the execution of which high intelligence is requisite; or as if the soul of the warrior, when he has an army, or the defence of a city under his care, did not exert itself as much by mind as by body.", " What your worship may do, and fairly do, is to change this service and tribute as regards the lady Dulcinea del Toboso for a certain quantity of ave-marias and credos which we will say for your worship\u2019s intention, and this is a condition that can be complied with by night as by day, running or resting, in peace or in war; but to imagine that we are going now to return to the flesh-pots of Egypt, I mean to take up our chain and set out for El Toboso, is to imagine that it is now night, though it is not yet ten in the morning, and to ask this of us is like asking pears of the elm tree.\u201d \u201cThen by all that\u2019s good,\u201d said Don Quixote (now stirred to wrath), \u201cDon son of a bitch, Don Ginesillo de Paropillo, or whatever your name is, you will have to go yourself alone, with your tail between your legs and the whole chain on your back.\u201d Pasamonte, who was anything but meek (being by this time thoroughly convinced that Don Quixote was not quite right in his head as he had committed such a vagary as to set them free), finding himself abused in this fashion, gave the wink to his companions, and falling back they began to shower stones on Don Quixote at such a rate that he was quite unable to protect himself with his buckler, and poor Rocinante no more heeded the spur than if he had been made of brass.", " They took leave of all, and of the good Maritornes, who, sinner as she was, promised to pray a rosary of prayers that God might grant them success in such an arduous and Christian undertaking as that they had in hand. But hardly had he sallied forth from the inn when it struck the curate that he was doing wrong in rigging himself out in that fashion, as it was an indecorous thing for a priest to dress himself that way even though much might depend upon it; and saying so to the barber he begged him to change dresses, as it was fitter he should be the distressed damsel, while he himself would play the squire\u2019s part, which would be less derogatory to his dignity; otherwise he was resolved to have nothing more to do with the matter, and let the devil take Don Quixote. Just at this moment Sancho came up, and on seeing the pair in such a costume he was unable to restrain his laughter; the barber, however, agreed to do as the curate wished, and, altering their plan, the curate went on to instruct him how to play his part and what to say to Don Quixote to induce and compel him to come with them and give up his fancy for the place he had chosen for his idle penance."], "In the story that Cardenio tells the priest and the barber, who marries Cardenio\u2019s beloved, Lucinda, against her wishes?": [" In theirs the listeners felt as much pity as wonder at her misfortunes; but as the curate was just about to offer her some consolation and advice Cardenio forestalled him, saying, \u201cSo then, se\u00f1ora, you are the fair Dorothea, the only daughter of the rich Clenardo?\u201d Dorothea was astonished at hearing her father\u2019s name, and at the miserable appearance of him who mentioned it, for it has been already said how wretchedly clad Cardenio was; so she said to him: \u201cAnd who may you be, brother, who seem to know my father\u2019s name so well?

The curate at once hastened to uncover her face and throw water on it, and as he did so Don Fernando, for he it was who held the other in his arms, recognised her and stood as if death-stricken by the sight; not, however, relaxing his grasp of Luscinda, for it was she that was struggling to release herself from his hold, having recognised Cardenio by his voice, as he had recognised her. Cardenio also heard Dorothea\u2019s cry as she fell fainting, and imagining that it came from his Luscinda burst forth in terror from the room, and the first thing he saw was Don Fernando with Luscinda in his arms. Don Fernando, too, knew Cardenio at once; and all three, Luscinda, Cardenio, and Dorothea, stood in silent amazement scarcely knowing what had happened to them.", " Even Sancho Panza was weeping; though afterwards he said he only wept because he saw that Dorothea was not as he fancied the queen Micomicona, of whom he expected such great favours. Their wonder as well as their weeping lasted some time, and then Cardenio and Luscinda went and fell on their knees before Don Fernando, returning him thanks for the favour he had rendered them in language so grateful that he knew not how to answer them, and raising them up embraced them with every mark of affection and courtesy. He then asked Dorothea how she had managed to reach a place so far removed from her own home, and she in a few fitting words told all that she had previously related to Cardenio, with which Don Fernando and his companions were so delighted that they wished the story had been longer; so charmingly did Dorothea describe her misadventures. When she had finished Don Fernando recounted what had befallen him in the city after he had found in Luscinda\u2019s bosom the paper in which she declared that she was Cardenio\u2019s wife, and never could be his.", " What I entreat of you is that you reproach me not with my transgression and grievous wrong-doing; for the same cause and force that drove me to make you mine impelled me to struggle against being yours; and to prove this, turn and look at the eyes of the now happy Luscinda, and you will see in them an excuse for all my errors: and as she has found and gained the object of her desires, and I have found in you what satisfies all my wishes, may she live in peace and contentment as many happy years with her Cardenio, as on my knees I pray Heaven to allow me to live with my Dorothea;\u201d and with these words he once more embraced her and pressed his face to hers with so much tenderness that he had to take great heed to keep his tears from completing the proof of his love and repentance in the sight of all.

He then told Cardenio and Dorothea what they had proposed to do to cure Don Quixote, or at any rate take him home; upon which Dorothea said that she could play the distressed damsel better than the barber; especially as she had there the dress in which to do it to the life, and that they might trust to her acting the part in every particular requisite for carrying out their scheme, for she had read a great many books of chivalry, and knew exactly the style in which afflicted damsels begged boons of knights-errant. \u201cIn that case,\u201d said the curate, \u201cthere is nothing more required than to set about it at once, for beyond a doubt fortune is declaring itself in our favour, since it has so unexpectedly begun to open a door for your relief, and smoothed the way for us to our object.\u201d Dorothea then took out of her pillow-case a complete petticoat of some rich stuff, and a green mantle of some other fine material, and a necklace and other ornaments out of a little box, and with these in an instant she so arrayed herself that she looked like a great and rich lady.", " Her husband Guillermo died of grief at the death of so good a wife, leaving his daughter Marcela, a child and rich, to the care of an uncle of hers, a priest and prebendary in our village. The girl grew up with such beauty that it reminded us of her mother\u2019s, which was very great, and yet it was thought that the daughter\u2019s would exceed it; and so when she reached the age of fourteen to fifteen years nobody beheld her but blessed God that had made her so beautiful, and the greater number were in love with her past redemption. Her uncle kept her in great seclusion and retirement, but for all that the fame of her great beauty spread so that, as well for it as for her great wealth, her uncle was asked, solicited, and importuned, to give her in marriage not only by those of our town but of those many leagues round, and by the persons of highest quality in them. But he, being a good Christian man, though he desired to give her in marriage at once, seeing her to be old enough, was unwilling to do so without her consent, not that he had any eye to the gain and profit which the custody of the girl\u2019s property brought him while he put off her marriage; and, faith, this was said in praise of the good priest in more than one set in the town."], "What reward does Dorothea promise Don Quixote for vanquishing \u201cthe giant\u201d?": [" But all this, he declared, did not so much grieve or distress him as his certain knowledge that a prodigious giant, the lord of a great island close to our kingdom, Pandafilando of the Scowl by name\u2014for it is averred that, though his eyes are properly placed and straight, he always looks askew as if he squinted, and this he does out of malignity, to strike fear and terror into those he looks at\u2014that he knew, I say, that this giant on becoming aware of my orphan condition would overrun my kingdom with a mighty force and strip me of all, not leaving me even a small village to shelter me; but that I could avoid all this ruin and misfortune if I were willing to marry him; however, as far as he could see, he never expected that I would consent to a marriage so unequal; and he said no more than the truth in this, for it has never entered my mind to marry that giant, or any other, let him be ever so great or enormous.", " On seeing this the landlord was so enraged that he fell on Don Quixote, and with his clenched fist began to pummel him in such a way, that if Cardenio and the curate had not dragged him off, he would have brought the war of the giant to an end. But in spite of all the poor gentleman never woke until the barber brought a great pot of cold water from the well and flung it with one dash all over his body, on which Don Quixote woke up, but not so completely as to understand what was the matter. Dorothea, seeing how short and slight his attire was, would not go in to witness the battle between her champion and her opponent. As for Sancho, he went searching all over the floor for the head of the giant, and not finding it he said, \u201cI see now that it\u2019s all enchantment in this house; for the last time, on this very spot where I am now, I got ever so many thumps without knowing who gave them to me, or being able to see anybody; and now this head is not to be seen anywhere about, though I saw it cut off with my own eyes and the blood running from the body as if from a fountain.\u201d \u201cWhat blood and fountains are you talking about, enemy of God and his saints?\u201d said the landlord.", " Don Fernando gave thanks to Heaven for the favour shown to him and for having been rescued from the intricate labyrinth in which he had been brought so near the destruction of his good name and of his soul; and in short everybody in the inn was full of contentment and satisfaction at the happy issue of such a complicated and hopeless business. The curate as a sensible man made sound reflections upon the whole affair, and congratulated each upon his good fortune; but the one that was in the highest spirits and good humour was the landlady, because of the promise Cardenio and the curate had given her to pay for all the losses and damage she had sustained through Don Quixote\u2019s means. Sancho, as has been already said, was the only one who was distressed, unhappy, and dejected; and so with a long face he went in to his master, who had just awoke, and said to him: \u201cSir Rueful Countenance, your worship may as well sleep on as much as you like, without troubling yourself about killing any giant or restoring her kingdom to the princess; for that is all over and settled now.\u201d \u201cI should think it was,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cfor I have had the most prodigious and stupendous battle with the giant that I ever remember having had all the days of my life; and with one back-stroke\u2014swish!\u2014I brought his head tumbling to the ground, and so much blood gushed forth from him that it ran in rivulets over the earth like water.\u201d \u201cLike red wine, your worship had better say,\u201d replied Sancho; \u201cfor I would have you know, if you don\u2019t know it, that the dead giant is a hacked wine-skin, and the blood four-and-twenty gallons of red wine that it had in its belly, and the cut-off head is the bitch that bore me; and the devil take it all.\u201d \u201cWhat art thou talking about, fool?\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cart thou in thy senses?\u201d \u201cLet your worship get up,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cand you will see the nice business you have made of it, and what we have to pay; and you will see the queen turned into a private lady called Dorothea, and other things that will astonish you, if you understand them.\u201d \u201cI shall not be surprised at anything of the kind,\u201d returned Don Quixote; \u201cfor if thou dost remember the last time we were here I told thee that everything that happened here was a matter of enchantment, and it would be no wonder if it were the same now.\u201d \u201cI could believe all that,\u201d replied Sancho, \u201cif my blanketing was the same sort of thing also; only it wasn\u2019t, but real and genuine; for I saw the landlord, who is here to-day, holding one end of the blanket and jerking me up to the skies very neatly and smartly, and with as much laughter as strength; and when it comes to be a case of knowing people, I hold for my part, simple and sinner as I am, that there is no enchantment about it at all, but a great deal of bruising and bad luck.\u201d \u201cWell, well, God will give a remedy,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201chand me my clothes and let me go out, for I want to see these transformations and things thou speakest of.\u201d Sancho fetched him his clothes; and while he was dressing, the curate gave Don Fernando and the others present an account of Don Quixote\u2019s madness and of the stratagem they had made use of to withdraw him from that Pena Pobre where he fancied himself stationed because of his lady\u2019s scorn.", " He was in his shirt, which was not long enough in front to cover his thighs completely and was six fingers shorter behind; his legs were very long and lean, covered with hair, and anything but clean; on his head he had a little greasy red cap that belonged to the host, round his left arm he had rolled the blanket of the bed, to which Sancho, for reasons best known to himself, owed a grudge, and in his right hand he held his unsheathed sword, with which he was slashing about on all sides, uttering exclamations as if he were actually fighting some giant: and the best of it was his eyes were not open, for he was fast asleep, and dreaming that he was doing battle with the giant. For his imagination was so wrought upon by the adventure he was going to accomplish, that it made him dream he had already reached the kingdom of Micomicon, and was engaged in combat with his enemy; and believing he was laying on the giant, he had given so many sword cuts to the skins that the whole room was full of wine."], "Who does Don Quixote encounter that tells Quixote not to interfere in his business again?": [" And you, secretary, answer my lord the duke and tell him that all his commands shall be obeyed to the letter, as he directs; and say from me to my lady the duchess that I kiss her hands, and that I beg of her not to forget to send my letter and bundle to my wife Teresa Panza by a messenger; and I will take it as a great favour and will not fail to serve her in all that may lie within my power; and as you are about it you may enclose a kiss of the hand to my master Don Quixote that he may see I am grateful bread; and as a good secretary and a good Biscayan you may add whatever you like and whatever will come in best; and now take away this cloth and give me something to eat, and I\u2019ll be ready to meet all the spies and assassins and enchanters that may come against me or my island.\u201d At this instant a page entered saying, \u201cHere is a farmer on business, who wants to speak to your lordship on a matter of great importance, he says.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very odd,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cthe ways of these men on business; is it possible they can be such fools as not to see that an hour like this is no hour for coming on business?", " On the latest, Mr. A. J. Duffield\u2019s, it would be in every sense of the word impertinent in me to offer an opinion here. I had not even seen it when the present undertaking was proposed to me, and since then I may say vidi tantum, having for obvious reasons resisted the temptation which Mr. Duffield\u2019s reputation and comely volumes hold out to every lover of Cervantes. From the foregoing history of our translations of \u201cDon Quixote,\u201d it will be seen that there are a good many people who, provided they get the mere narrative with its full complement of facts, incidents, and adventures served up to them in a form that amuses them, care very little whether that form is the one in which Cervantes originally shaped his ideas. On the other hand, it is clear that there are many who desire to have not merely the story he tells, but the story as he tells it, so far at least as differences of idiom and circumstances permit, and who will give a preference to the conscientious translator, even though he may have acquitted himself somewhat awkwardly.", " I am not sure, however, whether payment will comport with the cure, and I would not have the reward interfere with the medicine. I think there will be nothing lost by trying it; consider how much thou wouldst have, Sancho, and whip thyself at once, and pay thyself down with thine own hand, as thou hast money of mine.\u201d At this proposal Sancho opened his eyes and his ears a palm\u2019s breadth wide, and in his heart very readily acquiesced in whipping himself, and said he to his master, \u201cVery well then, se\u00f1or, I\u2019ll hold myself in readiness to gratify your worship\u2019s wishes if I\u2019m to profit by it; for the love of my wife and children forces me to seem grasping. Let your worship say how much you will pay me for each lash I give myself.\u201d \u201cIf Sancho,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cI were to requite thee as the importance and nature of the cure deserves, the treasures of Venice, the mines of Potosi, would be insufficient to pay thee.", " He crossed the courtyard at a walk, and coming to where the duennas were placed stopped to look at her who demanded him for a husband; the marshal of the field summoned Don Quixote, who had already presented himself in the courtyard, and standing by the side of Tosilos he addressed the duennas, and asked them if they consented that Don Quixote of La Mancha should do battle for their right. They said they did, and that whatever he should do in that behalf they declared rightly done, final and valid. By this time the duke and duchess had taken their places in a gallery commanding the enclosure, which was filled to overflowing with a multitude of people eager to see this perilous and unparalleled encounter. The conditions of the combat were that if Don Quixote proved the victor his antagonist was to marry the daughter of Do\u00f1a Rodriguez; but if he should be vanquished his opponent was released from the promise that was claimed against him and from all obligations to give satisfaction."], "What do the priest and the barber want to do with the inn\u2019s collection of chivalric romances?": [" IN WHICH THE DOUBTFUL QUESTION OF MAMBRINO\u2019S HELMET AND THE PACK-SADDLE IS FINALLY SETTLED, WITH OTHER ADVENTURES THAT OCCURRED IN TRUTH AND EARNEST c45a.jpg (154K) Full Size \u201cWhat do you think now, gentlemen,\u201d said the barber, \u201cof what these gentles say, when they want to make out that this is a helmet?\u201d \u201cAnd whoever says the contrary,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cI will let him know he lies if he is a knight, and if he is a squire that he lies again a thousand times.\u201d Our own barber, who was present at all this, and understood Don Quixote\u2019s humour so thoroughly, took it into his head to back up his delusion and carry on the joke for the general amusement; so addressing the other barber he said: \u201cSe\u00f1or barber, or whatever you are, you must know that I belong to your profession too, and have had a licence to practise for more than twenty years, and I know the implements of the barber craft, every one of them, perfectly well; and I was likewise a soldier for some time in the days of my youth, and I know also what a helmet is, and a morion, and a headpiece with a visor, and other things pertaining to soldiering, I meant to say to soldiers\u2019 arms; and I say\u2014saving better opinions and always with submission to sounder judgments\u2014that this piece we have now before us, which this worthy gentleman has in his hands, not only is no barber\u2019s basin, but is as far from being one as white is from black, and truth from falsehood; I say, moreover, that this, although it is a helmet, is not a complete helmet.\u201d \u201cCertainly not,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cfor half of it is wanting, that is to say the beaver.\u201d \u201cIt is quite true,\u201d said the curate, who saw the object of his friend the barber; and Cardenio, Don Fernando and his companions agreed with him, and even the Judge, if his thoughts had not been so full of Don Luis\u2019s affair, would have helped to carry on the joke; but he was so taken up with the serious matters he had on his mind that he paid little or no attention to these facetious proceedings.", " They took leave of all, and of the good Maritornes, who, sinner as she was, promised to pray a rosary of prayers that God might grant them success in such an arduous and Christian undertaking as that they had in hand. But hardly had he sallied forth from the inn when it struck the curate that he was doing wrong in rigging himself out in that fashion, as it was an indecorous thing for a priest to dress himself that way even though much might depend upon it; and saying so to the barber he begged him to change dresses, as it was fitter he should be the distressed damsel, while he himself would play the squire\u2019s part, which would be less derogatory to his dignity; otherwise he was resolved to have nothing more to do with the matter, and let the devil take Don Quixote. Just at this moment Sancho came up, and on seeing the pair in such a costume he was unable to restrain his laughter; the barber, however, agreed to do as the curate wished, and, altering their plan, the curate went on to instruct him how to play his part and what to say to Don Quixote to induce and compel him to come with them and give up his fancy for the place he had chosen for his idle penance.", " Search your memory, and if you find anything of this kind you need only tell me of it, and I promise you by the order of knighthood which I have received to procure you satisfaction and reparation to the utmost of your desire.\u201d The innkeeper replied to him with equal calmness, \u201cSir Knight, I do not want your worship to avenge me of any wrong, because when any is done me I can take what vengeance seems good to me; the only thing I want is that you pay me the score that you have run up in the inn last night, as well for the straw and barley for your two beasts, as for supper and beds.\u201d c16c.jpg (326K) Full Size \u201cThen this is an inn?\u201d said Don Quixote. \u201cAnd a very respectable one,\u201d said the innkeeper. \u201cI have been under a mistake all this time,\u201d answered Don Quixote, \u201cfor in truth I thought it was a castle, and not a bad one; but since it appears that it is not a castle but an inn, all that can be done now is that you should excuse the payment, for I cannot contravene the rule of knights-errant, of whom I know as a fact (and up to the present I have read nothing to the contrary) that they never paid for lodging or anything else in the inn where they might be; for any hospitality that might be offered them is their due by law and right in return for the insufferable toil they endure in seeking adventures by night and by day, in summer and in winter, on foot and on horseback, in hunger and thirst, cold and heat, exposed to all the inclemencies of heaven and all the hardships of earth.\u201d \u201cI have little to do with that,\u201d replied the innkeeper; \u201cpay me what you owe me, and let us have no more talk of chivalry, for all I care about is to get my money.\u201d \u201cYou are a stupid, scurvy innkeeper,\u201d said Don Quixote, and putting spurs to Rocinante and bringing his pike to the slope he rode out of the inn before anyone could stop him, and pushed on some distance without looking to see if his squire was following him.", " Enchantments of the sort travestied in those of Dulcinea and the Trifaldi and the cave of Montesinos play a leading part in the later and inferior romances, and another distinguishing feature is caricatured in Don Quixote\u2019s blind adoration of Dulcinea. In the romances of chivalry love is either a mere animalism or a fantastic idolatry. Only a coarse-minded man would care to make merry with the former, but to one of Cervantes\u2019 humour the latter was naturally an attractive subject for ridicule. Like everything else in these romances, it is a gross exaggeration of the real sentiment of chivalry, but its peculiar extravagance is probably due to the influence of those masters of hyperbole, the Provencal poets. When a troubadour professed his readiness to obey his lady in all things, he made it incumbent upon the next comer, if he wished to avoid the imputation of tameness and commonplace, to declare himself the slave of her will, which the next was compelled to cap by some still stronger declaration; and so expressions of devotion went on rising one above the other like biddings at an auction, and a conventional language of gallantry and theory of love came into being that in time permeated the literature of Southern Europe, and bore fruit, in one direction in the transcendental worship of Beatrice and Laura, and in another in the grotesque idolatry which found exponents in writers like Feliciano de Silva."], "In the manuscript that the priest reads at the inn, what does Anselmo test Camilla for?": [" That night, however, he thought of a plan by which he might deceive Anselmo without any injury to Camilla.

Anselmo was deep in love with a high-born and beautiful maiden of the same city, the daughter of parents so estimable, and so estimable herself, that he resolved, with the approval of his friend Lothario, without whom he did nothing, to ask her of them in marriage, and did so, Lothario being the bearer of the demand, and conducting the negotiation so much to the satisfaction of his friend that in a short time he was in possession of the object of his desires, and Camilla so happy in having won Anselmo for her husband, that she gave thanks unceasingly to heaven and to Lothario, by whose means such good fortune had fallen to her."], "When Ferdinand and Dorothea reunite, and Cardenio and Lucinda reunite, who alone weeps for grief rather than joy?": [" In theirs the listeners felt as much pity as wonder at her misfortunes; but as the curate was just about to offer her some consolation and advice Cardenio forestalled him, saying, \u201cSo then, se\u00f1ora, you are the fair Dorothea, the only daughter of the rich Clenardo?\u201d Dorothea was astonished at hearing her father\u2019s name, and at the miserable appearance of him who mentioned it, for it has been already said how wretchedly clad Cardenio was; so she said to him: \u201cAnd who may you be, brother, who seem to know my father\u2019s name so well? For so far, if I remember rightly, I have not mentioned it in the whole story of my misfortunes.\u201d \u201cI am that unhappy being, se\u00f1ora,\u201d replied Cardenio, \u201cwhom, as you have said, Luscinda declared to be her husband; I am the unfortunate Cardenio, whom the wrong-doing of him who has brought you to your present condition has reduced to the state you see me in, bare, ragged, bereft of all human comfort, and what is worse, of reason, for I only possess it when Heaven is pleased for some short space to restore it to me.", " Even Sancho Panza was weeping; though afterwards he said he only wept because he saw that Dorothea was not as he fancied the queen Micomicona, of whom he expected such great favours. Their wonder as well as their weeping lasted some time, and then Cardenio and Luscinda went and fell on their knees before Don Fernando, returning him thanks for the favour he had rendered them in language so grateful that he knew not how to answer them, and raising them up embraced them with every mark of affection and courtesy. He then asked Dorothea how she had managed to reach a place so far removed from her own home, and she in a few fitting words told all that she had previously related to Cardenio, with which Don Fernando and his companions were so delighted that they wished the story had been longer; so charmingly did Dorothea describe her misadventures. When she had finished Don Fernando recounted what had befallen him in the city after he had found in Luscinda\u2019s bosom the paper in which she declared that she was Cardenio\u2019s wife, and never could be his.", " The instant she recognised him, with a prolonged plaintive cry drawn from the depths of her heart, she fell backwards fainting, and but for the barber being close by to catch her in his arms, she would have fallen completely to the ground. The curate at once hastened to uncover her face and throw water on it, and as he did so Don Fernando, for he it was who held the other in his arms, recognised her and stood as if death-stricken by the sight; not, however, relaxing his grasp of Luscinda, for it was she that was struggling to release herself from his hold, having recognised Cardenio by his voice, as he had recognised her. Cardenio also heard Dorothea\u2019s cry as she fell fainting, and imagining that it came from his Luscinda burst forth in terror from the room, and the first thing he saw was Don Fernando with Luscinda in his arms. Don Fernando, too, knew Cardenio at once; and all three, Luscinda, Cardenio, and Dorothea, stood in silent amazement scarcely knowing what had happened to them.", " And as we have this consolation springing from no very visionary hope or wild fancy, I entreat you, se\u00f1ora, to form new resolutions in your better mind, as I mean to do in mine, preparing yourself to look forward to happier fortunes; for I swear to you by the faith of a gentleman and a Christian not to desert you until I see you in possession of Don Fernando, and if I cannot by words induce him to recognise his obligation to you, in that case to avail myself of the right which my rank as a gentleman gives me, and with just cause challenge him on account of the injury he has done you, not regarding my own wrongs, which I shall leave to Heaven to avenge, while I on earth devote myself to yours.\u201d Cardenio\u2019s words completed the astonishment of Dorothea, and not knowing how to return thanks for such an offer, she attempted to kiss his feet; but Cardenio would not permit it, and the licentiate replied for both, commended the sound reasoning of Cardenio, and lastly, begged, advised, and urged them to come with him to his village, where they might furnish themselves with what they needed, and take measures to discover Don Fernando, or restore Dorothea to her parents, or do what seemed to them most advisable."], "Upon the arrival of Zoraida and the captive, what lecture does Don Quixote give to the rest of the inn?": [" She took up the conversation, and in that mixture of tongues I have spoken of she asked me if I was a gentleman, and why I was not ransomed. I answered that I was already ransomed, and that by the price it might be seen what value my master set on me, as they had given one thousand five hundred zoltanis for me; to which she replied, \u201cHadst thou been my father\u2019s, I can tell thee, I would not have let him part with thee for twice as much, for you Christians always tell lies about yourselves and make yourselves out poor to cheat the Moors.\u201d \u201cThat may be, lady,\u201d said I; \u201cbut indeed I dealt truthfully with my master, as I do and mean to do with everybody in the world.\u201d \u201cAnd when dost thou go?\u201d said Zoraida. \u201cTo-morrow, I think,\u201d said I, \u201cfor there is a vessel here from France which sails to-morrow, and I think I shall go in her.\u201d \u201cWould it not be better,\u201d said Zoraida, \u201cto wait for the arrival of ships from Spain and go with them and not with the French who are not your friends?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said I; \u201cthough if there were intelligence that a vessel were now coming from Spain it is true I might, perhaps, wait for it; however, it is more likely I shall depart to-morrow, for the longing I feel to return to my country and to those I love is so great that it will not allow me to wait for another opportunity, however more convenient, if it be delayed.\u201d \u201cNo doubt thou art married in thine own country,\u201d said Zoraida, \u201cand for that reason thou art anxious to go and see thy wife.\u201d \u201cI am not married,\u201d I replied, \u201cbut I have given my promise to marry on my arrival there.\u201d \u201cAnd is the lady beautiful to whom thou hast given it?\u201d said Zoraida.", " The curate told him he was quite right in all he had said in favour of arms, and that he himself, though a man of letters and a graduate, was of the same opinion. They finished their supper, the cloth was removed, and while the hostess, her daughter, and Maritornes were getting Don Quixote of La Mancha\u2019s garret ready, in which it was arranged that the women were to be quartered by themselves for the night, Don Fernando begged the captive to tell them the story of his life, for it could not fail to be strange and interesting, to judge by the hints he had let fall on his arrival in company with Zoraida. To this the captive replied that he would very willingly yield to his request, only he feared his tale would not give them as much pleasure as he wished; nevertheless, not to be wanting in compliance, he would tell it. The curate and the others thanked him and added their entreaties, and he finding himself so pressed said there was no occasion ask, where a command had such weight, and added, \u201cIf your worships will give me your attention you will hear a true story which, perhaps, fictitious ones constructed with ingenious and studied art cannot come up to.\u201d These words made them settle themselves in their places and preserve a deep silence, and he seeing them waiting on his words in mute expectation, began thus in a pleasant quiet voice.", " To which the renegade, without waiting for Zoraida to reply, made answer, \u201cDo not trouble thyself by asking thy daughter Zoraida so many questions, se\u00f1or, for the one answer I will give thee will serve for all; I would have thee know that she is a Christian, and that it is she who has been the file for our chains and our deliverer from captivity. She is here of her own free will, as glad, I imagine, to find herself in this position as he who escapes from darkness into the light, from death to life, and from suffering to glory.\u201d \u201cDaughter, is this true, what he says?\u201d cried the Moor. \u201cIt is,\u201d replied Zoraida. \u201cThat thou art in truth a Christian,\u201d said the old man, \u201cand that thou hast given thy father into the power of his enemies?\u201d To which Zoraida made answer, \u201cA Christian I am, but it is not I who have placed thee in this position, for it never was my wish to leave thee or do thee harm, but only to do good to myself.\u201d \u201cAnd what good hast thou done thyself, daughter?\u201d said he.", " Dorothea took the Moorish lady by the hand and leading her to a seat beside herself, requested her to remove her veil. She looked at the captive as if to ask him what they meant and what she was to do. He said to her in Arabic that they asked her to take off her veil, and thereupon she removed it and disclosed a countenance so lovely, that to Dorothea she seemed more beautiful than Luscinda, and to Luscinda more beautiful than Dorothea, and all the bystanders felt that if any beauty could compare with theirs it was the Moorish lady\u2019s, and there were even those who were inclined to give it somewhat the preference. And as it is the privilege and charm of beauty to win the heart and secure good-will, all forthwith became eager to show kindness and attention to the lovely Moor. Don Fernando asked the captive what her name was, and he replied that it was Lela Zoraida; but the instant she heard him, she guessed what the Christian had asked, and said hastily, with some displeasure and energy, \u201cNo, not Zoraida; Maria, Maria!\u201d giving them to understand that she was called \u201cMaria\u201d and not \u201cZoraida.\u201d These words, and the touching earnestness with which she uttered them, drew more than one tear from some of the listeners, particularly the women, who are by nature tender-hearted and compassionate."], "What career did the captive\u2019s father order him to pursue?": [" Nor is it to be supposed from this that they are to omit commending themselves to God, for there will be time and opportunity for doing so while they are engaged in their task.\u201d \u201cFor all that,\u201d answered the traveller, \u201cI feel some doubt still, because often I have read how words will arise between two knights-errant, and from one thing to another it comes about that their anger kindles and they wheel their horses round and take a good stretch of field, and then without any more ado at the top of their speed they come to the charge, and in mid-career they are wont to commend themselves to their ladies; and what commonly comes of the encounter is that one falls over the haunches of his horse pierced through and through by his antagonist\u2019s lance, and as for the other, it is only by holding on to the mane of his horse that he can help falling to the ground; but I know not how the dead man had time to commend himself to God in the course of such rapid work as this; it would have been better if those words which he spent in commending himself to his lady in the midst of his career had been devoted to his duty and obligation as a Christian.", " That brave captain that you speak of is my eldest brother, who, being of a bolder and loftier mind than my other brother or myself, chose the honourable and worthy calling of arms, which was one of the three careers our father proposed to us, as your comrade mentioned in that fable you thought he was telling you. I followed that of letters, in which God and my own exertions have raised me to the position in which you see me. My second brother is in Peru, so wealthy that with what he has sent to my father and to me he has fully repaid the portion he took with him, and has even furnished my father\u2019s hands with the means of gratifying his natural generosity, while I too have been enabled to pursue my studies in a more becoming and creditable fashion, and so to attain my present standing. My father is still alive, though dying with anxiety to hear of his eldest son, and he prays God unceasingly that death may not close his eyes until he has looked upon those of his son; but with regard to him what surprises me is, that having so much common sense as he had, he should have neglected to give any intelligence about himself, either in his troubles and sufferings, or in his prosperity, for if his father or any of us had known of his condition he need not have waited for that miracle of the reed to obtain his ransom; but what now disquiets me is the uncertainty whether those Frenchmen may have restored him to liberty, or murdered him to hide the robbery.", " The instant the captive mentioned the name of Don Pedro de Aguilar, Don Fernando looked at his companions and they all three smiled; and when he came to speak of the sonnets one of them said, \u201cBefore your worship proceeds any further I entreat you to tell me what became of that Don Pedro de Aguilar you have spoken of.\u201d \u201cAll I know is,\u201d replied the captive, \u201cthat after having been in Constantinople two years, he escaped in the disguise of an Arnaut, in company with a Greek spy; but whether he regained his liberty or not I cannot tell, though I fancy he did, because a year afterwards I saw the Greek at Constantinople, though I was unable to ask him what the result of the journey was.\u201d \u201cWell then, you are right,\u201d returned the gentleman, \u201cfor that Don Pedro is my brother, and he is now in our village in good health, rich, married, and with three children.\u201d \u201cThanks be to God for all the mercies he has shown him,\u201d said the captive; \u201cfor to my mind there is no happiness on earth to compare with recovering lost liberty.\u201d \u201cAnd what is more,\u201d said the gentleman, \u201cI know the sonnets my brother made.\u201d \u201cThen let your worship repeat them,\u201d said the captive, \u201cfor you will recite them better than I can.\u201d \u201cWith all my heart,\u201d said the gentleman; \u201cthat on the Goletta runs thus.\u201d c39e.jpg (38K) CHAPTER XL.", " It was barely two hours after night set in when we were all on board the vessel, where the cords were removed from the hands of Zoraida\u2019s father, and the napkin from his mouth; but the renegade once more told him not to utter a word, or they would take his life. He, when he saw his daughter there, began to sigh piteously, and still more when he perceived that I held her closely embraced and that she lay quiet without resisting or complaining, or showing any reluctance; nevertheless he remained silent lest they should carry into effect the repeated threats the renegade had addressed to him. Finding herself now on board, and that we were about to give way with the oars, Zoraida, seeing her father there, and the other Moors bound, bade the renegade ask me to do her the favour of releasing the Moors and setting her father at liberty, for she would rather drown herself in the sea than suffer a father that had loved her so dearly to be carried away captive before her eyes and on her account."], "Where was the captive when Zoraida fell in love with him?": [" Dorothea took the Moorish lady by the hand and leading her to a seat beside herself, requested her to remove her veil.

We remained six days in Velez, at the end of which the renegade, having informed himself of all that was requisite for him to do, set out for the city of Granada to restore himself to the sacred bosom of the Church through the medium of the Holy Inquisition. The other released captives took their departures, each the way that seemed best to him, and Zoraida and I were left alone, with nothing more than the crowns which the courtesy of the Frenchman had bestowed upon Zoraida, out of which I bought the beast on which she rides; and, I for the present attending her as her father and squire and not as her husband, we are now going to ascertain if my father is living, or if any of my brothers has had better fortune than mine has been; though, as Heaven has made me the companion of Zoraida, I think no other lot could be assigned to me, however happy, that I would rather have.", " She took up the conversation, and in that mixture of tongues I have spoken of she asked me if I was a gentleman, and why I was not ransomed.

The servant replied that he was called the Licentiate Juan Perez de Viedma, and that he had heard it said he came from a village in the mountains of Leon. From this statement, and what he himself had seen, he felt convinced that this was his brother who had adopted letters by his father\u2019s advice; and excited and rejoiced, he called Don Fernando and Cardenio and the curate aside, and told them how the matter stood, assuring them that the judge was his brother. The servant had further informed him that he was now going to the Indies with the appointment of Judge of the Supreme Court of Mexico; and he had learned, likewise, that the young lady was his daughter, whose mother had died in giving birth to her, and that he was very rich in consequence of the dowry left to him with the daughter.", " In the middle of supper the curate said: \u201cI had a comrade of your worship\u2019s name, Se\u00f1or Judge, in Constantinople, where I was a captive for several years, and that same comrade was one of the stoutest soldiers and captains in the whole Spanish infantry; but he had as large a share of misfortune as he had of gallantry and courage.\u201d \u201cAnd how was the captain called, se\u00f1or?\u201d asked the Judge. \u201cHe was called Ruy Perez de Viedma,\u201d replied the curate, \u201cand he was born in a village in the mountains of Leon; and he mentioned a circumstance connected with his father and his brothers which, had it not been told me by so truthful a man as he was, I should have set down as one of those fables the old women tell over the fire in winter; for he said his father had divided his property among his three sons and had addressed words of advice to them sounder than any of Cato\u2019s. But I can say this much, that the choice he made of going to the wars was attended with such success, that by his gallant conduct and courage, and without any help save his own merit, he rose in a few years to be captain of infantry, and to see himself on the high-road and in position to be given the command of a corps before long; but Fortune was against him, for where he might have expected her favour he lost it, and with it his liberty, on that glorious day when so many recovered theirs, at the battle of Lepanto.", " It happened, however, that a little before the approach of dawn a voice so musical and sweet reached the ears of the ladies that it forced them all to listen attentively, but especially Dorothea, who had been awake, and by whose side Do\u00f1a Clara de Viedma, for so the Judge\u2019s daughter was called, lay sleeping. No one could imagine who it was that sang so sweetly, and the voice was unaccompanied by any instrument. At one moment it seemed to them as if the singer were in the courtyard, at another in the stable; and as they were all attention, wondering, Cardenio came to the door and said, \u201cListen, whoever is not asleep, and you will hear a muleteer\u2019s voice that enchants as it chants.\u201d \u201cWe are listening to it already, se\u00f1or,\u201d said Dorothea; on which Cardenio went away; and Dorothea, giving all her attention to it, made out the words of the song to be these: c42e.jpg (11K) CHAPTER XLIII.

The landlord replied that there were so many people in the inn he had not noticed the person they were inquiring for; but one of them observing the coach in which the Judge had come, said, \u201cHe is here no doubt, for this is the coach he is following: let one of us stay at the gate, and the rest go in to look for him; or indeed it would be as well if one of us went round the inn, lest he should escape over the wall of the yard.\u201d \u201cSo be it,\u201d said another; and while two of them went in, one remained at the gate and the other made the circuit of the inn; observing all which, the landlord was unable to conjecture for what reason they were taking all these precautions, though he understood they were looking for the youth whose description they had given him."], "How does Don Quixote respond when a member of the Holy Brotherhood presents him with a warrant for his arrest?": [" Suspecting how it was, then, he wished to satisfy himself as to whether Don Quixote\u2019s features corresponded; and taking a parchment out of his bosom he lit upon what he was in search of, and setting himself to read it deliberately, for he was not a quick reader, as he made out each word he fixed his eyes on Don Quixote, and went on comparing the description in the warrant with his face, and discovered that beyond all doubt he was the person described in it. As soon as he had satisfied himself, folding up the parchment, he took the warrant in his left hand and with his right seized Don Quixote by the collar so tightly that he did not allow him to breathe, and shouted aloud, \u201cHelp for the Holy Brotherhood! and that you may see I demand it in earnest, read this warrant which says this highwayman is to be arrested.\u201d The curate took the warrant and saw that what the officer said was true, and that it agreed with Don Quixote\u2019s appearance, who, on his part, when he found himself roughly handled by this rascally clown, worked up to the highest pitch of wrath, and all his joints cracking with rage, with both hands seized the officer by the throat with all his might, so that had he not been helped by his comrades he would have yielded up his life ere Don Quixote released his hold.", " Sancho followed him at his ass\u2019s best trot, but Rocinante stepped out so that, seeing himself left behind, he was forced to call to his master to wait for him. Don Quixote did so, reining in Rocinante until his weary squire came up, who on reaching him said, \u201cIt seems to me, se\u00f1or, it would be prudent in us to go and take refuge in some church, for, seeing how mauled he with whom you fought has been left, it will be no wonder if they give information of the affair to the Holy Brotherhood and arrest us, and, faith, if they do, before we come out of gaol we shall have to sweat for it.\u201d \u201cPeace,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cwhere hast thou ever seen or heard that a knight-errant has been arraigned before a court of justice, however many homicides he may have committed?\u201d \u201cI know nothing about omecils,\u201d answered Sancho, \u201cnor in my life have had anything to do with one; I only know that the Holy Brotherhood looks after those who fight in the fields, and in that other matter I do not meddle.\u201d \u201cThen thou needst have no uneasiness, my friend,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cfor I will deliver thee out of the hands of the Chaldeans, much more out of those of the Brotherhood.", " Don Quixote smiled when he heard these words, and said very calmly, \u201cCome now, base, ill-born brood; call ye it highway robbery to give freedom to those in bondage, to release the captives, to succour the miserable, to raise up the fallen, to relieve the needy? Infamous beings, who by your vile grovelling intellects deserve that heaven should not make known to you the virtue that lies in knight-errantry, or show you the sin and ignorance in which ye lie when ye refuse to respect the shadow, not to say the presence, of any knight-errant! Come now; band, not of officers, but of thieves; footpads with the licence of the Holy Brotherhood; tell me who was the ignoramus who signed a warrant of arrest against such a knight as I am? Who was he that did not know that knights-errant are independent of all jurisdictions, that their law is their sword, their charter their prowess, and their edicts their will?", " Who, I say again, was the fool that knows not that there are no letters patent of nobility that confer such privileges or exemptions as a knight-errant acquires the day he is dubbed a knight, and devotes himself to the arduous calling of chivalry? What knight-errant ever paid poll-tax, duty, queen\u2019s pin-money, king\u2019s dues, toll or ferry? What tailor ever took payment of him for making his clothes? What castellan that received him in his castle ever made him pay his shot? What king did not seat him at his table? What damsel was not enamoured of him and did not yield herself up wholly to his will and pleasure? And, lastly, what knight-errant has there been, is there, or will there ever be in the world, not bold enough to give, single-handed, four hundred cudgellings to four hundred officers of the Holy Brotherhood if they come in his way?\u201d CHAPTER XLVI. OF THE END OF THE NOTABLE ADVENTURE OF THE OFFICERS OF THE HOLY BROTHERHOOD; AND OF THE GREAT FEROCITY OF OUR WORTHY KNIGHT, DON QUIXOTE c46a.jpg (163K) Full Size While Don Quixote was talking in this strain, the curate was endeavouring to persuade the officers that he was out of his senses, as they might perceive by his deeds and his words, and that they need not press the matter any further, for even if they arrested him and carried him off, they would have to release him by-and-by as a madman; to which the holder of the warrant replied that he had nothing to do with inquiring into Don Quixote\u2019s madness, but only to execute his superior\u2019s orders, and that once taken they might let him go three hundred times if they liked."], "How do the priest and the barber go about bringing Don Quixote home without the help of Dorothea and Ferdinand?": [" The licentiate in reply told him not to be uneasy, for they would fetch him away in spite of himself. He then told Cardenio and Dorothea what they had proposed to do to cure Don Quixote, or at any rate take him home; upon which Dorothea said that she could play the distressed damsel better than the barber; especially as she had there the dress in which to do it to the life, and that they might trust to her acting the part in every particular requisite for carrying out their scheme, for she had read a great many books of chivalry, and knew exactly the style in which afflicted damsels begged boons of knights-errant. \u201cIn that case,\u201d said the curate, \u201cthere is nothing more required than to set about it at once, for beyond a doubt fortune is declaring itself in our favour, since it has so unexpectedly begun to open a door for your relief, and smoothed the way for us to our object.\u201d Dorothea then took out of her pillow-case a complete petticoat of some rich stuff, and a green mantle of some other fine material, and a necklace and other ornaments out of a little box, and with these in an instant she so arrayed herself that she looked like a great and rich lady.", " It only concerns them to aid them as persons in need of help, having regard to their sufferings and not to their rascalities. I encountered a chaplet or string of miserable and unfortunate people, and did for them what my sense of duty demands of me, and as for the rest be that as it may; and whoever takes objection to it, saving the sacred dignity of the se\u00f1or licentiate and his honoured person, I say he knows little about chivalry and lies like a whoreson villain, and this I will give him to know to the fullest extent with my sword;\u201d and so saying he settled himself in his stirrups and pressed down his morion; for the barber\u2019s basin, which according to him was Mambrino\u2019s helmet, he carried hanging at the saddle-bow until he could repair the damage done to it by the galley slaves. Dorothea, who was shrewd and sprightly, and by this time thoroughly understood Don Quixote\u2019s crazy turn, and that all except Sancho Panza were making game of him, not to be behind the rest said to him, on observing his irritation, \u201cSir Knight, remember the boon you have promised me, and that in accordance with it you must not engage in any other adventure, be it ever so pressing; calm yourself, for if the licentiate had known that the galley slaves had been set free by that unconquered arm he would have stopped his mouth thrice over, or even bitten his tongue three times before he would have said a word that tended towards disrespect of your worship.\u201d \u201cThat I swear heartily,\u201d said the curate, \u201cand I would have even plucked off a moustache.\u201d \u201cI will hold my peace, se\u00f1ora,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand I will curb the natural anger that had arisen in my breast, and will proceed in peace and quietness until I have fulfilled my promise; but in return for this consideration I entreat you to tell me, if you have no objection to do so, what is the nature of your trouble, and how many, who, and what are the persons of whom I am to require due satisfaction, and on whom I am to take vengeance on your behalf?\u201d \u201cThat I will do with all my heart,\u201d replied Dorothea, \u201cif it will not be wearisome to you to hear of miseries and misfortunes.\u201d \u201cIt will not be wearisome, se\u00f1ora,\u201d said Don Quixote; to which Dorothea replied, \u201cWell, if that be so, give me your attention.\u201d As soon as she said this, Cardenio and the barber drew close to her side, eager to hear what sort of story the quick-witted Dorothea would invent for herself; and Sancho did the same, for he was as much taken in by her as his master; and she having settled herself comfortably in the saddle, and with the help of coughing and other preliminaries taken time to think, began with great sprightliness of manner in this fashion.", " He described to them also nearly all the adventures that Sancho had mentioned, at which they marvelled and laughed not a little, thinking it, as all did, the strangest form of madness a crazy intellect could be capable of. But now, the curate said, that the lady Dorothea\u2019s good fortune prevented her from proceeding with their purpose, it would be necessary to devise or discover some other way of getting him home. Cardenio proposed to carry out the scheme they had begun, and suggested that Luscinda would act and support Dorothea\u2019s part sufficiently well. \u201cNo,\u201d said Don Fernando, \u201cthat must not be, for I want Dorothea to follow out this idea of hers; and if the worthy gentleman\u2019s village is not very far off, I shall be happy if I can do anything for his relief.\u201d \u201cIt is not more than two days\u2019 journey from this,\u201d said the curate. \u201cEven if it were more,\u201d said Don Fernando, \u201cI would gladly travel so far for the sake of doing so good a work.\u201d At this moment Don Quixote came out in full panoply, with Mambrino\u2019s helmet, all dinted as it was, on his head, his buckler on his arm, and leaning on his staff or pike.", " IN WHICH THE DOUBTFUL QUESTION OF MAMBRINO\u2019S HELMET AND THE PACK-SADDLE IS FINALLY SETTLED, WITH OTHER ADVENTURES THAT OCCURRED IN TRUTH AND EARNEST c45a.jpg (154K) Full Size \u201cWhat do you think now, gentlemen,\u201d said the barber, \u201cof what these gentles say, when they want to make out that this is a helmet?\u201d \u201cAnd whoever says the contrary,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cI will let him know he lies if he is a knight, and if he is a squire that he lies again a thousand times.\u201d Our own barber, who was present at all this, and understood Don Quixote\u2019s humour so thoroughly, took it into his head to back up his delusion and carry on the joke for the general amusement;

Sancho entered, and the curate and the barber took their leave of Don Quixote, of whose recovery they despaired when they saw how wedded he was to his crazy ideas, and how saturated with the nonsense of his unlucky chivalry; and said the curate to the barber, \u201cYou will see, gossip, that when we are least thinking of it, our gentleman will be off once more for another flight.\u201d \u201cI have no doubt of it,\u201d returned the barber; \u201cbut I do not wonder so much at the madness of the knight as at the simplicity of the squire, who has such a firm belief in all that about the island, that I suppose all the exposures that could be imagined would not get it out of his head.\u201d \u201cGod help them,\u201d said the curate; \u201cand let us be on the look-out to see what comes of all these absurdities of the knight and squire, for it seems as if they had both been cast in the same mould, and the madness of the master without the simplicity of the man would not be worth a farthing.\u201d \u201cThat is true,\u201d said the barber, \u201cand I should like very much to know what the pair are talking about at this moment.\u201d \u201cI promise you,\u201d said the curate, \u201cthe niece or the housekeeper will tell us by-and-by, for they are not the ones to forget to listen.\u201d Meanwhile Don Quixote shut himself up in his room with Sancho, and when they were alone he said to him, \u201cIt grieves me greatly, Sancho, that thou shouldst have said, and sayest, that I took thee out of thy cottage, when thou knowest I did not remain in my house.", " \u201cI will tell you,\u201d answered Sancho. \u201cYears ago I was for a month at the capital and there I saw taking the air a very small gentleman who they said was a very great man, and a man following him on horseback in every turn he took, just as if he was his tail. I asked why this man did not join the other man, instead of always going behind him; they answered me that he was his equerry, and that it was the custom with nobles to have such persons behind them, and ever since then I know it, for I have never forgotten it.\u201d \u201cThou art right,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand in the same way thou mayest carry thy barber with thee, for customs did not come into use all together, nor were they all invented at once, and thou mayest be the first count to have a barber to follow him; and, indeed, shaving one\u2019s beard is a greater trust than saddling one\u2019s horse.\u201d \u201cLet the barber business be my look-out,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cand your worship\u2019s be it to strive to become a king, and make me a count.\u201d \u201cSo it shall be,\u201d answered Don Quixote, and raising his eyes he saw what will be told in the following chapter.", " Dost thou not know, thou miserable little licentiate, that I can do it, being, as I say, Jupiter the Thunderer, who hold in my hands the fiery bolts with which I am able and am wont to threaten and lay waste the world? But in one way only will I punish this ignorant town, and that is by not raining upon it, nor on any part of its district or territory, for three whole years, to be reckoned from the day and moment when this threat is pronounced. Thou free, thou cured, thou in thy senses! and I mad, I disordered, I bound! I will as soon think of sending rain as of hanging myself. \u201cThose present stood listening to the words and exclamations of the madman; but our licentiate, turning to the chaplain and seizing him by the hands, said to him, \u2018Be not uneasy, se\u00f1or; attach no importance to what this madman has said; for if he is Jupiter and will not send rain, I, who am Neptune, the father and god of the waters, will rain as often as it pleases me and may be needful.\u2019 \u201cThe governor and the bystanders laughed, and at their laughter the chaplain was half ashamed, and he replied, \u2018For all that, Se\u00f1or Neptune, it will not do to vex Se\u00f1or Jupiter; remain where you are, and some other day, when there is a better opportunity and more time, we will come back for you.\u2019 So they stripped the licentiate, and he was left where he was; and that\u2019s the end of the story.\u201d \u201cSo that\u2019s the story, master barber,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cwhich came in so pat to the purpose that you could not help telling it?"], "According to the canon, who should take responsibility for improving Spanish theatre?": [" IN WHICH THE CANON PURSUES THE SUBJECT OF THE BOOKS OF CHIVALRY, WITH OTHER MATTERS WORTHY OF HIS WIT c48a.jpg (80K) Full Size \u201cIt is as you say, se\u00f1or canon,\u201d said the curate; \u201cand for that reason those who have hitherto written books of the sort deserve all the more censure for writing without paying any attention to good taste or the rules of art, by which they might guide themselves and become as famous in prose as the two princes of Greek and Latin poetry are in verse.\u201d \u201cI myself, at any rate,\u201d said the canon, \u201cwas once tempted to write a book of chivalry in which all the points I have mentioned were to be observed; and if I must own the truth I have more than a hundred sheets written; and to try if it came up to my own opinion of it, I showed them to persons who were fond of this kind of reading, to learned and intelligent men as well as to ignorant people who cared for nothing but the pleasure of listening to nonsense, and from all I obtained flattering approval; nevertheless I proceeded no farther with it, as well because it seemed to me an occupation inconsistent with my profession, as because I perceived that the fools are more numerous than the wise; and, though it is better to be praised by the wise few than applauded by the foolish many, I have no mind to submit myself to the stupid judgment of the silly public, to whom the reading of such books falls for the most part.", " Here, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote, will be reading worthy of your sound understanding; from which you will rise learned in history, in love with virtue, strengthened in goodness, improved in manners, brave without rashness, prudent without cowardice; and all to the honour of God, your own advantage and the glory of La Mancha, whence, I am informed, your worship derives your birth.\u201d Don Quixote listened with the greatest attention to the canon\u2019s words, and when he found he had finished, after regarding him for some time, he replied to him: \u201cIt appears to me, gentle sir, that your worship\u2019s discourse is intended to persuade me that there never were any knights-errant in the world, and that all the books of chivalry are false, lying, mischievous and useless to the State, and that I have done wrong in reading them, and worse in believing them, and still worse in imitating them, when I undertook to follow the arduous calling of knight-errantry which they set forth; for you deny that there ever were Amadises of Gaul or of Greece, or any other of the knights of whom the books are full.\u201d \u201cIt is all exactly as you state it,\u201d said the canon; to which Don Quixote returned, \u201cYou also went on to say that books of this kind had done me much harm, inasmuch as they had upset my senses, and shut me up in a cage, and that it would be better for me to reform and change my studies, and read other truer books which would afford more pleasure and instruction.\u201d \u201cJust so,\u201d said the canon.", " You silly, stupid applicant, don\u2019t be in a hurry; wait for the proper time and season for doing business; don\u2019t come at dinner-hour, or at bed-time; for judges are only flesh and blood, and must give to Nature what she naturally demands of them; all except myself, for in my case I give her nothing to eat, thanks to Se\u00f1or Doctor Pedro Recio Tirteafuera here, who would have me die of hunger, and declares that death to be life; and the same sort of life may God give him and all his kind\u2014I mean the bad doctors; for the good ones deserve palms and laurels.\u201d All who knew Sancho Panza were astonished to hear him speak so elegantly, and did not know what to attribute it to unless it were that office and grave responsibility either smarten or stupefy men\u2019s wits. At last Doctor Pedro Recio Agilers of Tirteafuera promised to let him have supper that night though it might be in contravention of all the aphorisms of Hippocrates.", " The canon agreed, and going on ahead with his servants, listened with attention to the account of the character, life, madness, and ways of Don Quixote, given him by the curate, who described to him briefly the beginning and origin of his craze, and told him the whole story of his adventures up to his being confined in the cage, together with the plan they had of taking him home to try if by any means they could discover a cure for his madness. The canon and his servants were surprised anew when they heard Don Quixote\u2019s strange story, and when it was finished he said, \u201cTo tell the truth, se\u00f1or curate, I for my part consider what they call books of chivalry to be mischievous to the State; and though, led by idle and false taste, I have read the beginnings of almost all that have been printed, I never could manage to read any one of them from beginning to end; for it seems to me they are all more or less the same thing; and one has nothing more in it than another; this no more than that."], "What special ability does the goatherd Eugenio claim to possess?": [" They all offered their services to Eugenio but he who showed himself most liberal in this way was Don Quixote, who said to him, \u201cMost assuredly, brother goatherd, if I found myself in a position to attempt any adventure, I would, this very instant, set out on your behalf, and would rescue Leandra from that convent (where no doubt she is kept against her will), in spite of the abbess and all who might try to prevent me, and would place her in your hands to deal with her according to your will and pleasure, observing, however, the laws of chivalry which lay down that no violence of any kind is to be offered to any damsel. But I trust in God our Lord that the might of one malignant enchanter may not prove so great but that the power of another better disposed may prove superior to it, and then I promise you my support and assistance, as I am bound to do by my profession, which is none other than to give aid to the weak and needy.\u201d The goatherd eyed him, and noticing Don Quixote\u2019s sorry appearance and looks, he was filled with wonder, and asked the barber, who was next him, \u201cSe\u00f1or, who is this man who makes such a figure and talks in such a strain?\u201d \u201cWho should it be,\u201d said the barber, \u201cbut the famous Don Quixote of La Mancha, the undoer of injustice, the righter of wrongs, the protector of damsels, the terror of giants, and the winner of battles?\u201d \u201cThat,\u201d said the goatherd, \u201csounds like what one reads in the books of the knights-errant, who did all that you say this man does; though it is my belief that either you are joking, or else this gentleman has empty lodgings in his head.\u201d \u201cYou are a great scoundrel,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand it is you who are empty and a fool.", " Sancho Panza, seeing his master treated in this fashion, attacked the madman with his closed fist; but the Ragged One received him in such a way that with a blow of his fist he stretched him at his feet, and then mounting upon him crushed his ribs to his own satisfaction; the goatherd, who came to the rescue, shared the same fate; and having beaten and pummelled them all he left them and quietly withdrew to his hiding-place on the mountain. Sancho rose, and with the rage he felt at finding himself so belaboured without deserving it, ran to take vengeance on the goatherd, accusing him of not giving them warning that this man was at times taken with a mad fit, for if they had known it they would have been on their guard to protect themselves. The goatherd replied that he had said so, and that if he had not heard him, that was no fault of his. Sancho retorted, and the goatherd rejoined, and the altercation ended in their seizing each other by the beard, and exchanging such fisticuffs that if Don Quixote had not made peace between them, they would have knocked one another to pieces.", " \u201cLeave me alone, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance,\u201d said Sancho, grappling with the goatherd, \u201cfor of this fellow, who is a clown like myself, and no dubbed knight, I can safely take satisfaction for the affront he has offered me, fighting with him hand to hand like an honest man.\u201d \u201cThat is true,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cbut I know that he is not to blame for what has happened.\u201d With this he pacified them, and again asked the goatherd if it would be possible to find Cardenio, as he felt the greatest anxiety to know the end of his story. The goatherd told him, as he had told him before, that there was no knowing of a certainty where his lair was; but that if he wandered about much in that neighbourhood he could not fail to fall in with him either in or out of his senses. c24e.jpg (69K) Full Size CHAPTER XXV.

I am a clown, but not so much of one but that I know how to behave to men and to beasts.\u201d \u201cThat I can well believe,\u201d said the curate, \u201cfor I know already by experience that the woods breed men of learning, and shepherds\u2019 huts harbour philosophers.\u201d \u201cAt all events, se\u00f1or,\u201d returned the goatherd, \u201cthey shelter men of experience; and that you may see the truth of this and grasp it, though I may seem to put myself forward without being asked, I will, if it will not tire you, gentlemen, and you will give me your attention for a little, tell you a true story which will confirm this gentleman\u2019s word (and he pointed to the curate) as well as my own.\u201d To this Don Quixote replied, \u201cSeeing that this affair has a certain colour of chivalry about it, I for my part, brother, will hear you most gladly, and so will all these gentlemen, from the high intelligence they possess and their love of curious novelties that interest, charm, and entertain the mind, as I feel quite sure your story will do."], "What does Don Quixote overhear that moves him to return home willingly?": [" Sancho shrugged his shoulders, obeyed, and sat down, and all the duchess\u2019s damsels and duennas gathered round him, waiting in profound silence to hear what he would say. It was the duchess, however, who spoke first, saying: \u201cNow that we are alone, and that there is nobody here to overhear us, I should be glad if the se\u00f1or governor would relieve me of certain doubts I have, rising out of the history of the great Don Quixote that is now in print. One is: inasmuch as worthy Sancho never saw Dulcinea, I mean the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, nor took Don Quixote\u2019s letter to her, for it was left in the memorandum book in the Sierra Morena, how did he dare to invent the answer and all that about finding her sifting wheat, the whole story being a deception and falsehood, and so much to the prejudice of the peerless Dulcinea\u2019s good name, a thing that is not at all becoming the character and fidelity of a good squire?\u201d p33b.jpg (326K) Full Size At these words, Sancho, without uttering one in reply, got up from his chair, and with noiseless steps, with his body bent and his finger on his lips, went all round the room lifting up the hangings; and this done, he came back to his seat and said, \u201cNow, se\u00f1ora, that I have seen that there is no one except the bystanders listening to us on the sly, I will answer what you have asked me, and all you may ask me, without fear or dread.", " It so happened that finding herself on one occasion alone with her maid, Camilla said to her, \u201cI am ashamed to think, my dear Leonela, how lightly I have valued myself that I did not compel Lothario to purchase by at least some expenditure of time that full possession of me that I so quickly yielded him of my own free will. I fear that he will think ill of my pliancy or lightness, not considering the irresistible influence he brought to bear upon me.\u201d \u201cLet not that trouble you, my lady,\u201d said Leonela, \u201cfor it does not take away the value of the thing given or make it the less precious to give it quickly if it be really valuable and worthy of being prized; nay, they are wont to say that he who gives quickly gives twice.\u201d \u201cThey say also,\u201d said Camilla, \u201cthat what costs little is valued less.\u201d \u201cThat saying does not hold good in your case,\u201d replied Leonela, \u201cfor love, as I have heard say, sometimes flies and sometimes walks; with this one it runs, with that it moves slowly; some it cools, others it burns; some it wounds, others it slays; it begins the course of its desires, and at the same moment completes and ends it; in the morning it will lay siege to a fortress and by night will have taken it, for there is no power that can resist it; so what are you in dread of, what do you fear, when the same must have befallen Lothario, love having chosen the absence of my lord as the instrument for subduing you?", " Cardenio then bade Dorothea return to her room, as he would endeavour to make the whole matter right, and they did as he desired. All the four who had come in quest of Don Luis had now come into the inn and surrounded him, urging him to return and console his father at once and without a moment\u2019s delay. He replied that he could not do so on any account until he had concluded some business in which his life, honour, and heart were at stake. The servants pressed him, saying that most certainly they would not return without him, and that they would take him away whether he liked it or not. \u201cYou shall not do that,\u201d replied Don Luis, \u201cunless you take me dead; though however you take me, it will be without life.\u201d By this time most of those in the inn had been attracted by the dispute, but particularly Cardenio, Don Fernando, his companions, the Judge, the curate, the barber, and Don Quixote; for he now considered there was no necessity for mounting guard over the castle any longer.", " They did so, and the curate questioned the peasant at great length as to how he had found Don Quixote. He told him, and the nonsense he had talked when found and on the way home, all which made the licentiate the more eager to do what he did the next day, which was to summon his friend the barber, Master Nicholas, and go with him to Don Quixote\u2019s house. p031.jpg (31K) CHAPTER VI. OF THE DIVERTING AND IMPORTANT SCRUTINY WHICH THE CURATE AND THE BARBER MADE IN THE LIBRARY OF OUR INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN c06a.jpg (92K) Full Size He was still sleeping; so the curate asked the niece for the keys of the room where the books, the authors of all the mischief, were, and right willingly she gave them. They all went in, the housekeeper with them, and found more than a hundred volumes of big books very well bound, and some other small ones. The moment the housekeeper saw them she turned about and ran out of the room, and came back immediately with a saucer of holy water and a sprinkler, saying, \u201cHere, your worship, se\u00f1or licentiate, sprinkle this room; don\u2019t leave any magician of the many there are in these books to bewitch us in revenge for our design of banishing them from the world.\u201d The simplicity of the housekeeper made the licentiate laugh, and he directed the barber to give him the books one by one to see what they were about, as there might be some to be found among them that did not deserve the penalty of fire."], "What work has another author published that provokes Cervantes\u2019 anger?": [" Seeing that the story of \u201cDon Quixote\u201d and all its characters and incidents have now been for more than two centuries and a half familiar as household words in English mouths, it seems to me that the old familiar names and phrases should not be changed without good reason. Of course a translator who holds that \u201cDon Quixote\u201d should receive the treatment a great classic deserves, will feel himself bound by the injunction laid upon the Morisco in Chap. IX not to omit or add anything. II: ABOUT CERVANTES AND DON QUIXOTE Four generations had laughed over \u201cDon Quixote\u201d before it occurred to anyone to ask, who and what manner of man was this Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra whose name is on the title-page; and it was too late for a satisfactory answer to the question when it was proposed to add a life of the author to the London edition published at Lord Carteret\u2019s instance in 1738. All traces of the personality of Cervantes had by that time disappeared.", " It might naturally have been expected that, with such proofs before him that he had hit the taste of the public, Cervantes would have at once set about redeeming his rather vague promise of a second volume. But, to all appearance, nothing was farther from his thoughts. He had still by him one or two short tales of the same vintage as those he had inserted in \u201cDon Quixote\u201d and instead of continuing the adventures of Don Quixote, he set to work to write more of these \u201cNovelas Exemplares\u201d as he afterwards called them, with a view to making a book of them. The novels were published in the summer of 1613, with a dedication to the Conde de Lemos, the Maecenas of the day, and with one of those chatty confidential prefaces Cervantes was so fond of. In this, eight years and a half after the First Part of \u201cDon Quixote\u201d had appeared, we get the first hint of a forthcoming Second Part. \u201cYou shall see shortly,\u201d he says, \u201cthe further exploits of Don Quixote and humours of Sancho Panza.\u201d His idea of \u201cshortly\u201d was a somewhat elastic one, for, as we know by the date to Sancho\u2019s letter, he had barely one-half of the book completed that time twelvemonth.", " In fact Cervantes had no case, or a very bad one, as far as the mere continuation was concerned. But Avellaneda chose to write a preface to it, full of such coarse personal abuse as only an ill-conditioned man could pour out. He taunts Cervantes with being old, with having lost his hand, with having been in prison, with being poor, with being friendless, accuses him of envy of Lope\u2019s success, of petulance and querulousness, and so on; and it was in this that the sting lay. Avellaneda\u2019s reason for this personal attack is obvious enough. Whoever he may have been, it is clear that he was one of the dramatists of Lope\u2019s school, for he has the impudence to charge Cervantes with attacking him as well as Lope in his criticism on the drama. His identification has exercised the best critics and baffled all the ingenuity and research that has been brought to bear on it. Navarrete and Ticknor both incline to the belief that Cervantes knew who he was; but I must say I think the anger he shows suggests an invisible assailant; it is like the irritation of a man stung by a mosquito in the dark.", " The history of our English translations of \u201cDon Quixote\u201d is instructive. Shelton\u2019s, the first in any language, was made, apparently, about 1608, but not published till 1612. This of course was only the First Part. It has been asserted that the Second, published in 1620, is not the work of Shelton, but there is nothing to support the assertion save the fact that it has less spirit, less of what we generally understand by \u201cgo,\u201d about it than the first, which would be only natural if the first were the work of a young man writing _currente calamo_, and the second that of a middle-aged man writing for a bookseller. On the other hand, it is closer and more literal, the style is the same, the very same translations, or mistranslations, occur in it, and it is extremely unlikely that a new translator would, by suppressing his name, have allowed Shelton to carry off the credit. In 1687 John Phillips, Milton\u2019s nephew, produced a \u201cDon Quixote\u201d \u201cmade English,\u201d he says, \u201caccording to the humour of our modern language.\u201d His \u201cQuixote\u201d is not so much a translation as a travesty, and a travesty that for coarseness, vulgarity, and buffoonery is almost unexampled even in the literature of that day."], "What are the contents of the book Sancho that describes to Don Quixote at Quixote\u2019s house?": [" Almost the same civilities were exchanged between him and the student, who listening to Don Quixote, took him to be a sensible, clear-headed person. Here the author describes minutely everything belonging to Don Diego\u2019s mansion, putting before us in his picture the whole contents of a rich gentleman-farmer\u2019s house; but the translator of the history thought it best to pass over these and other details of the same sort in silence, as they are not in harmony with the main purpose of the story, the strong point of which is truth rather than dull digressions. They led Don Quixote into a room, and Sancho removed his armour, leaving him in loose Walloon breeches and chamois-leather doublet, all stained with the rust of his armour; his collar was a falling one of scholastic cut, without starch or lace, his buskins buff-coloured, and his shoes polished. He wore his good sword, which hung in a baldric of sea-wolf\u2019s skin, for he had suffered for many years, they say, from an ailment of the kidneys; and over all he threw a long cloak of good grey cloth.", " I withdrew at once with the Morisco into the cloister of the cathedral, and begged him to turn all these pamphlets that related to Don Quixote into the Castilian tongue, without omitting or adding anything to them, offering him whatever payment he pleased. He was satisfied with two arrobas of raisins and two bushels of wheat, and promised to translate them faithfully and with all despatch; but to make the matter easier, and not to let such a precious find out of my hands, I took him to my house, where in little more than a month and a half he translated the whole just as it is set down here. In the first pamphlet the battle between Don Quixote and the Biscayan was drawn to the very life, they planted in the same attitude as the history describes, their swords raised, and the one protected by his buckler, the other by his cushion, and the Biscayan\u2019s mule so true to nature that it could be seen to be a hired one a bowshot off.", " \u201cAt the same time they might fairly have passed them over in silence,\u201d observed Don Quixote; \u201cfor there is no need of recording events which do not change or affect the truth of a history, if they tend to bring the hero of it into contempt. \u00c6neas was not in truth and earnest so pious as Virgil represents him, nor Ulysses so wise as Homer describes him.\u201d \u201cThat is true,\u201d said Samson; \u201cbut it is one thing to write as a poet, another to write as a historian; the poet may describe or sing things, not as they were, but as they ought to have been; but the historian has to write them down, not as they ought to have been, but as they were, without adding anything to the truth or taking anything from it.\u201d \u201cWell then,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cif this se\u00f1or Moor goes in for telling the truth, no doubt among my master\u2019s drubbings mine are to be found; for they never took the measure of his worship\u2019s shoulders without doing the same for my whole body; but I have no right to wonder at that, for, as my master himself says, the members must share the pain of the head.\u201d \u201cYou are a sly dog, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201ci\u2019 faith, you have no want of memory when you choose to remember.\u201d \u201cIf I were to try to forget the thwacks they gave me,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cmy weals would not let me, for they are still fresh on my ribs.\u201d \u201cHush, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand don\u2019t interrupt the bachelor, whom I entreat to go on and tell all that is said about me in this history.\u201d \u201cAnd about me,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cfor they say, too, that I am one of the principal presonages in it.\u201d \u201cPersonages, not presonages, friend Sancho,\u201d said Samson.", " It came to pass, then, that after he had dined that day, in opposition to the rules and aphorisms of Doctor Tirteafuera, as they were taking away the cloth there came a courier with a letter from Don Quixote for the governor. Sancho ordered the secretary to read it to himself, and if there was nothing in it that demanded secrecy to read it aloud. The secretary did so, and after he had skimmed the contents he said, \u201cIt may well be read aloud, for what Se\u00f1or Don Quixote writes to your worship deserves to be printed or written in letters of gold, and it is as follows.\u201d DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA\u2019S LETTER TO SANCHO PANZA, GOVERNOR OF THE ISLAND OF BARATARIA. When I was expecting to hear of thy stupidities and blunders, friend Sancho, I have received intelligence of thy displays of good sense, for which I give special thanks to heaven that can raise the poor from the dunghill and of fools to make wise men."], "What does Don Quixote call the writer of the book that details his and Sancho\u2019s adventures?": [" To give expression to humour, and write in a strain of graceful pleasantry, is the gift of great geniuses. The cleverest character in comedy is the clown, for he who would make people take him for a fool, must not be one. History is in a measure a sacred thing, for it should be true, and where the truth is, there God is; but notwithstanding this, there are some who write and fling books broadcast on the world as if they were fritters.\u201d \u201cThere is no book so bad but it has something good in it,\u201d said the bachelor. \u201cNo doubt of that,\u201d replied Don Quixote; \u201cbut it often happens that those who have acquired and attained a well-deserved reputation by their writings, lose it entirely, or damage it in some degree, when they give them to the press.\u201d \u201cThe reason of that,\u201d said Samson, \u201cis, that as printed works are examined leisurely, their faults are easily seen; and the greater the fame of the writer, the more closely are they scrutinised.", " Were it not better, cruel memory, to remind me and recall what she then did, that stirred by a wrong so glaring I may seek, if not vengeance now, at least to rid myself of life? Be not weary, sirs, of listening to these digressions; my sorrow is not one of those that can or should be told tersely and briefly, for to me each incident seems to call for many words.\u201d To this the curate replied that not only were they not weary of listening to him, but that the details he mentioned interested them greatly, being of a kind by no means to be omitted and deserving of the same attention as the main story. \u201cTo proceed, then,\u201d continued Cardenio: \u201call being assembled in the hall, the priest of the parish came in and as he took the pair by the hand to perform the requisite ceremony, at the words, \u2018Will you, Se\u00f1ora Luscinda, take Se\u00f1or Don Fernando, here present, for your lawful husband, as the holy Mother Church ordains?\u2019 I thrust my head and neck out from between the tapestries, and with eager ears and throbbing heart set myself to listen to Luscinda\u2019s answer, awaiting in her reply the sentence of death or the grant of life.", " \u201cNow let us come to those references to authors which other books have, and you want for yours. The remedy for this is very simple: You have only to look out for some book that quotes them all, from A to Z as you say yourself, and then insert the very same alphabet in your book, and though the imposition may be plain to see, because you have so little need to borrow from them, that is no matter; there will probably be some simple enough to believe that you have made use of them all in this plain, artless story of yours. At any rate, if it answers no other purpose, this long catalogue of authors will serve to give a surprising look of authority to your book. Besides, no one will trouble himself to verify whether you have followed them or whether you have not, being no way concerned in it; especially as, if I mistake not, this book of yours has no need of any one of those things you say it wants, for it is, from beginning to end, an attack upon the books of chivalry, of which Aristotle never dreamt, nor St.", " They asked him whither he meant to direct his steps. He replied, to Saragossa, to take part in the harness jousts which were held in that city every year. Don Juan told him that the new history described how Don Quixote, let him be who he might, took part there in a tilting at the ring, utterly devoid of invention, poor in mottoes, very poor in costume, though rich in sillinesses. \u201cFor that very reason,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cI will not set foot in Saragossa; and by that means I shall expose to the world the lie of this new history writer, and people will see that I am not the Don Quixote he speaks of.\u201d \u201cYou will do quite right,\u201d said Don Jeronimo; \u201cand there are other jousts at Barcelona in which Se\u00f1or Don Quixote may display his prowess.\u201d \u201cThat is what I mean to do,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cand as it is now time, I pray your worships to give me leave to retire to bed, and to place and retain me among the number of your greatest friends and servants.\u201d \u201cAnd me too,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cmaybe I\u2019ll be good for something.\u201d With this they exchanged farewells, and Don Quixote and Sancho retired to their room, leaving Don Juan and Don Jeronimo amazed to see the medley he made of his good sense and his craziness; and they felt thoroughly convinced that these, and not those their Aragonese author described, were the genuine Don Quixote and Sancho."], "Why does Cervantes, the \u201ctranslator,\u201d doubt the authenticity of one of his manuscript chapters?": [" It was probably the ransacking of the Don\u2019s library and the discussion on the books of chivalry that first suggested it to him that his idea was capable of development. What, if instead of a mere string of farcical misadventures, he were to make his tale a burlesque of one of these books, caricaturing their style, incidents, and spirit? In pursuance of this change of plan, he hastily and somewhat clumsily divided what he had written into chapters on the model of \u201cAmadis,\u201d invented the fable of a mysterious Arabic manuscript, and set up Cid Hamete Benengeli in imitation of the almost invariable practice of the chivalry-romance authors, who were fond of tracing their books to some recondite source. In working out the new ideas, he soon found the value of Sancho Panza. Indeed, the keynote, not only to Sancho\u2019s part, but to the whole book, is struck in the first words Sancho utters when he announces his intention of taking his ass with him.", " Seeing that the story of \u201cDon Quixote\u201d and all its characters and incidents have now been for more than two centuries and a half familiar as household words in English mouths, it seems to me that the old familiar names and phrases should not be changed without good reason.

All traces of the personality of Cervantes had by that time disappeared.", " But after all there is no real antagonism between the two classes; there is no reason why what pleases the one should not please the other, or why a translator who makes it his aim to treat \u201cDon Quixote\u201d with the respect due to a great classic, should not be as acceptable even to the careless reader as the one who treats it as a famous old jest-book. It is not a question of caviare to the general, or, if it is, the fault rests with him who makes so. The method by which Cervantes won the ear of the Spanish people ought, mutatis mutandis, to be equally effective with the great majority of English readers. At any rate, even if there are readers to whom it is a matter of indifference, fidelity to the method is as much a part of the translator\u2019s duty as fidelity to the matter. If he can please all parties, so much the better; but his first duty is to those who look to him for as faithful a representation of his author as it is in his power to give them, faithful to the letter so long as fidelity is practicable, faithful to the spirit so far as he can make it.", " It is the mean, prosaic, commonplace character of all the surroundings and circumstances that gives a significance to Don Quixote\u2019s vigil and the ceremony that follows. Cervantes\u2019 humour is for the most part of that broader and simpler sort, the strength of which lies in the perception of the incongruous. It is the incongruity of Sancho in all his ways, words, and works, with the ideas and aims of his master, quite as much as the wonderful vitality and truth to nature of the character, that makes him the most humorous creation in the whole range of fiction. That unsmiling gravity of which Cervantes was the first great master, \u201cCervantes\u2019 serious air,\u201d which sits naturally on Swift alone, perhaps, of later humourists, is essential to this kind of humour, and here again Cervantes has suffered at the hands of his interpreters. Nothing, unless indeed the coarse buffoonery of Phillips, could be more out of place in an attempt to represent Cervantes, than a flippant, would-be facetious style, like that of Motteux\u2019s version for example, or the sprightly, jaunty air, French translators sometimes adopt."], "Don Quixote tells his niece and housekeeper that ___ and ___ are the only ways to increase fame and honor.": [" p01e.jpg (15K) CHAPTER II.

Be off to your own, brother, for it is you, and no one else, that delude my master, and lead him astray, and take him tramping about the country.\u201d To which Sancho replied, \u201cDevil\u2019s own housekeeper! it is I who am deluded, and led astray, and taken tramping about the country, and not thy master! He has carried me all over the world, and you are mightily mistaken. He enticed me away from home by a trick, promising me an island, which I am still waiting for.\u201d \u201cMay evil islands choke thee, thou detestable Sancho,\u201d said the niece; \u201cWhat are islands?", " But for all this Don Quixote could not shake off his sadness. His friends called in the doctor, who felt his pulse and was not very well satisfied with it, and said that in any case it would be well for him to attend to the health of his soul, as that of his body was in a bad way. Don Quixote heard this calmly; but not so his housekeeper, his niece, and his squire, who fell weeping bitterly, as if they had him lying dead before them. The doctor\u2019s opinion was that melancholy and depression were bringing him to his end. Don Quixote begged them to leave him to himself, as he had a wish to sleep a little. They obeyed, and he slept at one stretch, as the saying is, more than six hours, so that the housekeeper and niece thought he was going to sleep for ever. But at the end of that time he woke up, and in a loud voice exclaimed, \u201cBlessed be Almighty God, who has shown me such goodness. In truth his mercies are boundless, and the sins of men can neither limit them nor keep them back!\u201d The niece listened with attention to her uncle\u2019s words, and they struck her as more coherent than what usually fell from him, at least during his illness, so she asked, \u201cWhat are you saying, se\u00f1or?", " \u201cThe day that I see her a countess,\u201d replied Teresa, \u201cit will be the same to me as if I was burying her; but once more I say do as you please, for we women are born to this burden of being obedient to our husbands, though they be dogs;\u201d and with this she began to weep in earnest, as if she already saw Sanchica dead and buried. Sancho consoled her by saying that though he must make her a countess, he would put it off as long as possible. Here their conversation came to an end, and Sancho went back to see Don Quixote, and make arrangements for their departure. p05e.jpg (49K) Full Size CHAPTER VI.

That afternoon they took Don Quixote out for a stroll, not in his armour but in street costume, with a surcoat of tawny cloth upon him, that at that season would have made ice itself sweat. Orders were left with the servants to entertain Sancho so as not to let him leave the house. Don Quixote was mounted, not on Rocinante, but upon a tall mule of easy pace and handsomely caparisoned. They put the surcoat on him, and on the back, without his perceiving it, they stitched a parchment on which they wrote in large letters, \u201cThis is Don Quixote of La Mancha.\u201d As they set out upon their excursion the placard attracted the eyes of all who chanced to see him, and as they read out, \u201cThis is Don Quixote of La Mancha,\u201d Don Quixote was amazed to see how many people gazed at him, called him by his name, and recognised him, and turning to Don Antonio, who rode at his side, he observed to him, \u201cGreat are the privileges knight-errantry involves, for it makes him who professes it known and famous in every region of the earth; see, Don Antonio, even the very boys of this city know me without ever having seen me.\u201d \u201cTrue, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote,\u201d returned Don Antonio; \u201cfor as fire cannot be hidden or kept secret, virtue cannot escape being recognised; and that which is attained by the profession of arms shines distinguished above all others.\u201d It came to pass, however, that as Don Quixote was proceeding amid the acclamations that have been described, a Castilian, reading the inscription on his back, cried out in a loud voice, \u201cThe devil take thee for a Don Quixote of La Mancha!", " The first words written on the parchment found in the leaden box were these: THE ACADEMICIANS OF ARGAMASILLA, A VILLAGE OF LA MANCHA, ON THE LIFE AND DEATH OF DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA, HOC SCRIPSERUNT MONICONGO, ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA, ON THE TOMB OF DON QUIXOTE EPITAPH The scatterbrain that gave La Mancha more Rich spoils than Jason\u2019s; who a point so keen Had to his wit, and happier far had been If his wit\u2019s weathercock a blunter bore; The arm renowned far as Gaeta\u2019s shore, Cathay, and all the lands that lie between; The muse discreet and terrible in mien As ever wrote on brass in days of yore; He who surpassed the Amadises all, And who as naught the Galaors accounted, Supported by his love and gallantry: Who made the Belianises sing small, And sought renown on Rocinante mounted; Here, underneath this cold stone, doth he lie.

On perceiving it the curate begged the notary to bear witness that Alonso Quixano the Good, commonly called Don Quixote of La Mancha, had passed away from this present life, and died naturally; and said he desired this testimony in order to remove the possibility of any other author save Cide Hamete Benengeli bringing him to life again falsely and making interminable stories out of his achievements.

The wench, seeing that her master was coming and knowing that his temper was terrible, frightened and panic-stricken made for the bed of Sancho Panza, who still slept, and crouching upon it made a ball of herself. The innkeeper came in exclaiming, \u201cWhere art thou, strumpet? Of course this is some of thy work.\u201d At this Sancho awoke, and feeling this mass almost on top of him fancied he had the nightmare and began to distribute fisticuffs all round, of which a certain share fell upon Maritornes, who, irritated by the pain and flinging modesty aside, paid back so many in return to Sancho that she woke him up in spite of himself. He then, finding himself so handled, by whom he knew not, raising himself up as well as he could, grappled with Maritornes, and he and she between them began the bitterest and drollest scrimmage in the world.", " In the end, Don Quixote made up his mind to enter the city at nightfall, and they waited until the time came among some oak trees that were near El Toboso; and when the moment they had agreed upon arrived, they made their entrance into the city, where something happened them that may fairly be called something. p08e.jpg (49K) Full Size CHAPTER IX. WHEREIN IS RELATED WHAT WILL BE SEEN THERE p09a.jpg (79K) Full Size \u2019Twas at the very midnight hour\u2014more or less\u2014when Don Quixote and Sancho quitted the wood and entered El Toboso. The town was in deep silence, for all the inhabitants were asleep, and stretched on the broad of their backs, as the saying is. The night was darkish, though Sancho would have been glad had it been quite dark, so as to find in the darkness an excuse for his blundering. All over the place nothing was to be heard except the barking of dogs, which deafened the ears of Don Quixote and troubled the heart of Sancho.", " \u201cThe truth is, se\u00f1ora,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cthat I do feel the loss of Sancho; but that is not the main cause of my looking sad; and of all the offers your excellence makes me, I accept only the good-will with which they are made, and as to the remainder I entreat of your excellence to permit and allow me alone to wait upon myself in my chamber.\u201d \u201cIndeed, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote,\u201d said the duchess, \u201cthat must not be; four of my damsels, as beautiful as flowers, shall wait upon you.\u201d \u201cTo me,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cthey will not be flowers, but thorns to pierce my heart. They, or anything like them, shall as soon enter my chamber as fly. If your highness wishes to gratify me still further, though I deserve it not, permit me to please myself, and wait upon myself in my own room; for I place a barrier between my inclinations and my virtue, and I do not wish to break this rule through the generosity your highness is disposed to display towards me; and, in short, I will sleep in my clothes, sooner than allow anyone to undress me.\u201d \u201cSay no more, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote, say no more,\u201d said the duchess; \u201cI assure you I will give orders that not even a fly, not to say a damsel, shall enter your room.", " If it disturb you, and I owe Some reparation, it may be a Defence for me to let you know Don Quixote\u2019s tears are on the flow, And all for distant Dulcinea Del Toboso. The lealest lover time can show, Doomed for a lady-love to languish, Among these solitudes doth go, A prey to every kind of anguish. Why Love should like a spiteful foe Thus use him, he hath no idea, But hogsheads full\u2014this doth he know\u2014 Don Quixote\u2019s tears are on the flow, And all for distant Dulcinea Del Toboso. Adventure-seeking doth he go Up rugged heights, down rocky valleys, But hill or dale, or high or low, Mishap attendeth all his sallies: Love still pursues him to and fro, And plies his cruel scourge\u2014ah me! a Relentless fate, an endless woe; Don Quixote\u2019s tears are on the flow, And all for distant Dulcinea Del Toboso. The addition of \u201cDel Toboso\u201d to Dulcinea\u2019s name gave rise to no little laughter among those who found the above lines, for they suspected Don Quixote must have fancied that unless he added \u201cdel Toboso\u201d when he introduced the name of Dulcinea the verse would be unintelligible; which was indeed the fact, as he himself afterwards admitted."], "Who does Sancho present to Don Quixote as Dulcinea?": [" But one thing, se\u00f1or, troubles me more than all the rest, and that is thinking what is to be done when your worship conquers some giant, or some other knight, and orders him to go and present himself before the beauty of the lady Dulcinea. Where is this poor giant, or this poor wretch of a vanquished knight, to find her? I think I can see them wandering all over El Toboso, looking like noddies, and asking for my lady Dulcinea; and even if they meet her in the middle of the street they won\u2019t know her any more than they would my father.\u201d \u201cPerhaps, Sancho,\u201d returned Don Quixote, \u201cthe enchantment does not go so far as to deprive conquered and presented giants and knights of the power of recognising Dulcinea; we will try by experiment with one or two of the first I vanquish and send to her, whether they see her or not, by commanding them to return and give me an account of what happened to them in this respect.\u201d \u201cI declare, I think what your worship has proposed is excellent,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cand that by this plan we shall find out what we want to know; and if it be that it is only from your worship she is hidden, the misfortune will be more yours than hers; but so long as the lady Dulcinea is well and happy, we on our part will make the best of it, and get on as well as we can, seeking our adventures, and leaving Time to take his own course; for he is the best physician for these and greater ailments.\u201d Don Quixote was about to reply to Sancho Panza, but he was prevented by a cart crossing the road full of the most diverse and strange personages and figures that could be imagined.", " What displeases me most in it is that it represents Don Quixote as now cured of his love for Dulcinea del Toboso.\u201d On hearing this Don Quixote, full of wrath and indignation, lifted up his voice and said, \u201cWhoever he may be who says that Don Quixote of La Mancha has forgotten or can forget Dulcinea del Toboso, I will teach him with equal arms that what he says is very far from the truth; for neither can the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso be forgotten, nor can forgetfulness have a place in Don Quixote; his motto is constancy, and his profession to maintain the same with his life and never wrong it.\u201d \u201cWho is this that answers us?\u201d said they in the next room. \u201cWho should it be,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cbut Don Quixote of La Mancha himself, who will make good all he has said and all he will say; for pledges don\u2019t trouble a good payer.\u201d Sancho had hardly uttered these words when two gentlemen, for such they seemed to be, entered the room, and one of them, throwing his arms round Don Quixote\u2019s neck, said to him, \u201cYour appearance cannot leave any question as to your name, nor can your name fail to identify your appearance; unquestionably, se\u00f1or, you are the real Don Quixote of La Mancha, cynosure and morning star of knight-errantry, despite and in defiance of him who has sought to usurp your name and bring to naught your achievements, as the author of this book which I here present to you has done;\u201d and with this he put a book which his companion carried into the hands of Don Quixote, who took it, and without replying began to run his eye over it; but he presently returned it saying, \u201cIn the little I have seen I have discovered three things in this author that deserve to be censured.", " \u201cIf thou art advising me to marry, in order that immediately on slaying the giant I may become king, and be able to confer favours on thee, and give thee what I have promised, let me tell thee I shall be able very easily to satisfy thy desires without marrying; for before going into battle I will make it a stipulation that, if I come out of it victorious, even I do not marry, they shall give me a portion of the kingdom, that I may bestow it upon whomsoever I choose, and when they give it to me upon whom wouldst thou have me bestow it but upon thee?\u201d \u201cThat is plain speaking,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cbut let your worship take care to choose it on the seacoast, so that if I don\u2019t like the life, I may be able to ship off my black vassals and deal with them as I have said; don\u2019t mind going to see my lady Dulcinea now, but go and kill this giant and let us finish off this business; for by God it strikes me it will be one of great honour and great profit.\u201d \u201cI hold thou art in the right of it, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand I will take thy advice as to accompanying the princess before going to see Dulcinea; but I counsel thee not to say anything to anyone, or to those who are with us, about what we have considered and discussed, for as Dulcinea is so decorous that she does not wish her thoughts to be known it is not right that I or anyone for me should disclose them.\u201d \u201cWell then, if that be so,\u201d said Sancho, \u201chow is it that your worship makes all those you overcome by your arm go to present themselves before my lady Dulcinea, this being the same thing as signing your name to it that you love her and are her lover?", " He told him, too, of the jokes he had practised upon him, and of the device for the disenchantment of Dulcinea at the expense of Sancho\u2019s backside; and finally he gave him an account of the trick Sancho had played upon his master, making him believe that Dulcinea was enchanted and turned into a country wench; and of how the duchess, his wife, had persuaded Sancho that it was he himself who was deceived, inasmuch as Dulcinea was really enchanted; at which the bachelor laughed not a little, and marvelled as well at the sharpness and simplicity of Sancho as at the length to which Don Quixote\u2019s madness went. The duke begged of him if he found him (whether he overcame him or not) to return that way and let him know the result. This the bachelor did; he set out in quest of Don Quixote, and not finding him at Saragossa, he went on, and how he fared has been already told. He returned to the duke\u2019s castle and told him all, what the conditions of the combat were, and how Don Quixote was now, like a loyal knight-errant, returning to keep his promise of retiring to his village for a year, by which time, said the bachelor, he might perhaps be cured of his madness; for that was the object that had led him to adopt these disguises, as it was a sad thing for a gentleman of such good parts as Don Quixote to be a madman."], "Who does the Knight of the Wood claim to have vanquished?": [" To be brief, last of all she has commanded me to go through all the provinces of Spain and compel all the knights-errant wandering therein to confess that she surpasses all women alive to-day in beauty, and that I am the most valiant and the most deeply enamoured knight on earth; in support of which claim I have already travelled over the greater part of Spain, and have there vanquished several knights who have dared to contradict me; but what I most plume and pride myself upon is having vanquished in single combat that so famous knight Don Quixote of La Mancha, and made him confess that my Casildea is more beautiful than his Dulcinea; and in this one victory I hold myself to have conquered all the knights in the world; for this Don Quixote that I speak of has vanquished them all, and I having vanquished him, his glory, his fame, and his honour have passed and are transferred to my person; for The more the vanquished hath of fair renown, The greater glory gilds the victor\u2019s crown.", " Over his armour he wore a surcoat or cassock of what seemed to be the finest cloth of gold, all bespangled with glittering mirrors like little moons, which gave him an extremely gallant and splendid appearance; above his helmet fluttered a great quantity of plumes, green, yellow, and white, and his lance, which was leaning against a tree, was very long and stout, and had a steel point more than a palm in length. Don Quixote observed all, and took note of all, and from what he saw and observed he concluded that the said knight must be a man of great strength, but he did not for all that give way to fear, like Sancho Panza; on the contrary, with a composed and dauntless air, he said to the Knight of the Mirrors, \u201cIf, sir knight, your great eagerness to fight has not banished your courtesy, by it I would entreat you to raise your visor a little, in order that I may see if the comeliness of your countenance corresponds with that of your equipment.\u201d \u201cWhether you come victorious or vanquished out of this emprise, sir knight,\u201d replied he of the Mirrors, \u201cyou will have more than enough time and leisure to see me; and if now I do not comply with your request, it is because it seems to me I should do a serious wrong to the fair Casildea de Vandalia in wasting time while I stopped to raise my visor before compelling you to confess what you are already aware I maintain.\u201d \u201cWell then,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cwhile we are mounting you can at least tell me if I am that Don Quixote whom you said you vanquished.\u201d \u201cTo that we answer you,\u201d said he of the Mirrors, \u201cthat you are as like the very knight I vanquished as one egg is like another, but as you say enchanters persecute you, I will not venture to say positively whether you are the said person or not.\u201d \u201cThat,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cis enough to convince me that you are under a deception; however, entirely to relieve you of it, let our horses be brought, and in less time than it would take you to raise your visor, if God, my lady, and my arm stand me in good stead, I shall see your face, and you shall see that I am not the vanquished Don Quixote you take me to be.\u201d With this, cutting short the colloquy, they mounted, and Don Quixote wheeled Rocinante round in order to take a proper distance to charge back upon his adversary, and he of the Mirrors did the same; but Don Quixote had not moved away twenty paces when he heard himself called by the other, and, each returning half-way, he of the Mirrors said to him, \u201cRemember, sir knight, that the terms of our combat are, that the vanquished, as I said before, shall be at the victor\u2019s disposal.\u201d \u201cI am aware of it already,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cprovided what is commanded and imposed upon the vanquished be things that do not transgress the limits of chivalry.\u201d \u201cThat is understood,\u201d replied he of the Mirrors.", " You must know, se\u00f1or, that I am called the bachelor Samson Carrasco. I am of the same village as Don Quixote of La Mancha, whose craze and folly make all of us who know him feel pity for him, and I am one of those who have felt it most; and persuaded that his chance of recovery lay in quiet and keeping at home and in his own house, I hit upon a device for keeping him there. Three months ago, therefore, I went out to meet him as a knight-errant, under the assumed name of the Knight of the Mirrors, intending to engage him in combat and overcome him without hurting him, making it the condition of our combat that the vanquished should be at the disposal of the victor. What I meant to demand of him (for I regarded him as vanquished already) was that he should return to his own village, and not leave it for a whole year, by which time he might be cured. But fate ordered it otherwise, for he vanquished me and unhorsed me, and so my plan failed.", " If all these tokens are not enough to vindicate the truth of what I say, here is my sword, that will compel incredulity itself to give credence to it.\u201d \u201cCalm yourself, sir knight,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand give ear to what I am about to say to you. I would have you know that this Don Quixote you speak of is the greatest friend I have in the world; so much so that I may say I regard him in the same light as my own person; and from the precise and clear indications you have given I cannot but think that he must be the very one you have vanquished. On the other hand, I see with my eyes and feel with my hands that it is impossible it can have been the same; unless indeed it be that, as he has many enemies who are enchanters, and one in particular who is always persecuting him, someone of these may have taken his shape in order to allow himself to be vanquished, so as to defraud him of the fame that his exalted achievements as a knight have earned and acquired for him throughout the known world."], "Who is the Knight of the Wood /Knight of the Mirrors?": [" In fine, both master and man remained under the delusion; and, down in the mouth, and out of luck, he of the Mirrors and his squire parted from Don Quixote and Sancho, he meaning to go look for some village where he could plaster and strap his ribs. Don Quixote and Sancho resumed their journey to Saragossa, and on it the history leaves them in order that it may tell who the Knight of the Mirrors and his long-nosed squire were. p14e.jpg (56K) CHAPTER XV. WHEREIN IT IS TOLD AND KNOWN WHO THE KNIGHT OF THE MIRRORS AND HIS SQUIRE WERE p15a.jpg (122K) Full Size Don Quixote went off satisfied, elated, and vain-glorious in the highest degree at having won a victory over such a valiant knight as he fancied him of the Mirrors to be, and one from whose knightly word he expected to learn whether the enchantment of his lady still continued; inasmuch as the said vanquished knight was bound, under the penalty of ceasing to be one, to return and render him an account of what took place between him and her.", " Over his armour he wore a surcoat or cassock of what seemed to be the finest cloth of gold, all bespangled with glittering mirrors like little moons, which gave him an extremely gallant and splendid appearance; above his helmet fluttered a great quantity of plumes, green, yellow, and white, and his lance, which was leaning against a tree, was very long and stout, and had a steel point more than a palm in length.

however, entirely to relieve you of it, let our horses be brought, and in less time than it would take you to raise your visor, if God, my lady, and my arm stand me in good stead, I shall see your face, and you shall see that I am not the vanquished Don Quixote you take me to be.\u201d With this, cutting short the colloquy, they mounted, and Don Quixote wheeled Rocinante round in order to take a proper distance to charge back upon his adversary, and he of the Mirrors did the same; but Don Quixote had not moved away twenty paces when he heard himself called by the other, and, each returning half-way, he of the Mirrors said to him, \u201cRemember, sir knight, that the terms of our combat are, that the vanquished, as I said before, shall be at the victor\u2019s disposal.\u201d \u201cI am aware of it already,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cprovided what is commanded and imposed upon the vanquished be things that do not transgress the limits of chivalry.\u201d \u201cThat is understood,\u201d replied he of the Mirrors.", " Isn\u2019t it Tom Cecial, my neighbour and gossip?\u201d \u201cWhy, to be sure I am!\u201d returned the now unnosed squire; \u201cTom Cecial I am, gossip and friend Sancho Panza; and I\u2019ll tell you presently the means and tricks and falsehoods by which I have been brought here; but in the meantime, beg and entreat of your master not to touch, maltreat, wound, or slay the Knight of the Mirrors whom he has at his feet; because, beyond all dispute, it is the rash and ill-advised bachelor Samson Carrasco, our fellow townsman.\u201d At this moment he of the Mirrors came to himself, and Don Quixote perceiving it, held the naked point of his sword over his face, and said to him, \u201cYou are a dead man, knight, unless you confess that the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso excels your Casildea de Vandalia in beauty; and in addition to this you must promise, if you should survive this encounter and fall, to go to the city of El Toboso and present yourself before her on my behalf, that she deal with you according to her good pleasure; and if she leaves you free to do yours, you are in like manner to return and seek me out (for the trail of my mighty deeds will serve you as a guide to lead you to where I may be), and tell me what may have passed between you and her\u2014conditions which, in accordance with what we stipulated before our combat, do not transgress the just limits of knight-errantry.\u201d \u201cI confess,\u201d said the fallen knight, \u201cthat the dirty tattered shoe of the lady Dulcinea del Toboso is better than the ill-combed though clean beard of Casildea; and I promise to go and to return from her presence to yours, and to give you a full and particular account of all you demand of me.\u201d \u201cYou must also confess and believe,\u201d added Don Quixote, \u201cthat the knight you vanquished was not and could not be Don Quixote of La Mancha, but someone else in his likeness, just as I confess and believe that you, though you seem to be the bachelor Samson Carrasco, are not so, but some other resembling him, whom my enemies have here put before me in his shape, in order that I may restrain and moderate the vehemence of my wrath, and make a gentle use of the glory of my victory.\u201d \u201cI confess, hold, and think everything to be as you believe, hold, and think it,\u201d the crippled knight; \u201clet me rise, I entreat you; if, indeed, the shock of my fall will allow me, for it has left me in a sorry plight enough.\u201d Don Quixote helped him to rise, with the assistance of his squire Tom Cecial; from whom Sancho never took his eyes, and to whom he put questions, the replies to which furnished clear proof that he was really and truly the Tom Cecial he said; but the impression made on Sancho\u2019s mind by what his master said about the enchanters having changed the face of the Knight of the Mirrors into that of the bachelor Samson Carrasco, would not permit him to believe what he saw with his eyes.", " But Don Quixote was of one mind, he of the Mirrors of another, for he just then had no thought of anything but finding some village where he could plaster himself, as has been said already. The history goes on to say, then, that when the bachelor Samson Carrasco recommended Don Quixote to resume his knight-errantry which he had laid aside, it was in consequence of having been previously in conclave with the curate and the barber on the means to be adopted to induce Don Quixote to stay at home in peace and quiet without worrying himself with his ill-starred adventures; at which consultation it was decided by the unanimous vote of all, and on the special advice of Carrasco, that Don Quixote should be allowed to go, as it seemed impossible to restrain him, and that Samson should sally forth to meet him as a knight-errant, and do battle with him, for there would be no difficulty about a cause, and vanquish him, that being looked upon as an easy matter; and that it should be agreed and settled that the vanquished was to be at the mercy of the victor."], "How does Don Diego de Miranda dress?": [" All this time, Don Diego de Miranda had not spoken a word, being entirely taken up with observing and noting all that Don Quixote did and said, and the opinion he formed was that he was a man of brains gone mad, and a madman on the verge of rationality. The first part of his history had not yet reached him, for, had he read it, the amazement with which his words and deeds filled him would have vanished, as he would then have understood the nature of his madness; but knowing nothing of it, he took him to be rational one moment, and crazy the next, for what he said was sensible, elegant, and well expressed, and what he did, absurd, rash, and foolish; and said he to himself, \u201cWhat could be madder than putting on a helmet full of curds, and then persuading oneself that enchanters are softening one\u2019s skull; or what could be greater rashness and folly than wanting to fight lions tooth and nail?\u201d Don Quixote roused him from these reflections and this soliloquy by saying, \u201cNo doubt, Se\u00f1or Don Diego de Miranda, you set me down in your mind as a fool and a madman, and it would be no wonder if you did, for my deeds do not argue anything else.", " OF WHAT HAPPENED DON QUIXOTE IN THE CASTLE OR HOUSE OF THE KNIGHT OF THE GREEN GABAN, TOGETHER WITH OTHER MATTERS OUT OF THE COMMON p18a.jpg (133K) Full Size Don Quixote found Don Diego de Miranda\u2019s house built in village style, with his arms in rough stone over the street door; in the patio was the store-room, and at the entrance the cellar, with plenty of wine-jars standing round, which, coming from El Toboso, brought back to his memory his enchanted and transformed Dulcinea; and with a sigh, and not thinking of what he was saying, or in whose presence he was, he exclaimed- \u201cO ye sweet treasures, to my sorrow found! Once sweet and welcome when \u2019twas heaven\u2019s good-will. \u201cO ye Tobosan jars, how ye bring back to my memory the sweet object of my bitter regrets!\u201d p18b.jpg (300K) Full Size The student poet, Don Diego\u2019s son, who had come out with his mother to receive him, heard this exclamation, and both mother and son were filled with amazement at the extraordinary figure he presented; he, however, dismounting from Rocinante, advanced with great politeness to ask permission to kiss the lady\u2019s hand, while Don Diego said, \u201cSe\u00f1ora, pray receive with your wonted kindness Se\u00f1or Don Quixote of La Mancha, whom you see before you, a knight-errant, and the bravest and wisest in the world.\u201d The lady, whose name was Do\u00f1a Christina, received him with every sign of good-will and great courtesy, and Don Quixote placed himself at her service with an abundance of well-chosen and polished phrases.", " Don Diego; \u201call I can tell thee is that I have seen him act the acts of the greatest madman in the world, and heard him make observations so sensible that they efface and undo all he does; do thou talk to him and feel the pulse of his wits, and as thou art shrewd, form the most reasonable conclusion thou canst as to his wisdom or folly; though, to tell the truth, I am more inclined to take him to be mad than sane.\u201d With this Don Lorenzo went away to entertain Don Quixote as has been said, and in the course of the conversation that passed between them Don Quixote said to Don Lorenzo, \u201cYour father, Se\u00f1or Don Diego de Miranda, has told me of the rare abilities and subtle intellect you possess, and, above all, that you are a great poet.\u201d \u201cA poet, it may be,\u201d replied Don Lorenzo, \u201cbut a great one, by no means. It is true that I am somewhat given to poetry and to reading good poets, but not so much so as to justify the title of \u2018great\u2019 which my father gives me.\u201d \u201cI do not dislike that modesty,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cfor there is no poet who is not conceited and does not think he is the best poet in the world.\u201d \u201cThere is no rule without an exception,\u201d said Don Lorenzo; \u201cthere may be some who are poets and yet do not think they are.\u201d \u201cVery few,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cbut tell me, what verses are those which you have now in hand, and which your father tells me keep you somewhat restless and absorbed?", " \u201cI am confused just now, sirs,\u201d said the damsel, \u201cand I don\u2019t know what I am saying; but the truth is that I am the daughter of Diego de la Llana, whom you must all know.\u201d \u201cAy, that will do,\u201d said the majordomo; \u201cfor I know Diego de la Llana, and know that he is a gentleman of position and a rich man, and that he has a son and a daughter, and that since he was left a widower nobody in all this town can speak of having seen his daughter\u2019s face; for he keeps her so closely shut up that he does not give even the sun a chance of seeing her; and for all that report says she is extremely beautiful.\u201d \u201cIt is true,\u201d said the damsel, \u201cand I am that daughter; whether report lies or not as to my beauty, you, sirs, will have decided by this time, as you have seen me;\u201d and with this she began to weep bitterly. On seeing this the secretary leant over to the head-carver\u2019s ear, and said to him in a low voice, \u201cSomething serious has no doubt happened this poor maiden, that she goes wandering from home in such a dress and at such an hour, and one of her rank too.\u201d \u201cThere can be no doubt about it,\u201d returned the carver, \u201cand moreover her tears confirm your suspicion.\u201d Sancho gave her the best comfort he could, and entreated her to tell them without any fear what had happened her, as they would all earnestly and by every means in their power endeavour to relieve her."], "When Don Quixote challenges the lions and the lion tamer opens a cage, what does the lion then do?": [" They returned at length to the cart, and as they came up, Don Quixote said to the carter, \u201cPut your mules to once more, brother, and continue your journey; and do thou, Sancho, give him two gold crowns for himself and the keeper, to compensate for the delay they have incurred through me.\u201d \u201cThat will I give with all my heart,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cbut what has become of the lions? Are they dead or alive?\u201d The keeper, then, in full detail, and bit by bit, described the end of the contest, exalting to the best of his power and ability the valour of Don Quixote, at the sight of whom the lion quailed, and would not and dared not come out of the cage, although he had held the door open ever so long; and showing how, in consequence of his having represented to the knight that it was tempting God to provoke the lion in order to force him out, which he wished to have done, he very reluctantly, and altogether against his will, had allowed the door to be closed.", " You, gentlemen, place yourselves in safety before I open, for I know they will do me no harm.\u201d Once more the gentleman strove to persuade Don Quixote not to do such a mad thing, as it was tempting God to engage in such a piece of folly. To this, Don Quixote replied that he knew what he was about. The gentleman in return entreated him to reflect, for he knew he was under a delusion. \u201cWell, se\u00f1or,\u201d answered Don Quixote, \u201cif you do not like to be a spectator of this tragedy, as in your opinion it will be, spur your flea-bitten mare, and place yourself in safety.\u201d Hearing this, Sancho with tears in his eyes entreated him to give up an enterprise compared with which the one of the windmills, and the awful one of the fulling mills, and, in fact, all the feats he had attempted in the whole course of his life, were cakes and fancy bread. \u201cLook ye, se\u00f1or,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cthere\u2019s no enchantment here, nor anything of the sort, for between the bars and chinks of the cage I have seen the paw of a real lion, and judging by that I reckon the lion such a paw could belong to must be bigger than a mountain.\u201d \u201cFear at any rate,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cwill make him look bigger to thee than half the world.", " Don Quixote planted himself before it and said, \u201cWhither are you going, brothers? What cart is this? What have you got in it? What flags are those?\u201d To this the carter replied, \u201cThe cart is mine; what is in it is a pair of wild caged lions, which the governor of Oran is sending to court as a present to his Majesty; and the flags are our lord the King\u2019s, to show that what is here is his property.\u201d \u201cAnd are the lions large?\u201d asked Don Quixote. \u201cSo large,\u201d replied the man who sat at the door of the cart, \u201cthat larger, or as large, have never crossed from Africa to Spain; I am the keeper, and I have brought over others, but never any like these. They are male and female; the male is in that first cage and the female in the one behind, and they are hungry now, for they have eaten nothing to-day, so let your worship stand aside, for we must make haste to the place where we are to feed them.\u201d Hereupon, smiling slightly, Don Quixote exclaimed, \u201cLion-whelps to me!", " The first thing he did was to turn round in the cage in which he lay, and protrude his claws, and stretch himself thoroughly; he next opened his mouth, and yawned very leisurely, and with near two palms\u2019 length of tongue that he had thrust forth, he licked the dust out of his eyes and washed his face; having done this, he put his head out of the cage and looked all round with eyes like glowing coals, a spectacle and demeanour to strike terror into temerity itself. Don Quixote merely observed him steadily, longing for him to leap from the cart and come to close quarters with him, when he hoped to hew him in pieces. So far did his unparalleled madness go; but the noble lion, more courteous than arrogant, not troubling himself about silly bravado, after having looked all round, as has been said, turned about and presented his hind-quarters to Don Quixote, and very coolly and tranquilly lay down again in the cage."], "What does Don Diego\u2019s son, Don Lorenzo, do?": [" Don Diego; \u201call I can tell thee is that I have seen him act the acts of the greatest madman in the world, and heard him make observations so sensible that they efface and undo all he does; do thou talk to him and feel the pulse of his wits, and as thou art shrewd, form the most reasonable conclusion thou canst as to his wisdom or folly; though, to tell the truth, I am more inclined to take him to be mad than sane.\u201d With this Don Lorenzo went away to entertain Don Quixote as has been said, and in the course of the conversation that passed between them Don Quixote said to Don Lorenzo, \u201cYour father, Se\u00f1or Don Diego de Miranda, has told me of the rare abilities and subtle intellect you possess, and, above all, that you are a great poet.\u201d \u201cA poet, it may be,\u201d replied Don Lorenzo, \u201cbut a great one, by no means. It is true that I am somewhat given to poetry and to reading good poets, but not so much so as to justify the title of \u2018great\u2019 which my father gives me.\u201d \u201cI do not dislike that modesty,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cfor there is no poet who is not conceited and does not think he is the best poet in the world.\u201d \u201cThere is no rule without an exception,\u201d said Don Lorenzo; \u201cthere may be some who are poets and yet do not think they are.\u201d \u201cVery few,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cbut tell me, what verses are those which you have now in hand, and which your father tells me keep you somewhat restless and absorbed?", " Don Diego and his son commended his laudable resolution, and bade him furnish himself with all he wanted from their house and belongings, as they would most gladly be of service to him; which, indeed, his personal worth and his honourable profession made incumbent upon them. The day of his departure came at length, as welcome to Don Quixote as it was sad and sorrowful to Sancho Panza, who was very well satisfied with the abundance of Don Diego\u2019s house, and objected to return to the starvation of the woods and wilds and the short-commons of his ill-stocked alforjas; these, however, he filled and packed with what he considered needful. On taking leave, Don Quixote said to Don Lorenzo, \u201cI know not whether I have told you already, but if I have I tell you once more, that if you wish to spare yourself fatigue and toil in reaching the inaccessible summit of the temple of fame, you have nothing to do but to turn aside out of the somewhat narrow path of poetry and take the still narrower one of knight-errantry, wide enough, however, to make you an emperor in the twinkling of an eye.\u201d In this speech Don Quixote wound up the evidence of his madness, but still better in what he added when he said, \u201cGod knows, I would gladly take Don Lorenzo with me to teach him how to spare the humble, and trample the proud under foot, virtues that are part and parcel of the profession I belong to; but since his tender age does not allow of it, nor his praiseworthy pursuits permit it, I will simply content myself with impressing it upon your worship that you will become famous as a poet if you are guided by the opinion of others rather than by your own; because no fathers or mothers ever think their own children ill-favoured, and this sort of deception prevails still more strongly in the case of the children of the brain.\u201d Both father and son were amazed afresh at the strange medley Don Quixote talked, at one moment sense, at another nonsense, and at the pertinacity and persistence he displayed in going through thick and thin in quest of his unlucky adventures, which he made the end and aim of his desires.", " Of all these qualities, great and small, is a true knight-errant made up; judge then, Se\u00f1or Don Lorenzo, whether it be a contemptible science which the knight who studies and professes it has to learn, and whether it may not compare with the very loftiest that are taught in the schools.\u201d \u201cIf that be so,\u201d replied Don Lorenzo, \u201cthis science, I protest, surpasses all.\u201d \u201cHow, if that be so?\u201d said Don Quixote. \u201cWhat I mean to say,\u201d said Don Lorenzo, \u201cis, that I doubt whether there are now, or ever were, any knights-errant, and adorned with such virtues.\u201d \u201cMany a time,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201chave I said what I now say once more, that the majority of the world are of opinion that there never were any knights-errant in it; and as it is my opinion that, unless heaven by some miracle brings home to them the truth that there were and are, all the pains one takes will be in vain (as experience has often proved to me), I will not now stop to disabuse you of the error you share with the multitude.", " But first of all, with five or six buckets of water (for as regard the number of buckets there is some dispute), he washed his head and face, and still the water remained whey-coloured, thanks to Sancho\u2019s greediness and purchase of those unlucky curds that turned his master so white. Thus arrayed, and with an easy, sprightly, and gallant air, Don Quixote passed out into another room, where the student was waiting to entertain him while the table was being laid; for on the arrival of so distinguished a guest, Do\u00f1a Christina was anxious to show that she knew how and was able to give a becoming reception to those who came to her house. While Don Quixote was taking off his armour, Don Lorenzo (for so Don Diego\u2019s son was called) took the opportunity to say to his father, \u201cWhat are we to make of this gentleman you have brought home to us, sir? For his name, his appearance, and your describing him as a knight-errant have completely puzzled my mother and me.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say, my son,\u201d replied."], "What decision has Quiteria made that elicits Sancho\u2019s praise but not Don Quixote\u2019s?": [" p21b.jpg (374K) Full Size On this the fair Quiteria, to all appearance distressed, grieved, and repentant, advanced without a word to where Basilio lay, his eyes already turned in his head, his breathing short and painful, murmuring the name of Quiteria between his teeth, and apparently about to die like a heathen and not like a Christian. Quiteria approached him, and kneeling, demanded his hand by signs without speaking. Basilio opened his eyes and gazing fixedly at her, said, \u201cO Quiteria, why hast thou turned compassionate at a moment when thy compassion will serve as a dagger to rob me of life, for I have not now the strength left either to bear the happiness thou givest me in accepting me as thine, or to suppress the pain that is rapidly drawing the dread shadow of death over my eyes? What I entreat of thee, O thou fatal star to me, is that the hand thou demandest of me and wouldst give me, be not given out of complaisance or to deceive me afresh, but that thou confess and declare that without any constraint upon thy will thou givest it to me as to thy lawful husband; for it is not meet that thou shouldst trifle with me at such a moment as this, or have recourse to falsehoods with one who has dealt so truly by thee.\u201d While uttering these words he showed such weakness that the bystanders expected each return of faintness would take his life with it.", " He has provided dancers too, not only sword but also bell-dancers, for in his own town there are those who ring the changes and jingle the bells to perfection; of shoe-dancers I say nothing, for of them he has engaged a host. But none of these things, nor of the many others I have omitted to mention, will do more to make this a memorable wedding than the part which I suspect the despairing Basilio will play in it. This Basilio is a youth of the same village as Quiteria, and he lived in the house next door to that of her parents, of which circumstance Love took advantage to reproduce to the word the long-forgotten loves of Pyramus and Thisbe; for Basilio loved Quiteria from his earliest years, and she responded to his passion with countless modest proofs of affection, so that the loves of the two children, Basilio and Quiteria, were the talk and the amusement of the town. As they grew up, the father of Quiteria made up his mind to refuse Basilio his wonted freedom of access to the house, and to relieve himself of constant doubts and suspicions, he arranged a match for his daughter with the rich Camacho, as he did not approve of marrying her to Basilio, who had not so large a share of the gifts of fortune as of nature; for if the truth be told ungrudgingly, he is the most agile youth we know, a mighty thrower of the bar, a first-rate wrestler, and a great ball-player; he runs like a deer, and leaps better than a goat, bowls over the nine-pins as if by magic, sings like a lark, plays the guitar so as to make it speak, and, above all, handles a sword as well as the best.\u201d \u201cFor that excellence alone,\u201d said Don Quixote at this, \u201cthe youth deserves to marry, not merely the fair Quiteria, but Queen Guinevere herself, were she alive now, in spite of Launcelot and all who would try to prevent it.\u201d \u201cSay that to my wife,\u201d said Sancho, who had until now listened in silence, \u201cfor she won\u2019t hear of anything but each one marrying his equal, holding with the proverb \u2018each ewe to her like.\u2019 What I would like is that this good Basilio (for I am beginning to take a fancy to him already) should marry this lady Quiteria; and a blessing and good luck\u2014I meant to say the opposite\u2014on people who would prevent those who love one another from marrying.\u201d \u201cIf all those who love one another were to marry,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cit would deprive parents of the right to choose, and marry their children to the proper person and at the proper time; and if it was left to daughters to choose husbands as they pleased, one would be for choosing her father\u2019s servant, and another, someone she has seen passing in the street and fancies gallant and dashing, though he may be a drunken bully; for love and fancy easily blind the eyes of the judgment, so much wanted in choosing one\u2019s way of life; and the matrimonial choice is very liable to error, and it needs great caution and the special favour of heaven to make it a good one.", " But so deep an impression had the rejection of Quiteria made on Camacho\u2019s mind that it banished her at once from his thoughts; and so the counsels of the priest, who was a wise and kindly disposed man, prevailed with him, and by their means he and his partisans were pacified and tranquillised, and to prove it put up their swords again, inveighing against the pliancy of Quiteria rather than the craftiness of Basilio; Camacho maintaining that, if Quiteria as a maiden had such a love for Basilio, she would have loved him too as a married woman, and that he ought to thank heaven more for having taken her than for having given her. Camacho and those of his following, therefore, being consoled and pacified, those on Basilio\u2019s side were appeased; and the rich Camacho, to show that he felt no resentment for the trick, and did not care about it, desired the festival to go on just as if he were married in reality.", " \u201cIn this case,\u201d said he, \u201cit will be only to say \u2018yes,\u2019 and no consequences can follow the utterance of the word, for the nuptial couch of this marriage must be the grave.\u201d Camacho was listening to all this, perplexed and bewildered and not knowing what to say or do; but so urgent were the entreaties of Basilio\u2019s friends, imploring him to allow Quiteria to give him her hand, so that his soul, quitting this life in despair, should not be lost, that they moved, nay, forced him, to say that if Quiteria were willing to give it he was satisfied, as it was only putting off the fulfillment of his wishes for a moment. At once all assailed Quiteria and pressed her, some with prayers, and others with tears, and others with persuasive arguments, to give her hand to poor Basilio; but she, harder than marble and more unmoved than any statue, seemed unable or unwilling to utter a word, nor would she have given any reply had not the priest bade her decide quickly what she meant to do, as Basilio now had his soul at his teeth, and there was no time for hesitation."], "What ploy does Basilio use to marry Quiteria, just as she is about to marry Camacho?": [" He has provided dancers too, not only sword but also bell-dancers, for in his own town there are those who ring the changes and jingle the bells to perfection; of shoe-dancers I say nothing, for of them he has engaged a host.

To make a grand match for himself, and he without a farthing; is there nothing else? Faith, se\u00f1or, it\u2019s my opinion the poor man should be content with what he can get, and not go looking for dainties in the bottom of the sea. I will bet my arm that Camacho could bury Basilio in reals; and if that be so, as no doubt it is, what a fool Quiteria would be to refuse the fine dresses and jewels Camacho must have given her and will give her, and take Basilio\u2019s bar-throwing and sword-play.", " Basilio, however, reviving slightly, said in a weak voice, as though in pain, \u201cIf thou wouldst consent, cruel Quiteria, to give me thy hand as my bride in this last fatal moment, I might still hope that my rashness would find pardon, as by its means I attained the bliss of being thine.\u201d Hearing this the priest bade him think of the welfare of his soul rather than of the cravings of the body, and in all earnestness implore God\u2019s pardon for his sins and for his rash resolve; to which Basilio replied that he was determined not to confess unless Quiteria first gave him her hand in marriage, for that happiness would compose his mind and give him courage to make his confession. Don Quixote hearing the wounded man\u2019s entreaty, exclaimed aloud that what Basilio asked was just and reasonable, and moreover a request that might be easily complied with; and that it would be as much to Se\u00f1or Camacho\u2019s honour to receive the lady Quiteria as the widow of the brave Basilio as if he received her direct from her father."], "What happens to Don Quixote when Sancho and Balsilio\u2019s cousin lower him into Montesino\u2019s Cave?": [" Don Quixote begged the fencing licentiate to find him a guide to show him the way to the cave of Montesinos, as he had a great desire to enter it and see with his own eyes if the wonderful tales that were told of it all over the country were true. The licentiate said he would get him a cousin of his own, a famous scholar, and one very much given to reading books of chivalry, who would have great pleasure in conducting him to the mouth of the very cave, and would show him the lakes of Ruidera, which were likewise famous all over La Mancha, and even all over Spain; and he assured him he would find him entertaining, for he was a youth who could write books good enough to be printed and dedicated to princes. The cousin arrived at last, leading an ass in foal, with a pack-saddle covered with a parti-coloured carpet or sackcloth; Sancho saddled Rocinante, got Dapple ready, and stocked his alforjas, along with which went those of the cousin, likewise well filled; and so, commending themselves to God and bidding farewell to all, they set out, taking the road for the famous cave of Montesinos.", " Don Quixote explained his wish, and begged him to ask his ape at once to tell him whether certain things which had happened to him in the cave of Montesinos were dreams or realities, for to him they appeared to partake of both.

Nay! to ask foolish things and answer nonsense I needn\u2019t go looking for help from my neighbours.\u201d \u201cThou hast said more than thou art aware of, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cfor there are some who weary themselves out in learning and proving things that, after they are known and proved, are not worth a farthing to the understanding or memory.\u201d In this and other pleasant conversation the day went by, and that night they put up at a small hamlet whence it was not more than two leagues to the cave of Montesinos, so the cousin told Don Quixote, adding, that if he was bent upon entering it, it would be requisite for him to provide himself with ropes, so that he might be tied and lowered into its depths.", " \u201cLittle better than an hour,\u201d replied Sancho. \u201cThat cannot be,\u201d returned Don Quixote, \u201cbecause night overtook me while I was there, and day came, and it was night again and day again three times; so that, by my reckoning, I have been three days in those remote regions beyond our ken.\u201d \u201cMy master must be right,\u201d replied Sancho; \u201cfor as everything that has happened to him is by enchantment, maybe what seems to us an hour would seem three days and nights there.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d said Don Quixote. \u201cAnd did your worship eat anything all that time, se\u00f1or?\u201d asked the cousin. \u201cI never touched a morsel,\u201d answered Don Quixote, \u201cnor did I feel hunger, or think of it.\u201d \u201cAnd do the enchanted eat?\u201d said the cousin. \u201cThey neither eat,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cnor are they subject to the greater excrements, though it is thought that their nails, beards, and hair grow.\u201d \u201cAnd do the enchanted sleep, now, se\u00f1or?\u201d asked Sancho."], "What does Cide Hamete Benengali say about Don Quixote\u2019s story from Montesino\u2019s Cave?": [" O se\u00f1or, se\u00f1or, for God\u2019s sake, consider yourself, have a care for your honour, and give no credit to this silly stuff that has left you scant and short of wits.\u201d \u201cThou talkest in this way because thou lovest me, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cand not being experienced in the things of the world, everything that has some difficulty about it seems to thee impossible; but time will pass, as I said before, and I will tell thee some of the things I saw down there which will make thee believe what I have related now, the truth of which admits of neither reply nor question.\u201d p23e.jpg (54K) CHAPTER XXIV.

Upon this Master Pedro, without answering, went back to fetch the ape, and, having placed it in front of Don Quixote and Sancho, said: \u201cSee here, se\u00f1or ape, this gentleman wishes to know whether certain things which happened to him in the cave called the cave of Montesinos were false or true.\u201d On his making the usual sign the ape mounted on his left shoulder and seemed to whisper in his ear, and Master Pedro said at once, \u201cThe ape says that the things you saw or that happened to you in that cave are, part of them false, part true; and that he only knows this and no more as regards this question; but if your worship wishes to know more, on Friday next he will answer all that may be asked him, for his virtue is at present exhausted, and will not return to him till Friday, as he has said.\u201d \u201cDid I not say, se\u00f1or,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cthat I could not bring myself to believe that all your worship said about the adventures in the cave was true, or even the half of it?\u201d \u201cThe course of events will tell, Sancho,\u201d replied Don Quixote; \u201ctime, that discloses all things, leaves nothing that it does not drag into the light of day, though it be buried in the bosom of the earth.", " p74b.jpg (391K) Full Size At last Don Quixote\u2019s end came, after he had received all the sacraments, and had in full and forcible terms expressed his detestation of books of chivalry. The notary was there at the time, and he said that in no book of chivalry had he ever read of any knight-errant dying in his bed so calmly and so like a Christian as Don Quixote, who amid the tears and lamentations of all present yielded up his spirit, that is to say died. On perceiving it the curate begged the notary to bear witness that Alonso Quixano the Good, commonly called Don Quixote of La Mancha, had passed away from this present life, and died naturally; and said he desired this testimony in order to remove the possibility of any other author save Cide Hamete Benengeli bringing him to life again falsely and making interminable stories out of his achievements. Such was the end of the Ingenious Gentleman of La Mancha, whose village Cide Hamete would not indicate precisely, in order to leave all the towns and villages of La Mancha to contend among themselves for the right to adopt him and claim him as a son, as the seven cities of Greece contended for Homer."], "What does Master Peter\u2019s ape puppet do?": [" Don Quixote at once asked the landlord what this Master Pedro was, and what was the show and what was the ape he had with him; which the landlord replied, \u201cThis is a famous puppet-showman, who for some time past has been going about this Mancha de Aragon, exhibiting a show of the release of Melisendra by the famous Don Gaiferos, one of the best and best-represented stories that have been seen in this part of the kingdom for many a year; he has also with him an ape with the most extraordinary gift ever seen in an ape or imagined in a human being; for if you ask him anything, he listens attentively to the question, and then jumps on his master\u2019s shoulder, and pressing close to his ear tells him the answer which Master Pedro then delivers. He says a great deal more about things past than about things to come; and though he does not always hit the truth in every case, most times he is not far wrong, so that he makes us fancy he has got the devil in him.", " Don Quixote was not very well satisfied with the divinations of the ape, as he did not think it proper that an ape should divine anything, either past or future; so while Master Pedro was arranging the show, he retired with Sancho into a corner of the stable, where, without being overheard by anyone, he said to him, \u201cLook here, Sancho, I have been seriously thinking over this ape\u2019s extraordinary gift, and have come to the conclusion that beyond doubt this Master Pedro, his master, has a pact, tacit or express, with the devil.\u201d \u201cIf the packet is express from the devil,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cit must be a very dirty packet no doubt; but what good can it do Master Pedro to have such packets?\u201d \u201cThou dost not understand me, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cI only mean he must have made some compact with the devil to infuse this power into the ape, that he may get his living, and after he has grown rich he will give him his soul, which is what the enemy of mankind wants; this I am led to believe by observing that the ape only answers about things past or present, and the devil\u2019s knowledge extends no further; for the future he knows only by guesswork, and that not always; for it is reserved for God alone to know the times and the seasons, and for him there is neither past nor future; all is present.", " He gets two reals for every question if the ape answers; I mean if his master answers for him after he has whispered into his ear; and so it is believed that this same Master Pedro is very rich. He is a \u2018gallant man\u2019 as they say in Italy, and good company, and leads the finest life in the world; talks more than six, drinks more than a dozen, and all by his tongue, and his ape, and his show.\u201d Master Pedro now came back, and in a cart followed the show and the ape\u2014a big one, without a tail and with buttocks as bare as felt, but not vicious-looking. As soon as Don Quixote saw him, he asked him, \u201cCan you tell me, sir fortune-teller, what fish do we catch, and how will it be with us? See, here are my two reals,\u201d and he bade Sancho give them to Master Pedro; but he answered for the ape and said, \u201cSe\u00f1or, this animal does not give any answer or information touching things that are to come; of things past he knows something, and more or less of things present.\u201d \u201cGad,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cI would not give a farthing to be told what\u2019s past with me, for who knows that better than I do myself?", " God help every one to his own, Master Pedro, and let us all proceed fairly and honestly; and now go on.\u201d Master Pedro, perceiving that Don Quixote was beginning to wander, and return to his original fancy, was not disposed to let him escape, so he said to him, \u201cThis cannot be Melisendra, but must be one of the damsels that waited on her; so if I\u2019m given sixty maravedis for her, I\u2019ll be content and sufficiently paid.\u201d And so he went on, putting values on ever so many more smashed figures, which, after the two arbitrators had adjusted them to the satisfaction of both parties, came to forty reals and three-quarters; and over and above this sum, which Sancho at once disbursed, Master Pedro asked for two reals for his trouble in catching the ape. \u201cLet him have them, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cnot to catch the ape, but to get drunk; and two hundred would I give this minute for the good news, to anyone who could tell me positively, that the lady Do\u00f1a Melisandra and Se\u00f1or Don Gaiferos were now in France and with their own people.\u201d \u201cNo one could tell us that better than my ape,\u201d said Master Pedro; \u201cbut there\u2019s no devil that could catch him now; I suspect, however, that affection and hunger will drive him to come looking for me to-night; but to-morrow will soon be here and we shall see.\u201d In short, the puppet-show storm passed off, and all supped in peace and good fellowship at Don Quixote\u2019s expense, for he was the height of generosity."], "According to the man with the weapons, what behavior has provoked war between two neighbouring villages?": [" For I would have you know, Sir Errant, that in these little villages everything is talked about and everything is carped at, and rest assured, as I am, that the priest must be over and above good who forces his parishioners to speak well of him, especially in villages.\u201d \u201cThat is the truth,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cbut go on, for the story is very good, and you, good Pedro, tell it with very good grace.\u201d \u201cMay that of the Lord not be wanting to me,\u201d said Pedro; \u201cthat is the one to have. To proceed; you must know that though the uncle put before his niece and described to her the qualities of each one in particular of the many who had asked her in marriage, begging her to marry and make a choice according to her own taste, she never gave any other answer than that she had no desire to marry just yet, and that being so young she did not think herself fit to bear the burden of matrimony. At these, to all appearance, reasonable excuses that she made, her uncle ceased to urge her, and waited till she was somewhat more advanced in age and could mate herself to her own liking.", " Let this new Samson remain in his own country, and, bringing honour to it, bring honour at the same time on the grey heads of his venerable parents; for I will be content with any squire that comes to hand, as Sancho does not deign to accompany me.\u201d \u201cI do deign,\u201d said Sancho, deeply moved and with tears in his eyes; \u201cit shall not be said of me, master mine,\u201d he continued, \u201c\u2018the bread eaten and the company dispersed.\u2019 Nay, I come of no ungrateful stock, for all the world knows, but particularly my own town, who the Panzas from whom I am descended were; and, what is more, I know and have learned, by many good words and deeds, your worship\u2019s desire to show me favour; and if I have been bargaining more or less about my wages, it was only to please my wife, who, when she sets herself to press a point, no hammer drives the hoops of a cask as she drives one to do what she wants; but, after all, a man must be a man, and a woman a woman; and as I am a man anyhow, which I can\u2019t deny, I will be one in my own house too, let who will take it amiss; and so there\u2019s nothing more to do but for your worship to make your will with its codicil in such a way that it can\u2019t be provoked, and let us set out at once, to save Se\u00f1or Samson\u2019s soul from suffering, as he says his conscience obliges him to persuade your worship to sally out upon the world a third time; so I offer again to serve your worship faithfully and loyally, as well and better than all the squires that served knights-errant in times past or present.\u201d The bachelor was filled with amazement when he heard Sancho\u2019s phraseology and style of talk, for though he had read the first part of his master\u2019s history he never thought that he could be so droll as he was there described; but now, hearing him talk of a \u201cwill and codicil that could not be provoked,\u201d instead of \u201cwill and codicil that could not be revoked,\u201d he believed all he had read of him, and set him down as one of the greatest simpletons of modern times; and he said to himself that two such lunatics as master and man the world had never seen.", " As a child she was beautiful, she continued to grow in beauty, and at the age of sixteen she was most lovely. The fame of her beauty began to spread abroad through all the villages around\u2014but why do I say the villages around, merely, when it spread to distant cities, and even made its way into the halls of royalty and reached the ears of people of every class, who came from all sides to see her as if to see something rare and curious, or some wonder-working image? Her father watched over her and she watched over herself; for there are no locks, or guards, or bolts that can protect a young girl better than her own modesty. The wealth of the father and the beauty of the daughter led many neighbours as well as strangers to seek her for a wife; but he, as one might well be who had the disposal of so rich a jewel, was perplexed and unable to make up his mind to which of her countless suitors he should entrust her.", " Upon Don Quixote\u2019s approach a peasant called out, \u201cOne of these two gentlemen who come here, and who don\u2019t know the parties, will tell us what we ought to do about our wager.\u201d \u201cThat I will, certainly,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cand according to the rights of the case, if I can manage to understand it.\u201d \u201cWell, here it is, worthy sir,\u201d said the peasant; \u201ca man of this village who is so fat that he weighs twenty stone challenged another, a neighbour of his, who does not weigh more than nine, to run a race. The agreement was that they were to run a distance of a hundred paces with equal weights; and when the challenger was asked how the weights were to be equalised he said that the other, as he weighed nine stone, should put eleven in iron on his back, and that in this way the twenty stone of the thin man would equal the twenty stone of the fat one.\u201d \u201cNot at all,\u201d exclaimed Sancho at once, before Don Quixote could answer; \u201cit\u2019s for me, that only a few days ago left off being a governor and a judge, as all the world knows, to settle these doubtful questions and give an opinion in disputes of all sorts.\u201d \u201cAnswer in God\u2019s name, Sancho my friend,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cfor I am not fit to give crumbs to a cat, my wits are so confused and upset.\u201d With this permission Sancho said to the peasants who stood clustered round him, waiting with open mouths for the decision to come from his, \u201cBrothers, what the fat man requires is not in reason, nor has it a shadow of justice in it; because, if it be true, as they say, that the challenged may choose the weapons, the other has no right to choose such as will prevent and keep him from winning."], "The villagers who bray like asses attack ___.": [" Besides which, you have been told that it is folly to take offence at merely hearing a bray. I remember when I was a boy I brayed as often as I had a fancy, without anyone hindering me, and so elegantly and naturally that when I brayed all the asses in the town would bray; but I was none the less for that the son of my parents who were greatly respected; and though I was envied because of the gift by more than one of the high and mighty ones of the town, I did not care two farthings for it; and that you may see I am telling the truth, wait a bit and listen, for this art, like swimming, once learnt is never forgotten;\u201d and then, taking hold of his nose, he began to bray so vigorously that all the valleys around rang again. One of those, however, that stood near him, fancying he was mocking them, lifted up a long staff he had in his hand and smote him such a blow with it that Sancho dropped helpless to the ground.", " Here it is. I can bray to perfection, and if you can ever so little, the thing\u2019s as good as done.\u2019 \u2018Ever so little did you say, gossip?\u2019 said the other; \u2018by God, I\u2019ll not give in to anybody, not even to the asses themselves.\u2019 \u2018We\u2019ll soon see,\u2019 said the second regidor, \u2018for my plan is that you should go one side of the forest, and I the other, so as to go all round about it; and every now and then you will bray and I will bray; and it cannot be but that the ass will hear us, and answer us if he is in the forest.\u2019 To which the owner of the ass replied, \u2018It\u2019s an excellent plan, I declare, gossip, and worthy of your great genius;\u2019 and the two separating as agreed, it so fell out that they brayed almost at the same moment, and each, deceived by the braying of the other, ran to look, fancying the ass had turned up at last. When they came in sight of one another, said the loser, \u2018Is it possible, gossip, that it was not my ass that brayed?\u2019 \u2018No, it was I,\u2019 said the other.", " halt! ye merry, jovial crew! I want to teach you how to treat asses and animals that serve the squires of knights-errant for steeds.\u201d So loud were the shouts of Don Quixote, that those in the cart heard and understood them, and, guessing by the words what the speaker\u2019s intention was, Death in an instant jumped out of the cart, and the emperor, the devil carter and the angel after him, nor did the queen or the god Cupid stay behind; and all armed themselves with stones and formed in line, prepared to receive Don Quixote on the points of their pebbles. Don Quixote, when he saw them drawn up in such a gallant array with uplifted arms ready for a mighty discharge of stones, checked Rocinante and began to consider in what way he could attack them with the least danger to himself. As he halted Sancho came up, and seeing him disposed to attack this well-ordered squadron, said to him, \u201cIt would be the height of madness to attempt such an enterprise; remember, se\u00f1or, that against sops from the brook, and plenty of them, there is no defensive armour in the world, except to stow oneself away under a brass bell; and besides, one should remember that it is rashness, and not valour, for a single man to attack an army that has Death in it, and where emperors fight in person, with angels, good and bad, to help them; and if this reflection will not make you keep quiet, perhaps it will to know for certain that among all these, though they look like kings, princes, and emperors, there is not a single knight-errant.\u201d \u201cNow indeed thou hast hit the point, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cwhich may and should turn me from the resolution I had already formed.", " \u201cThere\u2019s where it is, what I abominate, Se\u00f1or Samson,\u201d said Sancho here; \u201cmy master will attack a hundred armed men as a greedy boy would half a dozen melons. Body of the world, se\u00f1or bachelor! there is a time to attack and a time to retreat, and it is not to be always \u2018Santiago, and close Spain!\u2019 Moreover, I have heard it said (and I think by my master himself, if I remember rightly) that the mean of valour lies between the extremes of cowardice and rashness; and if that be so, I don\u2019t want him to fly without having good reason, or to attack when the odds make it better not. But, above all things, I warn my master that if he is to take me with him it must be on the condition that he is to do all the fighting, and that I am not to be called upon to do anything except what concerns keeping him clean and comfortable; in this I will dance attendance on him readily; but to expect me to draw sword, even against rascally churls of the hatchet and hood, is idle."], "What is the real social station of the character referred to as \u201cCountess Trifaldi\u201d?": [" p37e.jpg (21K) CHAPTER XXXVIII.

Don Quixote and Sancho got up rather shaken, and, looking about them, were filled with amazement at finding themselves in the same garden from which they had started, and seeing such a number of people stretched on the ground; and their astonishment was increased when at one side of the garden they perceived a tall lance planted in the ground, and hanging from it by two cords of green silk a smooth white parchment on which there was the following inscription in large gold letters: \u201cThe illustrious knight Don Quixote of La Mancha has, by merely attempting it, finished and concluded the adventure of the Countess Trifaldi, otherwise called the Distressed Duenna; Malambruno is now satisfied on every point, the chins of the duennas are now smooth and clean, and King Don Clavijo and Queen Antonomasia in their original form; and when the squirely flagellation shall have been completed, the white dove shall find herself delivered from the pestiferous gerfalcons that persecute her, and in the arms of her beloved mate; for such is the decree of the sage Merlin, arch-enchanter of enchanters.\u201d As soon as Don Quixote had read the inscription on the parchment he perceived clearly that it referred to the disenchantment of Dulcinea, and returning hearty thanks to heaven that he had with so little danger achieved so grand an exploit as to restore to their former complexion the countenances of those venerable duennas, he advanced towards the duke and duchess, who had not yet come to themselves, and taking the duke by the hand he said, \u201cBe of good cheer, worthy sir, be of good cheer; it\u2019s nothing at all; the adventure is now over and without any harm done, as the inscription fixed on this post shows plainly.\u201d The duke came to himself slowly and like one recovering consciousness after a heavy sleep, and the duchess and all who had fallen prostrate about the garden did the same, with such demonstrations of wonder and amazement that they would have almost persuaded one that what they pretended so adroitly in jest had happened to them in reality."], "According to the story that the Countess tells Don Quixote, why does she seek his help?": [" p37e.jpg (21K) CHAPTER XXXVIII.

The ecclesiastic took his seat opposite to him, and the duke and duchess those at the sides. All this time Sancho stood by, gaping with amazement at the honour he saw shown to his master by these illustrious persons; and observing all the ceremonious pressing that had passed between the duke and Don Quixote to induce him to take his seat at the head of the table, he said, \u201cIf your worship will give me leave I will tell you a story of what happened in my village about this matter of seats.\u201d The moment Sancho said this Don Quixote trembled, making sure that he was about to say something foolish.", " Now, I say, is the time when the virtue that is in thee is ripe, and endowed with efficacy to work the good that is looked for from thee.\u201d To which Sancho made answer, \u201cThat\u2019s trick upon trick, I think, and not honey upon pancakes; a nice thing it would be for a whipping to come now, on the top of pinches, smacks, and pin-proddings!

This horse, according to ancient tradition, was made by Merlin. He lent him to Pierres, who was a friend of his, and who made long journeys with him, and, as has been said, carried off the fair Magalona, bearing her through the air on its haunches and making all who beheld them from the earth gape with astonishment; and he never lent him save to those whom he loved or those who paid him well; and since the great Pierres we know of no one having mounted him until now."], "What does Don Quixote want Sancho to believe, in exchange for him believing Sancho\u2019s story about the goats in heaven?": [" It is true I felt that I was passing through the region of the air, and even that I touched that of fire; but that we passed farther I cannot believe; for the region of fire being between the heaven of the moon and the last region of the air, we could not have reached that heaven where the seven goats Sancho speaks of are without being burned; and as we were not burned, either Sancho is lying or Sancho is dreaming.\u201d \u201cI am neither lying nor dreaming,\u201d said Sancho; \u201conly ask me the tokens of those same goats, and you\u2019ll see by that whether I\u2019m telling the truth or not.\u201d \u201cTell us them then, Sancho,\u201d said the duchess. \u201cTwo of them,\u201d said Sancho, \u201care green, two blood-red, two blue, and one a mixture of all colours.\u201d \u201cAn odd sort of goat, that,\u201d said the duke; \u201cin this earthly region of ours we have no such colours; I mean goats of such colours.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s very plain,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cof course there must be a difference between the goats of heaven and the goats of the earth.\u201d \u201cTell me, Sancho,\u201d said the duke, \u201cdid you see any he-goat among those goats?\u201d \u201cNo, se\u00f1or,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cbut I have heard say that none ever passed the horns of the moon.\u201d They did not care to ask him anything more about his journey, for they saw he was in the vein to go rambling all over the heavens giving an account of everything that went on there, without having ever stirred from the garden.", " The fisherman got into the boat and carried one goat over; he came back and carried another over; he came back again, and again brought over another\u2014let your worship keep count of the goats the fisherman is taking across, for if one escapes the memory there will be an end of the story, and it will be impossible to tell another word of it.

So I come and take, and what do I do? without saying anything to anybody, not even to my master, softly and quietly I got down from Clavile\u00f1o and amused myself with the goats\u2014which are like violets, like flowers\u2014for nigh three-quarters of an hour; and Clavile\u00f1o never stirred or moved from one spot.\u201d \u201cAnd while the good Sancho was amusing himself with the goats,\u201d said the duke, \u201chow did Se\u00f1or Don Quixote amuse himself?\u201d To which Don Quixote replied, \u201cAs all these things and such like occurrences are out of the ordinary course of nature, it is no wonder that Sancho says what he does; for my own part I can only say that I did not uncover my eyes either above or below, nor did I see sky or earth or sea or shore.", " \u201cCertainly not,\u201d replied Don Quixote; \u201cat least, during those three days I was with them not one of them closed an eye, nor did I either.\u201d \u201cThe proverb, \u2018Tell me what company thou keepest and I\u2019ll tell thee what thou art,\u2019 is to the point here,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cyour worship keeps company with enchanted people that are always fasting and watching; what wonder is it, then, that you neither eat nor sleep while you are with them?

So having laid their plans and given instructions to their servants and vassals how to behave to Sancho in his government of the promised island, the next day, that following Clavile\u00f1o\u2019s flight, the duke told Sancho to prepare and get ready to go and be governor, for his islanders were already looking out for him as for the showers of May.", " And the first thing I have got to say is, that for my own part I hold my master Don Quixote to be stark mad, though sometimes he says things that, to my mind, and indeed everybody\u2019s that listens to him, are so wise, and run in such a straight furrow, that Satan himself could not have said them better; but for all that, really, and beyond all question, it\u2019s my firm belief he is cracked. Well, then, as this is clear to my mind, I can venture to make him believe things that have neither head nor tail, like that affair of the answer to the letter, and that other of six or eight days ago, which is not yet in history, that is to say, the affair of the enchantment of my lady Dulcinea; for I made him believe she is enchanted, though there\u2019s no more truth in it than over the hills of \u00dabeda.\u201d The duchess begged him to tell her about the enchantment or deception, so Sancho told the whole story exactly as it had happened, and his hearers were not a little amused by it; and then resuming, the duchess said, \u201cIn consequence of what worthy Sancho has told me, a doubt starts up in my mind, and there comes a kind of whisper to my ear that says, \u2018If Don Quixote be mad, crazy, and cracked, and Sancho Panza his squire knows it, and, notwithstanding, serves and follows him, and goes trusting to his empty promises, there can be no doubt he must be still madder and sillier than his master; and that being so, it will be cast in your teeth, se\u00f1ora duchess, if you give the said Sancho an island to govern; for how will he who does not know how to govern himself know how to govern others?\u2019\u201d \u201cBy God, se\u00f1ora,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cbut that doubt comes timely; but your grace may say it out, and speak plainly, or as you like; for I know what you say is true, and if I were wise I should have left my master long ago; but this was my fate, this was my bad luck; I can\u2019t help it, I must follow him; we\u2019re from the same village, I\u2019ve eaten his bread, I\u2019m fond of him, I\u2019m grateful, he gave me his ass-colts, and above all I\u2019m faithful; so it\u2019s quite impossible for anything to separate us, except the pickaxe and shovel.", " \u201cSo much the better,\u201d said the duke, \u201cfor many droll things cannot be said in few words; but not to lose time in talking, come, great Knight of the Rueful Countenance\u2014\u201d \u201cOf the Lions, your highness must say,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cfor there is no Rueful Countenance nor any such character now.\u201d \u201cHe of the Lions be it,\u201d continued the duke; \u201cI say, let Sir Knight of the Lions come to a castle of mine close by, where he shall be given that reception which is due to so exalted a personage, and which the duchess and I are wont to give to all knights-errant who come there.\u201d By this time Sancho had fixed and girthed Rocinante\u2019s saddle, and Don Quixote having got on his back and the duke mounted a fine horse, they placed the duchess in the middle and set out for the castle. The duchess desired Sancho to come to her side, for she found infinite enjoyment in listening to his shrewd remarks. Sancho required no pressing, but pushed himself in between them and the duke, who thought it rare good fortune to receive such a knight-errant and such a homely squire in their castle."], "What kind of advice does Don Quixote offer Sancho before the latter\u2019s departure to become a governor?": [" In fine, Don Quixote and Sancho embraced one another and made friends, and by the advice and with the approval of the great Carrasco, who was now their oracle, it was arranged that their departure should take place three days thence, by which time they could have all that was requisite for the journey ready, and procure a closed helmet, which Don Quixote said he must by all means take. Samson offered him one, as he knew a friend of his who had it would not refuse it to him, though it was more dingy with rust and mildew than bright and clean like burnished steel. The curses which both housekeeper and niece poured out on the bachelor were past counting; they tore their hair, they clawed their faces, and in the style of the hired mourners that were once in fashion, they raised a lamentation over the departure of their master and uncle, as if it had been his death. Samson\u2019s intention in persuading him to sally forth once more was to do what the history relates farther on; all by the advice of the curate and barber, with whom he had previously discussed the subject.", " I don\u2019t set up to be a fighting man, Se\u00f1or Samson, but only the best and most loyal squire that ever served knight-errant; and if my master Don Quixote, in consideration of my many faithful services, is pleased to give me some island of the many his worship says one may stumble on in these parts, I will take it as a great favour; and if he does not give it to me, I was born like everyone else, and a man must not live in dependence on anyone except God; and what is more, my bread will taste as well, and perhaps even better, without a government than if I were a governor; and how do I know but that in these governments the devil may have prepared some trip for me, to make me lose my footing and fall and knock my grinders out? Sancho I was born and Sancho I mean to die. But for all that, if heaven were to make me a fair offer of an island or something else of the kind, without much trouble and without much risk, I am not such a fool as to refuse it; for they say, too, \u2018when they offer thee a heifer, run with a halter; and \u2018when good luck comes to thee, take it in.\u2019\u201d \u201cBrother Sancho,\u201d said Carrasco, \u201cyou have spoken like a professor; but, for all that, put your trust in God and in Se\u00f1or Don Quixote, for he will give you a kingdom, not to say an island.\u201d \u201cIt is all the same, be it more or be it less,\u201d replied Sancho; \u201cthough I can tell Se\u00f1or Carrasco that my master would not throw the kingdom he might give me into a sack all in holes; for I have felt my own pulse and I find myself sound enough to rule kingdoms and govern islands; and I have before now told my master as much.\u201d \u201cTake care, Sancho,\u201d said Samson; \u201chonours change manners, and perhaps when you find yourself a governor you won\u2019t know the mother that bore you.\u201d \u201cThat may hold good of those that are born in the ditches,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cnot of those who have the fat of an old Christian four fingers deep on their souls, as I have.", " And I would have thee know, Sancho, that if the naked truth, undisguised by flattery, came to the ears of princes, times would be different, and other ages would be reckoned iron ages more than ours, which I hold to be the golden of these latter days. Profit by this advice, Sancho, and report to me clearly and faithfully the truth of what thou knowest touching what I have demanded of thee.\u201d \u201cThat I will do with all my heart, master,\u201d replied Sancho, \u201cprovided your worship will not be vexed at what I say, as you wish me to say it out in all its nakedness, without putting any more clothes on it than it came to my knowledge in.\u201d \u201cI will not be vexed at all,\u201d returned Don Quixote; \u201cthou mayest speak freely, Sancho, and without any beating about the bush.\u201d \u201cWell then,\u201d said he, \u201cfirst of all, I have to tell you that the common people consider your worship a mighty great madman, and me no less a fool.", " Before it was daylight the man with the lances and halberds took his departure, and soon after daybreak the cousin and the page came to bid Don Quixote farewell, the former returning home, the latter resuming his journey, towards which, to help him, Don Quixote gave him twelve reals. Master Pedro did not care to engage in any more palaver with Don Quixote, whom he knew right well; so he rose before the sun, and having got together the remains of his show and caught his ape, he too went off to seek his adventures. The landlord, who did not know Don Quixote, was as much astonished at his mad freaks as at his generosity. To conclude, Sancho, by his master\u2019s orders, paid him very liberally, and taking leave of him they quitted the inn at about eight in the morning and took to the road, where we will leave them to pursue their journey, for this is necessary in order to allow certain other matters to be set forth, which are required to clear up this famous history."], "According to Cervantes, whose arrival must Sancho await before he begins governing?": [" It is the mean, prosaic, commonplace character of all the surroundings and circumstances that gives a significance to Don Quixote\u2019s vigil and the ceremony that follows. Cervantes\u2019 humour is for the most part of that broader and simpler sort, the strength of which lies in the perception of the incongruous. It is the incongruity of Sancho in all his ways, words, and works, with the ideas and aims of his master, quite as much as the wonderful vitality and truth to nature of the character, that makes him the most humorous creation in the whole range of fiction. That unsmiling gravity of which Cervantes was the first great master, \u201cCervantes\u2019 serious air,\u201d which sits naturally on Swift alone, perhaps, of later humourists, is essential to this kind of humour, and here again Cervantes has suffered at the hands of his interpreters. Nothing, unless indeed the coarse buffoonery of Phillips, could be more out of place in an attempt to represent Cervantes, than a flippant, would-be facetious style, like that of Motteux\u2019s version for example, or the sprightly, jaunty air, French translators sometimes adopt.", " \u201cI have given up being governor of an island,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cand such a one, faith, as you won\u2019t find the like of easily.\u201d \u201cAnd where is this island?\u201d said Ricote. \u201cWhere?\u201d said Sancho; \u201ctwo leagues from here, and it is called the island of Barataria.\u201d \u201cNonsense! Sancho,\u201d said Ricote; \u201cislands are away out in the sea; there are no islands on the mainland.\u201d \u201cWhat? No islands!\u201d said Sancho; \u201cI tell thee, friend Ricote, I left it this morning, and yesterday I was governing there as I pleased like a sagittarius; but for all that I gave it up, for it seemed to me a dangerous office, a governor\u2019s.\u201d \u201cAnd what hast thou gained by the government?\u201d asked Ricote. \u201cI have gained,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cthe knowledge that I am no good for governing, unless it is a drove of cattle, and that the riches that are to be got by these governments are got at the cost of one\u2019s rest and sleep, ay and even one\u2019s food; for in islands the governors must eat little, especially if they have doctors to look after their health.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t understand thee, Sancho,\u201d said Ricote; \u201cbut it seems to me all nonsense thou art talking.", " Seeing that the story of \u201cDon Quixote\u201d and all its characters and incidents have now been for more than two centuries and a half familiar as household words in English mouths, it seems to me that the old familiar names and phrases should not be changed without good reason. Of course a translator who holds that \u201cDon Quixote\u201d should receive the treatment a great classic deserves, will feel himself bound by the injunction laid upon the Morisco in Chap. IX not to omit or add anything. II: ABOUT CERVANTES AND DON QUIXOTE Four generations had laughed over \u201cDon Quixote\u201d before it occurred to anyone to ask, who and what manner of man was this Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra whose name is on the title-page; and it was too late for a satisfactory answer to the question when it was proposed to add a life of the author to the London edition published at Lord Carteret\u2019s instance in 1738. All traces of the personality of Cervantes had by that time disappeared.", " In fact Cervantes had no case, or a very bad one, as far as the mere continuation was concerned. But Avellaneda chose to write a preface to it, full of such coarse personal abuse as only an ill-conditioned man could pour out. He taunts Cervantes with being old, with having lost his hand, with having been in prison, with being poor, with being friendless, accuses him of envy of Lope\u2019s success, of petulance and querulousness, and so on; and it was in this that the sting lay. Avellaneda\u2019s reason for this personal attack is obvious enough. Whoever he may have been, it is clear that he was one of the dramatists of Lope\u2019s school, for he has the impudence to charge Cervantes with attacking him as well as Lope in his criticism on the drama. His identification has exercised the best critics and baffled all the ingenuity and research that has been brought to bear on it. Navarrete and Ticknor both incline to the belief that Cervantes knew who he was; but I must say I think the anger he shows suggests an invisible assailant; it is like the irritation of a man stung by a mosquito in the dark."], "What honorific title does Sancho refuse as governor of the town?": [" In the midst marched Sancho with his staff, as fine a sight as one could wish to see, and but a few streets of the town had been traversed when they heard a noise as of a clashing of swords. They hastened to the spot, and found that the combatants were but two, who seeing the authorities approaching stood still, and one of them exclaimed, \u201cHelp, in the name of God and the king! Are men to be allowed to rob in the middle of this town, and rush out and attack people in the very streets?\u201d \u201cBe calm, my good man,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cand tell me what the cause of this quarrel is; for I am the governor.\u201d Said the other combatant, \u201cSe\u00f1or governor, I will tell you in a very few words. Your worship must know that this gentleman has just now won more than a thousand reals in that gambling house opposite, and God knows how. I was there, and gave more than one doubtful point in his favour, very much against what my conscience told me.", " God guide thee, Sancho, and govern thee in thy government, and deliver me from the misgiving I have that thou wilt turn the whole island upside down, a thing I might easily prevent by explaining to the duke what thou art and telling him that all that fat little person of thine is nothing else but a sack full of proverbs and sauciness.\u201d \u201cSe\u00f1or,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cif your worship thinks I\u2019m not fit for this government, I give it up on the spot; for the mere black of the nail of my soul is dearer to me than my whole body; and I can live just as well, simple Sancho, on bread and onions, as governor, on partridges and capons; and what\u2019s more, while we\u2019re asleep we\u2019re all equal, great and small, rich and poor. But if your worship looks into it, you will see it was your worship alone that put me on to this business of governing; for I know no more about the government of islands than a buzzard; and if there\u2019s any reason to think that because of my being a governor the devil will get hold of me, I\u2019d rather go Sancho to heaven than governor to hell.\u201d \u201cBy God, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cfor those last words thou hast uttered alone, I consider thou deservest to be governor of a thousand islands.", " I don\u2019t set up to be a fighting man, Se\u00f1or Samson, but only the best and most loyal squire that ever served knight-errant; and if my master Don Quixote, in consideration of my many faithful services, is pleased to give me some island of the many his worship says one may stumble on in these parts, I will take it as a great favour; and if he does not give it to me, I was born like everyone else, and a man must not live in dependence on anyone except God; and what is more, my bread will taste as well, and perhaps even better, without a government than if I were a governor; and how do I know but that in these governments the devil may have prepared some trip for me, to make me lose my footing and fall and knock my grinders out?

Then the boys took to it, which was the same thing for it as getting into the hands and mouths of all the devils of hell; and braying spread from one town to another in such a way that the men of the braying town are as easy to be known as blacks are to be known from whites, and the unlucky joke has gone so far that several times the scoffed have come out in arms and in a body to do battle with the scoffers, and neither king nor rook, fear nor shame, can mend matters. To-morrow or the day after, I believe, the men of my town, that is, of the braying town, are going to take the field against another village two leagues away from ours, one of those that persecute us most; and that we may turn out well prepared I have bought these lances and halberds you have seen."], "What is in the bag that the servants lower onto Don Quixote\u2019s balcony as he sings a ballad for Dulcinea?": [" This seemed to him to fit exactly the case in which he found himself, so, making a show of severe suffering, he began to roll on the ground and with feeble breath repeat the very words which the wounded knight of the wood is said to have uttered: Where art thou, lady mine, that thou My sorrow dost not rue? Thou canst not know it, lady mine, Or else thou art untrue. And so he went on with the ballad as far as the lines: O noble Marquis of Mantua, My Uncle and liege lord! p026.jpg (316K) Full Size As chance would have it, when he had got to this line there happened to come by a peasant from his own village, a neighbour of his, who had been with a load of wheat to the mill, and he, seeing the man stretched there, came up to him and asked him who he was and what was the matter with him that he complained so dolefully. Don Quixote was firmly persuaded that this was the Marquis of Mantua, his uncle, so the only answer he made was to go on with his ballad, in which he told the tale of his misfortune, and of the loves of the Emperor\u2019s son and his wife all exactly as the ballad sings it.", " Nay, only look at my disposition, is that likely to show ingratitude to anyone?\u201d \u201cGod grant it,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cwe shall see when the government comes; and I seem to see it already.\u201d He then begged the bachelor, if he were a poet, to do him the favour of composing some verses for him conveying the farewell he meant to take of his lady Dulcinea del Toboso, and to see that a letter of her name was placed at the beginning of each line, so that, at the end of the verses, \u201cDulcinea del Toboso\u201d might be read by putting together the first letters. The bachelor replied that although he was not one of the famous poets of Spain, who were, they said, only three and a half, he would not fail to compose the required verses; though he saw a great difficulty in the task, as the letters which made up the name were seventeen; so, if he made four ballad stanzas of four lines each, there would be a letter over, and if he made them of five, what they called decimas or redondillas, there were three letters short; nevertheless he would try to drop a letter as well as he could, so that the name \u201cDulcinea del Toboso\u201d might be got into four ballad stanzas.", " for Gaiferos ask\u2014 which I do not repeat here because prolixity begets disgust; suffice it to observe how Don Gaiferos discovers himself, and that by her joyful gestures Melisendra shows us she has recognised him; and what is more, we now see she lowers herself from the balcony to place herself on the haunches of her good husband\u2019s horse. But ah! unhappy lady, the edge of her petticoat has caught on one of the bars of the balcony and she is left hanging in the air, unable to reach the ground. But you see how compassionate heaven sends aid in our sorest need; Don Gaiferos advances, and without minding whether the rich petticoat is torn or not, he seizes her and by force brings her to the ground, and then with one jerk places her on the haunches of his horse, astraddle like a man, and bids her hold on tight and clasp her arms round his neck, crossing them on his breast so as not to fall, for the lady Melisendra was not used to that style of riding.", " He came along singing the ballad that says- Ill did ye fare, ye men of France, In Roncesvalles chase- \u201cMay I die, Sancho,\u201d said Don Quixote, when he heard him, \u201cif any good will come to us to-night! Dost thou not hear what that clown is singing?\u201d \u201cI do,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cbut what has Roncesvalles chase to do with what we have in hand? He might just as well be singing the ballad of Calainos, for any good or ill that can come to us in our business.\u201d By this time the labourer had come up, and Don Quixote asked him, \u201cCan you tell me, worthy friend, and God speed you, whereabouts here is the palace of the peerless princess Do\u00f1a Dulcinea del Toboso?\u201d \u201cSe\u00f1or,\u201d replied the lad, \u201cI am a stranger, and I have been only a few days in the town, doing farm work for a rich farmer. In that house opposite there live the curate of the village and the sacristan, and both or either of them will be able to give your worship some account of this lady princess, for they have a list of all the people of El Toboso; though it is my belief there is not a princess living in the whole of it; many ladies there are, of quality, and in her own house each of them may be a princess.\u201d \u201cWell, then, she I am inquiring for will be one of these, my friend,\u201d said Don Quixote."], "Following the arrival of the Duke\u2019s letter, what does Sancho fear that the town doctor is trying to do?": [" When I entered the room where he was I found him with an open letter in his hand, which, before I could utter a word, he gave me, saying, \u2018By this letter thou wilt see, Cardenio, the disposition the Duke Ricardo has to serve thee.\u2019 This Duke Ricardo, as you, sirs, probably know already, is a grandee of Spain who has his seat in the best part of this Andalusia. I took and read the letter, which was couched in terms so flattering that even I myself felt it would be wrong in my father not to comply with the request the duke made in it, which was that he would send me immediately to him, as he wished me to become the companion, not servant, of his eldest son, and would take upon himself the charge of placing me in a position corresponding to the esteem in which he held me. On reading the letter my voice failed me, and still more when I heard my father say, \u2018Two days hence thou wilt depart, Cardenio, in accordance with the duke\u2019s wish, and give thanks to God who is opening a road to thee by which thou mayest attain what I know thou dost deserve; and to these words he added others of fatherly counsel.", " My lord the duke wrote to me the other day to warn me that certain spies had got into this island to kill me; but up to the present I have not found out any except a certain doctor who receives a salary in this town for killing all the governors that come here; he is called Doctor Pedro Recio, and is from Tirteafuera; so you see what a name he has to make me dread dying under his hands. This doctor says of himself that he does not cure diseases when there are any, but prevents them coming, and the medicines he uses are diet and more diet until he brings one down to bare bones; as if leanness was not worse than fever. In short he is killing me with hunger, and I am dying myself of vexation; for when I thought I was coming to this government to get my meat hot and my drink cool, and take my ease between holland sheets on feather beds, I find I have come to do penance as if I was a hermit; and as I don\u2019t do it willingly I suspect that in the end the devil will carry me off.", " Thy husband, the governor, SANCHO PANZA When she had done reading the letter the duchess said to Sancho, \u201cOn two points the worthy governor goes rather astray; one is in saying or hinting that this government has been bestowed upon him for the lashes that he is to give himself, when he knows (and he cannot deny it) that when my lord the duke promised it to him nobody ever dreamt of such a thing as lashes; the other is that he shows himself here to be very covetous; and I would not have him a money-seeker, for \u2018covetousness bursts the bag,\u2019 and the covetous governor does ungoverned justice.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t mean it that way, se\u00f1ora,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cand if you think the letter doesn\u2019t run as it ought to do, it\u2019s only to tear it up and make another; and maybe it will be a worse one if it is left to my gumption.\u201d \u201cNo, no,\u201d said the duchess, \u201cthis one will do, and I wish the duke to see it.\u201d With this they betook themselves to a garden where they were to dine, and the duchess showed Sancho\u2019s letter to the duke, who was highly delighted with it.", " He replied, \u201cMy name, se\u00f1or governor, is Doctor Pedro Recio de Aguero I am a native of a place called Tirteafuera which lies between Caracuel and Almod\u00f3var del Campo, on the right-hand side, and I have the degree of doctor from the university of Osuna.\u201d To which Sancho, glowing all over with rage, returned, \u201cThen let Doctor Pedro Recio de Malaguero, native of Tirteafuera, a place that\u2019s on the right-hand side as we go from Caracuel to Almod\u00f3var del Campo, graduate of Osuna, get out of my presence at once; or I swear by the sun I\u2019ll take a cudgel, and by dint of blows, beginning with him, I\u2019ll not leave a doctor in the whole island; at least of those I know to be ignorant; for as to learned, wise, sensible physicians, them I will reverence and honour as divine persons. Once more I say let Pedro Recio get out of this or I\u2019ll take this chair I am sitting on and break it over his head.

Yielding to this conviction, the worthy chaplain begged the governor to have the clothes in which the licentiate had entered the house given to him. The governor again bade him beware of what he was doing, as the licentiate was beyond a doubt still mad; but all his cautions and warnings were unavailing to dissuade the chaplain from taking him away.

She complied and disclosed what no one could have ever anticipated, for she disclosed the countenance of Do\u00f1a Rodriguez, the duenna of the house; the other female in mourning being her daughter, who had been made a fool of by the rich farmer\u2019s son."], "What does the mock battle in which Sancho participates as governor convince him of?": [" God guide thee, Sancho, and govern thee in thy government, and deliver me from the misgiving I have that thou wilt turn the whole island upside down, a thing I might easily prevent by explaining to the duke what thou art and telling him that all that fat little person of thine is nothing else but a sack full of proverbs and sauciness.\u201d \u201cSe\u00f1or,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cif your worship thinks I\u2019m not fit for this government, I give it up on the spot; for the mere black of the nail of my soul is dearer to me than my whole body; and I can live just as well, simple Sancho, on bread and onions, as governor, on partridges and capons; and what\u2019s more, while we\u2019re asleep we\u2019re all equal, great and small, rich and poor.

He asked also who was in the coach, whither they were bound and what money they had, and one of the men on horseback replied, \u201cThe persons in the coach are my lady Do\u00f1a Guiomar de Qui\u00f1ones, wife of the regent of the Vicaria at Naples, her little daughter, a handmaid and a duenna; we six servants are in attendance upon her, and the money amounts to six hundred crowns.\u201d \u201cSo then,\u201d said Roque Guinart, \u201cwe have got here nine hundred crowns and sixty reals; my soldiers must number some sixty; see how much there falls to each, for I am a bad arithmetician.\u201d As soon as the robbers heard this they raised a shout of \u201cLong life to Roque Guinart, in spite of the lladres that seek his ruin!\u201d The captains showed plainly the concern they felt, the regent\u2019s lady was downcast, and the pilgrims did not at all enjoy seeing their property confiscated.", " They came to the side of the ship to ask who we were, whither we were bound, and whence we came, but as they asked this in French our renegade said, \u201cLet no one answer, for no doubt these are French corsairs who plunder all comers.\u201d c41f.jpg (268K) Full Size Acting on this warning no one answered a word, but after we had gone a little ahead, and the vessel was now lying to leeward, suddenly they fired two guns, and apparently both loaded with chain-shot, for with one they cut our mast in half and brought down both it and the sail into the sea, and the other, discharged at the same moment, sent a ball into our vessel amidships, staving her in completely, but without doing any further damage. We, however, finding ourselves sinking began to shout for help and call upon those in the ship to pick us up as we were beginning to fill. They then lay to, and lowering a skiff or boat, as many as a dozen Frenchmen, well armed with match-locks, and their matches burning, got into it and came alongside; and seeing how few we were, and that our vessel was going down, they took us in, telling us that this had come to us through our incivility in not giving them an answer.", " But chance, directing things otherwise, so ordered it that just as the chief galley came close enough for those on board the vessel to hear the shouts from her calling on them to surrender, two Toraquis, that is to say two Turks, both drunken, that with a dozen more were on board the brigantine, discharged their muskets, killing two of the soldiers that lined the sides of our vessel. Seeing this the general swore he would not leave one of those he found on board the vessel alive, but as he bore down furiously upon her she slipped away from him underneath the oars. The galley shot a good way ahead; those on board the vessel saw their case was desperate, and while the galley was coming about they made sail, and by sailing and rowing once more tried to sheer off; but their activity did not do them as much good as their rashness did them harm, for the galley coming up with them in a little more than half a mile threw her oars over them and took the whole of them alive.", " All he can do is to inform his captain of what is going on so that he may try to remedy it by a counter-mine, and then stand his ground in fear and expectation of the moment when he will fly up to the clouds without wings and descend into the deep against his will. And if this seems a trifling risk, let us see whether it is equalled or surpassed by the encounter of two galleys stem to stem, in the midst of the open sea, locked and entangled one with the other, when the soldier has no more standing room than two feet of the plank of the spur; and yet, though he sees before him threatening him as many ministers of death as there are cannon of the foe pointed at him, not a lance length from his body, and sees too that with the first heedless step he will go down to visit the profundities of Neptune\u2019s bosom, still with dauntless heart, urged on by honour that nerves him, he makes himself a target for all that musketry, and struggles to cross that narrow path to the enemy\u2019s ship."], "What does the Knight of the White Moon\u2019s demand that Don Quixote do if he should lose their fight?": [" In the end they carried him into the city in a hand-chair which the viceroy sent for, and thither the viceroy himself returned, eager to ascertain who this Knight of the White Moon was who had left Don Quixote in such a sad plight. p64e.jpg (44K) Full Size CHAPTER LXV.

But as it is so, I will prove plainly to you that you are not enchanted.

But to return to the subject we were discussing just now, the enchantment of the lady Dulcinea, I look upon it as certain, and something more than evident, that Sancho\u2019s idea of practising a deception upon his master, making him believe that the peasant girl was Dulcinea and that if he did not recognise her it must be because she was enchanted, was all a device of one of the enchanters that persecute Don Quixote. For in truth and earnest, I know from good authority that the coarse country wench who jumped up on the ass was and is Dulcinea del Toboso, and that worthy Sancho, though he fancies himself the deceiver, is the one that is deceived; and that there is no more reason to doubt the truth of this, than of anything else we never saw.", " Once more, sirs, I say my master may go alone, and much good may it do him; and I\u2019ll stay here in the company of my lady the duchess; and maybe when he comes back, he will find the lady Dulcinea\u2019s affair ever so much advanced; for I mean in leisure hours, and at idle moments, to give myself a spell of whipping without so much as a hair to cover me.\u201d \u201cFor all that you must go if it be necessary, my good Sancho,\u201d said the duchess, \u201cfor they are worthy folk who ask you; and the faces of these ladies must not remain overgrown in this way because of your idle fears; that would be a hard case indeed.\u201d \u201cIn the king\u2019s name, once more!\u201d said Sancho; \u201cIf this charitable work were to be done for the sake of damsels in confinement or charity-girls, a man might expose himself to some hardships; but to bear it for the sake of stripping beards off duennas!

And now the horsemen in livery came galloping up with shouts and outlandish cries and cheers to where Don Quixote stood amazed and wondering; and one of them, he to whom Roque had sent word, addressing him exclaimed, \u201cWelcome to our city, mirror, beacon, star and cynosure of all knight-errantry in its widest extent! Welcome, I say, valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha; not the false, the fictitious, the apocryphal, that these latter days have offered us in lying histories, but the true, the legitimate, the real one that Cide Hamete Benengeli, flower of historians, has described to us!\u201d Don Quixote made no answer, nor did the horsemen wait for one, but wheeling again with all their followers, they began curvetting round Don Quixote, who, turning to Sancho, said, \u201cThese gentlemen have plainly recognised us; I will wager they have read our history, and even that newly printed one by the Aragonese.\u201d The cavalier who had addressed Don Quixote again approached him and said, \u201cCome with us, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote, for we are all of us your servants and great friends of Roque Guinart\u2019s;\u201d to which Don Quixote returned, \u201cIf courtesy breeds courtesy, yours, sir knight, is daughter or very nearly akin to the great Roque\u2019s; carry me where you please; I will have no will but yours, especially if you deign to employ it in your service.\u201d p61c.jpg (448K) Full Size The cavalier replied with words no less polite, and then, all closing in around him, they set out with him for the city, to the music of the clarions and the drums.", " Sancho took it and, handing it to the other old man, said to him, \u201cGo, and God be with you; for now you are paid.\u201d \u201cI, se\u00f1or!\u201d returned the old man; \u201cwhy, is this cane worth ten gold-crowns?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said the governor, \u201cor if not I am the greatest dolt in the world; now you will see whether I have got the headpiece to govern a whole kingdom;\u201d and he ordered the cane to be broken in two, there, in the presence of all. It was done, and in the middle of it they found ten gold-crowns. All were filled with amazement, and looked upon their governor as another Solomon. They asked him how he had come to the conclusion that the ten crowns were in the cane; he replied, that observing how the old man who swore gave the stick to his opponent while he was taking the oath, and swore that he had really and truly given him the crowns, and how as soon as he had done swearing he asked for the stick again, it came into his head that the sum demanded must be inside it; and from this he said it might be seen that God sometimes guides those who govern in their judgments, even though they may be fools; besides he had himself heard the curate of his village mention just such another case, and he had so good a memory, that if it was not that he forgot everything he wished to remember, there would not be such a memory in all the island.", " In this way he acquired a prodigious name and all ran after him; on other occasions, being very crafty, he would answer in such a way that the answers suited the questions; and as no one cross-questioned him or pressed him to tell how his ape divined, he made fools of them all and filled his pouch. The instant he entered the inn he knew Don Quixote and Sancho, and with that knowledge it was easy for him to astonish them and all who were there; but it would have cost him dear had Don Quixote brought down his hand a little lower when he cut off King Marsilio\u2019s head and destroyed all his horsemen, as related in the preceeding chapter. So much for Master Pedro and his ape; and now to return to Don Quixote of La Mancha. After he had left the inn he determined to visit, first of all, the banks of the Ebro and that neighbourhood, before entering the city of Saragossa, for the ample time there was still to spare before the jousts left him enough for all.", " They carried me to Constantinople, where the Grand Turk, Selim, made my master general at sea for having done his duty in the battle and carried off as evidence of his bravery the standard of the Order of Malta. The following year, which was the year seventy-two, I found myself at Navarino rowing in the leading galley with the three lanterns. There I saw and observed how the opportunity of capturing the whole Turkish fleet in harbour was lost; for all the marines and janizzaries that belonged to it made sure that they were about to be attacked inside the very harbour, and had their kits and pasamaques, or shoes, ready to flee at once on shore without waiting to be assailed, in so great fear did they stand of our fleet. But Heaven ordered it otherwise, not for any fault or neglect of the general who commanded on our side, but for the sins of Christendom, and because it was God\u2019s will and pleasure that we should always have instruments of punishment to chastise us."], "According to the Duke\u2019s musician, what do people call the practice of stealing one another\u2019s literary work?": [" And according to that the gentleman has good reason to say he would rather be a labouring man than a king, if vermin are to eat him.\u201d The duchess could not help laughing at the simplicity of her duenna, or wondering at the language and proverbs of Sancho, to whom she said, \u201cWorthy Sancho knows very well that when once a knight has made a promise he strives to keep it, though it should cost him his life. My lord and husband the duke, though not one of the errant sort, is none the less a knight for that reason, and will keep his word about the promised island, in spite of the envy and malice of the world. Let Sancho be of good cheer; for when he least expects it he will find himself seated on the throne of his island and seat of dignity, and will take possession of his government that he may discard it for another of three-bordered brocade. The charge I give him is to be careful how he governs his vassals, bearing in mind that they are all loyal and well-born.\u201d \u201cAs to governing them well,\u201d said Sancho, \u201cthere\u2019s no need of charging me to do that, for I\u2019m kind-hearted by nature, and full of compassion for the poor; there\u2019s no stealing the loaf from him who kneads and bakes;\u2019 and by my faith it won\u2019t do to throw false dice with me; I am an old dog, and I know all about \u2018tus, tus;\u2019 I can be wide-awake if need be, and I don\u2019t let clouds come before my eyes, for I know where the shoe pinches me; I say so, because with me the good will have support and protection, and the bad neither footing nor access.", " Don Stockfish, soul of a mortar, stone of a date, more obstinate and obdurate than a clown asked a favour when he has his mind made up, if I fall upon you I\u2019ll tear your eyes out! Do you fancy, Don Vanquished, Don Cudgelled, that I died for your sake? All that you have seen to-night has been make-believe; I\u2019m not the woman to let the black of my nail suffer for such a camel, much less die!\u201d \u201cThat I can well believe,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cfor all that about lovers pining to death is absurd; they may talk of it, but as for doing it\u2014Judas may believe that!\u201d While they were talking, the musician, singer, and poet, who had sung the two stanzas given above came in, and making a profound obeisance to Don Quixote said, \u201cWill your worship, sir knight, reckon and retain me in the number of your most faithful servants, for I have long been a great admirer of yours, as well because of your fame as because of your achievements?\u201d \u201cWill your worship tell me who you are,\u201d replied Don Quixote, \u201cso that my courtesy may be answerable to your deserts?\u201d The young man replied that he was the musician and songster of the night before.", " On the other hand he showed marks of wounds, which, though they could not be made out, he said were gunshot wounds received in divers encounters and actions. Lastly, with monstrous impudence he used to say \u201cyou\u201d to his equals and even those who knew what he was, and declare that his arm was his father and his deeds his pedigree, and that being a soldier he was as good as the king himself. And to add to these swaggering ways he was a trifle of a musician, and played the guitar with such a flourish that some said he made it speak; nor did his accomplishments end here, for he was something of a poet too, and on every trifle that happened in the town he made a ballad a league long. c51b.jpg (372K) Full Size This soldier, then, that I have described, this Vicente de la Roca, this bravo, gallant, musician, poet, was often seen and watched by Leandra from a window of her house which looked out on the plaza.", " The time for my departure arrived; I spoke one night to Luscinda, I told her all that had occurred, as I did also to her father, entreating him to allow some delay, and to defer the disposal of her hand until I should see what the Duke Ricardo sought of me: he gave me the promise, and she confirmed it with vows and swoonings unnumbered. Finally, I presented myself to the duke, and was received and treated by him so kindly that very soon envy began to do its work, the old servants growing envious of me, and regarding the duke\u2019s inclination to show me favour as an injury to themselves. But the one to whom my arrival gave the greatest pleasure was the duke\u2019s second son, Fernando by name, a gallant youth, of noble, generous, and amorous disposition, who very soon made so intimate a friend of me that it was remarked by everybody; for though the elder was attached to me, and showed me kindness, he did not carry his affectionate treatment to the same length as Don Fernando."], "Don Quixote remembers Don Alvero Tarfe from ___.": [" p71e.jpg (42K) CHAPTER LXXII. OF HOW DON QUIXOTE AND SANCHO REACHED THEIR VILLAGE p72a.jpg (155K) Full Size All that day Don Quixote and Sancho remained in the village and inn waiting for night, the one to finish off his task of scourging in the open country, the other to see it accomplished, for therein lay the accomplishment of his wishes. Meanwhile there arrived at the hostelry a traveller on horseback with three or four servants, one of whom said to him who appeared to be the master, \u201cHere, Se\u00f1or Don \u00c1lvaro Tarfe, your worship may take your siesta to-day; the quarters seem clean and cool.\u201d When he heard this Don Quixote said to Sancho, \u201cLook here, Sancho; on turning over the leaves of that book of the Second Part of my history I think I came casually upon this name of Don \u00c1lvaro Tarfe.\u201d \u201cVery likely,\u201d said Sancho; \u201cwe had better let him dismount, and by-and-by we can ask about it.\u201d The gentleman dismounted, and the landlady gave him a room on the ground floor opposite Don Quixote\u2019s and adorned with painted serge hangings of the same sort.", " The newly arrived gentleman put on a summer coat, and coming out to the gateway of the hostelry, which was wide and cool, addressing Don Quixote, who was pacing up and down there, he asked, \u201cIn what direction is your worship bound, gentle sir?\u201d \u201cTo a village near this which is my own village,\u201d replied Don Quixote; \u201cand your worship, where are you bound for?\u201d \u201cI am going to Granada, se\u00f1or,\u201d said the gentleman, \u201cto my own country.\u201d \u201cAnd a goodly country,\u201d said Don Quixote; \u201cbut will your worship do me the favour of telling me your name, for it strikes me it is of more importance to me to know it than I can tell you.\u201d \u201cMy name is Don \u00c1lvaro Tarfe,\u201d replied the traveller. To which Don Quixote returned, \u201cI have no doubt whatever that your worship is that Don \u00c1lvaro Tarfe who appears in print in the Second Part of the history of Don Quixote of La Mancha, lately printed and published by a new author.\u201d \u201cI am the same,\u201d replied the gentleman; \u201cand that same Don Quixote, the principal personage in the said history, was a very great friend of mine, and it was I who took him away from home, or at least induced him to come to some jousts that were to be held at Saragossa, whither I was going myself; indeed, I showed him many kindnesses, and saved him from having his shoulders touched up by the executioner because of his extreme rashness.\u201d \u201cTell me, Se\u00f1or Don \u00c1lvaro,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cam I at all like that Don Quixote you talk of?\u201d \u201cNo indeed,\u201d replied the traveller, \u201cnot a bit.\u201d \u201cAnd that Don Quixote\u2014\u201d said our one, \u201chad he with him a squire called Sancho Panza?\u201d \u201cHe had,\u201d said Don \u00c1lvaro; \u201cbut though he had the name of being very droll, I never heard him say anything that had any drollery in it.\u201d \u201cThat I can well believe,\u201d said Sancho at this, \u201cfor to come out with drolleries is not in everybody\u2019s line; and that Sancho your worship speaks of, gentle sir, must be some great scoundrel, dunderhead, and thief, all in one; for I am the real Sancho Panza, and I have more drolleries than if it rained them; let your worship only try; come along with me for a year or so, and you will find they fall from me at every turn, and so rich and so plentiful that though mostly I don\u2019t know what I am saying I make everybody that hears me laugh.", " Sancho replied that it was a long story to tell, but he would tell him if they happened to be going the same road. By this dinner-time arrived, and Don Quixote and Don \u00c1lvaro dined together. The alcalde of the village came by chance into the inn together with a notary, and Don Quixote laid a petition before him, showing that it was requisite for his rights that Don \u00c1lvaro Tarfe, the gentleman there present, should make a declaration before him that he did not know Don Quixote of La Mancha, also there present, and that he was not the one that was in print in a history entitled \u201cSecond Part of Don Quixote of La Mancha, by one Avellaneda of Tordesillas.\u201d The alcalde finally put it in legal form, and the declaration was made with all the formalities required in such cases, at which Don Quixote and Sancho were in high delight, as if a declaration of the sort was of any great importance to them, and as if their words and deeds did not plainly show the difference between the two Don Quixotes and the two Sanchos.", " And the real Don Quixote of La Mancha, the famous, the valiant, the wise, the lover, the righter of wrongs, the guardian of minors and orphans, the protector of widows, the killer of damsels, he who has for his sole mistress the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso, is this gentleman before you, my master; all other Don Quixotes and all other Sancho Panzas are dreams and mockeries.\u201d \u201cBy God I believe it,\u201d said Don \u00c1lvaro; \u201cfor you have uttered more drolleries, my friend, in the few words you have spoken than the other Sancho Panza in all I ever heard from him, and they were not a few. He was more greedy than well-spoken, and more dull than droll; and I am convinced that the enchanters who persecute Don Quixote the Good have been trying to persecute me with Don Quixote the Bad. But I don\u2019t know what to say, for I am ready to swear I left him shut up in the Casa del Nuncio at Toledo, and here another Don Quixote turns up, though a very different one from mine.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I am good,\u201d said Don Quixote, \u201cbut I can safely say I am not \u2018the Bad;\u2019 and to prove it, let me tell you, Se\u00f1or Don \u00c1lvaro Tarfe, I have never in my life been in Saragossa; so far from that, when it was told me that this imaginary Don Quixote had been present at the jousts in that city, I declined to enter it, in order to drag his falsehood before the face of the world; and so I went on straight to Barcelona, the treasure-house of courtesy, haven of strangers, asylum of the poor, home of the valiant, champion of the wronged, pleasant exchange of firm friendships, and city unrivalled in site and beauty."], "What does Don Quixote disavow before dying of fever?": [" My lord the duke wrote to me the other day to warn me that certain spies had got into this island to kill me; but up to the present I have not found out any except a certain doctor who receives a salary in this town for killing all the governors that come here; he is called Doctor Pedro Recio, and is from Tirteafuera; so you see what a name he has to make me dread dying under his hands. This doctor says of himself that he does not cure diseases when there are any, but prevents them coming, and the medicines he uses are diet and more diet until he brings one down to bare bones; as if leanness was not worse than fever. In short he is killing me with hunger, and I am dying myself of vexation; for when I thought I was coming to this government to get my meat hot and my drink cool, and take my ease between holland sheets on feather beds, I find I have come to do penance as if I was a hermit; and as I don\u2019t do it willingly I suspect that in the end the devil will carry me off.", " They proceeded slowly, making their way into the most rugged part of the mountain, Sancho all the while dying to have a talk with his master, and longing for him to begin, so that there should be no breach of the injunction laid upon him; but unable to keep silence so long he said to him: \u201cSe\u00f1or Don Quixote, give me your worship\u2019s blessing and dismissal, for I\u2019d like to go home at once to my wife and children with whom I can at any rate talk and converse as much as I like; for to want me to go through these solitudes day and night and not speak to you when I have a mind is burying me alive. If luck would have it that animals spoke as they did in the days of Guisopete, it would not be so bad, because I could talk to Rocinante about whatever came into my head, and so put up with my ill-fortune; but it is a hard case, and not to be borne with patience, to go seeking adventures all one\u2019s life and get nothing but kicks and blanketings, brickbats and punches, and with all this to have to sew up one\u2019s mouth without daring to say what is in one\u2019s heart, just as if one were dumb.\u201d \u201cI understand thee, Sancho,\u201d replied Don Quixote; \u201cthou art dying to have the interdict I placed upon thy tongue removed; consider it removed, and say what thou wilt while we are wandering in these mountains.\u201d \u201cSo be it,\u201d said Sancho; \u201clet me speak now, for God knows what will happen by-and-by; and to take advantage of the permit at once, I ask, what made your worship stand up so for that Queen Majimasa, or whatever her name is, or what did it matter whether that abbot was a friend of hers or not?", " Come, my son, let us go look for some place where I may hide, while thou dost return, as thou sayest, to seek, and speak with my lady, from whose discretion and courtesy I look for favours more than miraculous.\u201d Sancho was in a fever to get his master out of the town, lest he should discover the falsehood of the reply he had brought to him in the Sierra Morena on behalf of Dulcinea; so he hastened their departure, which they took at once, and two miles out of the village they found a forest or thicket wherein Don Quixote ensconced himself, while Sancho returned to the city to speak to Dulcinea, in which embassy things befell him which demand fresh attention and a new chapter. p09e.jpg (34K) CHAPTER X.

He was one of those that sailed from Messina, in September 1571, under the command of Don John of Austria; but on the morning of the 7th of October, when the Turkish fleet was sighted, he was lying below ill with fever. At the news that the enemy was in sight he rose, and, in spite of the remonstrances of his comrades and superiors, insisted on taking his post, saying he preferred death in the service of God and the King to health. His galley, the _Marquesa_, was in the thick of the fight, and before it was over he had received three gunshot wounds, two in the breast and one in the left hand or arm."]}
