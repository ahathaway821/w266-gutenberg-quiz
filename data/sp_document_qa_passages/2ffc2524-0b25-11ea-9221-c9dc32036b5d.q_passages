{"What is the verdictat Dmitri\u2019s trial?": [" He had never, never persuaded me that his brother was a murderer. On the contrary, it was I who persuaded him! Oh, my vile temper was the cause of everything! I paved the way to that hideous scene at the trial. He wanted to show me that he was an honorable man, and that, even if I loved his brother, he would not ruin him for revenge or jealousy. So he came to the court ... I am the cause of it all, I alone am to blame!\u201d Katya never had made such confessions to Alyosha before, and he felt that she was now at that stage of unbearable suffering when even the proudest heart painfully crushes its pride and falls vanquished by grief. Oh, Alyosha knew another terrible reason of her present misery, though she had carefully concealed it from him during those days since the trial; but it would have been for some reason too painful to him if she had been brought so low as to speak to him now about that. She was suffering for her \u201ctreachery\u201d at the trial, and Alyosha felt that her conscience was impelling her to confess it to him, to him, Alyosha, with tears and cries and hysterical writhings on the floor. But he dreaded that moment and longed to spare her. It made the commission on which he had come even more difficult. He spoke of Mitya again. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, it\u2019s all right, don\u2019t be anxious about him!\u201d she began again, sharply and stubbornly. \u201cAll that is only momentary, I know him, I know his heart only too well.", " \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d said Mitya, looking at him rather uncertainly. \u201cOh, you mean the trial! Damn it all! Till now we\u2019ve been talking of things that don\u2019t matter, about this trial, but I haven\u2019t said a word to you about the chief thing. Yes, the trial is to\u2010morrow; but it wasn\u2019t the trial I meant, when I said it was all over with me. Why do you look at me so critically?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean, Mitya?\u201d \u201cIdeas, ideas, that\u2019s all! Ethics! What is ethics?\u201d \u201cEthics?\u201d asked Alyosha, wondering. \u201cYes; is it a science?\u201d \u201cYes, there is such a science ... but ... I confess I can\u2019t explain to you what sort of science it is.\u201d \u201cRakitin knows. Rakitin knows a lot, damn him! He\u2019s not going to be a monk. He means to go to Petersburg. There he\u2019ll go in for criticism of an elevating tendency. Who knows, he may be of use and make his own career, too. Ough! they are first\u2010rate, these people, at making a career! Damn ethics, I am done for, Alexey, I am, you man of God! I love you more than any one. It makes my heart yearn to look at you. Who was Karl Bernard?\u201d \u201cKarl Bernard?\u201d Alyosha was surprised again. \u201cNo, not Karl. Stay, I made a mistake. Claude Bernard. What was he? Chemist or what?\u201d \u201cHe must be a savant,\u201d answered Alyosha; \u201cbut I confess I can\u2019t tell you much about him, either. I\u2019ve heard of him as a savant, but what sort I don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cWell, damn him, then! I don\u2019t know either,\u201d swore Mitya.", " Book XII. A Judicial Error Chapter I. The Fatal Day At ten o\u2019clock in the morning of the day following the events I have described, the trial of Dmitri Karamazov began in our district court. I hasten to emphasize the fact that I am far from esteeming myself capable of reporting all that took place at the trial in full detail, or even in the actual order of events. I imagine that to mention everything with full explanation would fill a volume, even a very large one. And so I trust I may not be reproached, for confining myself to what struck me. I may have selected as of most interest what was of secondary importance, and may have omitted the most prominent and essential details. But I see I shall do better not to apologize. I will do my best and the reader will see for himself that I have done all I can. And, to begin with, before entering the court, I will mention what surprised me most on that day. Indeed, as it appeared later, every one was surprised at it, too. We all knew that the affair had aroused great interest, that every one was burning with impatience for the trial to begin, that it had been a subject of talk, conjecture, exclamation and surmise for the last two months in local society. Every one knew, too, that the case had become known throughout Russia, but yet we had not imagined that it had aroused such burning, such intense, interest in every one, not only among ourselves, but all over Russia.", " He was in terrible distress. But as the table blocked his way, and there was hardly room to pass between the table and the wall, he only turned round where he stood and sat down again. Perhaps the impossibility of moving irritated him, as he suddenly cried out almost as furiously as before. \u201cListen, you miserable, contemptible creature! Don\u2019t you understand that if I haven\u2019t killed you, it\u2019s simply because I am keeping you to answer to\u2010morrow at the trial. God sees,\u201d Ivan raised his hand, \u201cperhaps I, too, was guilty; perhaps I really had a secret desire for my father\u2019s ... death, but I swear I was not as guilty as you think, and perhaps I didn\u2019t urge you on at all. No, no, I didn\u2019t urge you on! But no matter, I will give evidence against myself to\u2010morrow at the trial. I\u2019m determined to! I shall tell everything, everything. But we\u2019ll make our appearance together. And whatever you may say against me at the trial, whatever evidence you give, I\u2019ll face it; I am not afraid of you. I\u2019ll confirm it all myself! But you must confess, too! You must, you must; we\u2019ll go together. That\u2019s how it shall be!\u201d Ivan said this solemnly and resolutely and from his flashing eyes alone it could be seen that it would be so. \u201cYou are ill, I see; you are quite ill. Your eyes are yellow,\u201d Smerdyakov commented, without the least irony, with apparent sympathy in fact. \u201cWe\u2019ll go together,\u201d Ivan repeated. \u201cAnd if you won\u2019t go, no matter, I\u2019ll go alone.\u201d Smerdyakov paused as though pondering."], "Which of the Karamazovbrothers does Miusov help to raise?": [" \u2018It must be He, it can be no one but Him!\u2019 He stops at the steps of the Seville cathedral at the moment when the weeping mourners are bringing in a little open white coffin. In it lies a child of seven, the only daughter of a prominent citizen. The dead child lies hidden in flowers. \u2018He will raise your child,\u2019 the crowd shouts to the weeping mother. The priest, coming to meet the coffin, looks perplexed, and frowns, but the mother of the dead child throws herself at His feet with a wail. \u2018If it is Thou, raise my child!\u2019 she cries, holding out her hands to Him. The procession halts, the coffin is laid on the steps at His feet. He looks with compassion, and His lips once more softly pronounce, \u2018Maiden, arise!\u2019 and the maiden arises. The little girl sits up in the coffin and looks round, smiling with wide\u2010 open wondering eyes, holding a bunch of white roses they had put in her hand. \u201cThere are cries, sobs, confusion among the people, and at that moment the cardinal himself, the Grand Inquisitor, passes by the cathedral. He is an old man, almost ninety, tall and erect, with a withered face and sunken eyes, in which there is still a gleam of light. He is not dressed in his gorgeous cardinal\u2019s robes, as he was the day before, when he was burning the enemies of the Roman Church\u2014at this moment he is wearing his coarse, old, monk\u2019s cassock. At a distance behind him come his gloomy assistants and slaves and the \u2018holy guard.\u2019 He stops at the sight of the crowd and watches it from a distance.", " Mitya was surprised. \u201cOh, I was sitting like this, astride, one leg on one side of the wall and one on the other.\u201d \u201cAnd the pestle?\u201d \u201cThe pestle was in my hand.\u201d \u201cNot in your pocket? Do you remember that precisely? Was it a violent blow you gave him?\u201d \u201cIt must have been a violent one. But why do you ask?\u201d \u201cWould you mind sitting on the chair just as you sat on the wall then and showing us just how you moved your arm, and in what direction?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re making fun of me, aren\u2019t you?\u201d asked Mitya, looking haughtily at the speaker; but the latter did not flinch. Mitya turned abruptly, sat astride on his chair, and swung his arm. \u201cThis was how I struck him! That\u2019s how I knocked him down! What more do you want?\u201d \u201cThank you. May I trouble you now to explain why you jumped down, with what object, and what you had in view?\u201d \u201cOh, hang it!... I jumped down to look at the man I\u2019d hurt ... I don\u2019t know what for!\u201d \u201cThough you were so excited and were running away?\u201d \u201cYes, though I was excited and running away.\u201d \u201cYou wanted to help him?\u201d \u201cHelp!...

I remember everything\u2014every detail. I jumped down to look at him, and wiped his face with my handkerchief.\u201d \u201cWe have seen your handkerchief. Did you hope to restore him to consciousness?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know whether I hoped it.", " This is a case of mathematics: you couldn\u2019t help coming, after all that has passed with Katerina Ivanovna; you couldn\u2019t, you couldn\u2019t, that\u2019s a mathematical certainty.\u201d \u201cThe realism of actual life, madam, that\u2019s what it is. But allow me to explain\u2014\u201d \u201cRealism indeed, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. I\u2019m all for realism now. I\u2019ve seen too much of miracles. You\u2019ve heard that Father Zossima is dead?\u201d \u201cNo, madam, it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard of it.\u201d Mitya was a little surprised. The image of Alyosha rose to his mind. \u201cLast night, and only imagine\u2014\u201d \u201cMadam,\u201d said Mitya, \u201cI can imagine nothing except that I\u2019m in a desperate position, and that if you don\u2019t help me, everything will come to grief, and I first of all. Excuse me for the triviality of the expression, but I\u2019m in a fever\u2014\u201d \u201cI know, I know that you\u2019re in a fever.

Oh, believe me, I\u2019m an experienced doctor of the soul, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.\u201d \u201cMadam, if you are an experienced doctor, I\u2019m certainly an experienced patient,\u201d said Mitya, with an effort to be polite, \u201cand I feel that if you are watching over my destiny in this way, you will come to my help in my ruin, and so allow me, at least to explain to you the plan with which I have ventured to come to you ... and what I am hoping of you....", " In the evening, returning home in a savage and brutal humor, I flew into a rage with my orderly Afanasy, and gave him two blows in the face with all my might, so that it was covered with blood. He had not long been in my service and I had struck him before, but never with such ferocious cruelty. And, believe me, though it\u2019s forty years ago, I recall it now with shame and pain. I went to bed and slept for about three hours; when I waked up the day was breaking. I got up\u2014I did not want to sleep any more\u2014I went to the window\u2014opened it, it looked out upon the garden; I saw the sun rising; it was warm and beautiful, the birds were singing. \u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of it?\u201d I thought. \u201cI feel in my heart as it were something vile and shameful. Is it because I am going to shed blood? No,\u201d I thought, \u201cI feel it\u2019s not that. Can it be that I am afraid of death, afraid of being killed? No, that\u2019s not it, that\u2019s not it at all.\u201d... And all at once I knew what it was: it was because I had beaten Afanasy the evening before! It all rose before my mind, it all was as it were repeated over again; he stood before me and I was beating him straight on the face and he was holding his arms stiffly down, his head erect, his eyes fixed upon me as though on parade. He staggered at every blow and did not even dare to raise his hands to protect himself. That is what a man has been brought to, and that was a man beating a fellow creature!"], "Which characteris the son of Stinking Lizaveta?": [" He listened and said he thought it was more like some one groaning, \u201cit might be a woman.\u201d He got up and dressed. It was a rather warm night in May. As he went down the steps, he distinctly heard groans coming from the garden. But the gate from the yard into the garden was locked at night, and there was no other way of entering it, for it was enclosed all round by a strong, high fence. Going back into the house, Grigory lighted a lantern, took the garden key, and taking no notice of the hysterical fears of his wife, who was still persuaded that she heard a child crying, and that it was her own baby crying and calling for her, went into the garden in silence. There he heard at once that the groans came from the bath\u2010house that stood near the garden gate, and that they were the groans of a woman. Opening the door of the bath\u2010house, he saw a sight which petrified him. An idiot girl, who wandered about the streets and was known to the whole town by the nickname of Lizaveta Smerdyastchaya (Stinking Lizaveta), had got into the bath\u2010 house and had just given birth to a child. She lay dying with the baby beside her. She said nothing, for she had never been able to speak. But her story needs a chapter to itself. Chapter II. Lizaveta There was one circumstance which struck Grigory particularly, and confirmed a very unpleasant and revolting suspicion. This Lizaveta was a dwarfish creature, \u201cnot five foot within a wee bit,\u201d as many of the pious old women said pathetically about her, after her death.", " A captivating little foot, Though swollen and red and tender! The doctors come and plasters put, But still they cannot mend her. Yet, \u2019tis not for her foot I dread\u2014 A theme for Pushkin\u2019s muse more fit\u2014 It\u2019s not her foot, it is her head: I tremble for her loss of wit! For as her foot swells, strange to say, Her intellect is on the wane\u2014 Oh, for some remedy I pray That may restore both foot and brain! He is a pig, a regular pig, but he\u2019s very arch, the rascal! And he really has put in a progressive idea. And wasn\u2019t he angry when she kicked him out! He was gnashing his teeth!\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s taken his revenge already,\u201d said Alyosha. \u201cHe\u2019s written a paragraph about Madame Hohlakov.\u201d And Alyosha told him briefly about the paragraph in _Gossip_. \u201cThat\u2019s his doing, that\u2019s his doing!\u201d Mitya assented, frowning. \u201cThat\u2019s him! These paragraphs ... I know ... the insulting things that have been written about Grushenka, for instance.... And about Katya, too.... H\u2019m!\u201d He walked across the room with a harassed air. \u201cBrother, I cannot stay long,\u201d Alyosha said, after a pause. \u201cTo\u2010morrow will be a great and awful day for you, the judgment of God will be accomplished ... I am amazed at you, you walk about here, talking of I don\u2019t know what ...\u201d \u201cNo, don\u2019t be amazed at me,\u201d Mitya broke in warmly. \u201cAm I to talk of that stinking dog? Of the murderer? We\u2019ve talked enough of him. I don\u2019t want to say more of the stinking son of Stinking Lizaveta!", " The most likely explanation is that it happened naturally\u2014that Lizaveta, accustomed to clambering over hurdles to sleep in gardens, had somehow managed to climb this fence, in spite of her condition, and had leapt down, injuring herself. Grigory rushed to Marfa and sent her to Lizaveta, while he ran to fetch an old midwife who lived close by. They saved the baby, but Lizaveta died at dawn. Grigory took the baby, brought it home, and making his wife sit down, put it on her lap. \u201cA child of God\u2014an orphan is akin to all,\u201d he said, \u201cand to us above others. Our little lost one has sent us this, who has come from the devil\u2019s son and a holy innocent. Nurse him and weep no more.\u201d So Marfa brought up the child. He was christened Pavel, to which people were not slow in adding Fyodorovitch (son of Fyodor). Fyodor Pavlovitch did not object to any of this, and thought it amusing, though he persisted vigorously in denying his responsibility. The townspeople were pleased at his adopting the foundling. Later on, Fyodor Pavlovitch invented a surname for the child, calling him Smerdyakov, after his mother\u2019s nickname. So this Smerdyakov became Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s second servant, and was living in the lodge with Grigory and Marfa at the time our story begins. He was employed as cook. I ought to say something of this Smerdyakov, but I am ashamed of keeping my readers\u2019 attention so long occupied with these common menials, and I will go back to my story, hoping to say more of Smerdyakov in the course of it.", " He was weak in health, it is true; but in character, in spirit, he was by no means the weak man the prosecutor has made him out to be. I found in him no trace of the timidity on which the prosecutor so insisted. There was no simplicity about him, either. I found in him, on the contrary, an extreme mistrustfulness concealed under a mask of _na\u00efvet\u00e9_, and an intelligence of considerable range. The prosecutor was too simple in taking him for weak\u2010minded. He made a very definite impression on me: I left him with the conviction that he was a distinctly spiteful creature, excessively ambitious, vindictive, and intensely envious. I made some inquiries: he resented his parentage, was ashamed of it, and would clench his teeth when he remembered that he was the son of \u2018stinking Lizaveta.\u2019 He was disrespectful to the servant Grigory and his wife, who had cared for him in his childhood. He cursed and jeered at Russia. He dreamed of going to France and becoming a Frenchman. He used often to say that he hadn\u2019t the means to do so. I fancy he loved no one but himself and had a strangely high opinion of himself. His conception of culture was limited to good clothes, clean shirt\u2010fronts and polished boots. Believing himself to be the illegitimate son of Fyodor Pavlovitch (there is evidence of this), he might well have resented his position, compared with that of his master\u2019s legitimate sons. They had everything, he nothing."], "Why does Dmitrileave Katerina?": [" They\u2019ve planned it together, the three of them\u2014Mitya, Katerina, and Ivan Fyodorovitch. Alyosha, I\u2019ve been wanting to ask you a long time. A week ago he suddenly told me that Ivan was in love with Katerina, because he often goes to see her. Did he tell me the truth or not? Tell me, on your conscience, tell me the worst.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t tell you a lie. Ivan is not in love with Katerina Ivanovna, I think.\u201d \u201cOh, that\u2019s what I thought! He is lying to me, shameless deceiver, that\u2019s what it is! And he was jealous of me just now, so as to put the blame on me afterwards. He is stupid, he can\u2019t disguise what he is doing; he is so open, you know.... But I\u2019ll give it to him, I\u2019ll give it to him! \u2018You believe I did it,\u2019 he said. He said that to me, to me. He reproached me with that! God forgive him! You wait, I\u2019ll make it hot for Katerina at the trial! I\u2019ll just say a word then ... I\u2019ll tell everything then!\u201d And again she cried bitterly. \u201cThis I can tell you for certain, Grushenka,\u201d Alyosha said, getting up. \u201cFirst, that he loves you, loves you more than any one in the world, and you only, believe me. I know. I do know. The second thing is that I don\u2019t want to worm his secret out of him, but if he\u2019ll tell me of himself to\u2010 day, I shall tell him straight out that I have promised to tell you. Then I\u2019ll come to you to\u2010day, and tell you. Only ... I fancy ... Katerina Ivanovna has nothing to do with it, and that the secret is about something else.", " \u201cShe\u2019s perhaps too na\u00efve,\u201d thought Katerina Ivanovna, with a gleam of hope. Grushenka meanwhile seemed enthusiastic over the \u201csweet hand.\u201d She raised it deliberately to her lips. But she held it for two or three minutes near her lips, as though reconsidering something. \u201cDo you know, angel lady,\u201d she suddenly drawled in an even more soft and sugary voice, \u201cdo you know, after all, I think I won\u2019t kiss your hand?\u201d And she laughed a little merry laugh. \u201cAs you please. What\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d said Katerina Ivanovna, starting suddenly. \u201cSo that you may be left to remember that you kissed my hand, but I didn\u2019t kiss yours.\u201d There was a sudden gleam in her eyes. She looked with awful intentness at Katerina Ivanovna. \u201cInsolent creature!\u201d cried Katerina Ivanovna, as though suddenly grasping something. She flushed all over and leapt up from her seat. Grushenka too got up, but without haste. \u201cSo I shall tell Mitya how you kissed my hand, but I didn\u2019t kiss yours at all. And how he will laugh!\u201d \u201cVile slut! Go away!\u201d \u201cAh, for shame, young lady! Ah, for shame! That\u2019s unbecoming for you, dear young lady, a word like that.\u201d \u201cGo away! You\u2019re a creature for sale!\u201d screamed Katerina Ivanovna. Every feature was working in her utterly distorted face. \u201cFor sale indeed! You used to visit gentlemen in the dusk for money once; you brought your beauty for sale. You see, I know.\u201d Katerina Ivanovna shrieked, and would have rushed at her, but Alyosha held her with all his strength.", " It appeared too that there were other people concerned, far more so than Alyosha could have supposed before. There was something positively mysterious in it, too. Ivan had made a step towards him, which was what Alyosha had been long desiring. Yet now he felt for some reason that he was frightened at it. And these women? Strange to say, that morning he had set out for Katerina Ivanovna\u2019s in the greatest embarrassment; now he felt nothing of the kind. On the contrary, he was hastening there as though expecting to find guidance from her. Yet to give her this message was obviously more difficult than before. The matter of the three thousand was decided irrevocably, and Dmitri, feeling himself dishonored and losing his last hope, might sink to any depth. He had, moreover, told him to describe to Katerina Ivanovna the scene which had just taken place with his father. It was by now seven o\u2019clock, and it was getting dark as Alyosha entered the very spacious and convenient house in the High Street occupied by Katerina Ivanovna. Alyosha knew that she lived with two aunts. One of them, a woman of little education, was that aunt of her half\u2010sister Agafya Ivanovna who had looked after her in her father\u2019s house when she came from boarding\u2010school. The other aunt was a Moscow lady of style and consequence, though in straitened circumstances. It was said that they both gave way in everything to Katerina Ivanovna, and that she only kept them with her as chaperons.", " I only remember a few exclamations I heard on the steps as I went out. \u201cHe\u2019ll have a twenty years\u2019 trip to the mines!\u201d \u201cNot less.\u201d \u201cWell, our peasants have stood firm.\u201d \u201cAnd have done for our Mitya.\u201d EPILOGUE Chapter I. Plans For Mitya\u2019s Escape Very early, at nine o\u2019clock in the morning, five days after the trial, Alyosha went to Katerina Ivanovna\u2019s to talk over a matter of great importance to both of them, and to give her a message. She sat and talked to him in the very room in which she had once received Grushenka. In the next room Ivan Fyodorovitch lay unconscious in a high fever. Katerina Ivanovna had immediately after the scene at the trial ordered the sick and unconscious man to be carried to her house, disregarding the inevitable gossip and general disapproval of the public. One of the two relations who lived with her had departed to Moscow immediately after the scene in court, the other remained. But if both had gone away, Katerina Ivanovna would have adhered to her resolution, and would have gone on nursing the sick man and sitting by him day and night. Varvinsky and Herzenstube were attending him. The famous doctor had gone back to Moscow, refusing to give an opinion as to the probable end of the illness. Though the doctors encouraged Katerina Ivanovna and Alyosha, it was evident that they could not yet give them positive hopes of recovery. Alyosha came to see his sick brother twice a day."], "To whom does Alyoshabecome engaged?": [" He had to be on the alert. Dmitri might be on the watch for her somewhere, and when she knocked on the window (Smerdyakov had informed him two days before that he had told her where and how to knock) the door must be opened at once. She must not be a second in the passage, for fear\u2014which God forbid!\u2014that she should be frightened and run away. Fyodor Pavlovitch had much to think of, but never had his heart been steeped in such voluptuous hopes. This time he could say almost certainly that she would come! Book VI. The Russian Monk Chapter I. Father Zossima And His Visitors When with an anxious and aching heart Alyosha went into his elder\u2019s cell, he stood still almost astonished. Instead of a sick man at his last gasp, perhaps unconscious, as he had feared to find him, he saw him sitting up in his chair and, though weak and exhausted, his face was bright and cheerful, he was surrounded by visitors and engaged in a quiet and joyful conversation. But he had only got up from his bed a quarter of an hour before Alyosha\u2019s arrival; his visitors had gathered together in his cell earlier, waiting for him to wake, having received a most confident assurance from Father Pa\u00efssy that \u201cthe teacher would get up, and as he had himself promised in the morning, converse once more with those dear to his heart.\u201d This promise and indeed every word of the dying elder Father Pa\u00efssy put implicit trust in.", " No, now he\u2019s saving his soul! Why have you put that long gown on him? If he runs he\u2019ll fall.\u201d And suddenly she hid her face in her hand and went off into irresistible, prolonged, nervous, inaudible laughter. The elder listened to her with a smile, and blessed her tenderly. As she kissed his hand she suddenly pressed it to her eyes and began crying. \u201cDon\u2019t be angry with me. I\u2019m silly and good for nothing ... and perhaps Alyosha\u2019s right, quite right, in not wanting to come and see such a ridiculous girl.\u201d \u201cI will certainly send him,\u201d said the elder. Chapter V. So Be It! So Be It! The elder\u2019s absence from his cell had lasted for about twenty\u2010five minutes. It was more than half\u2010past twelve, but Dmitri, on whose account they had all met there, had still not appeared. But he seemed almost to be forgotten, and when the elder entered the cell again, he found his guests engaged in eager conversation. Ivan and the two monks took the leading share in it. Mi\u00fcsov, too, was trying to take a part, and apparently very eagerly, in the conversation. But he was unsuccessful in this also. He was evidently in the background, and his remarks were treated with neglect, which increased his irritability. He had had intellectual encounters with Ivan before and he could not endure a certain carelessness Ivan showed him. \u201cHitherto at least I have stood in the front ranks of all that is progressive in Europe, and here the new generation positively ignores us,\u201d he thought.", " It may be wondered why, if he felt so certain, he had not gone to her at first, one of his own sort, so to speak, instead of to Samsonov, a man he did not know, who was not of his own class, and to whom he hardly knew how to speak. But the fact was that he had never known Madame Hohlakov well, and had seen nothing of her for the last month, and that he knew she could not endure him. She had detested him from the first because he was engaged to Katerina Ivanovna, while she had, for some reason, suddenly conceived the desire that Katerina Ivanovna should throw him over, and marry the \u201ccharming, chivalrously refined Ivan, who had such excellent manners.\u201d Mitya\u2019s manners she detested. Mitya positively laughed at her, and had once said about her that she was just as lively and at her ease as she was uncultivated. But that morning in the cart a brilliant idea had struck him: \u201cIf she is so anxious I should not marry Katerina Ivanovna\u201d (and he knew she was positively hysterical upon the subject) \u201cwhy should she refuse me now that three thousand, just to enable me to leave Katya and get away from her for ever. These spoilt fine ladies, if they set their hearts on anything, will spare no expense to satisfy their caprice. Besides, she\u2019s so rich,\u201d Mitya argued. As for his \u201cplan\u201d it was just the same as before; it consisted of the offer of his rights to Tchermashnya\u2014but not with a commercial object, as it had been with Samsonov, not trying to allure the lady with the possibility of making a profit of six or seven thousand\u2014but simply as a security for the debt.", " Who will search them?\u201d \u201cBehind the curtains, of course.\u201d Nikolay Parfenovitch bent his head in assent. His small face wore an expression of peculiar solemnity. Chapter VI. The Prosecutor Catches Mitya Something utterly unexpected and amazing to Mitya followed. He could never, even a minute before, have conceived that any one could behave like that to him, Mitya Karamazov. What was worst of all, there was something humiliating in it, and on their side something \u201csupercilious and scornful.\u201d It was nothing to take off his coat, but he was asked to undress further, or rather not asked but \u201ccommanded,\u201d he quite understood that. From pride and contempt he submitted without a word. Several peasants accompanied the lawyers and remained on the same side of the curtain. \u201cTo be ready if force is required,\u201d thought Mitya, \u201cand perhaps for some other reason, too.\u201d \u201cWell, must I take off my shirt, too?\u201d he asked sharply, but Nikolay Parfenovitch did not answer. He was busily engaged with the prosecutor in examining the coat, the trousers, the waistcoat and the cap; and it was evident that they were both much interested in the scrutiny. \u201cThey make no bones about it,\u201d thought Mitya, \u201cthey don\u2019t keep up the most elementary politeness.\u201d \u201cI ask you for the second time\u2014need I take off my shirt or not?\u201d he said, still more sharply and irritably. \u201cDon\u2019t trouble yourself. We will tell you what to do,\u201d Nikolay Parfenovitch said, and his voice was positively peremptory, or so it seemed to Mitya."], "What does FyodorPavlovich offer Grushenka if she chooses him over Dmitri?": [" For him the whole tormenting question lay between him and Fyodor Pavlovitch. Here, we must note, by the way, one certain fact: he was firmly persuaded that Fyodor Pavlovitch would offer, or perhaps had offered, Grushenka lawful wedlock, and did not for a moment believe that the old voluptuary hoped to gain his object for three thousand roubles. Mitya had reached this conclusion from his knowledge of Grushenka and her character. That was how it was that he could believe at times that all Grushenka\u2019s uneasiness rose from not knowing which of them to choose, which was most to her advantage. Strange to say, during those days it never occurred to him to think of the approaching return of the \u201cofficer,\u201d that is, of the man who had been such a fatal influence in Grushenka\u2019s life, and whose arrival she was expecting with such emotion and dread. It is true that of late Grushenka had been very silent about it. Yet he was perfectly aware of a letter she had received a month ago from her seducer, and had heard of it from her own lips. He partly knew, too, what the letter contained. In a moment of spite Grushenka had shown him that letter, but to her astonishment he attached hardly any consequence to it. It would be hard to say why this was. Perhaps, weighed down by all the hideous horror of his struggle with his own father for this woman, he was incapable of imagining any danger more terrible, at any rate for the time.", " From some rumor, or perhaps from some stray word of Grushenka\u2019s, he had gathered further that the old man would perhaps prefer him to Fyodor Pavlovitch for Grushenka. Possibly many of the readers of my novel will feel that in reckoning on such assistance, and being ready to take his bride, so to speak, from the hands of her protector, Dmitri showed great coarseness and want of delicacy. I will only observe that Mitya looked upon Grushenka\u2019s past as something completely over. He looked on that past with infinite pity and resolved with all the fervor of his passion that when once Grushenka told him she loved him and would marry him, it would mean the beginning of a new Grushenka and a new Dmitri, free from every vice. They would forgive one another and would begin their lives afresh. As for Kuzma Samsonov, Dmitri looked upon him as a man who had exercised a fateful influence in that remote past of Grushenka\u2019s, though she had never loved him, and who was now himself a thing of the past, completely done with, and, so to say, non\u2010existent. Besides, Mitya hardly looked upon him as a man at all, for it was known to every one in the town that he was only a shattered wreck, whose relations with Grushenka had changed their character and were now simply paternal, and that this had been so for a long time. In any case there was much simplicity on Mitya\u2019s part in all this, for in spite of all his vices, he was a very simple\u2010hearted man.", " I understand nothing!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re a painter!\u201d \u201cFor mercy\u2019s sake! I\u2019m Karamazov, Dmitri Karamazov. I have an offer to make you, an advantageous offer ... very advantageous offer, concerning the copse!\u201d The peasant stroked his beard importantly. \u201cNo, you\u2019ve contracted for the job and turned out a scamp. You\u2019re a scoundrel!\u201d \u201cI assure you you\u2019re mistaken,\u201d cried Mitya, wringing his hands in despair. The peasant still stroked his beard, and suddenly screwed up his eyes cunningly. \u201cNo, you show me this: you tell me the law that allows roguery. D\u2019you hear? You\u2019re a scoundrel! Do you understand that?\u201d Mitya stepped back gloomily, and suddenly \u201csomething seemed to hit him on the head,\u201d as he said afterwards. In an instant a light seemed to dawn in his mind, \u201ca light was kindled and I grasped it all.\u201d He stood, stupefied, wondering how he, after all a man of intelligence, could have yielded to such folly, have been led into such an adventure, and have kept it up for almost twenty\u2010four hours, fussing round this Lyagavy, wetting his head. \u201cWhy, the man\u2019s drunk, dead drunk, and he\u2019ll go on drinking now for a week; what\u2019s the use of waiting here? And what if Samsonov sent me here on purpose? What if she\u2014? Oh, God, what have I done?\u201d The peasant sat watching him and grinning. Another time Mitya might have killed the fool in a fury, but now he felt as weak as a child. He went quietly to the bench, took up his overcoat, put it on without a word, and went out of the hut.", " \u201cI had no thoughts for either of them all this last month. I was expecting another man who had wronged me. But I think,\u201d she said in conclusion, \u201cthat there\u2019s no need for you to inquire about that, nor for me to answer you, for that\u2019s my own affair.\u201d Nikolay Parfenovitch immediately acted upon this hint. He again dismissed the \u201cromantic\u201d aspect of the case and passed to the serious one, that is, to the question of most importance, concerning the three thousand roubles. Grushenka confirmed the statement that three thousand roubles had certainly been spent on the first carousal at Mokroe, and, though she had not counted the money herself, she had heard that it was three thousand from Dmitri Fyodorovitch\u2019s own lips. \u201cDid he tell you that alone, or before some one else, or did you only hear him speak of it to others in your presence?\u201d the prosecutor inquired immediately. To which Grushenka replied that she had heard him say so before other people, and had heard him say so when they were alone. \u201cDid he say it to you alone once, or several times?\u201d inquired the prosecutor, and learned that he had told Grushenka so several times. Ippolit Kirillovitch was very well satisfied with this piece of evidence. Further examination elicited that Grushenka knew, too, where that money had come from, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had got it from Katerina Ivanovna. \u201cAnd did you never, once, hear that the money spent a month ago was not three thousand, but less, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had saved half that sum for his own use?\u201d \u201cNo, I never heard that,\u201d answered Grushenka."], "Who tells Dmitriabout Grushenka\u2019s secret knock?": [" I know! He was cheerful before, though, indeed, he is cheerful to\u2010day.\u201d \u201cBut you said he was worried.\u201d \u201cYes, he is worried and yet cheerful. He keeps on being irritable for a minute and then cheerful and then irritable again. And you know, Alyosha, I am constantly wondering at him\u2014with this awful thing hanging over him, he sometimes laughs at such trifles as though he were a baby himself.\u201d \u201cAnd did he really tell you not to tell me about Ivan? Did he say, \u2018Don\u2019t tell him\u2019?\u201d \u201cYes, he told me, \u2018Don\u2019t tell him.\u2019 It\u2019s you that Mitya\u2019s most afraid of. Because it\u2019s a secret: he said himself it was a secret. Alyosha, darling, go to him and find out what their secret is and come and tell me,\u201d Grushenka besought him with sudden eagerness. \u201cSet my mind at rest that I may know the worst that\u2019s in store for me. That\u2019s why I sent for you.\u201d \u201cYou think it\u2019s something to do with you? If it were, he wouldn\u2019t have told you there was a secret.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. Perhaps he wants to tell me, but doesn\u2019t dare to. He warns me. There is a secret, he tells me, but he won\u2019t tell me what it is.\u201d \u201cWhat do you think yourself?\u201d \u201cWhat do I think? It\u2019s the end for me, that\u2019s what I think. They all three have been plotting my end, for Katerina\u2019s in it. It\u2019s all Katerina, it all comes from her. She is this and that, and that means that I am not. He tells me that beforehand\u2014warns me. He is planning to throw me over, that\u2019s the whole secret.", " When he reached the market\u2010place he stood still in perplexity, wondering at himself. He realized that what he wanted was to go to Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s and find out if anything had happened there. \u201cOn account of some stupid nonsense\u2014as it\u2019s sure to turn out\u2014am I going to wake up the household and make a scandal? Fooh! damn it, is it my business to look after them?\u201d In a very bad humor he went straight home, and suddenly remembered Fenya. \u201cDamn it all! I ought to have questioned her just now,\u201d he thought with vexation, \u201cI should have heard everything.\u201d And the desire to speak to her, and so find out, became so pressing and importunate that when he was half\u2010way home he turned abruptly and went towards the house where Grushenka lodged. Going up to the gate he knocked. The sound of the knock in the silence of the night sobered him and made him feel annoyed. And no one answered him; every one in the house was asleep. \u201cAnd I shall be making a fuss!\u201d he thought, with a feeling of positive discomfort. But instead of going away altogether, he fell to knocking again with all his might, filling the street with clamor. \u201cNot coming? Well, I will knock them up, I will!\u201d he muttered at each knock, fuming at himself, but at the same time he redoubled his knocks on the gate. Chapter VI. \u201cI Am Coming, Too!\u201d But Dmitri Fyodorovitch was speeding along the road. It was a little more than twenty versts to Mokroe, but Andrey\u2019s three horses galloped at such a pace that the distance might be covered in an hour and a quarter.", " It\u2019s his going to see him, that\u2019s what it is,\u201d Grushenka began, and suddenly broke off. Alyosha gazed at her in amazement. \u201cIvan\u2019s going? Has he been to see him? Mitya told me himself that Ivan hasn\u2019t been once.\u201d \u201cThere ... there! What a girl I am! Blurting things out!\u201d exclaimed Grushenka, confused and suddenly blushing. \u201cStay, Alyosha, hush! Since I\u2019ve said so much I\u2019ll tell the whole truth\u2014he\u2019s been to see him twice, the first directly he arrived. He galloped here from Moscow at once, of course, before I was taken ill; and the second time was a week ago. He told Mitya not to tell you about it, under any circumstances; and not to tell any one, in fact. He came secretly.\u201d Alyosha sat plunged in thought, considering something. The news evidently impressed him. \u201cIvan doesn\u2019t talk to me of Mitya\u2019s case,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cHe\u2019s said very little to me these last two months. And whenever I go to see him, he seems vexed at my coming, so I\u2019ve not been to him for the last three weeks. H\u2019m!... if he was there a week ago ... there certainly has been a change in Mitya this week.\u201d \u201cThere has been a change,\u201d Grushenka assented quickly. \u201cThey have a secret, they have a secret! Mitya told me himself there was a secret, and such a secret that Mitya can\u2019t rest. Before then, he was cheerful\u2014and, indeed, he is cheerful now\u2014but when he shakes his head like that, you know, and strides about the room and keeps pulling at the hair on his right temple with his right hand, I know there is something on his mind worrying him....", " I imagine something every day.... What did she say to you about me?\u201d Alyosha repeated all Grushenka had said to him that day. Mitya listened, made him repeat things, and seemed pleased. \u201cThen she is not angry at my being jealous?\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cShe is a regular woman! \u2018I\u2019ve a fierce heart myself!\u2019 Ah, I love such fierce hearts, though I can\u2019t bear any one\u2019s being jealous of me. I can\u2019t endure it. We shall fight. But I shall love her, I shall love her infinitely. Will they marry us? Do they let convicts marry? That\u2019s the question. And without her I can\u2019t exist....\u201d Mitya walked frowning across the room. It was almost dark. He suddenly seemed terribly worried. \u201cSo there\u2019s a secret, she says, a secret? We have got up a plot against her, and Katya is mixed up in it, she thinks. No, my good Grushenka, that\u2019s not it. You are very wide of the mark, in your foolish feminine way. Alyosha, darling, well, here goes! I\u2019ll tell you our secret!\u201d He looked round, went close up quickly to Alyosha, who was standing before him, and whispered to him with an air of mystery, though in reality no one could hear them: the old warder was dozing in the corner, and not a word could reach the ears of the soldiers on guard. \u201cI will tell you all our secret,\u201d Mitya whispered hurriedly. \u201cI meant to tell you later, for how could I decide on anything without you? You are everything to me. Though I say that Ivan is superior to us, you are my angel."], "What does Kolyaclaim as his political affiliation?": [" But when he said he wasn\u2019t guilty, I believed him at once, and I believe him now and always shall believe him. He is not the man to tell a lie.\u201d Fetyukovitch began his cross\u2010examination. I remember that among other things he asked about Rakitin and the twenty\u2010five roubles \u201cyou paid him for bringing Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov to see you.\u201d \u201cThere was nothing strange about his taking the money,\u201d sneered Grushenka, with angry contempt. \u201cHe was always coming to me for money: he used to get thirty roubles a month at least out of me, chiefly for luxuries: he had enough to keep him without my help.\u201d \u201cWhat led you to be so liberal to Mr. Rakitin?\u201d Fetyukovitch asked, in spite of an uneasy movement on the part of the President. \u201cWhy, he is my cousin. His mother was my mother\u2019s sister. But he\u2019s always besought me not to tell any one here of it, he is so dreadfully ashamed of me.\u201d This fact was a complete surprise to every one; no one in the town nor in the monastery, not even Mitya, knew of it. I was told that Rakitin turned purple with shame where he sat. Grushenka had somehow heard before she came into the court that he had given evidence against Mitya, and so she was angry. The whole effect on the public, of Rakitin\u2019s speech, of his noble sentiments, of his attacks upon serfdom and the political disorder of Russia, was this time finally ruined. Fetyukovitch was satisfied: it was another godsend.", " \u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010\u2010 Notes of the Life of the deceased Priest and Monk, the Elder Zossima, taken from his own words by Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov. BIOGRAPHICAL NOTES _(a)_ _Father Zossima\u2019s Brother_ Beloved fathers and teachers, I was born in a distant province in the north, in the town of V. My father was a gentleman by birth, but of no great consequence or position. He died when I was only two years old, and I don\u2019t remember him at all. He left my mother a small house built of wood, and a fortune, not large, but sufficient to keep her and her children in comfort. There were two of us, my elder brother Markel and I. He was eight years older than I was, of hasty irritable temperament, but kind\u2010hearted and never ironical. He was remarkably silent, especially at home with me, his mother, and the servants. He did well at school, but did not get on with his schoolfellows, though he never quarreled, at least so my mother has told me. Six months before his death, when he was seventeen, he made friends with a political exile who had been banished from Moscow to our town for freethinking, and led a solitary existence there. He was a good scholar who had gained distinction in philosophy in the university. Something made him take a fancy to Markel, and he used to ask him to see him. The young man would spend whole evenings with him during that winter, till the exile was summoned to Petersburg to take up his post again at his own request, as he had powerful friends.", " But from the color in his cheeks Alyosha guessed that Rakitin was probably no less excited, and he knew what caused his excitement. \u201cAllow me to tell you one little anecdote, gentlemen,\u201d Mi\u00fcsov said impressively, with a peculiarly majestic air. \u201cSome years ago, soon after the _coup d\u2019\u00e9tat_ of December, I happened to be calling in Paris on an extremely influential personage in the Government, and I met a very interesting man in his house. This individual was not precisely a detective but was a sort of superintendent of a whole regiment of political detectives\u2014a rather powerful position in its own way. I was prompted by curiosity to seize the opportunity of conversation with him. And as he had not come as a visitor but as a subordinate official bringing a special report, and as he saw the reception given me by his chief, he deigned to speak with some openness, to a certain extent only, of course. He was rather courteous than open, as Frenchmen know how to be courteous, especially to a foreigner. But I thoroughly understood him. The subject was the socialist revolutionaries who were at that time persecuted. I will quote only one most curious remark dropped by this person. \u2018We are not particularly afraid,\u2019 said he, \u2018of all these socialists, anarchists, infidels, and revolutionists; we keep watch on them and know all their goings on. But there are a few peculiar men among them who believe in God and are Christians, but at the same time are socialists.", " He clung to the monastery, and was within an ace of becoming a monk. He seems to me to have betrayed unconsciously, and so early, that timid despair which leads so many in our unhappy society, who dread cynicism and its corrupting influences, and mistakenly attribute all the mischief to European enlightenment, to return to their \u2018native soil,\u2019 as they say, to the bosom, so to speak, of their mother earth, like frightened children, yearning to fall asleep on the withered bosom of their decrepit mother, and to sleep there for ever, only to escape the horrors that terrify them. \u201cFor my part I wish the excellent and gifted young man every success; I trust that his youthful idealism and impulse towards the ideas of the people may never degenerate, as often happens, on the moral side into gloomy mysticism, and on the political into blind chauvinism\u2014two elements which are even a greater menace to Russia than the premature decay, due to misunderstanding and gratuitous adoption of European ideas, from which his elder brother is suffering.\u201d Two or three people clapped their hands at the mention of chauvinism and mysticism. Ippolit Kirillovitch had been, indeed, carried away by his own eloquence. All this had little to do with the case in hand, to say nothing of the fact of its being somewhat vague, but the sickly and consumptive man was overcome by the desire to express himself once in his life."], "Who brings Zuchkato Ilyusha\u2019s bedside?": [" Where I stand will be at once the foremost place ... \u2018all things are lawful\u2019 and that\u2019s the end of it! That\u2019s all very charming; but if you want to swindle why do you want a moral sanction for doing it? But that\u2019s our modern Russian all over. He can\u2019t bring himself to swindle without a moral sanction. He is so in love with truth\u2014\u201d The visitor talked, obviously carried away by his own eloquence, speaking louder and louder and looking ironically at his host. But he did not succeed in finishing; Ivan suddenly snatched a glass from the table and flung it at the orator. \u201c_Ah, mais c\u2019est b\u00eate enfin_,\u201d cried the latter, jumping up from the sofa and shaking the drops of tea off himself. \u201cHe remembers Luther\u2019s inkstand! He takes me for a dream and throws glasses at a dream! It\u2019s like a woman! I suspected you were only pretending to stop up your ears.\u201d A loud, persistent knocking was suddenly heard at the window. Ivan jumped up from the sofa. \u201cDo you hear? You\u2019d better open,\u201d cried the visitor; \u201cit\u2019s your brother Alyosha with the most interesting and surprising news, I\u2019ll be bound!\u201d \u201cBe silent, deceiver, I knew it was Alyosha, I felt he was coming, and of course he has not come for nothing; of course he brings \u2018news,\u2019 \u201d Ivan exclaimed frantically. \u201cOpen, open to him. There\u2019s a snowstorm and he is your brother. _Monsieur sait\u2010il le temps qu\u2019il fait? C\u2019est \u00e0 ne pas mettre un chien dehors_.\u201d The knocking continued.", " \u201cOh, you know, that\u2019s rather an interesting view. When I go home, I\u2019ll think it over. I\u2019ll admit I thought I might learn something from you. I\u2019ve come to learn of you, Karamazov,\u201d Kolya concluded, in a voice full of spontaneous feeling. \u201cAnd I of you,\u201d said Alyosha, smiling and pressing his hand. Kolya was much pleased with Alyosha. What struck him most was that he treated him exactly like an equal and that he talked to him just as if he were \u201cquite grown up.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll show you something directly, Karamazov; it\u2019s a theatrical performance, too,\u201d he said, laughing nervously. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve come.\u201d \u201cLet us go first to the people of the house, on the left. All the boys leave their coats in there, because the room is small and hot.\u201d \u201cOh, I\u2019m only coming in for a minute. I\u2019ll keep on my overcoat. Perezvon will stay here in the passage and be dead. _Ici_, Perezvon, lie down and be dead! You see how he\u2019s dead. I\u2019ll go in first and explore, then I\u2019ll whistle to him when I think fit, and you\u2019ll see, he\u2019ll dash in like mad. Only Smurov must not forget to open the door at the moment. I\u2019ll arrange it all and you\u2019ll see something.\u201d Chapter V. By Ilusha\u2019s Bedside The room inhabited by the family of the retired captain Snegiryov is already familiar to the reader. It was close and crowded at that moment with a number of visitors. Several boys were sitting with Ilusha, and though all of them, like Smurov, were prepared to deny that it was Alyosha who had brought them and reconciled them with Ilusha, it was really the fact.", " What object? Alyosha watched him intently. \u201cWe are discussing this gentleman\u2019s most interesting article,\u201d said Father Iosif, the librarian, addressing the elder, and indicating Ivan. \u201cHe brings forward much that is new, but I think the argument cuts both ways. It is an article written in answer to a book by an ecclesiastical authority on the question of the ecclesiastical court, and the scope of its jurisdiction.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry I have not read your article, but I\u2019ve heard of it,\u201d said the elder, looking keenly and intently at Ivan. \u201cHe takes up a most interesting position,\u201d continued the Father Librarian. \u201cAs far as Church jurisdiction is concerned he is apparently quite opposed to the separation of Church from State.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s interesting. But in what sense?\u201d Father Zossima asked Ivan. The latter, at last, answered him, not condescendingly, as Alyosha had feared, but with modesty and reserve, with evident goodwill and apparently without the slightest _arri\u00e8re\u2010pens\u00e9e_. \u201cI start from the position that this confusion of elements, that is, of the essential principles of Church and State, will, of course, go on for ever, in spite of the fact that it is impossible for them to mingle, and that the confusion of these elements cannot lead to any consistent or even normal results, for there is falsity at the very foundation of it. Compromise between the Church and State in such questions as, for instance, jurisdiction, is, to my thinking, impossible in any real sense.", " \u201cHow disgraceful!\u201d cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch. \u201cPardon me!\u201d said the Father Superior. \u201cIt was said of old, \u2018Many have begun to speak against me and have uttered evil sayings about me. And hearing it I have said to myself: it is the correction of the Lord and He has sent it to heal my vain soul.\u2019 And so we humbly thank you, honored guest!\u201d and he made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow. \u201cTut\u2014tut\u2014tut\u2014sanctimoniousness and stock phrases! Old phrases and old gestures. The old lies and formal prostrations. We know all about them. A kiss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller\u2019s _Robbers_. I don\u2019t like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the truth is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclaim aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being virtuous in the world, do good to society, without shutting yourself up in a monastery at other people\u2019s expense, and without expecting a reward up aloft for it\u2014you\u2019ll find that a bit harder. I can talk sense, too, Father Superior. What have they got here?\u201d He went up to the table. \u201cOld port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie, fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has provided it all? The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing earned by his horny hand, wringing it from his family and the tax\u2010gatherer!"], "How does Christrespond to the Grand Inquisitor\u2019s list of accusations?": [" Do you know, Alyosha\u2014don\u2019t laugh! I made a poem about a year ago. If you can waste another ten minutes on me, I\u2019ll tell it to you.\u201d \u201cYou wrote a poem?\u201d \u201cOh, no, I didn\u2019t write it,\u201d laughed Ivan, \u201cand I\u2019ve never written two lines of poetry in my life. But I made up this poem in prose and I remembered it. I was carried away when I made it up. You will be my first reader\u2014that is listener. Why should an author forego even one listener?\u201d smiled Ivan. \u201cShall I tell it to you?\u201d \u201cI am all attention,\u201d said Alyosha. \u201cMy poem is called \u2018The Grand Inquisitor\u2019; it\u2019s a ridiculous thing, but I want to tell it to you.\u201d Chapter V. The Grand Inquisitor \u201cEven this must have a preface\u2014that is, a literary preface,\u201d laughed Ivan, \u201cand I am a poor hand at making one. You see, my action takes place in the sixteenth century, and at that time, as you probably learnt at school, it was customary in poetry to bring down heavenly powers on earth. Not to speak of Dante, in France, clerks, as well as the monks in the monasteries, used to give regular performances in which the Madonna, the saints, the angels, Christ, and God himself were brought on the stage. In those days it was done in all simplicity. In Victor Hugo\u2019s _Notre Dame de Paris_ an edifying and gratuitous spectacle was provided for the people in the H\u00f4tel de Ville of Paris in the reign of Louis XI. in honor of the birth of the dauphin. It was called _Le bon jugement de la tr\u00e8s sainte et gracieuse Vierge Marie_, and she appears herself on the stage and pronounces her _bon jugement_.", " He sees everything; he sees them set the coffin down at His feet, sees the child rise up, and his face darkens. He knits his thick gray brows and his eyes gleam with a sinister fire. He holds out his finger and bids the guards take Him. And such is his power, so completely are the people cowed into submission and trembling obedience to him, that the crowd immediately makes way for the guards, and in the midst of deathlike silence they lay hands on Him and lead Him away. The crowd instantly bows down to the earth, like one man, before the old Inquisitor. He blesses the people in silence and passes on. The guards lead their prisoner to the close, gloomy vaulted prison in the ancient palace of the Holy Inquisition and shut Him in it. The day passes and is followed by the dark, burning, \u2018breathless\u2019 night of Seville. The air is \u2018fragrant with laurel and lemon.\u2019 In the pitch darkness the iron door of the prison is suddenly opened and the Grand Inquisitor himself comes in with a light in his hand. He is alone; the door is closed at once behind him. He stands in the doorway and for a minute or two gazes into His face. At last he goes up slowly, sets the light on the table and speaks. \u201c \u2018Is it Thou? Thou?\u2019 but receiving no answer, he adds at once, \u2018Don\u2019t answer, be silent. What canst Thou say, indeed? I know too well what Thou wouldst say. And Thou hast no right to add anything to what Thou hadst said of old.", " \u201cI simply didn\u2019t notice. You\u2019re quite right there, prosecutor,\u201d Mitya assented suddenly. Next came the account of Mitya\u2019s sudden determination to \u201cstep aside\u201d and make way for their happiness. But he could not make up his mind to open his heart to them as before, and tell them about \u201cthe queen of his soul.\u201d He disliked speaking of her before these chilly persons \u201cwho were fastening on him like bugs.\u201d And so in response to their reiterated questions he answered briefly and abruptly: \u201cWell, I made up my mind to kill myself. What had I left to live for? That question stared me in the face. Her first rightful lover had come back, the man who wronged her but who\u2019d hurried back to offer his love, after five years, and atone for the wrong with marriage.... So I knew it was all over for me.... And behind me disgrace, and that blood\u2014Grigory\u2019s.... What had I to live for? So I went to redeem the pistols I had pledged, to load them and put a bullet in my brain to\u2010morrow.\u201d \u201cAnd a grand feast the night before?\u201d \u201cYes, a grand feast the night before. Damn it all, gentlemen! Do make haste and finish it. I meant to shoot myself not far from here, beyond the village, and I\u2019d planned to do it at five o\u2019clock in the morning. And I had a note in my pocket already. I wrote it at Perhotin\u2019s when I loaded my pistols. Here\u2019s the letter. Read it! It\u2019s not for you I tell it,\u201d he added contemptuously. He took it from his waistcoat pocket and flung it on the table.", " \u201cYour poem is in praise of Jesus, not in blame of Him\u2014as you meant it to be. And who will believe you about freedom? Is that the way to understand it? That\u2019s not the idea of it in the Orthodox Church.... That\u2019s Rome, and not even the whole of Rome, it\u2019s false\u2014those are the worst of the Catholics, the Inquisitors, the Jesuits!... And there could not be such a fantastic creature as your Inquisitor. What are these sins of mankind they take on themselves? Who are these keepers of the mystery who have taken some curse upon themselves for the happiness of mankind? When have they been seen? We know the Jesuits, they are spoken ill of, but surely they are not what you describe? They are not that at all, not at all.... They are simply the Romish army for the earthly sovereignty of the world in the future, with the Pontiff of Rome for Emperor ... that\u2019s their ideal, but there\u2019s no sort of mystery or lofty melancholy about it.... It\u2019s simple lust of power, of filthy earthly gain, of domination\u2014something like a universal serfdom with them as masters\u2014that\u2019s all they stand for. They don\u2019t even believe in God perhaps. Your suffering Inquisitor is a mere fantasy.\u201d \u201cStay, stay,\u201d laughed Ivan, \u201chow hot you are! A fantasy you say, let it be so! Of course it\u2019s a fantasy. But allow me to say: do you really think that the Roman Catholic movement of the last centuries is actually nothing but the lust of power, of filthy earthly gain?"], "What is the subjectof Dmitri\u2019s hallucination?": [" He was trembling all over. He seemed frantic. \u201cBut you\u2019ve seen for yourself that she hasn\u2019t come,\u201d cried Ivan. \u201cBut she may have come by that other entrance.\u201d \u201cYou know that entrance is locked, and you have the key.\u201d Dmitri suddenly reappeared in the drawing\u2010room. He had, of course, found the other entrance locked, and the key actually was in Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s pocket. The windows of all the rooms were also closed, so Grushenka could not have come in anywhere nor have run out anywhere. \u201cHold him!\u201d shrieked Fyodor Pavlovitch, as soon as he saw him again. \u201cHe\u2019s been stealing money in my bedroom.\u201d And tearing himself from Ivan he rushed again at Dmitri. But Dmitri threw up both hands and suddenly clutched the old man by the two tufts of hair that remained on his temples, tugged at them, and flung him with a crash on the floor. He kicked him two or three times with his heel in the face. The old man moaned shrilly. Ivan, though not so strong as Dmitri, threw his arms round him, and with all his might pulled him away. Alyosha helped him with his slender strength, holding Dmitri in front. \u201cMadman! You\u2019ve killed him!\u201d cried Ivan. \u201cServe him right!\u201d shouted Dmitri breathlessly. \u201cIf I haven\u2019t killed him, I\u2019ll come again and kill him. You can\u2019t protect him!\u201d \u201cDmitri! Go away at once!\u201d cried Alyosha commandingly. \u201cAlexey! You tell me. It\u2019s only you I can believe; was she here just now, or not?", " \u201cBut are you really going so soon, brother?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWhat of Dmitri and father? how will it end?\u201d asked Alyosha anxiously. \u201cYou are always harping upon it! What have I to do with it? Am I my brother Dmitri\u2019s keeper?\u201d Ivan snapped irritably, but then he suddenly smiled bitterly. \u201cCain\u2019s answer about his murdered brother, wasn\u2019t it? Perhaps that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking at this moment? Well, damn it all, I can\u2019t stay here to be their keeper, can I? I\u2019ve finished what I had to do, and I am going. Do you imagine I am jealous of Dmitri, that I\u2019ve been trying to steal his beautiful Katerina Ivanovna for the last three months? Nonsense, I had business of my own. I finished it. I am going. I finished it just now, you were witness.\u201d \u201cAt Katerina Ivanovna\u2019s?\u201d \u201cYes, and I\u2019ve released myself once for all. And after all, what have I to do with Dmitri? Dmitri doesn\u2019t come in. I had my own business to settle with Katerina Ivanovna. You know, on the contrary, that Dmitri behaved as though there was an understanding between us. I didn\u2019t ask him to do it, but he solemnly handed her over to me and gave us his blessing. It\u2019s all too funny. Ah, Alyosha, if you only knew how light my heart is now! Would you believe, it, I sat here eating my dinner and was nearly ordering champagne to celebrate my first hour of freedom. Tfoo! It\u2019s been going on nearly six months, and all at once I\u2019ve thrown it off. I could never have guessed even yesterday, how easy it would be to put an end to it if I wanted.\u201d \u201cYou are speaking of your love, Ivan?\u201d \u201cOf my love, if you like.", " \u201cYou are a lie, you are my illness, you are a phantom. It\u2019s only that I don\u2019t know how to destroy you and I see I must suffer for a time. You are my hallucination. You are the incarnation of myself, but only of one side of me ... of my thoughts and feelings, but only the nastiest and stupidest of them. From that point of view you might be of interest to me, if only I had time to waste on you\u2014\u201d \u201cExcuse me, excuse me, I\u2019ll catch you. When you flew out at Alyosha under the lamp\u2010post this evening and shouted to him, \u2018You learnt it from _him_! How do you know that _he_ visits me?\u2019 you were thinking of me then. So for one brief moment you did believe that I really exist,\u201d the gentleman laughed blandly. \u201cYes, that was a moment of weakness ... but I couldn\u2019t believe in you. I don\u2019t know whether I was asleep or awake last time. Perhaps I was only dreaming then and didn\u2019t see you really at all\u2014\u201d \u201cAnd why were you so surly with Alyosha just now? He is a dear; I\u2019ve treated him badly over Father Zossima.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t talk of Alyosha! How dare you, you flunkey!\u201d Ivan laughed again. \u201cYou scold me, but you laugh\u2014that\u2019s a good sign. But you are ever so much more polite than you were last time and I know why: that great resolution of yours\u2014\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t speak of my resolution,\u201d cried Ivan, savagely. \u201cI understand, I understand, _c\u2019est noble, c\u2019est charmant_, you are going to defend your brother and to sacrifice yourself ... _C\u2019est chevaleresque_.\u201d \u201cHold your tongue, I\u2019ll kick you!\u201d \u201cI shan\u2019t be altogether sorry, for then my object will be attained.", " Seeing this, Dmitri uttered a scream rather than a shout and rushed at Grigory. \u201cThen she\u2019s there! She\u2019s hidden there! Out of the way, scoundrel!\u201d He tried to pull Grigory away, but the old servant pushed him back. Beside himself with fury, Dmitri struck out, and hit Grigory with all his might. The old man fell like a log, and Dmitri, leaping over him, broke in the door. Smerdyakov remained pale and trembling at the other end of the room, huddling close to Fyodor Pavlovitch. \u201cShe\u2019s here!\u201d shouted Dmitri. \u201cI saw her turn towards the house just now, but I couldn\u2019t catch her. Where is she? Where is she?\u201d That shout, \u201cShe\u2019s here!\u201d produced an indescribable effect on Fyodor Pavlovitch. All his terror left him. \u201cHold him! Hold him!\u201d he cried, and dashed after Dmitri. Meanwhile Grigory had got up from the floor, but still seemed stunned. Ivan and Alyosha ran after their father. In the third room something was heard to fall on the floor with a ringing crash: it was a large glass vase\u2014not an expensive one\u2014on a marble pedestal which Dmitri had upset as he ran past it. \u201cAt him!\u201d shouted the old man. \u201cHelp!\u201d Ivan and Alyosha caught the old man and were forcibly bringing him back. \u201cWhy do you run after him? He\u2019ll murder you outright,\u201d Ivan cried wrathfully at his father. \u201cIvan! Alyosha! She must be here. Grushenka\u2019s here. He said he saw her himself, running.\u201d He was choking. He was not expecting Grushenka at the time, and the sudden news that she was here made him beside himself."], "Which elder isAlyosha\u2019s teacher?": [" At ten years old he had realized that they were living not in their own home but on other people\u2019s charity, and that their father was a man of whom it was disgraceful to speak. This boy began very early, almost in his infancy (so they say at least), to show a brilliant and unusual aptitude for learning. I don\u2019t know precisely why, but he left the family of Yefim Petrovitch when he was hardly thirteen, entering a Moscow gymnasium, and boarding with an experienced and celebrated teacher, an old friend of Yefim Petrovitch. Ivan used to declare afterwards that this was all due to the \u201cardor for good works\u201d of Yefim Petrovitch, who was captivated by the idea that the boy\u2019s genius should be trained by a teacher of genius. But neither Yefim Petrovitch nor this teacher was living when the young man finished at the gymnasium and entered the university. As Yefim Petrovitch had made no provision for the payment of the tyrannical old lady\u2019s legacy, which had grown from one thousand to two, it was delayed, owing to formalities inevitable in Russia, and the young man was in great straits for the first two years at the university, as he was forced to keep himself all the time he was studying. It must be noted that he did not even attempt to communicate with his father, perhaps from pride, from contempt for him, or perhaps from his cool common sense, which told him that from such a father he would get no real assistance.", " Whether they had really been healed or were simply better in the natural course of the disease was a question which did not exist for Alyosha, for he fully believed in the spiritual power of his teacher and rejoiced in his fame, in his glory, as though it were his own triumph. His heart throbbed, and he beamed, as it were, all over when the elder came out to the gates of the hermitage into the waiting crowd of pilgrims of the humbler class who had flocked from all parts of Russia on purpose to see the elder and obtain his blessing. They fell down before him, wept, kissed his feet, kissed the earth on which he stood, and wailed, while the women held up their children to him and brought him the sick \u201cpossessed with devils.\u201d The elder spoke to them, read a brief prayer over them, blessed them, and dismissed them. Of late he had become so weak through attacks of illness that he was sometimes unable to leave his cell, and the pilgrims waited for him to come out for several days. Alyosha did not wonder why they loved him so, why they fell down before him and wept with emotion merely at seeing his face. Oh! he understood that for the humble soul of the Russian peasant, worn out by grief and toil, and still more by the everlasting injustice and everlasting sin, his own and the world\u2019s, it was the greatest need and comfort to find some one or something holy to fall down before and worship.", " The elder had sent Porfiry the evening before to a widow, whose house had been burnt down lately, and who after the fire had gone with her children begging alms. Porfiry hastened to reply that he had given the money, as he had been instructed, \u201cfrom an unknown benefactress.\u201d \u201cGet up, my dear boy,\u201d the elder went on to Alyosha. \u201cLet me look at you. Have you been home and seen your brother?\u201d It seemed strange to Alyosha that he asked so confidently and precisely, about one of his brothers only\u2014but which one? Then perhaps he had sent him out both yesterday and to\u2010day for the sake of that brother. \u201cI have seen one of my brothers,\u201d answered Alyosha. \u201cI mean the elder one, to whom I bowed down.\u201d \u201cI only saw him yesterday and could not find him to\u2010day,\u201d said Alyosha. \u201cMake haste to find him, go again to\u2010morrow and make haste, leave everything and make haste. Perhaps you may still have time to prevent something terrible. I bowed down yesterday to the great suffering in store for him.\u201d He was suddenly silent and seemed to be pondering. The words were strange. Father Iosif, who had witnessed the scene yesterday, exchanged glances with Father Pa\u00efssy. Alyosha could not resist asking: \u201cFather and teacher,\u201d he began with extreme emotion, \u201cyour words are too obscure.... What is this suffering in store for him?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t inquire. I seemed to see something terrible yesterday ... as though his whole future were expressed in his eyes.", " He had to be on the alert. Dmitri might be on the watch for her somewhere, and when she knocked on the window (Smerdyakov had informed him two days before that he had told her where and how to knock) the door must be opened at once. She must not be a second in the passage, for fear\u2014which God forbid!\u2014that she should be frightened and run away. Fyodor Pavlovitch had much to think of, but never had his heart been steeped in such voluptuous hopes. This time he could say almost certainly that she would come! Book VI. The Russian Monk Chapter I. Father Zossima And His Visitors When with an anxious and aching heart Alyosha went into his elder\u2019s cell, he stood still almost astonished. Instead of a sick man at his last gasp, perhaps unconscious, as he had feared to find him, he saw him sitting up in his chair and, though weak and exhausted, his face was bright and cheerful, he was surrounded by visitors and engaged in a quiet and joyful conversation. But he had only got up from his bed a quarter of an hour before Alyosha\u2019s arrival; his visitors had gathered together in his cell earlier, waiting for him to wake, having received a most confident assurance from Father Pa\u00efssy that \u201cthe teacher would get up, and as he had himself promised in the morning, converse once more with those dear to his heart.\u201d This promise and indeed every word of the dying elder Father Pa\u00efssy put implicit trust in."], "What single injusticetroubles Ivan most?": [" \u201cThere\u2019ll be nothing of the sort, and you won\u2019t go,\u201d he concluded at last positively. \u201cYou don\u2019t understand me,\u201d Ivan exclaimed reproachfully. \u201cYou\u2019ll be too much ashamed, if you confess it all. And, what\u2019s more, it will be no use at all, for I shall say straight out that I never said anything of the sort to you, and that you are either ill (and it looks like it, too), or that you\u2019re so sorry for your brother that you are sacrificing yourself to save him and have invented it all against me, for you\u2019ve always thought no more of me than if I\u2019d been a fly. And who will believe you, and what single proof have you got?\u201d \u201cListen, you showed me those notes just now to convince me.\u201d Smerdyakov lifted the book off the notes and laid it on one side. \u201cTake that money away with you,\u201d Smerdyakov sighed. \u201cOf course, I shall take it. But why do you give it to me, if you committed the murder for the sake of it?\u201d Ivan looked at him with great surprise. \u201cI don\u2019t want it,\u201d Smerdyakov articulated in a shaking voice, with a gesture of refusal. \u201cI did have an idea of beginning a new life with that money in Moscow or, better still, abroad. I did dream of it, chiefly because \u2018all things are lawful.\u2019 That was quite right what you taught me, for you talked a lot to me about that. For if there\u2019s no everlasting God, there\u2019s no such thing as virtue, and there\u2019s no need of it. You were right there. So that\u2019s how I looked at it.\u201d \u201cDid you come to that of yourself?\u201d asked Ivan, with a wry smile.", " God bless you! Come, go along! Love Ivan!\u201d was Mitya\u2019s last word. Alyosha went out in tears. Such distrustfulness in Mitya, such lack of confidence even to him, to Alyosha\u2014all this suddenly opened before Alyosha an unsuspected depth of hopeless grief and despair in the soul of his unhappy brother. Intense, infinite compassion overwhelmed him instantly. There was a poignant ache in his torn heart. \u201cLove Ivan!\u201d\u2014he suddenly recalled Mitya\u2019s words. And he was going to Ivan. He badly wanted to see Ivan all day. He was as much worried about Ivan as about Mitya, and more than ever now. Chapter V. Not You, Not You! On the way to Ivan he had to pass the house where Katerina Ivanovna was living. There was light in the windows. He suddenly stopped and resolved to go in. He had not seen Katerina Ivanovna for more than a week. But now it struck him that Ivan might be with her, especially on the eve of the terrible day. Ringing, and mounting the staircase, which was dimly lighted by a Chinese lantern, he saw a man coming down, and as they met, he recognized him as his brother. So he was just coming from Katerina Ivanovna. \u201cAh, it\u2019s only you,\u201d said Ivan dryly. \u201cWell, good\u2010by! You are going to her?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t advise you to; she\u2019s upset and you\u2019ll upset her more.\u201d A door was instantly flung open above, and a voice cried suddenly: \u201cNo, no! Alexey Fyodorovitch, have you come from him?\u201d \u201cYes, I have been with him.\u201d \u201cHas he sent me any message?", " A light lunch was brought in, with brandy. When Fyodor Pavlovitch was pleased, he usually became expansive, but to\u2010day he seemed to restrain himself. Of Dmitri, for instance, he did not say a word. He was quite unmoved by the parting, and seemed, in fact, at a loss for something to say. Ivan noticed this particularly. \u201cHe must be bored with me,\u201d he thought. Only when accompanying his son out on to the steps, the old man began to fuss about. He would have kissed him, but Ivan made haste to hold out his hand, obviously avoiding the kiss. His father saw it at once, and instantly pulled himself up. \u201cWell, good luck to you, good luck to you!\u201d he repeated from the steps. \u201cYou\u2019ll come again some time or other? Mind you do come. I shall always be glad to see you. Well, Christ be with you!\u201d Ivan got into the carriage. \u201cGood\u2010by, Ivan! Don\u2019t be too hard on me!\u201d the father called for the last time. The whole household came out to take leave\u2014Smerdyakov, Marfa and Grigory. Ivan gave them ten roubles each. When he had seated himself in the carriage, Smerdyakov jumped up to arrange the rug. \u201cYou see ... I am going to Tchermashnya,\u201d broke suddenly from Ivan. Again, as the day before, the words seemed to drop of themselves, and he laughed, too, a peculiar, nervous laugh. He remembered it long after. \u201cIt\u2019s a true saying then, that \u2018it\u2019s always worth while speaking to a clever man,\u2019 \u201d answered Smerdyakov firmly, looking significantly at Ivan.", " It would suit him down to the ground. He\u2019ll carry off Katerina Ivanovna, for whom he is languishing, and pocket her dowry of sixty thousand. That\u2019s very alluring to start with, for a man of no consequence and a beggar. And, take note, he won\u2019t be wronging Mitya, but doing him the greatest service. For I know as a fact that Mitya only last week, when he was with some gypsy girls drunk in a tavern, cried out aloud that he was unworthy of his betrothed, Katya, but that his brother Ivan, he was the man who deserved her. And Katerina Ivanovna will not in the end refuse such a fascinating man as Ivan. She\u2019s hesitating between the two of them already. And how has that Ivan won you all, so that you all worship him? He is laughing at you, and enjoying himself at your expense.\u201d \u201cHow do you know? How can you speak so confidently?\u201d Alyosha asked sharply, frowning. \u201cWhy do you ask, and are frightened at my answer? It shows that you know I\u2019m speaking the truth.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t like Ivan. Ivan wouldn\u2019t be tempted by money.\u201d \u201cReally? And the beauty of Katerina Ivanovna? It\u2019s not only the money, though a fortune of sixty thousand is an attraction.\u201d \u201cIvan is above that. He wouldn\u2019t make up to any one for thousands. It is not money, it\u2019s not comfort Ivan is seeking. Perhaps it\u2019s suffering he is seeking.\u201d \u201cWhat wild dream now? Oh, you\u2014aristocrats!\u201d \u201cAh, Misha, he has a stormy spirit. His mind is in bondage."], "Who raises Smerdyakov?": [" Ha ha! I see through you, Mr. Prosecutor. You thought, of course, that I should jump at that, catch at your prompting, and shout with all my might, \u2018Aie! it\u2019s Smerdyakov; he\u2019s the murderer.\u2019 Confess that\u2019s what you thought. Confess, and I\u2019ll go on.\u201d But the prosecutor did not confess. He held his tongue and waited. \u201cYou\u2019re mistaken. I\u2019m not going to shout \u2018It\u2019s Smerdyakov,\u2019 \u201d said Mitya. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t even suspect him?\u201d \u201cWhy, do you suspect him?\u201d \u201cHe is suspected, too.\u201d Mitya fixed his eyes on the floor. \u201cJoking apart,\u201d he brought out gloomily. \u201cListen. From the very beginning, almost from the moment when I ran out to you from behind the curtain, I\u2019ve had the thought of Smerdyakov in my mind. I\u2019ve been sitting here, shouting that I\u2019m innocent and thinking all the time \u2018Smerdyakov!\u2019 I can\u2019t get Smerdyakov out of my head. In fact, I, too, thought of Smerdyakov just now; but only for a second. Almost at once I thought, \u2018No, it\u2019s not Smerdyakov.\u2019 It\u2019s not his doing, gentlemen.\u201d \u201cIn that case is there anybody else you suspect?\u201d Nikolay Parfenovitch inquired cautiously. \u201cI don\u2019t know any one it could be, whether it\u2019s the hand of Heaven or Satan, but ... not Smerdyakov,\u201d Mitya jerked out with decision. \u201cBut what makes you affirm so confidently and emphatically that it\u2019s not he?\u201d \u201cFrom my conviction\u2014my impression. Because Smerdyakov is a man of the most abject character and a coward. He\u2019s not a coward, he\u2019s the epitome of all the cowardice in the world walking on two legs.", " \u201cPrecisely so,\u201d said Smerdyakov, softly and reasonably, watching Ivan intently, however. \u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018precisely so\u2019?\u201d Ivan questioned him, with a menacing light in his eyes, restraining himself with difficulty. \u201cI spoke because I felt sorry for you. If I were in your place I should simply throw it all up ... rather than stay on in such a position,\u201d answered Smerdyakov, with the most candid air looking at Ivan\u2019s flashing eyes. They were both silent. \u201cYou seem to be a perfect idiot, and what\u2019s more ... an awful scoundrel, too.\u201d Ivan rose suddenly from the bench. He was about to pass straight through the gate, but he stopped short and turned to Smerdyakov. Something strange followed. Ivan, in a sudden paroxysm, bit his lip, clenched his fists, and, in another minute, would have flung himself on Smerdyakov. The latter, anyway, noticed it at the same moment, started, and shrank back. But the moment passed without mischief to Smerdyakov, and Ivan turned in silence, as it seemed in perplexity, to the gate. \u201cI am going away to Moscow to\u2010morrow, if you care to know\u2014early to\u2010morrow morning. That\u2019s all!\u201d he suddenly said aloud angrily, and wondered himself afterwards what need there was to say this then to Smerdyakov. \u201cThat\u2019s the best thing you can do,\u201d he responded, as though he had expected to hear it; \u201cexcept that you can always be telegraphed for from Moscow, if anything should happen here.\u201d Ivan stopped again, and again turned quickly to Smerdyakov.", " Something very deep down seemed burning and rankling in his soul. His pride above all suffered cruelly all that month. But of that later.... When, after his conversation with Alyosha, Ivan suddenly decided with his hand on the bell of his lodging to go to Smerdyakov, he obeyed a sudden and peculiar impulse of indignation. He suddenly remembered how Katerina Ivanovna had only just cried out to him in Alyosha\u2019s presence: \u201cIt was you, you, persuaded me of his\u201d (that is, Mitya\u2019s) \u201cguilt!\u201d Ivan was thunderstruck when he recalled it. He had never once tried to persuade her that Mitya was the murderer; on the contrary, he had suspected himself in her presence, that time when he came back from Smerdyakov. It was _she_, she, who had produced that \u201cdocument\u201d and proved his brother\u2019s guilt. And now she suddenly exclaimed: \u201cI\u2019ve been at Smerdyakov\u2019s myself!\u201d When had she been there? Ivan had known nothing of it. So she was not at all so sure of Mitya\u2019s guilt! And what could Smerdyakov have told her? What, what, had he said to her? His heart burned with violent anger. He could not understand how he could, half an hour before, have let those words pass and not have cried out at the moment. He let go of the bell and rushed off to Smerdyakov. \u201cI shall kill him, perhaps, this time,\u201d he thought on the way. Chapter VIII. The Third And Last Interview With Smerdyakov When he was half\u2010way there, the keen dry wind that had been blowing early that morning rose again, and a fine dry snow began falling thickly.", " Why not accept such an interpretation of the facts? What trustworthy proof have we that the prisoner is lying? \u201cBut we shall be told at once again, \u2018There is his father\u2019s corpse! If he ran away without murdering him, who did murder him?\u2019 Here, I repeat, you have the whole logic of the prosecution. Who murdered him, if not he? There\u2019s no one to put in his place. \u201cGentlemen of the jury, is that really so? Is it positively, actually true that there is no one else at all? We\u2019ve heard the prosecutor count on his fingers all the persons who were in that house that night. They were five in number; three of them, I agree, could not have been responsible\u2014the murdered man himself, old Grigory, and his wife. There are left then the prisoner and Smerdyakov, and the prosecutor dramatically exclaims that the prisoner pointed to Smerdyakov because he had no one else to fix on, that had there been a sixth person, even a phantom of a sixth person, he would have abandoned the charge against Smerdyakov at once in shame and have accused that other. But, gentlemen of the jury, why may I not draw the very opposite conclusion? There are two persons\u2014the prisoner and Smerdyakov. Why can I not say that you accuse my client, simply because you have no one else to accuse? And you have no one else only because you have determined to exclude Smerdyakov from all suspicion. \u201cIt\u2019s true, indeed, Smerdyakov is accused only by the prisoner, his two brothers, and Madame Svyetlov."], "Who introducesAlyosha to Grushenka?": [" From some rumor, or perhaps from some stray word of Grushenka\u2019s, he had gathered further that the old man would perhaps prefer him to Fyodor Pavlovitch for Grushenka. Possibly many of the readers of my novel will feel that in reckoning on such assistance, and being ready to take his bride, so to speak, from the hands of her protector, Dmitri showed great coarseness and want of delicacy. I will only observe that Mitya looked upon Grushenka\u2019s past as something completely over. He looked on that past with infinite pity and resolved with all the fervor of his passion that when once Grushenka told him she loved him and would marry him, it would mean the beginning of a new Grushenka and a new Dmitri, free from every vice. They would forgive one another and would begin their lives afresh. As for Kuzma Samsonov, Dmitri looked upon him as a man who had exercised a fateful influence in that remote past of Grushenka\u2019s, though she had never loved him, and who was now himself a thing of the past, completely done with, and, so to say, non\u2010existent. Besides, Mitya hardly looked upon him as a man at all, for it was known to every one in the town that he was only a shattered wreck, whose relations with Grushenka had changed their character and were now simply paternal, and that this had been so for a long time. In any case there was much simplicity on Mitya\u2019s part in all this, for in spite of all his vices, he was a very simple\u2010hearted man.", " For him the whole tormenting question lay between him and Fyodor Pavlovitch. Here, we must note, by the way, one certain fact: he was firmly persuaded that Fyodor Pavlovitch would offer, or perhaps had offered, Grushenka lawful wedlock, and did not for a moment believe that the old voluptuary hoped to gain his object for three thousand roubles. Mitya had reached this conclusion from his knowledge of Grushenka and her character. That was how it was that he could believe at times that all Grushenka\u2019s uneasiness rose from not knowing which of them to choose, which was most to her advantage. Strange to say, during those days it never occurred to him to think of the approaching return of the \u201cofficer,\u201d that is, of the man who had been such a fatal influence in Grushenka\u2019s life, and whose arrival she was expecting with such emotion and dread. It is true that of late Grushenka had been very silent about it. Yet he was perfectly aware of a letter she had received a month ago from her seducer, and had heard of it from her own lips. He partly knew, too, what the letter contained. In a moment of spite Grushenka had shown him that letter, but to her astonishment he attached hardly any consequence to it. It would be hard to say why this was. Perhaps, weighed down by all the hideous horror of his struggle with his own father for this woman, he was incapable of imagining any danger more terrible, at any rate for the time.", " Grushenka was not even mentioned in his will. All this became known afterwards. He helped Grushenka with his advice to increase her capital and put business in her way. When Fyodor Pavlovitch, who first came into contact with Grushenka over a piece of speculation, ended to his own surprise by falling madly in love with her, old Samsonov, gravely ill as he was, was immensely amused. It is remarkable that throughout their whole acquaintance Grushenka was absolutely and spontaneously open with the old man, and he seems to have been the only person in the world with whom she was so. Of late, when Dmitri too had come on the scene with his love, the old man left off laughing. On the contrary, he once gave Grushenka a stern and earnest piece of advice. \u201cIf you have to choose between the two, father or son, you\u2019d better choose the old man, if only you make sure the old scoundrel will marry you and settle some fortune on you beforehand. But don\u2019t keep on with the captain, you\u2019ll get no good out of that.\u201d These were the very words of the old profligate, who felt already that his death was not far off and who actually died five months later. I will note, too, in passing, that although many in our town knew of the grotesque and monstrous rivalry of the Karamazovs, father and son, the object of which was Grushenka, scarcely any one understood what really underlay her attitude to both of them.", " Grushenka left that letter, too, unanswered. A whole series of letters had followed\u2014one every day\u2014all as pompous and rhetorical, but the loan asked for, gradually diminishing, dropped to a hundred roubles, then to twenty\u2010five, to ten, and finally Grushenka received a letter in which both the Poles begged her for only one rouble and included a receipt signed by both. Then Grushenka suddenly felt sorry for them, and at dusk she went round herself to their lodging. She found the two Poles in great poverty, almost destitution, without food or fuel, without cigarettes, in debt to their landlady. The two hundred roubles they had carried off from Mitya at Mokroe had soon disappeared. But Grushenka was surprised at their meeting her with arrogant dignity and self\u2010assertion, with the greatest punctilio and pompous speeches. Grushenka simply laughed, and gave her former admirer ten roubles. Then, laughing, she told Mitya of it and he was not in the least jealous. But ever since, the Poles had attached themselves to Grushenka and bombarded her daily with requests for money and she had always sent them small sums. And now that day Mitya had taken it into his head to be fearfully jealous. \u201cLike a fool, I went round to him just for a minute, on the way to see Mitya, for he is ill, too, my Pole,\u201d Grushenka began again with nervous haste. \u201cI was laughing, telling Mitya about it. \u2018Fancy,\u2019 I said, \u2018my Pole had the happy thought to sing his old songs to me to the guitar."], "Who exhibitsthe letter at Dmitri\u2019s trial?": [" To which Father Zossima had answered sternly, forbidding her to do so, and saying that to pray for the living as though they were dead was a kind of sorcery. He afterwards forgave her on account of her ignorance, and added, \u201cas though reading the book of the future\u201d (this was Madame Hohlakov\u2019s expression), words of comfort: \u201cthat her son Vassya was certainly alive and he would either come himself very shortly or send a letter, and that she was to go home and expect him.\u201d And \u201cWould you believe it?\u201d exclaimed Madame Hohlakov enthusiastically, \u201cthe prophecy has been fulfilled literally indeed, and more than that.\u201d Scarcely had the old woman reached home when they gave her a letter from Siberia which had been awaiting her. But that was not all; in the letter written on the road from Ekaterinenburg, Vassya informed his mother that he was returning to Russia with an official, and that three weeks after her receiving the letter he hoped \u201cto embrace his mother.\u201d Madame Hohlakov warmly entreated Alyosha to report this new \u201cmiracle of prediction\u201d to the Superior and all the brotherhood. \u201cAll, all, ought to know of it!\u201d she concluded. The letter had been written in haste, the excitement of the writer was apparent in every line of it. But Alyosha had no need to tell the monks, for all knew of it already. Rakitin had commissioned the monk who brought his message \u201cto inform most respectfully his reverence Father Pa\u00efssy, that he, Rakitin, has a matter to speak of with him, of such gravity that he dare not defer it for a moment, and humbly begs forgiveness for his presumption.\u201d As the monk had given the message to Father Pa\u00efssy before that to Alyosha, the latter found after reading the letter, there was nothing left for him to do but to hand it to Father Pa\u00efssy in confirmation of the story.", " For he knew I shouldn\u2019t want to revenge myself and ruin him! But read it, read it attentively\u2014more attentively, please\u2014and you will see that he had described it all in his letter, all beforehand, how he would kill his father and where his money was kept. Look, please, don\u2019t overlook that, there\u2019s one phrase there, \u2018I shall kill him as soon as Ivan has gone away.\u2019 So he thought it all out beforehand how he would kill him,\u201d Katerina Ivanovna pointed out to the court with venomous and malignant triumph. Oh! it was clear she had studied every line of that letter and detected every meaning underlining it. \u201cIf he hadn\u2019t been drunk, he wouldn\u2019t have written to me; but, look, everything is written there beforehand, just as he committed the murder after. A complete program of it!\u201d she exclaimed frantically. She was reckless now of all consequences to herself, though, no doubt, she had foreseen them even a month ago, for even then, perhaps, shaking with anger, she had pondered whether to show it at the trial or not. Now she had taken the fatal plunge. I remember that the letter was read aloud by the clerk, directly afterwards, I believe. It made an overwhelming impression. They asked Mitya whether he admitted having written the letter. \u201cIt\u2019s mine, mine!\u201d cried Mitya. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have written it, if I hadn\u2019t been drunk!... We\u2019ve hated each other for many things, Katya, but I swear, I swear I loved you even while I hated you, and you didn\u2019t love me!\u201d He sank back on his seat, wringing his hands in despair.", " I am a worthless creature,\u201d said Maximov, with tears in his voice. \u201cYou would do better to spend your kindness on people of more use than me.\u201d \u201cEch, every one is of use, Maximushka, and how can we tell who\u2019s of most use? If only that Pole didn\u2019t exist, Alyosha. He\u2019s taken it into his head to fall ill, too, to\u2010day. I\u2019ve been to see him also. And I shall send him some pies, too, on purpose. I hadn\u2019t sent him any, but Mitya accused me of it, so now I shall send some! Ah, here\u2019s Fenya with a letter! Yes, it\u2019s from the Poles\u2014begging again!\u201d Pan Mussyalovitch had indeed sent an extremely long and characteristically eloquent letter in which he begged her to lend him three roubles. In the letter was enclosed a receipt for the sum, with a promise to repay it within three months, signed by Pan Vrublevsky as well. Grushenka had received many such letters, accompanied by such receipts, from her former lover during the fortnight of her convalescence. But she knew that the two Poles had been to ask after her health during her illness. The first letter Grushenka got from them was a long one, written on large notepaper and with a big family crest on the seal. It was so obscure and rhetorical that Grushenka put it down before she had read half, unable to make head or tail of it. She could not attend to letters then. The first letter was followed next day by another in which Pan Mussyalovitch begged her for a loan of two thousand roubles for a very short period.", " It was the letter written by Mitya to Katerina Ivanovna when he was drunk, on the very evening he met Alyosha at the crossroads on the way to the monastery, after the scene at Katerina Ivanovna\u2019s, when Grushenka had insulted her. Then, parting from Alyosha, Mitya had rushed to Grushenka. I don\u2019t know whether he saw her, but in the evening he was at the \u201cMetropolis,\u201d where he got thoroughly drunk. Then he asked for pen and paper and wrote a document of weighty consequences to himself. It was a wordy, disconnected, frantic letter, a drunken letter in fact. It was like the talk of a drunken man, who, on his return home, begins with extraordinary heat telling his wife or one of his household how he has just been insulted, what a rascal had just insulted him, what a fine fellow he is on the other hand, and how he will pay that scoundrel out; and all that at great length, with great excitement and incoherence, with drunken tears and blows on the table. The letter was written on a dirty piece of ordinary paper of the cheapest kind. It had been provided by the tavern and there were figures scrawled on the back of it. There was evidently not space enough for his drunken verbosity and Mitya not only filled the margins but had written the last line right across the rest. The letter ran as follows: FATAL KATYA: To\u2010morrow I will get the money and repay your three thousand and farewell, woman of great wrath, but farewell, too, my love!"], "Who slams herown hand in the door?": [" He gave the signal and father opened to him ... for no one but he knew the signal, and without the signal father would never have opened the door....\u201d \u201cBut you\u2019re again forgetting the circumstance,\u201d the prosecutor observed, still speaking with the same restraint, though with a note of triumph, \u201cthat there was no need to give the signal if the door already stood open when you were there, while you were in the garden....\u201d \u201cThe door, the door,\u201d muttered Mitya, and he stared speechless at the prosecutor. He sank back helpless in his chair. All were silent. \u201cYes, the door!... It\u2019s a nightmare! God is against me!\u201d he exclaimed, staring before him in complete stupefaction. \u201cCome, you see,\u201d the prosecutor went on with dignity, \u201cand you can judge for yourself, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. On the one hand we have the evidence of the open door from which you ran out, a fact which overwhelms you and us. On the other side your incomprehensible, persistent, and, so to speak, obdurate silence with regard to the source from which you obtained the money which was so suddenly seen in your hands, when only three hours earlier, on your own showing, you pledged your pistols for the sake of ten roubles! In view of all these facts, judge for yourself. What are we to believe, and what can we depend upon? And don\u2019t accuse us of being \u2018frigid, cynical, scoffing people,\u2019 who are incapable of believing in the generous impulses of your heart....", " Go to the door, open it gently, and see whether mamma is listening,\u201d said Lise, in a nervous, hurried whisper. Alyosha went, opened the door, and reported that no one was listening. \u201cCome here, Alexey Fyodorovitch,\u201d Lise went on, flushing redder and redder. \u201cGive me your hand\u2014that\u2019s right. I have to make a great confession, I didn\u2019t write to you yesterday in joke, but in earnest,\u201d and she hid her eyes with her hand. It was evident that she was greatly ashamed of the confession. Suddenly she snatched his hand and impulsively kissed it three times. \u201cAh, Lise, what a good thing!\u201d cried Alyosha joyfully. \u201cYou know, I was perfectly sure you were in earnest.\u201d \u201cSure? Upon my word!\u201d She put aside his hand, but did not leave go of it, blushing hotly, and laughing a little happy laugh. \u201cI kiss his hand and he says, \u2018What a good thing!\u2019 \u201d But her reproach was undeserved. Alyosha, too, was greatly overcome. \u201cI should like to please you always, Lise, but I don\u2019t know how to do it,\u201d he muttered, blushing too. \u201cAlyosha, dear, you are cold and rude. Do you see? He has chosen me as his wife and is quite settled about it. He is sure I was in earnest. What a thing to say! Why, that\u2019s impertinence\u2014that\u2019s what it is.\u201d \u201cWhy, was it wrong of me to feel sure?\u201d Alyosha asked, laughing suddenly. \u201cAh, Alyosha, on the contrary, it was delightfully right,\u201d cried Lise, looking tenderly and happily at him. Alyosha stood still, holding her hand in his.", " The old man\u2019s lying there now with his skull broken, while I\u2014after dramatically describing how I wanted to kill him, and how I snatched up the pestle\u2014I suddenly run away from the window.

You are scoffers, gentlemen!\u201d And he swung round on his chair so that it creaked. \u201cAnd did you notice,\u201d asked the prosecutor suddenly, as though not observing Mitya\u2019s excitement, \u201cdid you notice when you ran away from the window, whether the door into the garden was open?\u201d \u201cNo, it was not open.\u201d \u201cIt was not?\u201d \u201cIt was shut.

Wait a bit!\u201d he seemed suddenly to bethink himself, and almost with a start: \u201cWhy, did you find the door open?\u201d \u201cYes, it was open.\u201d \u201cWhy, who could have opened it if you did not open it yourselves?\u201d cried Mitya, greatly astonished. \u201cThe door stood open, and your father\u2019s murderer undoubtedly went in at that door, and, having accomplished the crime, went out again by the same door,\u201d the prosecutor pronounced deliberately, as though chiseling out each word separately. \u201cThat is perfectly clear. The murder was committed in the room and _not through the __ window_; that is absolutely certain from the examination that has been made, from the position of the body and everything. There can be no doubt of that circumstance.\u201d Mitya was absolutely dumbfounded. \u201cBut that\u2019s utterly impossible!\u201d he cried, completely at a loss.", " Both seemed to be deaf. In answer to his repeated inquiry for the captain, one of them at last understood that he was asking for their lodgers, and pointed to a door across the passage. The captain\u2019s lodging turned out to be a simple cottage room. Alyosha had his hand on the iron latch to open the door, when he was struck by the strange hush within. Yet he knew from Katerina Ivanovna\u2019s words that the man had a family. \u201cEither they are all asleep or perhaps they have heard me coming and are waiting for me to open the door. I\u2019d better knock first,\u201d and he knocked. An answer came, but not at once, after an interval of perhaps ten seconds. \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d shouted some one in a loud and very angry voice. Then Alyosha opened the door and crossed the threshold. He found himself in a regular peasant\u2019s room. Though it was large, it was cumbered up with domestic belongings of all sorts, and there were several people in it. On the left was a large Russian stove. From the stove to the window on the left was a string running across the room, and on it there were rags hanging. There was a bedstead against the wall on each side, right and left, covered with knitted quilts. On the one on the left was a pyramid of four print\u2010covered pillows, each smaller than the one beneath. On the other there was only one very small pillow.

He overtook her outside the hospital grounds. She was walking fast, but as soon as Alyosha caught her up she said quickly: \u201cNo, before that woman I can\u2019t punish myself! I asked her forgiveness because I wanted to punish myself to the bitter end. She would not forgive me.... I like her for that!\u201d she added, in an unnatural voice, and her eyes flashed with fierce resentment. \u201cMy brother did not expect this in the least,\u201d muttered Alyosha. \u201cHe was sure she would not come\u2014\u201d \u201cNo doubt. Let us leave that,\u201d she snapped. \u201cListen: I can\u2019t go with you to the funeral now. I\u2019ve sent them flowers. I think they still have money. If necessary, tell them I\u2019ll never abandon them.... Now leave me, leave me, please. You are late as it is\u2014the bells are ringing for the service.... Leave me, please!\u201d Chapter III. Ilusha\u2019s Funeral. The Speech At The Stone He really was late. They had waited for him and had already decided to bear the pretty flower\u2010decked little coffin to the church without him. It was the coffin of poor little Ilusha. He had died two days after Mitya was sentenced. At the gate of the house Alyosha was met by the shouts of the boys, Ilusha\u2019s schoolfellows. They had all been impatiently expecting him and were glad that he had come at last.", " \u201cHe was certainly not in a normal state of mind: he told me himself that he saw visions when he was awake, that he met several persons in the street, who were dead, and that Satan visited him every evening,\u201d said the doctor, in conclusion. Having given his evidence, the celebrated doctor withdrew. The letter produced by Katerina Ivanovna was added to the material proofs. After some deliberation, the judges decided to proceed with the trial and to enter both the unexpected pieces of evidence (given by Ivan and Katerina Ivanovna) on the protocol. But I will not detail the evidence of the other witnesses, who only repeated and confirmed what had been said before, though all with their characteristic peculiarities. I repeat, all was brought together in the prosecutor\u2019s speech, which I shall quote immediately. Every one was excited, every one was electrified by the late catastrophe, and all were awaiting the speeches for the prosecution and the defense with intense impatience. Fetyukovitch was obviously shaken by Katerina Ivanovna\u2019s evidence. But the prosecutor was triumphant. When all the evidence had been taken, the court was adjourned for almost an hour. I believe it was just eight o\u2019clock when the President returned to his seat and our prosecutor, Ippolit Kirillovitch, began his speech. Chapter VI. The Prosecutor\u2019s Speech. Sketches Of Character Ippolit Kirillovitch began his speech, trembling with nervousness, with cold sweat on his forehead, feeling hot and cold all over by turns.", " He described this himself afterwards. He regarded this speech as his _chef\u2010 d\u2019\u0153uvre_, the _chef\u2010d\u2019\u0153uvre_ of his whole life, as his swan\u2010song. He died, it is true, nine months later of rapid consumption, so that he had the right, as it turned out, to compare himself to a swan singing his last song. He had put his whole heart and all the brain he had into that speech. And poor Ippolit Kirillovitch unexpectedly revealed that at least some feeling for the public welfare and \u201cthe eternal question\u201d lay concealed in him. Where his speech really excelled was in its sincerity. He genuinely believed in the prisoner\u2019s guilt; he was accusing him not as an official duty only, and in calling for vengeance he quivered with a genuine passion \u201cfor the security of society.\u201d Even the ladies in the audience, though they remained hostile to Ippolit Kirillovitch, admitted that he made an extraordinary impression on them. He began in a breaking voice, but it soon gained strength and filled the court to the end of his speech. But as soon as he had finished, he almost fainted. \u201cGentlemen of the jury,\u201d began the prosecutor, \u201cthis case has made a stir throughout Russia. But what is there to wonder at, what is there so peculiarly horrifying in it for us? We are so accustomed to such crimes! That\u2019s what\u2019s so horrible, that such dark deeds have ceased to horrify us. What ought to horrify us is that we are so accustomed to it, and not this or that isolated crime.", " At one moment he went up to the coffin to set straight the cover or the wreath, when a candle fell out of the candlestick he rushed to replace it and was a fearful time fumbling over it, then he subsided and stood quietly by the coffin with a look of blank uneasiness and perplexity. After the Epistle he suddenly whispered to Alyosha, who was standing beside him, that the Epistle had not been read properly but did not explain what he meant. During the prayer, \u201cLike the Cherubim,\u201d he joined in the singing but did not go on to the end. Falling on his knees, he pressed his forehead to the stone floor and lay so for a long while. At last came the funeral service itself and candles were distributed. The distracted father began fussing about again, but the touching and impressive funeral prayers moved and roused his soul. He seemed suddenly to shrink together and broke into rapid, short sobs, which he tried at first to smother, but at last he sobbed aloud. When they began taking leave of the dead and closing the coffin, he flung his arms about, as though he would not allow them to cover Ilusha, and began greedily and persistently kissing his dead boy on the lips. At last they succeeded in persuading him to come away from the step, but suddenly he impulsively stretched out his hand and snatched a few flowers from the coffin. He looked at them and a new idea seemed to dawn upon him, so that he apparently forgot his grief for a minute."], "When and wheredoes the Grand Inquisitor story take place?": [" Do you know, Alyosha\u2014don\u2019t laugh! I made a poem about a year ago. If you can waste another ten minutes on me, I\u2019ll tell it to you.\u201d \u201cYou wrote a poem?\u201d \u201cOh, no, I didn\u2019t write it,\u201d laughed Ivan, \u201cand I\u2019ve never written two lines of poetry in my life. But I made up this poem in prose and I remembered it. I was carried away when I made it up. You will be my first reader\u2014that is listener. Why should an author forego even one listener?\u201d smiled Ivan. \u201cShall I tell it to you?\u201d \u201cI am all attention,\u201d said Alyosha. \u201cMy poem is called \u2018The Grand Inquisitor\u2019; it\u2019s a ridiculous thing, but I want to tell it to you.\u201d Chapter V. The Grand Inquisitor \u201cEven this must have a preface\u2014that is, a literary preface,\u201d laughed Ivan, \u201cand I am a poor hand at making one. You see, my action takes place in the sixteenth century, and at that time, as you probably learnt at school, it was customary in poetry to bring down heavenly powers on earth. Not to speak of Dante, in France, clerks, as well as the monks in the monasteries, used to give regular performances in which the Madonna, the saints, the angels, Christ, and God himself were brought on the stage. In those days it was done in all simplicity. In Victor Hugo\u2019s _Notre Dame de Paris_ an edifying and gratuitous spectacle was provided for the people in the H\u00f4tel de Ville of Paris in the reign of Louis XI. in honor of the birth of the dauphin. It was called _Le bon jugement de la tr\u00e8s sainte et gracieuse Vierge Marie_, and she appears herself on the stage and pronounces her _bon jugement_.", " He sees everything; he sees them set the coffin down at His feet, sees the child rise up, and his face darkens. He knits his thick gray brows and his eyes gleam with a sinister fire. He holds out his finger and bids the guards take Him. And such is his power, so completely are the people cowed into submission and trembling obedience to him, that the crowd immediately makes way for the guards, and in the midst of deathlike silence they lay hands on Him and lead Him away. The crowd instantly bows down to the earth, like one man, before the old Inquisitor. He blesses the people in silence and passes on. The guards lead their prisoner to the close, gloomy vaulted prison in the ancient palace of the Holy Inquisition and shut Him in it. The day passes and is followed by the dark, burning, \u2018breathless\u2019 night of Seville. The air is \u2018fragrant with laurel and lemon.\u2019 In the pitch darkness the iron door of the prison is suddenly opened and the Grand Inquisitor himself comes in with a light in his hand. He is alone; the door is closed at once behind him. He stands in the doorway and for a minute or two gazes into His face. At last he goes up slowly, sets the light on the table and speaks. \u201c \u2018Is it Thou? Thou?\u2019 but receiving no answer, he adds at once, \u2018Don\u2019t answer, be silent. What canst Thou say, indeed? I know too well what Thou wouldst say. And Thou hast no right to add anything to what Thou hadst said of old.", " \u201cYour poem is in praise of Jesus, not in blame of Him\u2014as you meant it to be. And who will believe you about freedom? Is that the way to understand it? That\u2019s not the idea of it in the Orthodox Church.... That\u2019s Rome, and not even the whole of Rome, it\u2019s false\u2014those are the worst of the Catholics, the Inquisitors, the Jesuits!... And there could not be such a fantastic creature as your Inquisitor. What are these sins of mankind they take on themselves? Who are these keepers of the mystery who have taken some curse upon themselves for the happiness of mankind? When have they been seen? We know the Jesuits, they are spoken ill of, but surely they are not what you describe? They are not that at all, not at all.... They are simply the Romish army for the earthly sovereignty of the world in the future, with the Pontiff of Rome for Emperor ... that\u2019s their ideal, but there\u2019s no sort of mystery or lofty melancholy about it.... It\u2019s simple lust of power, of filthy earthly gain, of domination\u2014something like a universal serfdom with them as masters\u2014that\u2019s all they stand for. They don\u2019t even believe in God perhaps. Your suffering Inquisitor is a mere fantasy.\u201d \u201cStay, stay,\u201d laughed Ivan, \u201chow hot you are! A fantasy you say, let it be so! Of course it\u2019s a fantasy. But allow me to say: do you really think that the Roman Catholic movement of the last centuries is actually nothing but the lust of power, of filthy earthly gain?", " Though I believe I am not the father of lies. I am getting mixed in my texts. Say, the son of lies, and that will be enough. Only ... my angel ... I may sometimes talk about Diderot! Diderot will do no harm, though sometimes a word will do harm. Great elder, by the way, I was forgetting, though I had been meaning for the last two years to come here on purpose to ask and to find out something. Only do tell Pyotr Alexandrovitch not to interrupt me. Here is my question: Is it true, great Father, that the story is told somewhere in the _Lives of the Saints_ of a holy saint martyred for his faith who, when his head was cut off at last, stood up, picked up his head, and, \u2018courteously kissing it,\u2019 walked a long way, carrying it in his hands. Is that true or not, honored Father?\u201d \u201cNo, it is untrue,\u201d said the elder. \u201cThere is nothing of the kind in all the lives of the saints. What saint do you say the story is told of?\u201d asked the Father Librarian. \u201cI do not know what saint. I do not know, and can\u2019t tell. I was deceived. I was told the story. I had heard it, and do you know who told it? Pyotr Alexandrovitch Mi\u00fcsov here, who was so angry just now about Diderot. He it was who told the story.\u201d \u201cI have never told it you, I never speak to you at all.\u201d \u201cIt is true you did not tell me, but you told it when I was present. It was three years ago. I mentioned it because by that ridiculous story you shook my faith, Pyotr Alexandrovitch."], "Which of thefollowing was an actual experience of Dostoevsky that influencedthe writing of The Brothers Karamazov?": [" But in that case let it be kept outside the sphere of actual life. In the sphere of actual life, which has, indeed, its own rights, but also lays upon us great duties and obligations, in that sphere, if we want to be humane\u2014Christian, in fact\u2014we must, or ought to, act only upon convictions justified by reason and experience, which have been passed through the crucible of analysis; in a word, we must act rationally, and not as though in dream and delirium, that we may not do harm, that we may not ill\u2010treat and ruin a man. Then it will be real Christian work, not only mystic, but rational and philanthropic....\u201d There was violent applause at this passage from many parts of the court, but Fetyukovitch waved his hands as though imploring them to let him finish without interruption. The court relapsed into silence at once. The orator went on. \u201cDo you suppose, gentlemen, that our children as they grow up and begin to reason can avoid such questions? No, they cannot, and we will not impose on them an impossible restriction. The sight of an unworthy father involuntarily suggests tormenting questions to a young creature, especially when he compares him with the excellent fathers of his companions. The conventional answer to this question is: \u2018He begot you, and you are his flesh and blood, and therefore you are bound to love him.\u2019 The youth involuntarily reflects: \u2018But did he love me when he begot me?\u2019 he asks, wondering more and more.", " \u201cI\u2019ll tell you later, Lise\u2014afterwards,\u201d said Alyosha, confused. \u201cNow you wouldn\u2019t understand it perhaps\u2014and perhaps I couldn\u2019t explain it.\u201d \u201cI know your brothers and your father are worrying you, too.\u201d \u201cYes, my brothers too,\u201d murmured Alyosha, pondering. \u201cI don\u2019t like your brother Ivan, Alyosha,\u201d said Lise suddenly. He noticed this remark with some surprise, but did not answer it. \u201cMy brothers are destroying themselves,\u201d he went on, \u201cmy father, too. And they are destroying others with them. It\u2019s \u2018the primitive force of the Karamazovs,\u2019 as Father Pa\u00efssy said the other day, a crude, unbridled, earthly force. Does the spirit of God move above that force? Even that I don\u2019t know. I only know that I, too, am a Karamazov.... Me a monk, a monk! Am I a monk, Lise? You said just now that I was.\u201d \u201cYes, I did.\u201d \u201cAnd perhaps I don\u2019t even believe in God.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t believe? What is the matter?\u201d said Lise quietly and gently. But Alyosha did not answer. There was something too mysterious, too subjective in these last words of his, perhaps obscure to himself, but yet torturing him. \u201cAnd now on the top of it all, my friend, the best man in the world, is going, is leaving the earth! If you knew, Lise, how bound up in soul I am with him! And then I shall be left alone.... I shall come to you, Lise.... For the future we will be together.\u201d \u201cYes, together, together! Henceforward we shall be always together, all our lives!", " Believe me, Krassotkin, that sort of buffoonery is sometimes tragic in the extreme. His whole life now is centered in Ilusha, and if Ilusha dies, he will either go mad with grief or kill himself. I feel almost certain of that when I look at him now.\u201d \u201cI understand you, Karamazov. I see you understand human nature,\u201d Kolya added, with feeling. \u201cAnd as soon as I saw you with a dog, I thought it was Zhutchka you were bringing.\u201d \u201cWait a bit, Karamazov, perhaps we shall find it yet; but this is Perezvon. I\u2019ll let him go in now and perhaps it will amuse Ilusha more than the mastiff pup. Wait a bit, Karamazov, you will know something in a minute. But, I say, I am keeping you here!\u201d Kolya cried suddenly. \u201cYou\u2019ve no overcoat on in this bitter cold. You see what an egoist I am. Oh, we are all egoists, Karamazov!\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t trouble; it is cold, but I don\u2019t often catch cold. Let us go in, though, and, by the way, what is your name? I know you are called Kolya, but what else?\u201d \u201cNikolay\u2014Nikolay Ivanovitch Krassotkin, or, as they say in official documents, \u2018Krassotkin son.\u2019 \u201d Kolya laughed for some reason, but added suddenly, \u201cOf course I hate my name Nikolay.\u201d \u201cWhy so?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s so trivial, so ordinary.\u201d \u201cYou are thirteen?\u201d asked Alyosha. \u201cNo, fourteen\u2014that is, I shall be fourteen very soon, in a fortnight.

And how, seeing them again after many years, he loved them beyond measure, but he harassed and tormented them in love. He left them at last not able to bear the suffering of his heart, flung himself on his bed and wept. Then, wiping his tears away, he went out to them joyful and told them, \u201cBrothers, I am your brother Joseph!\u201d Let him read them further how happy old Jacob was on learning that his darling boy was still alive, and how he went to Egypt leaving his own country, and died in a foreign land, bequeathing his great prophecy that had lain mysteriously hidden in his meek and timid heart all his life, that from his offspring, from Judah, will come the great hope of the world, the Messiah and Saviour. Fathers and teachers, forgive me and don\u2019t be angry, that like a little child I\u2019ve been babbling of what you know long ago, and can teach me a hundred times more skillfully.

I went the day before yesterday, gentlemen, to a merchant of the town, called Samsonov, to borrow three thousand roubles from him on safe security. It was a pressing matter, gentlemen, it was a sudden necessity.\u201d \u201cAllow me to interrupt you,\u201d the prosecutor put in politely. \u201cWhy were you in such pressing need for just that sum, three thousand?\u201d \u201cOh, gentlemen, you needn\u2019t go into details, how, when and why, and why just so much money, and not so much, and all that rigmarole.", " And though he was told she was an idiot, he pronounced that for a young woman of twenty to wander about in nothing but a smock was a breach of the proprieties, and must not occur again. But the governor went his way, and Lizaveta was left as she was. At last her father died, which made her even more acceptable in the eyes of the religious persons of the town, as an orphan. In fact, every one seemed to like her; even the boys did not tease her, and the boys of our town, especially the schoolboys, are a mischievous set. She would walk into strange houses, and no one drove her away. Every one was kind to her and gave her something. If she were given a copper, she would take it, and at once drop it in the alms\u2010jug of the church or prison. If she were given a roll or bun in the market, she would hand it to the first child she met. Sometimes she would stop one of the richest ladies in the town and give it to her, and the lady would be pleased to take it. She herself never tasted anything but black bread and water. If she went into an expensive shop, where there were costly goods or money lying about, no one kept watch on her, for they knew that if she saw thousands of roubles overlooked by them, she would not have touched a farthing. She scarcely ever went to church. She slept either in the church porch or climbed over a hurdle (there are many hurdles instead of fences to this day in our town) into a kitchen garden.", " Where I stand will be at once the foremost place ... \u2018all things are lawful\u2019 and that\u2019s the end of it!

Alyosha watched him intently. \u201cWe are discussing this gentleman\u2019s most interesting article,\u201d said Father Iosif, the librarian, addressing the elder, and indicating Ivan. \u201cHe brings forward much that is new, but I think the argument cuts both ways.

But in what sense?\u201d Father Zossima asked Ivan. The latter, at last, answered him, not condescendingly, as Alyosha had feared, but with modesty and reserve, with evident goodwill and apparently without the slightest _arri\u00e8re\u2010pens\u00e9e_. \u201cI start from the position that this confusion of elements, that is, of the essential principles of Church and State, will, of course, go on for ever, in spite of the fact that it is impossible for them to mingle, and that the confusion of these elements cannot lead to any consistent or even normal results, for there is falsity at the very foundation of it. Compromise between the Church and State in such questions as, for instance, jurisdiction, is, to my thinking, impossible in any real sense."], "Who asks Alyoshato leave the monastery?": [" \u201cAlyosha, run after her!\u201d Mitya cried to his brother; \u201ctell her ...

I asked her forgiveness because I wanted to punish myself to the bitter end. She would not forgive me.... I like her for that!\u201d she added, in an unnatural voice, and her eyes flashed with fierce resentment. \u201cMy brother did not expect this in the least,\u201d muttered Alyosha. \u201cHe was sure she would not come\u2014\u201d \u201cNo doubt.

It was the coffin of poor little Ilusha. He had died two days after Mitya was sentenced. At the gate of the house Alyosha was met by the shouts of the boys, Ilusha\u2019s schoolfellows. They had all been impatiently expecting him and were glad that he had come at last.", " Alyosha did not leave him. The thought passed through his mind to run for a doctor, but he was afraid to leave his brother alone: there was no one to whom he could leave him. By degrees Ivan lost consciousness completely at last. He still went on talking, talking incessantly, but quite incoherently, and even articulated his words with difficulty. Suddenly he staggered violently; but Alyosha was in time to support him. Ivan let him lead him to his bed. Alyosha undressed him somehow and put him to bed. He sat watching over him for another two hours. The sick man slept soundly, without stirring, breathing softly and evenly. Alyosha took a pillow and lay down on the sofa, without undressing. As he fell asleep he prayed for Mitya and Ivan. He began to understand Ivan\u2019s illness. \u201cThe anguish of a proud determination. An earnest conscience!\u201d God, in Whom he disbelieved, and His truth were gaining mastery over his heart, which still refused to submit. \u201cYes,\u201d the thought floated through Alyosha\u2019s head as it lay on the pillow, \u201cyes, if Smerdyakov is dead, no one will believe Ivan\u2019s evidence; but he will go and give it.\u201d Alyosha smiled softly. \u201cGod will conquer!\u201d he thought. \u201cHe will either rise up in the light of truth, or ... he\u2019ll perish in hate, revenging on himself and on every one his having served the cause he does not believe in,\u201d Alyosha added bitterly, and again he prayed for Ivan.", " A Liberal of the forties and fifties, a freethinker and atheist, he may have been led on by boredom or the hope of frivolous diversion. He was suddenly seized with the desire to see the monastery and the holy man. As his lawsuit with the monastery still dragged on, he made it the pretext for seeing the Superior, in order to attempt to settle it amicably. A visitor coming with such laudable intentions might be received with more attention and consideration than if he came from simple curiosity. Influences from within the monastery were brought to bear on the elder, who of late had scarcely left his cell, and had been forced by illness to deny even his ordinary visitors. In the end he consented to see them, and the day was fixed. \u201cWho has made me a judge over them?\u201d was all he said, smilingly, to Alyosha. Alyosha was much perturbed when he heard of the proposed visit. Of all the wrangling, quarrelsome party, Dmitri was the only one who could regard the interview seriously. All the others would come from frivolous motives, perhaps insulting to the elder. Alyosha was well aware of that. Ivan and Mi\u00fcsov would come from curiosity, perhaps of the coarsest kind, while his father might be contemplating some piece of buffoonery. Though he said nothing, Alyosha thoroughly understood his father. The boy, I repeat, was far from being so simple as every one thought him. He awaited the day with a heavy heart.", " But how could he be left without him? How could he live without seeing and hearing him? Where should he go? He had told him not to weep, and to leave the monastery. Good God! It was long since Alyosha had known such anguish. He hurried through the copse that divided the monastery from the hermitage, and unable to bear the burden of his thoughts, he gazed at the ancient pines beside the path. He had not far to go\u2014about five hundred paces. He expected to meet no one at that hour, but at the first turn of the path he noticed Rakitin. He was waiting for some one. \u201cAre you waiting for me?\u201d asked Alyosha, overtaking him. \u201cYes,\u201d grinned Rakitin. \u201cYou are hurrying to the Father Superior, I know; he has a banquet. There\u2019s not been such a banquet since the Superior entertained the Bishop and General Pahatov, do you remember? I shan\u2019t be there, but you go and hand the sauces. Tell me one thing, Alexey, what does that vision mean? That\u2019s what I want to ask you.\u201d \u201cWhat vision?\u201d \u201cThat bowing to your brother, Dmitri. And didn\u2019t he tap the ground with his forehead, too!\u201d \u201cYou speak of Father Zossima?\u201d \u201cYes, of Father Zossima.\u201d \u201cTapped the ground?\u201d \u201cAh, an irreverent expression! Well, what of it? Anyway, what does that vision mean?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what it means, Misha.\u201d \u201cI knew he wouldn\u2019t explain it to you! There\u2019s nothing wonderful about it, of course, only the usual holy mummery. But there was an object in the performance."], "What does MadameKhokhlakov suggest when Dmitri asks her for a loan?": [" What\u2019s more, it struck me at the time. I fancied that there was an artificial simplicity about him; that he was in a hurry to suggest this idea to me that I might fancy it was my own. He insinuated it, as it were. Did he not insinuate the same idea at the inquiry and suggest it to the talented prosecutor? \u201cI shall be asked, \u2018What about the old woman, Grigory\u2019s wife? She heard the sick man moaning close by, all night.\u2019 Yes, she heard it, but that evidence is extremely unreliable. I knew a lady who complained bitterly that she had been kept awake all night by a dog in the yard. Yet the poor beast, it appeared, had only yelped once or twice in the night. And that\u2019s natural. If any one is asleep and hears a groan he wakes up, annoyed at being waked, but instantly falls asleep again. Two hours later, again a groan, he wakes up and falls asleep again; and the same thing again two hours later\u2014three times altogether in the night. Next morning the sleeper wakes up and complains that some one has been groaning all night and keeping him awake. And it is bound to seem so to him: the intervals of two hours of sleep he does not remember, he only remembers the moments of waking, so he feels he has been waked up all night. \u201cBut why, why, asks the prosecutor, did not Smerdyakov confess in his last letter? Why did his conscience prompt him to one step and not to both? But, excuse me, conscience implies penitence, and the suicide may not have felt penitence, but only despair.", " But that the jealous will never understand. And yet among them are men of noble hearts. It is remarkable, too, that those very men of noble hearts, standing hidden in some cupboard, listening and spying, never feel the stings of conscience at that moment, anyway, though they understand clearly enough with their \u201cnoble hearts\u201d the shameful depths to which they have voluntarily sunk. At the sight of Grushenka, Mitya\u2019s jealousy vanished, and, for an instant he became trustful and generous, and positively despised himself for his evil feelings. But it only proved that, in his love for the woman, there was an element of something far higher than he himself imagined, that it was not only a sensual passion, not only the \u201ccurve of her body,\u201d of which he had talked to Alyosha. But, as soon as Grushenka had gone, Mitya began to suspect her of all the low cunning of faithlessness, and he felt no sting of conscience at it. And so jealousy surged up in him again. He had, in any case, to make haste. The first thing to be done was to get hold of at least a small, temporary loan of money. The nine roubles had almost all gone on his expedition. And, as we all know, one can\u2019t take a step without money. But he had thought over in the cart where he could get a loan. He had a brace of fine dueling pistols in a case, which he had not pawned till then because he prized them above all his possessions.", " Dmitri\u2019s enthusiastic references to Ivan were the more striking in Alyosha\u2019s eyes since Dmitri was, compared with Ivan, almost uneducated, and the two brothers were such a contrast in personality and character that it would be difficult to find two men more unlike. It was at this time that the meeting, or, rather gathering of the members of this inharmonious family took place in the cell of the elder who had such an extraordinary influence on Alyosha. The pretext for this gathering was a false one. It was at this time that the discord between Dmitri and his father seemed at its acutest stage and their relations had become insufferably strained. Fyodor Pavlovitch seems to have been the first to suggest, apparently in joke, that they should all meet in Father Zossima\u2019s cell, and that, without appealing to his direct intervention, they might more decently come to an understanding under the conciliating influence of the elder\u2019s presence. Dmitri, who had never seen the elder, naturally supposed that his father was trying to intimidate him, but, as he secretly blamed himself for his outbursts of temper with his father on several recent occasions, he accepted the challenge. It must be noted that he was not, like Ivan, staying with his father, but living apart at the other end of the town. It happened that Pyotr Alexandrovitch Mi\u00fcsov, who was staying in the district at the time, caught eagerly at the idea.", " I have come, madam\u2014\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t explain it. It\u2019s of secondary importance. But as for help, you\u2019re not the first I have helped, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You have most likely heard of my cousin, Madame Belmesov. Her husband was ruined, \u2018had come to grief,\u2019 as you characteristically express it, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. I recommended him to take to horse\u2010breeding, and now he\u2019s doing well. Have you any idea of horse\u2010breeding, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?\u201d \u201cNot the faintest, madam; ah, madam, not the faintest!\u201d cried Mitya, in nervous impatience, positively starting from his seat. \u201cI simply implore you, madam, to listen to me. Only give me two minutes of free speech that I may just explain to you everything, the whole plan with which I have come. Besides, I am short of time. I\u2019m in a fearful hurry,\u201d Mitya cried hysterically, feeling that she was just going to begin talking again, and hoping to cut her short. \u201cI have come in despair ... in the last gasp of despair, to beg you to lend me the sum of three thousand, a loan, but on safe, most safe security, madam, with the most trustworthy guarantees! Only let me explain\u2014\u201d \u201cYou must tell me all that afterwards, afterwards!\u201d Madame Hohlakov with a gesture demanded silence in her turn, \u201cand whatever you may tell me, I know it all beforehand; I\u2019ve told you so already. You ask for a certain sum, for three thousand, but I can give you more, immeasurably more, I will save you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, but you must listen to me.\u201d Mitya started from his seat again."], "What is the subjectof Ivan\u2019s controversial essay?": [" God bless you! Come, go along! Love Ivan!\u201d was Mitya\u2019s last word. Alyosha went out in tears. Such distrustfulness in Mitya, such lack of confidence even to him, to Alyosha\u2014all this suddenly opened before Alyosha an unsuspected depth of hopeless grief and despair in the soul of his unhappy brother. Intense, infinite compassion overwhelmed him instantly. There was a poignant ache in his torn heart. \u201cLove Ivan!\u201d\u2014he suddenly recalled Mitya\u2019s words. And he was going to Ivan. He badly wanted to see Ivan all day. He was as much worried about Ivan as about Mitya, and more than ever now. Chapter V. Not You, Not You! On the way to Ivan he had to pass the house where Katerina Ivanovna was living. There was light in the windows. He suddenly stopped and resolved to go in. He had not seen Katerina Ivanovna for more than a week. But now it struck him that Ivan might be with her, especially on the eve of the terrible day. Ringing, and mounting the staircase, which was dimly lighted by a Chinese lantern, he saw a man coming down, and as they met, he recognized him as his brother. So he was just coming from Katerina Ivanovna. \u201cAh, it\u2019s only you,\u201d said Ivan dryly. \u201cWell, good\u2010by! You are going to her?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t advise you to; she\u2019s upset and you\u2019ll upset her more.\u201d A door was instantly flung open above, and a voice cried suddenly: \u201cNo, no! Alexey Fyodorovitch, have you come from him?\u201d \u201cYes, I have been with him.\u201d \u201cHas he sent me any message?", " A light lunch was brought in, with brandy. When Fyodor Pavlovitch was pleased, he usually became expansive, but to\u2010day he seemed to restrain himself. Of Dmitri, for instance, he did not say a word. He was quite unmoved by the parting, and seemed, in fact, at a loss for something to say. Ivan noticed this particularly. \u201cHe must be bored with me,\u201d he thought. Only when accompanying his son out on to the steps, the old man began to fuss about. He would have kissed him, but Ivan made haste to hold out his hand, obviously avoiding the kiss. His father saw it at once, and instantly pulled himself up. \u201cWell, good luck to you, good luck to you!\u201d he repeated from the steps. \u201cYou\u2019ll come again some time or other? Mind you do come. I shall always be glad to see you. Well, Christ be with you!\u201d Ivan got into the carriage. \u201cGood\u2010by, Ivan! Don\u2019t be too hard on me!\u201d the father called for the last time. The whole household came out to take leave\u2014Smerdyakov, Marfa and Grigory. Ivan gave them ten roubles each. When he had seated himself in the carriage, Smerdyakov jumped up to arrange the rug. \u201cYou see ... I am going to Tchermashnya,\u201d broke suddenly from Ivan. Again, as the day before, the words seemed to drop of themselves, and he laughed, too, a peculiar, nervous laugh. He remembered it long after. \u201cIt\u2019s a true saying then, that \u2018it\u2019s always worth while speaking to a clever man,\u2019 \u201d answered Smerdyakov firmly, looking significantly at Ivan.", " It would suit him down to the ground. He\u2019ll carry off Katerina Ivanovna, for whom he is languishing, and pocket her dowry of sixty thousand. That\u2019s very alluring to start with, for a man of no consequence and a beggar. And, take note, he won\u2019t be wronging Mitya, but doing him the greatest service. For I know as a fact that Mitya only last week, when he was with some gypsy girls drunk in a tavern, cried out aloud that he was unworthy of his betrothed, Katya, but that his brother Ivan, he was the man who deserved her. And Katerina Ivanovna will not in the end refuse such a fascinating man as Ivan. She\u2019s hesitating between the two of them already. And how has that Ivan won you all, so that you all worship him? He is laughing at you, and enjoying himself at your expense.\u201d \u201cHow do you know? How can you speak so confidently?\u201d Alyosha asked sharply, frowning. \u201cWhy do you ask, and are frightened at my answer? It shows that you know I\u2019m speaking the truth.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t like Ivan. Ivan wouldn\u2019t be tempted by money.\u201d \u201cReally? And the beauty of Katerina Ivanovna? It\u2019s not only the money, though a fortune of sixty thousand is an attraction.\u201d \u201cIvan is above that. He wouldn\u2019t make up to any one for thousands. It is not money, it\u2019s not comfort Ivan is seeking. Perhaps it\u2019s suffering he is seeking.\u201d \u201cWhat wild dream now? Oh, you\u2014aristocrats!\u201d \u201cAh, Misha, he has a stormy spirit. His mind is in bondage.", " \u201cNobody will believe you, as you\u2019ve plenty of money of your own; you may simply have taken it out of your cash\u2010box and brought it to the court.\u201d Ivan rose from his seat. \u201cI repeat,\u201d he said, \u201cthe only reason I haven\u2019t killed you is that I need you for to\u2010morrow, remember that, don\u2019t forget it!\u201d \u201cWell, kill me. Kill me now,\u201d Smerdyakov said, all at once looking strangely at Ivan. \u201cYou won\u2019t dare do that even!\u201d he added, with a bitter smile. \u201cYou won\u2019t dare to do anything, you, who used to be so bold!\u201d \u201cTill to\u2010morrow,\u201d cried Ivan, and moved to go out. \u201cStay a moment.... Show me those notes again.\u201d Ivan took out the notes and showed them to him. Smerdyakov looked at them for ten seconds. \u201cWell, you can go,\u201d he said, with a wave of his hand. \u201cIvan Fyodorovitch!\u201d he called after him again. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Ivan turned without stopping. \u201cGood\u2010by!\u201d \u201cTill to\u2010morrow!\u201d Ivan cried again, and he walked out of the cottage. The snowstorm was still raging. He walked the first few steps boldly, but suddenly began staggering. \u201cIt\u2019s something physical,\u201d he thought with a grin. Something like joy was springing up in his heart. He was conscious of unbounded resolution; he would make an end of the wavering that had so tortured him of late. His determination was taken, \u201cand now it will not be changed,\u201d he thought with relief. At that moment he stumbled against something and almost fell down. Stopping short, he made out at his feet the peasant he had knocked down, still lying senseless and motionless."], "Who kills FyodorPavlovich?": [" and what ready money he could find on him; \u2018it will come in handy for my pleasures in the fashionable world and for my career in the future.\u2019 After murdering them, he puts pillows under the head of each of his victims; he goes away. Next, a young hero \u2018decorated for bravery\u2019 kills the mother of his chief and benefactor, like a highwayman, and to urge his companions to join him he asserts that \u2018she loves him like a son, and so will follow all his directions and take no precautions.\u2019 Granted that he is a monster, yet I dare not say in these days that he is unique. Another man will not commit the murder, but will feel and think like him, and is as dishonorable in soul. In silence, alone with his conscience, he asks himself perhaps, \u2018What is honor, and isn\u2019t the condemnation of bloodshed a prejudice?\u2019 \u201cPerhaps people will cry out against me that I am morbid, hysterical, that it is a monstrous slander, that I am exaggerating. Let them say so\u2014and heavens! I should be the first to rejoice if it were so! Oh, don\u2019t believe me, think of me as morbid, but remember my words; if only a tenth, if only a twentieth part of what I say is true\u2014even so it\u2019s awful! Look how our young people commit suicide, without asking themselves Hamlet\u2019s question what there is beyond, without a sign of such a question, as though all that relates to the soul and to what awaits us beyond the grave had long been erased in their minds and buried under the sands.", " Three ladies, one a cripple and weak\u2010minded, another a cripple and hunchback and the third not crippled but far too clever.

I am alone in the world, and if I die, what will become of all of them? I simply ask you that. And if I challenge him and he kills me on the spot, what then? What will become of them? And worse still, if he doesn\u2019t kill me but only cripples me: I couldn\u2019t work, but I should still be a mouth to feed. Who would feed it and who would feed them all? Must I take Ilusha from school and send him to beg in the streets? That\u2019s what it means for me to challenge him to a duel.

I won\u2019t enlarge upon that now, as I shall have much to tell later of Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s firstborn, and must confine myself now to the most essential facts about him, without which I could not begin my story. In the first place, this Mitya, or rather Dmitri Fyodorovitch, was the only one of Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s three sons who grew up in the belief that he had property, and that he would be independent on coming of age. He spent an irregular boyhood and youth. He did not finish his studies at the gymnasium, he got into a military school, then went to the Caucasus, was promoted, fought a duel, and was degraded to the ranks, earned promotion again, led a wild life, and spent a good deal of money. He did not begin to receive any income from Fyodor Pavlovitch until he came of age, and until then got into debt. He saw and knew his father, Fyodor Pavlovitch, for the first time on coming of age, when he visited our neighborhood on purpose to settle with him about his property. He seems not to have liked his father. He did not stay long with him, and made haste to get away, having only succeeded in obtaining a sum of money, and entering into an agreement for future payments from the estate, of the revenues and value of which he was unable (a fact worthy of note), upon this occasion, to get a statement from his father. Fyodor Pavlovitch remarked for the first time then (this, too, should be noted) that Mitya had a vague and exaggerated idea of his property.", " Fyodor Pavlovitch was very well satisfied with this, as it fell in with his own designs. He gathered only that the young man was frivolous, unruly, of violent passions, impatient, and dissipated, and that if he could only obtain ready money he would be satisfied, although only, of course, for a short time. So Fyodor Pavlovitch began to take advantage of this fact, sending him from time to time small doles, installments. In the end, when four years later, Mitya, losing patience, came a second time to our little town to settle up once for all with his father, it turned out to his amazement that he had nothing, that it was difficult to get an account even, that he had received the whole value of his property in sums of money from Fyodor Pavlovitch, and was perhaps even in debt to him, that by various agreements into which he had, of his own desire, entered at various previous dates, he had no right to expect anything more, and so on, and so on. The young man was overwhelmed, suspected deceit and cheating, and was almost beside himself. And, indeed, this circumstance led to the catastrophe, the account of which forms the subject of my first introductory story, or rather the external side of it. But before I pass to that story I must say a little of Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s other two sons, and of their origin. Chapter III. The Second Marriage And The Second Family Very shortly after getting his four\u2010year\u2010old Mitya off his hands Fyodor Pavlovitch married a second time.", " Oo! what a coincidence! Why was I waiting for you? Hungering and thirsting for you in every cranny of my soul and even in my ribs? Why, to send you to father and to her, Katerina Ivanovna, so as to have done with her and with father. To send an angel. I might have sent any one, but I wanted to send an angel. And here you are on your way to see father and her.\u201d \u201cDid you really mean to send me?\u201d cried Alyosha with a distressed expression. \u201cStay! You knew it! And I see you understand it all at once. But be quiet, be quiet for a time. Don\u2019t be sorry, and don\u2019t cry.\u201d Dmitri stood up, thought a moment, and put his finger to his forehead. \u201cShe\u2019s asked you, written to you a letter or something, that\u2019s why you\u2019re going to her? You wouldn\u2019t be going except for that?\u201d \u201cHere is her note.\u201d Alyosha took it out of his pocket. Mitya looked through it quickly. \u201cAnd you were going the back\u2010way! Oh, gods, I thank you for sending him by the back\u2010way, and he came to me like the golden fish to the silly old fishermen in the fable! Listen, Alyosha, listen, brother! Now I mean to tell you everything, for I must tell some one. An angel in heaven I\u2019ve told already; but I want to tell an angel on earth. You are an angel on earth. You will hear and judge and forgive. And that\u2019s what I need, that some one above me should forgive. Listen! If two people break away from everything on earth and fly off into the unknown, or at least one of them, and before flying off or going to ruin he comes to some one else and says, \u2018Do this for me\u2019\u2014some favor never asked before that could only be asked on one\u2019s deathbed\u2014would that other refuse, if he were a friend or a brother?\u201d \u201cI will do it, but tell me what it is, and make haste,\u201d said Alyosha.", " When Fyodor Pavlovitch heard of it, his attitude to the boy seemed changed at once. Till then he had taken no notice of him, though he never scolded him, and always gave him a copeck when he met him. Sometimes, when he was in good humor, he would send the boy something sweet from his table. But as soon as he heard of his illness, he showed an active interest in him, sent for a doctor, and tried remedies, but the disease turned out to be incurable. The fits occurred, on an average, once a month, but at various intervals. The fits varied too, in violence: some were light and some were very severe. Fyodor Pavlovitch strictly forbade Grigory to use corporal punishment to the boy, and began allowing him to come upstairs to him. He forbade him to be taught anything whatever for a time, too. One day when the boy was about fifteen, Fyodor Pavlovitch noticed him lingering by the bookcase, and reading the titles through the glass. Fyodor Pavlovitch had a fair number of books\u2014over a hundred\u2014but no one ever saw him reading. He at once gave Smerdyakov the key of the bookcase. \u201cCome, read. You shall be my librarian. You\u2019ll be better sitting reading than hanging about the courtyard. Come, read this,\u201d and Fyodor Pavlovitch gave him _Evenings in a Cottage near Dikanka_. He read a little but didn\u2019t like it. He did not once smile, and ended by frowning. \u201cWhy? Isn\u2019t it funny?\u201d asked Fyodor Pavlovitch."], "At the beginning of the novel, what causes conflict between Fyodor and Dmitri?": [" From some rumor, or perhaps from some stray word of Grushenka\u2019s, he had gathered further that the old man would perhaps prefer him to Fyodor Pavlovitch for Grushenka. Possibly many of the readers of my novel will feel that in reckoning on such assistance, and being ready to take his bride, so to speak, from the hands of her protector, Dmitri showed great coarseness and want of delicacy. I will only observe that Mitya looked upon Grushenka\u2019s past as something completely over. He looked on that past with infinite pity and resolved with all the fervor of his passion that when once Grushenka told him she loved him and would marry him, it would mean the beginning of a new Grushenka and a new Dmitri, free from every vice. They would forgive one another and would begin their lives afresh. As for Kuzma Samsonov, Dmitri looked upon him as a man who had exercised a fateful influence in that remote past of Grushenka\u2019s, though she had never loved him, and who was now himself a thing of the past, completely done with, and, so to say, non\u2010existent. Besides, Mitya hardly looked upon him as a man at all, for it was known to every one in the town that he was only a shattered wreck, whose relations with Grushenka had changed their character and were now simply paternal, and that this had been so for a long time. In any case there was much simplicity on Mitya\u2019s part in all this, for in spite of all his vices, he was a very simple\u2010hearted man.", " Ivan always felt that Alyosha\u2019s opinion meant a great deal to him, and so he was astonished at it now. Another thing that was strange was that Alyosha did not make any attempt to talk about Mitya with Ivan, that he never began on the subject and only answered his questions. This, too, struck Ivan particularly. But he was very much preoccupied at that time with something quite apart from that. On his return from Moscow, he abandoned himself hopelessly to his mad and consuming passion for Katerina Ivanovna. This is not the time to begin to speak of this new passion of Ivan\u2019s, which left its mark on all the rest of his life: this would furnish the subject for another novel, which I may perhaps never write. But I cannot omit to mention here that when Ivan, on leaving Katerina Ivanovna with Alyosha, as I\u2019ve related already, told him, \u201cI am not keen on her,\u201d it was an absolute lie: he loved her madly, though at times he hated her so that he might have murdered her. Many causes helped to bring about this feeling. Shattered by what had happened with Mitya, she rushed on Ivan\u2019s return to meet him as her one salvation. She was hurt, insulted and humiliated in her feelings. And here the man had come back to her, who had loved her so ardently before (oh! she knew that very well), and whose heart and intellect she considered so superior to her own. But the sternly virtuous girl did not abandon herself altogether to the man she loved, in spite of the Karamazov violence of his passions and the great fascination he had for her.", " He was trembling all over. He seemed frantic. \u201cBut you\u2019ve seen for yourself that she hasn\u2019t come,\u201d cried Ivan. \u201cBut she may have come by that other entrance.\u201d \u201cYou know that entrance is locked, and you have the key.\u201d Dmitri suddenly reappeared in the drawing\u2010room. He had, of course, found the other entrance locked, and the key actually was in Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s pocket. The windows of all the rooms were also closed, so Grushenka could not have come in anywhere nor have run out anywhere. \u201cHold him!\u201d shrieked Fyodor Pavlovitch, as soon as he saw him again. \u201cHe\u2019s been stealing money in my bedroom.\u201d And tearing himself from Ivan he rushed again at Dmitri. But Dmitri threw up both hands and suddenly clutched the old man by the two tufts of hair that remained on his temples, tugged at them, and flung him with a crash on the floor. He kicked him two or three times with his heel in the face. The old man moaned shrilly. Ivan, though not so strong as Dmitri, threw his arms round him, and with all his might pulled him away. Alyosha helped him with his slender strength, holding Dmitri in front. \u201cMadman! You\u2019ve killed him!\u201d cried Ivan. \u201cServe him right!\u201d shouted Dmitri breathlessly. \u201cIf I haven\u2019t killed him, I\u2019ll come again and kill him. You can\u2019t protect him!\u201d \u201cDmitri! Go away at once!\u201d cried Alyosha commandingly. \u201cAlexey! You tell me. It\u2019s only you I can believe; was she here just now, or not?", " Seeing this, Dmitri uttered a scream rather than a shout and rushed at Grigory. \u201cThen she\u2019s there! She\u2019s hidden there! Out of the way, scoundrel!\u201d He tried to pull Grigory away, but the old servant pushed him back. Beside himself with fury, Dmitri struck out, and hit Grigory with all his might. The old man fell like a log, and Dmitri, leaping over him, broke in the door. Smerdyakov remained pale and trembling at the other end of the room, huddling close to Fyodor Pavlovitch. \u201cShe\u2019s here!\u201d shouted Dmitri. \u201cI saw her turn towards the house just now, but I couldn\u2019t catch her. Where is she? Where is she?\u201d That shout, \u201cShe\u2019s here!\u201d produced an indescribable effect on Fyodor Pavlovitch. All his terror left him. \u201cHold him! Hold him!\u201d he cried, and dashed after Dmitri. Meanwhile Grigory had got up from the floor, but still seemed stunned. Ivan and Alyosha ran after their father. In the third room something was heard to fall on the floor with a ringing crash: it was a large glass vase\u2014not an expensive one\u2014on a marble pedestal which Dmitri had upset as he ran past it. \u201cAt him!\u201d shouted the old man. \u201cHelp!\u201d Ivan and Alyosha caught the old man and were forcibly bringing him back. \u201cWhy do you run after him? He\u2019ll murder you outright,\u201d Ivan cried wrathfully at his father. \u201cIvan! Alyosha! She must be here. Grushenka\u2019s here. He said he saw her himself, running.\u201d He was choking. He was not expecting Grushenka at the time, and the sudden news that she was here made him beside himself."], "At the monastery, what causes Fyodor and Dmitri to begin shouting at each other?": [" I believe he changed his home a fourth time later on. I won\u2019t enlarge upon that now, as I shall have much to tell later of Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s firstborn, and must confine myself now to the most essential facts about him, without which I could not begin my story. In the first place, this Mitya, or rather Dmitri Fyodorovitch, was the only one of Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s three sons who grew up in the belief that he had property, and that he would be independent on coming of age. He spent an irregular boyhood and youth. He did not finish his studies at the gymnasium, he got into a military school, then went to the Caucasus, was promoted, fought a duel, and was degraded to the ranks, earned promotion again, led a wild life, and spent a good deal of money. He did not begin to receive any income from Fyodor Pavlovitch until he came of age, and until then got into debt. He saw and knew his father, Fyodor Pavlovitch, for the first time on coming of age, when he visited our neighborhood on purpose to settle with him about his property. He seems not to have liked his father. He did not stay long with him, and made haste to get away, having only succeeded in obtaining a sum of money, and entering into an agreement for future payments from the estate, of the revenues and value of which he was unable (a fact worthy of note), upon this occasion, to get a statement from his father. Fyodor Pavlovitch remarked for the first time then (this, too, should be noted) that Mitya had a vague and exaggerated idea of his property.", " He was trembling all over. He seemed frantic. \u201cBut you\u2019ve seen for yourself that she hasn\u2019t come,\u201d cried Ivan. \u201cBut she may have come by that other entrance.\u201d \u201cYou know that entrance is locked, and you have the key.\u201d Dmitri suddenly reappeared in the drawing\u2010room. He had, of course, found the other entrance locked, and the key actually was in Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s pocket. The windows of all the rooms were also closed, so Grushenka could not have come in anywhere nor have run out anywhere. \u201cHold him!\u201d shrieked Fyodor Pavlovitch, as soon as he saw him again. \u201cHe\u2019s been stealing money in my bedroom.\u201d And tearing himself from Ivan he rushed again at Dmitri. But Dmitri threw up both hands and suddenly clutched the old man by the two tufts of hair that remained on his temples, tugged at them, and flung him with a crash on the floor. He kicked him two or three times with his heel in the face. The old man moaned shrilly. Ivan, though not so strong as Dmitri, threw his arms round him, and with all his might pulled him away.

You can\u2019t protect him!\u201d \u201cDmitri! Go away at once!\u201d cried Alyosha commandingly. \u201cAlexey! You tell me. It\u2019s only you I can believe; was she here just now, or not?", " Chapter II. Smerdyakov With A Guitar He had no time to lose indeed. Even while he was saying good\u2010by to Lise, the thought had struck him that he must attempt some stratagem to find his brother Dmitri, who was evidently keeping out of his way. It was getting late, nearly three o\u2019clock. Alyosha\u2019s whole soul turned to the monastery, to his dying saint, but the necessity of seeing Dmitri outweighed everything. The conviction that a great inevitable catastrophe was about to happen grew stronger in Alyosha\u2019s mind with every hour. What that catastrophe was, and what he would say at that moment to his brother, he could perhaps not have said definitely. \u201cEven if my benefactor must die without me, anyway I won\u2019t have to reproach myself all my life with the thought that I might have saved something and did not, but passed by and hastened home. If I do as I intend, I shall be following his great precept.\u201d His plan was to catch his brother Dmitri unawares, to climb over the fence, as he had the day before, get into the garden and sit in the summer\u2010house. If Dmitri were not there, thought Alyosha, he would not announce himself to Foma or the women of the house, but would remain hidden in the summer\u2010house, even if he had to wait there till evening. If, as before, Dmitri were lying in wait for Grushenka to come, he would be very likely to come to the summer\u2010house. Alyosha did not, however, give much thought to the details of his plan, but resolved to act upon it, even if it meant not getting back to the monastery that day.", " Seeing this, Dmitri uttered a scream rather than a shout and rushed at Grigory. \u201cThen she\u2019s there! She\u2019s hidden there! Out of the way, scoundrel!\u201d He tried to pull Grigory away, but the old servant pushed him back.

He was not expecting Grushenka at the time, and the sudden news that she was here made him beside himself."], "Alyosha\u2019s faith is strengthened by his new friendship with whom?": [" \u201cYou agree. Then it must be so, if you agree. It\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it, Alyosha? That\u2019s the Russian faith all over, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cNo, Smerdyakov has not the Russian faith at all,\u201d said Alyosha firmly and gravely. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about his faith. I mean those two in the desert, only that idea. Surely that\u2019s Russian, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cYes, that\u2019s purely Russian,\u201d said Alyosha smiling. \u201cYour words are worth a gold piece, O ass, and I\u2019ll give it to you to\u2010day. But as to the rest you talk nonsense, nonsense, nonsense. Let me tell you, stupid, that we here are all of little faith, only from carelessness, because we haven\u2019t time; things are too much for us, and, in the second place, the Lord God has given us so little time, only twenty\u2010four hours in the day, so that one hasn\u2019t even time to get sleep enough, much less to repent of one\u2019s sins. While you have denied your faith to your enemies when you\u2019d nothing else to think about but to show your faith! So I consider, brother, that it constitutes a sin.\u201d \u201cConstitute a sin it may, but consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch, that it only extenuates it, if it does constitute. If I had believed then in very truth, as I ought to have believed, then it really would have been sinful if I had not faced tortures for my faith, and had gone over to the pagan Mohammedan faith. But, of course, it wouldn\u2019t have come to torture then, because I should only have had to say at that instant to the mountain, \u2018Move and crush the tormentor,\u2019 and it would have moved and at the very instant have crushed him like a black\u2010beetle, and I should have walked away as though nothing had happened, praising and glorifying God.", " Well, Grigory Vassilyevitch, if I\u2019m without faith and you have so great a faith that you are continually swearing at me, you try yourself telling this mountain, not to move into the sea for that\u2019s a long way off, but even to our stinking little river which runs at the bottom of the garden. You\u2019ll see for yourself that it won\u2019t budge, but will remain just where it is however much you shout at it, and that shows, Grigory Vassilyevitch, that you haven\u2019t faith in the proper manner, and only abuse others about it. Again, taking into consideration that no one in our day, not only you, but actually no one, from the highest person to the lowest peasant, can shove mountains into the sea\u2014except perhaps some one man in the world, or, at most, two, and they most likely are saving their souls in secret somewhere in the Egyptian desert, so you wouldn\u2019t find them\u2014if so it be, if all the rest have no faith, will God curse all the rest? that is, the population of the whole earth, except about two hermits in the desert, and in His well\u2010known mercy will He not forgive one of them? And so I\u2019m persuaded that though I may once have doubted I shall be forgiven if I shed tears of repentance.\u201d \u201cStay!\u201d cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, in a transport of delight. \u201cSo you do suppose there are two who can move mountains? Ivan, make a note of it, write it down. There you have the Russian all over!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re quite right in saying it\u2019s characteristic of the people\u2019s faith,\u201d Ivan assented, with an approving smile.", " \u201cYou will come back again!\u201d murmured Father Pa\u00efssy, looking after him with sorrowful surprise. Chapter II. A Critical Moment Father Pa\u00efssy, of course, was not wrong when he decided that his \u201cdear boy\u201d would come back again. Perhaps indeed, to some extent, he penetrated with insight into the true meaning of Alyosha\u2019s spiritual condition. Yet I must frankly own that it would be very difficult for me to give a clear account of that strange, vague moment in the life of the young hero I love so much. To Father Pa\u00efssy\u2019s sorrowful question, \u201cAre you too with those of little faith?\u201d I could of course confidently answer for Alyosha, \u201cNo, he is not with those of little faith. Quite the contrary.\u201d Indeed, all his trouble came from the fact that he was of great faith. But still the trouble was there and was so agonizing that even long afterwards Alyosha thought of that sorrowful day as one of the bitterest and most fatal days of his life. If the question is asked: \u201cCould all his grief and disturbance have been only due to the fact that his elder\u2019s body had shown signs of premature decomposition instead of at once performing miracles?\u201d I must answer without beating about the bush, \u201cYes, it certainly was.\u201d I would only beg the reader not to be in too great a hurry to laugh at my young hero\u2019s pure heart. I am far from intending to apologize for him or to justify his innocent faith on the ground of his youth, or the little progress he had made in his studies, or any such reason.", " But before three o\u2019clock in the afternoon that something took place to which I alluded at the end of the last book, something so unexpected by all of us and so contrary to the general hope, that, I repeat, this trivial incident has been minutely remembered to this day in our town and all the surrounding neighborhood. I may add here, for myself personally, that I feel it almost repulsive to recall that event which caused such frivolous agitation and was such a stumbling\u2010block to many, though in reality it was the most natural and trivial matter. I should, of course, have omitted all mention of it in my story, if it had not exerted a very strong influence on the heart and soul of the chief, though future, hero of my story, Alyosha, forming a crisis and turning\u2010point in his spiritual development, giving a shock to his intellect, which finally strengthened it for the rest of his life and gave it a definite aim. And so, to return to our story. When before dawn they laid Father Zossima\u2019s body in the coffin and brought it into the front room, the question of opening the windows was raised among those who were around the coffin. But this suggestion made casually by some one was unanswered and almost unnoticed. Some of those present may perhaps have inwardly noticed it, only to reflect that the anticipation of decay and corruption from the body of such a saint was an actual absurdity, calling for compassion (if not a smile) for the lack of faith and the frivolity it implied."], "Dmitri is imprisoned for the murder of whom?": [" What for? What for?\u201d Ivan asked himself. \u201cYes, of course, I was expecting something and he is right....\u201d And he remembered for the hundredth time how, on the last night in his father\u2019s house, he had listened on the stairs. But he remembered it now with such anguish that he stood still on the spot as though he had been stabbed. \u201cYes, I expected it then, that\u2019s true! I wanted the murder, I did want the murder! Did I want the murder? Did I want it? I must kill Smerdyakov! If I don\u2019t dare kill Smerdyakov now, life is not worth living!\u201d Ivan did not go home, but went straight to Katerina Ivanovna and alarmed her by his appearance. He was like a madman. He repeated all his conversation with Smerdyakov, every syllable of it. He couldn\u2019t be calmed, however much she tried to soothe him: he kept walking about the room, speaking strangely, disconnectedly. At last he sat down, put his elbows on the table, leaned his head on his hands and pronounced this strange sentence: \u201cIf it\u2019s not Dmitri, but Smerdyakov who\u2019s the murderer, I share his guilt, for I put him up to it. Whether I did, I don\u2019t know yet. But if he is the murderer, and not Dmitri, then, of course, I am the murderer, too.\u201d When Katerina Ivanovna heard that, she got up from her seat without a word, went to her writing\u2010table, opened a box standing on it, took out a sheet of paper and laid it before Ivan. This was the document of which Ivan spoke to Alyosha later on as a \u201cconclusive proof\u201d that Dmitri had killed his father.", " Gentlemen, I swear to you by all that\u2019s holy, if it had not been his father, but an ordinary enemy, he would, after running through the rooms and satisfying himself that the woman was not there, have made off, post\u2010haste, without doing any harm to his rival. He would have struck him, pushed him away perhaps, nothing more, for he had no thought and no time to spare for that. What he wanted to know was where she was. But his father, his father! The mere sight of the father who had hated him from his childhood, had been his enemy, his persecutor, and now his unnatural rival, was enough! A feeling of hatred came over him involuntarily, irresistibly, clouding his reason. It all surged up in one moment! It was an impulse of madness and insanity, but also an impulse of nature, irresistibly and unconsciously (like everything in nature) avenging the violation of its eternal laws. \u201cBut the prisoner even then did not murder him\u2014I maintain that, I cry that aloud!\u2014no, he only brandished the pestle in a burst of indignant disgust, not meaning to kill him, not knowing that he would kill him. Had he not had this fatal pestle in his hand, he would have only knocked his father down perhaps, but would not have killed him. As he ran away, he did not know whether he had killed the old man. Such a murder is not a murder. Such a murder is not a parricide. No, the murder of such a father cannot be called parricide.", " Seeing this, Dmitri uttered a scream rather than a shout and rushed at Grigory. \u201cThen she\u2019s there! She\u2019s hidden there! Out of the way, scoundrel!\u201d He tried to pull Grigory away, but the old servant pushed him back. Beside himself with fury, Dmitri struck out, and hit Grigory with all his might. The old man fell like a log, and Dmitri, leaping over him, broke in the door. Smerdyakov remained pale and trembling at the other end of the room, huddling close to Fyodor Pavlovitch. \u201cShe\u2019s here!\u201d shouted Dmitri. \u201cI saw her turn towards the house just now, but I couldn\u2019t catch her. Where is she? Where is she?\u201d That shout, \u201cShe\u2019s here!\u201d produced an indescribable effect on Fyodor Pavlovitch. All his terror left him. \u201cHold him! Hold him!\u201d he cried, and dashed after Dmitri. Meanwhile Grigory had got up from the floor, but still seemed stunned. Ivan and Alyosha ran after their father. In the third room something was heard to fall on the floor with a ringing crash: it was a large glass vase\u2014not an expensive one\u2014on a marble pedestal which Dmitri had upset as he ran past it. \u201cAt him!\u201d shouted the old man. \u201cHelp!\u201d Ivan and Alyosha caught the old man and were forcibly bringing him back. \u201cWhy do you run after him? He\u2019ll murder you outright,\u201d Ivan cried wrathfully at his father. \u201cIvan! Alyosha! She must be here. Grushenka\u2019s here. He said he saw her himself, running.\u201d He was choking. He was not expecting Grushenka at the time, and the sudden news that she was here made him beside himself.", " But there\u2019s a limit to these flights of fancy. \u201c \u2018Quite so,\u2019 some astute people will tell me, \u2018but what if they were in agreement? What if they murdered him together and shared the money\u2014what then?\u2019 A weighty question, truly! And the facts to confirm it are astounding. One commits the murder and takes all the trouble while his accomplice lies on one side shamming a fit, apparently to arouse suspicion in every one, alarm in his master and alarm in Grigory. It would be interesting to know what motives could have induced the two accomplices to form such an insane plan. \u201cBut perhaps it was not a case of active complicity on Smerdyakov\u2019s part, but only of passive acquiescence; perhaps Smerdyakov was intimidated and agreed not to prevent the murder, and foreseeing that he would be blamed for letting his master be murdered, without screaming for help or resisting, he may have obtained permission from Dmitri Karamazov to get out of the way by shamming a fit\u2014\u2018you may murder him as you like; it\u2019s nothing to me.\u2019 But as this attack of Smerdyakov\u2019s was bound to throw the household into confusion, Dmitri Karamazov could never have agreed to such a plan. I will waive that point however. Supposing that he did agree, it would still follow that Dmitri Karamazov is the murderer and the instigator, and Smerdyakov is only a passive accomplice, and not even an accomplice, but merely acquiesced against his will through terror."], "In the introduction, the author claims that the novel is a biography of whom?": [" \u201cYes. She did run away. I\u2019ve had that unpleasant experience,\u201d Maximov modestly assented, \u201cwith a _monsieur_. And what was worse, she\u2019d had all my little property transferred to her beforehand. \u2018You\u2019re an educated man,\u2019 she said to me. \u2018You can always get your living.\u2019 She settled my business with that. A venerable bishop once said to me: \u2018One of your wives was lame, but the other was too light\u2010footed.\u2019 He he!\u201d \u201cListen, listen!\u201d cried Kalganov, bubbling over, \u201cif he\u2019s telling lies\u2014and he often is\u2014he\u2019s only doing it to amuse us all. There\u2019s no harm in that, is there? You know, I sometimes like him. He\u2019s awfully low, but it\u2019s natural to him, eh? Don\u2019t you think so? Some people are low from self\u2010 interest, but he\u2019s simply so, from nature. Only fancy, he claims (he was arguing about it all the way yesterday) that Gogol wrote _Dead Souls_ about him. Do you remember, there\u2019s a landowner called Maximov in it, whom Nozdryov thrashed. He was charged, do you remember, \u2018for inflicting bodily injury with rods on the landowner Maximov in a drunken condition.\u2019 Would you believe it, he claims that he was that Maximov and that he was beaten! Now can it be so? Tchitchikov made his journey, at the very latest, at the beginning of the twenties, so that the dates don\u2019t fit. He couldn\u2019t have been thrashed then, he couldn\u2019t, could he?\u201d It was difficult to imagine what Kalganov was excited about, but his excitement was genuine.", " The article dealt with a subject which was being debated everywhere at the time\u2014the position of the ecclesiastical courts. After discussing several opinions on the subject he went on to explain his own view. What was most striking about the article was its tone, and its unexpected conclusion. Many of the Church party regarded him unquestioningly as on their side. And yet not only the secularists but even atheists joined them in their applause. Finally some sagacious persons opined that the article was nothing but an impudent satirical burlesque. I mention this incident particularly because this article penetrated into the famous monastery in our neighborhood, where the inmates, being particularly interested in the question of the ecclesiastical courts, were completely bewildered by it. Learning the author\u2019s name, they were interested in his being a native of the town and the son of \u201cthat Fyodor Pavlovitch.\u201d And just then it was that the author himself made his appearance among us. Why Ivan Fyodorovitch had come amongst us I remember asking myself at the time with a certain uneasiness. This fateful visit, which was the first step leading to so many consequences, I never fully explained to myself. It seemed strange on the face of it that a young man so learned, so proud, and apparently so cautious, should suddenly visit such an infamous house and a father who had ignored him all his life, hardly knew him, never thought of him, and would not under any circumstances have given him money, though he was always afraid that his sons Ivan and Alexey would also come to ask him for it.", " What that business was the reader will learn fully in due time. Yet even when I did know of this special circumstance I still felt Ivan Fyodorovitch to be an enigmatic figure, and thought his visit rather mysterious. I may add that Ivan appeared at the time in the light of a mediator between his father and his elder brother Dmitri, who was in open quarrel with his father and even planning to bring an action against him. The family, I repeat, was now united for the first time, and some of its members met for the first time in their lives. The younger brother, Alexey, had been a year already among us, having been the first of the three to arrive. It is of that brother Alexey I find it most difficult to speak in this introduction. Yet I must give some preliminary account of him, if only to explain one queer fact, which is that I have to introduce my hero to the reader wearing the cassock of a novice. Yes, he had been for the last year in our monastery, and seemed willing to be cloistered there for the rest of his life. Chapter IV. The Third Son, Alyosha He was only twenty, his brother Ivan was in his twenty\u2010fourth year at the time, while their elder brother Dmitri was twenty\u2010seven. First of all, I must explain that this young man, Alyosha, was not a fanatic, and, in my opinion at least, was not even a mystic. I may as well give my full opinion from the beginning. He was simply an early lover of humanity, and that he adopted the monastic life was simply because at that time it struck him, so to say, as the ideal escape for his soul struggling from the darkness of worldly wickedness to the light of love.", " \u201cI am not a poodle,\u201d Grigory muttered. \u201cAll right, it\u2019s I am a poodle myself,\u201d cried Mitya. \u201cIf it\u2019s an insult, I take it to myself and I beg his pardon. I was a beast and cruel to him. I was cruel to \u00c6sop too.\u201d \u201cWhat \u00c6sop?\u201d the President asked sternly again. \u201cOh, Pierrot ... my father, Fyodor Pavlovitch.\u201d The President again and again warned Mitya impressively and very sternly to be more careful in his language. \u201cYou are injuring yourself in the opinion of your judges.\u201d The counsel for the defense was equally clever in dealing with the evidence of Rakitin. I may remark that Rakitin was one of the leading witnesses and one to whom the prosecutor attached great significance. It appeared that he knew everything; his knowledge was amazing, he had been everywhere, seen everything, talked to everybody, knew every detail of the biography of Fyodor Pavlovitch and all the Karamazovs. Of the envelope, it is true, he had only heard from Mitya himself. But he described minutely Mitya\u2019s exploits in the \u201cMetropolis,\u201d all his compromising doings and sayings, and told the story of Captain Snegiryov\u2019s \u201cwisp of tow.\u201d But even Rakitin could say nothing positive about Mitya\u2019s inheritance, and confined himself to contemptuous generalities. \u201cWho could tell which of them was to blame, and which was in debt to the other, with their crazy Karamazov way of muddling things so that no one could make head or tail of it?\u201d He attributed the tragic crime to the habits that had become ingrained by ages of serfdom and the distressed condition of Russia, due to the lack of appropriate institutions."], "What does the narrator say about the two different versions of the story about Fyodor\u2019s reaction to news that Adelaida had died?": [" But, who knows, it may have been simplicity. At last he succeeded in getting on the track of his runaway wife. The poor woman turned out to be in Petersburg, where she had gone with her divinity student, and where she had thrown herself into a life of complete emancipation. Fyodor Pavlovitch at once began bustling about, making preparations to go to Petersburg, with what object he could not himself have said. He would perhaps have really gone; but having determined to do so he felt at once entitled to fortify himself for the journey by another bout of reckless drinking. And just at that time his wife\u2019s family received the news of her death in Petersburg. She had died quite suddenly in a garret, according to one story, of typhus, or as another version had it, of starvation. Fyodor Pavlovitch was drunk when he heard of his wife\u2019s death, and the story is that he ran out into the street and began shouting with joy, raising his hands to Heaven: \u201cLord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace,\u201d but others say he wept without restraint like a little child, so much so that people were sorry for him, in spite of the repulsion he inspired. It is quite possible that both versions were true, that he rejoiced at his release, and at the same time wept for her who released him. As a general rule, people, even the wicked, are much more na\u00efve and simple\u2010hearted than we suppose. And we ourselves are, too.", " The most likely explanation is that it happened naturally\u2014that Lizaveta, accustomed to clambering over hurdles to sleep in gardens, had somehow managed to climb this fence, in spite of her condition, and had leapt down, injuring herself. Grigory rushed to Marfa and sent her to Lizaveta, while he ran to fetch an old midwife who lived close by. They saved the baby, but Lizaveta died at dawn. Grigory took the baby, brought it home, and making his wife sit down, put it on her lap. \u201cA child of God\u2014an orphan is akin to all,\u201d he said, \u201cand to us above others. Our little lost one has sent us this, who has come from the devil\u2019s son and a holy innocent. Nurse him and weep no more.\u201d So Marfa brought up the child. He was christened Pavel, to which people were not slow in adding Fyodorovitch (son of Fyodor). Fyodor Pavlovitch did not object to any of this, and thought it amusing, though he persisted vigorously in denying his responsibility. The townspeople were pleased at his adopting the foundling. Later on, Fyodor Pavlovitch invented a surname for the child, calling him Smerdyakov, after his mother\u2019s nickname. So this Smerdyakov became Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s second servant, and was living in the lodge with Grigory and Marfa at the time our story begins. He was employed as cook. I ought to say something of this Smerdyakov, but I am ashamed of keeping my readers\u2019 attention so long occupied with these common menials, and I will go back to my story, hoping to say more of Smerdyakov in the course of it.", " Fyodor Pavlovitch was very well satisfied with this, as it fell in with his own designs. He gathered only that the young man was frivolous, unruly, of violent passions, impatient, and dissipated, and that if he could only obtain ready money he would be satisfied, although only, of course, for a short time. So Fyodor Pavlovitch began to take advantage of this fact, sending him from time to time small doles, installments. In the end, when four years later, Mitya, losing patience, came a second time to our little town to settle up once for all with his father, it turned out to his amazement that he had nothing, that it was difficult to get an account even, that he had received the whole value of his property in sums of money from Fyodor Pavlovitch, and was perhaps even in debt to him, that by various agreements into which he had, of his own desire, entered at various previous dates, he had no right to expect anything more, and so on, and so on. The young man was overwhelmed, suspected deceit and cheating, and was almost beside himself. And, indeed, this circumstance led to the catastrophe, the account of which forms the subject of my first introductory story, or rather the external side of it. But before I pass to that story I must say a little of Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s other two sons, and of their origin. Chapter III. The Second Marriage And The Second Family Very shortly after getting his four\u2010year\u2010old Mitya off his hands Fyodor Pavlovitch married a second time.", " Though I believe I am not the father of lies. I am getting mixed in my texts. Say, the son of lies, and that will be enough. Only ... my angel ... I may sometimes talk about Diderot! Diderot will do no harm, though sometimes a word will do harm. Great elder, by the way, I was forgetting, though I had been meaning for the last two years to come here on purpose to ask and to find out something. Only do tell Pyotr Alexandrovitch not to interrupt me. Here is my question: Is it true, great Father, that the story is told somewhere in the _Lives of the Saints_ of a holy saint martyred for his faith who, when his head was cut off at last, stood up, picked up his head, and, \u2018courteously kissing it,\u2019 walked a long way, carrying it in his hands. Is that true or not, honored Father?\u201d \u201cNo, it is untrue,\u201d said the elder. \u201cThere is nothing of the kind in all the lives of the saints. What saint do you say the story is told of?\u201d asked the Father Librarian. \u201cI do not know what saint. I do not know, and can\u2019t tell. I was deceived. I was told the story. I had heard it, and do you know who told it? Pyotr Alexandrovitch Mi\u00fcsov here, who was so angry just now about Diderot. He it was who told the story.\u201d \u201cI have never told it you, I never speak to you at all.\u201d \u201cIt is true you did not tell me, but you told it when I was present. It was three years ago. I mentioned it because by that ridiculous story you shook my faith, Pyotr Alexandrovitch."], "After the death of his mother, who raises Dmitri to adulthood?": [" I\u2019ll knock that mysticism out of her, thought I! \u2018Here,\u2019 said I, \u2018you see your holy image. Here it is. Here I take it down. You believe it\u2019s miraculous, but here, I\u2019ll spit on it directly and nothing will happen to me for it!\u2019... When she saw it, good Lord! I thought she would kill me. But she only jumped up, wrung her hands, then suddenly hid her face in them, began trembling all over and fell on the floor ... fell all of a heap. Alyosha, Alyosha, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d The old man jumped up in alarm. From the time he had begun speaking about his mother, a change had gradually come over Alyosha\u2019s face. He flushed crimson, his eyes glowed, his lips quivered. The old sot had gone spluttering on, noticing nothing, till the moment when something very strange happened to Alyosha. Precisely what he was describing in the crazy woman was suddenly repeated with Alyosha. He jumped up from his seat exactly as his mother was said to have done, wrung his hands, hid his face in them, and fell back in his chair, shaking all over in an hysterical paroxysm of sudden violent, silent weeping. His extraordinary resemblance to his mother particularly impressed the old man. \u201cIvan, Ivan! Water, quickly! It\u2019s like her, exactly as she used to be then, his mother. Spurt some water on him from your mouth, that\u2019s what I used to do to her. He\u2019s upset about his mother, his mother,\u201d he muttered to Ivan. \u201cBut she was my mother, too, I believe, his mother.", " Was she not?\u201d said Ivan, with uncontrolled anger and contempt. The old man shrank before his flashing eyes. But something very strange had happened, though only for a second; it seemed really to have escaped the old man\u2019s mind that Alyosha\u2019s mother actually was the mother of Ivan too. \u201cYour mother?\u201d he muttered, not understanding. \u201cWhat do you mean? What mother are you talking about? Was she?... Why, damn it! of course she was yours too! Damn it! My mind has never been so darkened before. Excuse me, why, I was thinking, Ivan.... He he he!\u201d He stopped. A broad, drunken, half\u2010senseless grin overspread his face. At that moment a fearful noise and clamor was heard in the hall, there were violent shouts, the door was flung open, and Dmitri burst into the room. The old man rushed to Ivan in terror. \u201cHe\u2019ll kill me! He\u2019ll kill me! Don\u2019t let him get at me!\u201d he screamed, clinging to the skirt of Ivan\u2019s coat. Chapter IX. The Sensualists Grigory and Smerdyakov ran into the room after Dmitri. They had been struggling with him in the passage, refusing to admit him, acting on instructions given them by Fyodor Pavlovitch some days before. Taking advantage of the fact that Dmitri stopped a moment on entering the room to look about him, Grigory ran round the table, closed the double doors on the opposite side of the room leading to the inner apartments, and stood before the closed doors, stretching wide his arms, prepared to defend the entrance, so to speak, with the last drop of his blood.", " It was the beginning of Lent, and Markel would not fast, he was rude and laughed at it. \u201cThat\u2019s all silly twaddle, and there is no God,\u201d he said, horrifying my mother, the servants, and me too. For though I was only nine, I too was aghast at hearing such words. We had four servants, all serfs. I remember my mother selling one of the four, the cook Afimya, who was lame and elderly, for sixty paper roubles, and hiring a free servant to take her place. In the sixth week in Lent, my brother, who was never strong and had a tendency to consumption, was taken ill. He was tall but thin and delicate\u2010 looking, and of very pleasing countenance. I suppose he caught cold, anyway the doctor, who came, soon whispered to my mother that it was galloping consumption, that he would not live through the spring. My mother began weeping, and, careful not to alarm my brother, she entreated him to go to church, to confess and take the sacrament, as he was still able to move about. This made him angry, and he said something profane about the church. He grew thoughtful, however; he guessed at once that he was seriously ill, and that that was why his mother was begging him to confess and take the sacrament. He had been aware, indeed, for a long time past, that he was far from well, and had a year before coolly observed at dinner to our mother and me, \u201cMy life won\u2019t be long among you, I may not live another year,\u201d which seemed now like a prophecy.", " Friends came to see us. \u201cDear ones,\u201d he would say to them, \u201cwhat have I done that you should love me so, how can you love any one like me, and how was it I did not know, I did not appreciate it before?\u201d When the servants came in to him he would say continually, \u201cDear, kind people, why are you doing so much for me, do I deserve to be waited on? If it were God\u2019s will for me to live, I would wait on you, for all men should wait on one another.\u201d Mother shook her head as she listened. \u201cMy darling, it\u2019s your illness makes you talk like that.\u201d \u201cMother, darling,\u201d he would say, \u201cthere must be servants and masters, but if so I will be the servant of my servants, the same as they are to me. And another thing, mother, every one of us has sinned against all men, and I more than any.\u201d Mother positively smiled at that, smiled through her tears. \u201cWhy, how could you have sinned against all men, more than all? Robbers and murderers have done that, but what sin have you committed yet, that you hold yourself more guilty than all?\u201d \u201cMother, little heart of mine,\u201d he said (he had begun using such strange caressing words at that time), \u201clittle heart of mine, my joy, believe me, every one is really responsible to all men for all men and for everything. I don\u2019t know how to explain it to you, but I feel it is so, painfully even. And how is it we went on then living, getting angry and not knowing?\u201d So he would get up every day, more and more sweet and joyous and full of love."], "After marrying 16 year-old Sofia, Fyodor holds what types of gatherings in their home?": [" \u201cCould you have answered at that moment, if any one had asked you a question\u2014for instance, what year it is?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cAnd what year is it, Anno Domini, do you know?\u201d Grigory stood with a perplexed face, looking straight at his tormentor. Strange to say, it appeared he really did not know what year it was. \u201cBut perhaps you can tell me how many fingers you have on your hands?\u201d \u201cI am a servant,\u201d Grigory said suddenly, in a loud and distinct voice. \u201cIf my betters think fit to make game of me, it is my duty to suffer it.\u201d Fetyukovitch was a little taken aback, and the President intervened, reminding him that he must ask more relevant questions. Fetyukovitch bowed with dignity and said that he had no more questions to ask of the witness. The public and the jury, of course, were left with a grain of doubt in their minds as to the evidence of a man who might, while undergoing a certain cure, have seen \u201cthe gates of heaven,\u201d and who did not even know what year he was living in. But before Grigory left the box another episode occurred. The President, turning to the prisoner, asked him whether he had any comment to make on the evidence of the last witness. \u201cExcept about the door, all he has said is true,\u201d cried Mitya, in a loud voice. \u201cFor combing the lice off me, I thank him; for forgiving my blows, I thank him. The old man has been honest all his life and as faithful to my father as seven hundred poodles.\u201d \u201cPrisoner, be careful in your language,\u201d the President admonished him.", " To Alyosha\u2019s amazement this tomb turned out to be Grigory\u2019s doing. He had put it up on the poor \u201ccrazy woman\u2019s\u201d grave at his own expense, after Fyodor Pavlovitch, whom he had often pestered about the grave, had gone to Odessa, abandoning the grave and all his memories. Alyosha showed no particular emotion at the sight of his mother\u2019s grave. He only listened to Grigory\u2019s minute and solemn account of the erection of the tomb; he stood with bowed head and walked away without uttering a word. It was perhaps a year before he visited the cemetery again. But this little episode was not without an influence upon Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2014and a very original one. He suddenly took a thousand roubles to our monastery to pay for requiems for the soul of his wife; but not for the second, Alyosha\u2019s mother, the \u201ccrazy woman,\u201d but for the first, Adela\u00efda Ivanovna, who used to thrash him. In the evening of the same day he got drunk and abused the monks to Alyosha. He himself was far from being religious; he had probably never put a penny candle before the image of a saint. Strange impulses of sudden feeling and sudden thought are common in such types. I have mentioned already that he looked bloated. His countenance at this time bore traces of something that testified unmistakably to the life he had led. Besides the long fleshy bags under his little, always insolent, suspicious, and ironical eyes; besides the multitude of deep wrinkles in his little fat face, the Adam\u2019s apple hung below his sharp chin like a great, fleshy goiter, which gave him a peculiar, repulsive, sensual appearance; add to that a long rapacious mouth with full lips, between which could be seen little stumps of black decayed teeth.", " From somebody unknown, but terrible and dangerous. What he needed was to feel that there was _another_ man, an old and tried friend, that he might call him in his sick moments merely to look at his face, or, perhaps, exchange some quite irrelevant words with him. And if the old servant were not angry, he felt comforted, and if he were angry, he was more dejected. It happened even (very rarely however) that Fyodor Pavlovitch went at night to the lodge to wake Grigory and fetch him for a moment. When the old man came, Fyodor Pavlovitch would begin talking about the most trivial matters, and would soon let him go again, sometimes even with a jest. And after he had gone, Fyodor Pavlovitch would get into bed with a curse and sleep the sleep of the just. Something of the same sort had happened to Fyodor Pavlovitch on Alyosha\u2019s arrival. Alyosha \u201cpierced his heart\u201d by \u201cliving with him, seeing everything and blaming nothing.\u201d Moreover, Alyosha brought with him something his father had never known before: a complete absence of contempt for him and an invariable kindness, a perfectly natural unaffected devotion to the old man who deserved it so little. All this was a complete surprise to the old profligate, who had dropped all family ties. It was a new and surprising experience for him, who had till then loved nothing but \u201cevil.\u201d When Alyosha had left him, he confessed to himself that he had learnt something he had not till then been willing to learn.", " Fyodor Pavlovitch was very well satisfied with this, as it fell in with his own designs.

But Ivan\u2019s a tomb.\u201d \u201cIvan\u2019s a tomb?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Alyosha listened with great attention. \u201cI was lieutenant in a line regiment, but still I was under supervision, like a kind of convict. Yet I was awfully well received in the little town. I spent money right and left. I was thought to be rich; I thought so myself. But I must have pleased them in other ways as well. Although they shook their heads over me, they liked me. My colonel, who was an old man, took a sudden dislike to me. He was always down upon me, but I had powerful friends, and, moreover, all the town was on my side, so he couldn\u2019t do me much harm. I was in fault myself for refusing to treat him with proper respect. I was proud. This obstinate old fellow, who was really a very good sort, kind\u2010hearted and hospitable, had had two wives, both dead. His first wife, who was of a humble family, left a daughter as unpretentious as herself. She was a young woman of four and twenty when I was there, and was living with her father and an aunt, her mother\u2019s sister. The aunt was simple and illiterate; the niece was simple but lively. I like to say nice things about people. I never knew a woman of more charming character than Agafya\u2014fancy, her name was Agafya Ivanovna! And she wasn\u2019t bad\u2010looking either, in the Russian style: tall, stout, with a full figure, and beautiful eyes, though a rather coarse face.", " In the end this unhappy young woman, kept in terror from her childhood, fell into that kind of nervous disease which is most frequently found in peasant women who are said to be \u201cpossessed by devils.\u201d At times after terrible fits of hysterics she even lost her reason. Yet she bore Fyodor Pavlovitch two sons, Ivan and Alexey, the eldest in the first year of marriage and the second three years later. When she died, little Alexey was in his fourth year, and, strange as it seems, I know that he remembered his mother all his life, like a dream, of course. At her death almost exactly the same thing happened to the two little boys as to their elder brother, Mitya. They were completely forgotten and abandoned by their father. They were looked after by the same Grigory and lived in his cottage, where they were found by the tyrannical old lady who had brought up their mother. She was still alive, and had not, all those eight years, forgotten the insult done her. All that time she was obtaining exact information as to her Sofya\u2019s manner of life, and hearing of her illness and hideous surroundings she declared aloud two or three times to her retainers: \u201cIt serves her right. God has punished her for her ingratitude.\u201d Exactly three months after Sofya Ivanovna\u2019s death the general\u2019s widow suddenly appeared in our town, and went straight to Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s house. She spent only half an hour in the town but she did a great deal."], "What irritates the atheist Miusov at the monastery?": [" A Liberal of the forties and fifties, a freethinker and atheist, he may have been led on by boredom or the hope of frivolous diversion. He was suddenly seized with the desire to see the monastery and the holy man. As his lawsuit with the monastery still dragged on, he made it the pretext for seeing the Superior, in order to attempt to settle it amicably. A visitor coming with such laudable intentions might be received with more attention and consideration than if he came from simple curiosity. Influences from within the monastery were brought to bear on the elder, who of late had scarcely left his cell, and had been forced by illness to deny even his ordinary visitors. In the end he consented to see them, and the day was fixed. \u201cWho has made me a judge over them?\u201d was all he said, smilingly, to Alyosha. Alyosha was much perturbed when he heard of the proposed visit. Of all the wrangling, quarrelsome party, Dmitri was the only one who could regard the interview seriously. All the others would come from frivolous motives, perhaps insulting to the elder. Alyosha was well aware of that. Ivan and Mi\u00fcsov would come from curiosity, perhaps of the coarsest kind, while his father might be contemplating some piece of buffoonery. Though he said nothing, Alyosha thoroughly understood his father. The boy, I repeat, was far from being so simple as every one thought him. He awaited the day with a heavy heart.", " He was extremely interested in his brother Ivan, but when the latter had been two months in the town, though they had met fairly often, they were still not intimate. Alyosha was naturally silent, and he seemed to be expecting something, ashamed about something, while his brother Ivan, though Alyosha noticed at first that he looked long and curiously at him, seemed soon to have left off thinking of him. Alyosha noticed it with some embarrassment. He ascribed his brother\u2019s indifference at first to the disparity of their age and education. But he also wondered whether the absence of curiosity and sympathy in Ivan might be due to some other cause entirely unknown to him. He kept fancying that Ivan was absorbed in something\u2014something inward and important\u2014that he was striving towards some goal, perhaps very hard to attain, and that that was why he had no thought for him. Alyosha wondered, too, whether there was not some contempt on the part of the learned atheist for him\u2014a foolish novice. He knew for certain that his brother was an atheist. He could not take offense at this contempt, if it existed; yet, with an uneasy embarrassment which he did not himself understand, he waited for his brother to come nearer to him. Dmitri used to speak of Ivan with the deepest respect and with a peculiar earnestness. From him Alyosha learnt all the details of the important affair which had of late formed such a close and remarkable bond between the two elder brothers.", " The path Alyosha chose was a path going in the opposite direction, but he chose it with the same thirst for swift achievement. As soon as he reflected seriously he was convinced of the existence of God and immortality, and at once he instinctively said to himself: \u201cI want to live for immortality, and I will accept no compromise.\u201d In the same way, if he had decided that God and immortality did not exist, he would at once have become an atheist and a socialist. For socialism is not merely the labor question, it is before all things the atheistic question, the question of the form taken by atheism to\u2010day, the question of the tower of Babel built without God, not to mount to heaven from earth but to set up heaven on earth. Alyosha would have found it strange and impossible to go on living as before. It is written: \u201cGive all that thou hast to the poor and follow Me, if thou wouldst be perfect.\u201d Alyosha said to himself: \u201cI can\u2019t give two roubles instead of \u2018all,\u2019 and only go to mass instead of \u2018following Him.\u2019 \u201d Perhaps his memories of childhood brought back our monastery, to which his mother may have taken him to mass. Perhaps the slanting sunlight and the holy image to which his poor \u201ccrazy\u201d mother had held him up still acted upon his imagination. Brooding on these things he may have come to us perhaps only to see whether here he could sacrifice all or only \u201ctwo roubles,\u201d and in the monastery he met this elder.", " Won\u2019t you have a drop of brandy? Take some cold coffee and I\u2019ll pour a quarter of a glass of brandy into it, it\u2019s delicious, my boy.\u201d \u201cNo, thank you. I\u2019ll take that roll with me if I may,\u201d said Alyosha, and taking a halfpenny French roll he put it in the pocket of his cassock. \u201cAnd you\u2019d better not have brandy, either,\u201d he suggested apprehensively, looking into the old man\u2019s face. \u201cYou are quite right, it irritates my nerves instead of soothing them. Only one little glass. I\u2019ll get it out of the cupboard.\u201d He unlocked the cupboard, poured out a glass, drank it, then locked the cupboard and put the key back in his pocket. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. One glass won\u2019t kill me.\u201d \u201cYou see you are in a better humor now,\u201d said Alyosha, smiling. \u201cUm! I love you even without the brandy, but with scoundrels I am a scoundrel. Ivan is not going to Tchermashnya\u2014why is that? He wants to spy how much I give Grushenka if she comes. They are all scoundrels! But I don\u2019t recognize Ivan, I don\u2019t know him at all. Where does he come from? He is not one of us in soul. As though I\u2019d leave him anything! I shan\u2019t leave a will at all, you may as well know. And I\u2019ll crush Mitya like a beetle. I squash black\u2010beetles at night with my slipper; they squelch when you tread on them. And your Mitya will squelch too. _Your_ Mitya, for you love him. Yes, you love him and I am not afraid of your loving him. But if Ivan loved him I should be afraid for myself at his loving him."], "How do the monks show their respect for Zosima?": [" For they expected something quite different. And, behold, soon after midday there were signs of something, at first only observed in silence by those who came in and out and were evidently each afraid to communicate the thought in his mind. But by three o\u2019clock those signs had become so clear and unmistakable, that the news swiftly reached all the monks and visitors in the hermitage, promptly penetrated to the monastery, throwing all the monks into amazement, and finally, in the shortest possible time, spread to the town, exciting every one in it, believers and unbelievers alike. The unbelievers rejoiced, and as for the believers some of them rejoiced even more than the unbelievers, for \u201cmen love the downfall and disgrace of the righteous,\u201d as the deceased elder had said in one of his exhortations. The fact is that a smell of decomposition began to come from the coffin, growing gradually more marked, and by three o\u2019clock it was quite unmistakable. In all the past history of our monastery, no such scandal could be recalled, and in no other circumstances could such a scandal have been possible, as showed itself in unseemly disorder immediately after this discovery among the very monks themselves. Afterwards, even many years afterwards, some sensible monks were amazed and horrified, when they recalled that day, that the scandal could have reached such proportions. For in the past, monks of very holy life had died, God\u2010fearing old men, whose saintliness was acknowledged by all, yet from their humble coffins, too, the breath of corruption had come, naturally, as from all dead bodies, but that had caused no scandal nor even the slightest excitement.", " The nearest friends of the deceased and those whose duty it was from their position began to lay out the corpse according to the ancient ritual, and all the monks gathered together in the church. And before dawn the news of the death reached the town. By the morning all the town was talking of the event, and crowds were flocking from the town to the monastery. But this subject will be treated in the next book; I will only add here that before a day had passed something happened so unexpected, so strange, upsetting, and bewildering in its effect on the monks and the townspeople, that after all these years, that day of general suspense is still vividly remembered in the town. PART III Book VII. Alyosha Chapter I. The Breath Of Corruption The body of Father Zossima was prepared for burial according to the established ritual. As is well known, the bodies of dead monks and hermits are not washed. In the words of the Church Ritual: \u201cIf any one of the monks depart in the Lord, the monk designated (that is, whose office it is) shall wipe the body with warm water, making first the sign of the cross with a sponge on the forehead of the deceased, on the breast, on the hands and feet and on the knees, and that is enough.\u201d All this was done by Father Pa\u00efssy, who then clothed the deceased in his monastic garb and wrapped him in his cloak, which was, according to custom, somewhat slit to allow of its being folded about him in the form of a cross.", " And I\u2019ll pay what\u2019s wanted for you there, if they ask for it. But, of course, if they don\u2019t ask, why should we worry them? What do you say? You know, you spend money like a canary, two grains a week. H\u2019m!... Do you know that near one monastery there\u2019s a place outside the town where every baby knows there are none but \u2018the monks\u2019 wives\u2019 living, as they are called. Thirty women, I believe. I have been there myself. You know, it\u2019s interesting in its own way, of course, as a variety. The worst of it is it\u2019s awfully Russian. There are no French women there. Of course they could get them fast enough, they have plenty of money. If they get to hear of it they\u2019ll come along. Well, there\u2019s nothing of that sort here, no \u2018monks\u2019 wives,\u2019 and two hundred monks. They\u2019re honest. They keep the fasts. I admit it.... H\u2019m.... So you want to be a monk? And do you know I\u2019m sorry to lose you, Alyosha; would you believe it, I\u2019ve really grown fond of you? Well, it\u2019s a good opportunity. You\u2019ll pray for us sinners; we have sinned too much here. I\u2019ve always been thinking who would pray for me, and whether there\u2019s any one in the world to do it. My dear boy, I\u2019m awfully stupid about that. You wouldn\u2019t believe it. Awfully. You see, however stupid I am about it, I keep thinking, I keep thinking\u2014from time to time, of course, not all the while. It\u2019s impossible, I think, for the devils to forget to drag me down to hell with their hooks when I die.", " Alyosha noticed that many, almost all, went in to the elder for the first time with apprehension and uneasiness, but came out with bright and happy faces. Alyosha was particularly struck by the fact that Father Zossima was not at all stern. On the contrary, he was always almost gay. The monks used to say that he was more drawn to those who were more sinful, and the greater the sinner the more he loved him. There were, no doubt, up to the end of his life, among the monks some who hated and envied him, but they were few in number and they were silent, though among them were some of great dignity in the monastery, one, for instance, of the older monks distinguished for his strict keeping of fasts and vows of silence. But the majority were on Father Zossima\u2019s side and very many of them loved him with all their hearts, warmly and sincerely. Some were almost fanatically devoted to him, and declared, though not quite aloud, that he was a saint, that there could be no doubt of it, and, seeing that his end was near, they anticipated miracles and great glory to the monastery in the immediate future from his relics. Alyosha had unquestioning faith in the miraculous power of the elder, just as he had unquestioning faith in the story of the coffin that flew out of the church. He saw many who came with sick children or relatives and besought the elder to lay hands on them and to pray over them, return shortly after\u2014some the next day\u2014and, falling in tears at the elder\u2019s feet, thank him for healing their sick."], "While waiting for Dmitri to arrive at Zosima\u2019s room, Fyodor spends time doing what?": [" Father Zossima moved towards Dmitri and reaching him sank on his knees before him. Alyosha thought that he had fallen from weakness, but this was not so. The elder distinctly and deliberately bowed down at Dmitri\u2019s feet till his forehead touched the floor. Alyosha was so astounded that he failed to assist him when he got up again. There was a faint smile on his lips. \u201cGood\u2010by! Forgive me, all of you!\u201d he said, bowing on all sides to his guests. Dmitri stood for a few moments in amazement. Bowing down to him\u2014what did it mean? Suddenly he cried aloud, \u201cOh, God!\u201d hid his face in his hands, and rushed out of the room. All the guests flocked out after him, in their confusion not saying good\u2010by, or bowing to their host. Only the monks went up to him again for a blessing. \u201cWhat did it mean, falling at his feet like that? Was it symbolic or what?\u201d said Fyodor Pavlovitch, suddenly quieted and trying to reopen conversation without venturing to address anybody in particular. They were all passing out of the precincts of the hermitage at the moment. \u201cI can\u2019t answer for a madhouse and for madmen,\u201d Mi\u00fcsov answered at once ill\u2010humoredly, \u201cbut I will spare myself your company, Fyodor Pavlovitch, and, trust me, for ever. Where\u2019s that monk?\u201d \u201cThat monk,\u201d that is, the monk who had invited them to dine with the Superior, did not keep them waiting. He met them as soon as they came down the steps from the elder\u2019s cell, as though he had been waiting for them all the time.", " Seeing this, Dmitri uttered a scream rather than a shout and rushed at Grigory. \u201cThen she\u2019s there! She\u2019s hidden there! Out of the way, scoundrel!\u201d He tried to pull Grigory away, but the old servant pushed him back. Beside himself with fury, Dmitri struck out, and hit Grigory with all his might. The old man fell like a log, and Dmitri, leaping over him, broke in the door. Smerdyakov remained pale and trembling at the other end of the room, huddling close to Fyodor Pavlovitch. \u201cShe\u2019s here!\u201d shouted Dmitri. \u201cI saw her turn towards the house just now, but I couldn\u2019t catch her. Where is she? Where is she?\u201d That shout, \u201cShe\u2019s here!\u201d produced an indescribable effect on Fyodor Pavlovitch. All his terror left him. \u201cHold him! Hold him!\u201d he cried, and dashed after Dmitri. Meanwhile Grigory had got up from the floor, but still seemed stunned. Ivan and Alyosha ran after their father. In the third room something was heard to fall on the floor with a ringing crash: it was a large glass vase\u2014not an expensive one\u2014on a marble pedestal which Dmitri had upset as he ran past it. \u201cAt him!\u201d shouted the old man. \u201cHelp!\u201d Ivan and Alyosha caught the old man and were forcibly bringing him back. \u201cWhy do you run after him? He\u2019ll murder you outright,\u201d Ivan cried wrathfully at his father. \u201cIvan! Alyosha! She must be here. Grushenka\u2019s here. He said he saw her himself, running.\u201d He was choking. He was not expecting Grushenka at the time, and the sudden news that she was here made him beside himself.", " In the following days he became convinced of Mitya\u2019s guilt, as he got to know all the weight of evidence against him. There was evidence of people of no importance, Fenya and her mother, for instance, but the effect of it was almost overpowering. As to Perhotin, the people at the tavern, and at Plotnikov\u2019s shop, as well as the witnesses at Mokroe, their evidence seemed conclusive. It was the details that were so damning. The secret of the knocks impressed the lawyers almost as much as Grigory\u2019s evidence as to the open door. Grigory\u2019s wife, Marfa, in answer to Ivan\u2019s questions, declared that Smerdyakov had been lying all night the other side of the partition wall. \u201cHe was not three paces from our bed,\u201d and that although she was a sound sleeper she waked several times and heard him moaning, \u201cHe was moaning the whole time, moaning continually.\u201d Talking to Herzenstube, and giving it as his opinion that Smerdyakov was not mad, but only rather weak, Ivan only evoked from the old man a subtle smile. \u201cDo you know how he spends his time now?\u201d he asked; \u201clearning lists of French words by heart. He has an exercise\u2010book under his pillow with the French words written out in Russian letters for him by some one, he he he!\u201d Ivan ended by dismissing all doubts. He could not think of Dmitri without repulsion. Only one thing was strange, however. Alyosha persisted that Dmitri was not the murderer, and that \u201cin all probability\u201d Smerdyakov was.", " He was trembling all over. He seemed frantic. \u201cBut you\u2019ve seen for yourself that she hasn\u2019t come,\u201d cried Ivan. \u201cBut she may have come by that other entrance.\u201d \u201cYou know that entrance is locked, and you have the key.\u201d Dmitri suddenly reappeared in the drawing\u2010room. He had, of course, found the other entrance locked, and the key actually was in Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s pocket. The windows of all the rooms were also closed, so Grushenka could not have come in anywhere nor have run out anywhere. \u201cHold him!\u201d shrieked Fyodor Pavlovitch, as soon as he saw him again. \u201cHe\u2019s been stealing money in my bedroom.\u201d And tearing himself from Ivan he rushed again at Dmitri. But Dmitri threw up both hands and suddenly clutched the old man by the two tufts of hair that remained on his temples, tugged at them, and flung him with a crash on the floor. He kicked him two or three times with his heel in the face. The old man moaned shrilly. Ivan, though not so strong as Dmitri, threw his arms round him, and with all his might pulled him away. Alyosha helped him with his slender strength, holding Dmitri in front. \u201cMadman! You\u2019ve killed him!\u201d cried Ivan. \u201cServe him right!\u201d shouted Dmitri breathlessly. \u201cIf I haven\u2019t killed him, I\u2019ll come again and kill him. You can\u2019t protect him!\u201d \u201cDmitri! Go away at once!\u201d cried Alyosha commandingly. \u201cAlexey! You tell me. It\u2019s only you I can believe; was she here just now, or not?"], "Why does a crowd of women come to see Zosima?": [" Father Zossima stood on the top step, put on his stole, and began blessing the women who thronged about him. One crazy woman was led up to him. As soon as she caught sight of the elder she began shrieking and writhing as though in the pains of childbirth. Laying the stole on her forehead, he read a short prayer over her, and she was at once soothed and quieted. I do not know how it may be now, but in my childhood I often happened to see and hear these \u201cpossessed\u201d women in the villages and monasteries. They used to be brought to mass; they would squeal and bark like a dog so that they were heard all over the church. But when the sacrament was carried in and they were led up to it, at once the \u201cpossession\u201d ceased, and the sick women were always soothed for a time. I was greatly impressed and amazed at this as a child; but then I heard from country neighbors and from my town teachers that the whole illness was simulated to avoid work, and that it could always be cured by suitable severity; various anecdotes were told to confirm this. But later on I learnt with astonishment from medical specialists that there is no pretense about it, that it is a terrible illness to which women are subject, specially prevalent among us in Russia, and that it is due to the hard lot of the peasant women. It is a disease, I was told, arising from exhausting toil too soon after hard, abnormal and unassisted labor in childbirth, and from the hopeless misery, from beatings, and so on, which some women were not able to endure like others.", " He went out of the cell. Alyosha and the novice flew to escort him down the steps. Alyosha was breathless: he was glad to get away, but he was glad, too, that the elder was good\u2010humored and not offended. Father Zossima was going towards the portico to bless the people waiting for him there. But Fyodor Pavlovitch persisted in stopping him at the door of the cell. \u201cBlessed man!\u201d he cried, with feeling. \u201cAllow me to kiss your hand once more. Yes, with you I could still talk, I could still get on. Do you think I always lie and play the fool like this? Believe me, I have been acting like this all the time on purpose to try you. I have been testing you all the time to see whether I could get on with you. Is there room for my humility beside your pride? I am ready to give you a testimonial that one can get on with you! But now, I\u2019ll be quiet; I will keep quiet all the time. I\u2019ll sit in a chair and hold my tongue. Now it is for you to speak, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. You are the principal person left now\u2014for ten minutes.\u201d Chapter III. Peasant Women Who Have Faith Near the wooden portico below, built on to the outer wall of the precinct, there was a crowd of about twenty peasant women. They had been told that the elder was at last coming out, and they had gathered together in anticipation. Two ladies, Madame Hohlakov and her daughter, had also come out into the portico to wait for the elder, but in a separate part of it set aside for women of rank.", " The strange and instant healing of the frantic and struggling woman as soon as she was led up to the holy sacrament, which had been explained to me as due to malingering and the trickery of the \u201cclericals,\u201d arose probably in the most natural manner. Both the women who supported her and the invalid herself fully believed as a truth beyond question that the evil spirit in possession of her could not hold out if the sick woman were brought to the sacrament and made to bow down before it. And so, with a nervous and psychically deranged woman, a sort of convulsion of the whole organism always took place, and was bound to take place, at the moment of bowing down to the sacrament, aroused by the expectation of the miracle of healing and the implicit belief that it would come to pass; and it did come to pass, though only for a moment. It was exactly the same now as soon as the elder touched the sick woman with the stole. Many of the women in the crowd were moved to tears of ecstasy by the effect of the moment: some strove to kiss the hem of his garment, others cried out in sing\u2010song voices. He blessed them all and talked with some of them. The \u201cpossessed\u201d woman he knew already. She came from a village only six versts from the monastery, and had been brought to him before. \u201cBut here is one from afar.\u201d He pointed to a woman by no means old but very thin and wasted, with a face not merely sunburnt but almost blackened by exposure.", " Come, go along now, go and amuse yourself.\u201d Once, however, she called him, as it were, puzzled and uneasy. \u201cWhy are you sad? I see you\u2019re sad.... Yes, I see it,\u201d she added, looking intently into his eyes. \u201cThough you keep kissing the peasants and shouting, I see something. No, be merry. I\u2019m merry; you be merry, too.... I love somebody here. Guess who it is. Ah, look, my boy has fallen asleep, poor dear, he\u2019s drunk.\u201d She meant Kalganov. He was, in fact, drunk, and had dropped asleep for a moment, sitting on the sofa. But he was not merely drowsy from drink; he felt suddenly dejected, or, as he said, \u201cbored.\u201d He was intensely depressed by the girls\u2019 songs, which, as the drinking went on, gradually became coarse and more reckless. And the dances were as bad. Two girls dressed up as bears, and a lively girl, called Stepanida, with a stick in her hand, acted the part of keeper, and began to \u201cshow them.\u201d \u201cLook alive, Marya, or you\u2019ll get the stick!\u201d The bears rolled on the ground at last in the most unseemly fashion, amid roars of laughter from the closely\u2010packed crowd of men and women. \u201cWell, let them! Let them!\u201d said Grushenka sententiously, with an ecstatic expression on her face. \u201cWhen they do get a day to enjoy themselves, why shouldn\u2019t folks be happy?\u201d Kalganov looked as though he had been besmirched with dirt. \u201cIt\u2019s swinish, all this peasant foolery,\u201d he murmured, moving away; \u201cit\u2019s the game they play when it\u2019s light all night in summer.\u201d He particularly disliked one \u201cnew\u201d song to a jaunty dance\u2010tune."], "What advice does Zosima give to Madame Khokhlakov?": [" I\u2019m cured. \u2018Enough!\u2019 as Turgenev says.\u201d \u201cBut, madam, the three thousand you so generously promised to lend me\u2014\u201d \u201cIt is yours, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,\u201d Madame Hohlakov cut in at once. \u201cThe money is as good as in your pocket, not three thousand, but three million, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, in less than no time. I\u2019ll make you a present of the idea: you shall find gold\u2010mines, make millions, return and become a leading man, and wake us up and lead us to better things. Are we to leave it all to the Jews? You will found institutions and enterprises of all sorts. You will help the poor, and they will bless you. This is the age of railways, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You\u2019ll become famous and indispensable to the Department of Finance, which is so badly off at present. The depreciation of the rouble keeps me awake at night, Dmitri Fyodorovitch; people don\u2019t know that side of me\u2014\u201d \u201cMadam, madam!\u201d Dmitri interrupted with an uneasy presentiment. \u201cI shall indeed, perhaps, follow your advice, your wise advice, madam.... I shall perhaps set off ... to the gold\u2010mines.... I\u2019ll come and see you again about it ... many times, indeed ... but now, that three thousand you so generously ... oh, that would set me free, and if you could to\u2010day ... you see, I haven\u2019t a minute, a minute to lose to\u2010day\u2014\u201d \u201cEnough, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, enough!\u201d Madame Hohlakov interrupted emphatically. \u201cThe question is, will you go to the gold\u2010mines or not; have you quite made up your mind?", " Grushenka was not even mentioned in his will. All this became known afterwards. He helped Grushenka with his advice to increase her capital and put business in her way. When Fyodor Pavlovitch, who first came into contact with Grushenka over a piece of speculation, ended to his own surprise by falling madly in love with her, old Samsonov, gravely ill as he was, was immensely amused. It is remarkable that throughout their whole acquaintance Grushenka was absolutely and spontaneously open with the old man, and he seems to have been the only person in the world with whom she was so. Of late, when Dmitri too had come on the scene with his love, the old man left off laughing. On the contrary, he once gave Grushenka a stern and earnest piece of advice. \u201cIf you have to choose between the two, father or son, you\u2019d better choose the old man, if only you make sure the old scoundrel will marry you and settle some fortune on you beforehand. But don\u2019t keep on with the captain, you\u2019ll get no good out of that.\u201d These were the very words of the old profligate, who felt already that his death was not far off and who actually died five months later. I will note, too, in passing, that although many in our town knew of the grotesque and monstrous rivalry of the Karamazovs, father and son, the object of which was Grushenka, scarcely any one understood what really underlay her attitude to both of them.", " Listen, kiss me, I allow you.\u201d Alyosha kissed her. \u201cCome, now go. Christ be with you!\u201d and she made the sign of the cross over him. \u201cMake haste back to _him_ while he is alive. I see I\u2019ve kept you cruelly. I\u2019ll pray to\u2010day for him and you. Alyosha, we shall be happy! Shall we be happy, shall we?\u201d \u201cI believe we shall, Lise.\u201d Alyosha thought it better not to go in to Madame Hohlakov and was going out of the house without saying good\u2010by to her. But no sooner had he opened the door than he found Madame Hohlakov standing before him. From the first word Alyosha guessed that she had been waiting on purpose to meet him. \u201cAlexey Fyodorovitch, this is awful. This is all childish nonsense and ridiculous. I trust you won\u2019t dream\u2014It\u2019s foolishness, nothing but foolishness!\u201d she said, attacking him at once. \u201cOnly don\u2019t tell her that,\u201d said Alyosha, \u201cor she will be upset, and that\u2019s bad for her now.\u201d \u201cSensible advice from a sensible young man. Am I to understand that you only agreed with her from compassion for her invalid state, because you didn\u2019t want to irritate her by contradiction?\u201d \u201cOh, no, not at all. I was quite serious in what I said,\u201d Alyosha declared stoutly. \u201cTo be serious about it is impossible, unthinkable, and in the first place I shall never be at home to you again, and I shall take her away, you may be sure of that.\u201d \u201cBut why?\u201d asked Alyosha. \u201cIt\u2019s all so far off. We may have to wait another year and a half.\u201d \u201cAh, Alexey Fyodorovitch, that\u2019s true, of course, and you\u2019ll have time to quarrel and separate a thousand times in a year and a half.", " He remained waiting in the entry. Madame Hohlakov herself was already in her bedroom, though not yet asleep. She had felt upset ever since Mitya\u2019s visit, and had a presentiment that she would not get through the night without the sick headache which always, with her, followed such excitement. She was surprised on hearing the announcement from the maid. She irritably declined to see him, however, though the unexpected visit at such an hour, of an \u201cofficial living in the town,\u201d who was a total stranger, roused her feminine curiosity intensely. But this time Pyotr Ilyitch was as obstinate as a mule. He begged the maid most earnestly to take another message in these very words: \u201cThat he had come on business of the greatest importance, and that Madame Hohlakov might have cause to regret it later, if she refused to see him now.\u201d \u201cI plunged headlong,\u201d he described it afterwards. The maid, gazing at him in amazement, went to take his message again. Madame Hohlakov was impressed. She thought a little, asked what he looked like, and learned that he was \u201cvery well dressed, young and so polite.\u201d We may note, parenthetically, that Pyotr Ilyitch was a rather good\u2010looking young man, and well aware of the fact. Madame Hohlakov made up her mind to see him. She was in her dressing\u2010gown and slippers, but she flung a black shawl over her shoulders. \u201cThe official\u201d was asked to walk into the drawing\u2010room, the very room in which Mitya had been received shortly before."], "In a discussion with the monks, Ivan argues in support of which of the following?": [" Alyosha did not leave him. The thought passed through his mind to run for a doctor, but he was afraid to leave his brother alone: there was no one to whom he could leave him. By degrees Ivan lost consciousness completely at last. He still went on talking, talking incessantly, but quite incoherently, and even articulated his words with difficulty. Suddenly he staggered violently; but Alyosha was in time to support him. Ivan let him lead him to his bed. Alyosha undressed him somehow and put him to bed. He sat watching over him for another two hours. The sick man slept soundly, without stirring, breathing softly and evenly. Alyosha took a pillow and lay down on the sofa, without undressing. As he fell asleep he prayed for Mitya and Ivan. He began to understand Ivan\u2019s illness. \u201cThe anguish of a proud determination. An earnest conscience!\u201d God, in Whom he disbelieved, and His truth were gaining mastery over his heart, which still refused to submit. \u201cYes,\u201d the thought floated through Alyosha\u2019s head as it lay on the pillow, \u201cyes, if Smerdyakov is dead, no one will believe Ivan\u2019s evidence; but he will go and give it.\u201d Alyosha smiled softly. \u201cGod will conquer!\u201d he thought. \u201cHe will either rise up in the light of truth, or ... he\u2019ll perish in hate, revenging on himself and on every one his having served the cause he does not believe in,\u201d Alyosha added bitterly, and again he prayed for Ivan.", " For they expected something quite different. And, behold, soon after midday there were signs of something, at first only observed in silence by those who came in and out and were evidently each afraid to communicate the thought in his mind. But by three o\u2019clock those signs had become so clear and unmistakable, that the news swiftly reached all the monks and visitors in the hermitage, promptly penetrated to the monastery, throwing all the monks into amazement, and finally, in the shortest possible time, spread to the town, exciting every one in it, believers and unbelievers alike. The unbelievers rejoiced, and as for the believers some of them rejoiced even more than the unbelievers, for \u201cmen love the downfall and disgrace of the righteous,\u201d as the deceased elder had said in one of his exhortations. The fact is that a smell of decomposition began to come from the coffin, growing gradually more marked, and by three o\u2019clock it was quite unmistakable. In all the past history of our monastery, no such scandal could be recalled, and in no other circumstances could such a scandal have been possible, as showed itself in unseemly disorder immediately after this discovery among the very monks themselves. Afterwards, even many years afterwards, some sensible monks were amazed and horrified, when they recalled that day, that the scandal could have reached such proportions. For in the past, monks of very holy life had died, God\u2010fearing old men, whose saintliness was acknowledged by all, yet from their humble coffins, too, the breath of corruption had come, naturally, as from all dead bodies, but that had caused no scandal nor even the slightest excitement.", " The nearest friends of the deceased and those whose duty it was from their position began to lay out the corpse according to the ancient ritual, and all the monks gathered together in the church. And before dawn the news of the death reached the town. By the morning all the town was talking of the event, and crowds were flocking from the town to the monastery. But this subject will be treated in the next book; I will only add here that before a day had passed something happened so unexpected, so strange, upsetting, and bewildering in its effect on the monks and the townspeople, that after all these years, that day of general suspense is still vividly remembered in the town. PART III Book VII. Alyosha Chapter I. The Breath Of Corruption The body of Father Zossima was prepared for burial according to the established ritual. As is well known, the bodies of dead monks and hermits are not washed. In the words of the Church Ritual: \u201cIf any one of the monks depart in the Lord, the monk designated (that is, whose office it is) shall wipe the body with warm water, making first the sign of the cross with a sponge on the forehead of the deceased, on the breast, on the hands and feet and on the knees, and that is enough.\u201d All this was done by Father Pa\u00efssy, who then clothed the deceased in his monastic garb and wrapped him in his cloak, which was, according to custom, somewhat slit to allow of its being folded about him in the form of a cross.", " What you talked about last time?\u201d \u201cYou stood before me last time and understood it all, and you understand it now.\u201d \u201cAll I understand is that you are mad.\u201d \u201cAren\u2019t you tired of it? Here we are face to face; what\u2019s the use of going on keeping up a farce to each other? Are you still trying to throw it all on me, to my face? _You_ murdered him; you are the real murderer, I was only your instrument, your faithful servant, and it was following your words I did it.\u201d \u201c_Did_ it? Why, did you murder him?\u201d Ivan turned cold. Something seemed to give way in his brain, and he shuddered all over with a cold shiver. Then Smerdyakov himself looked at him wonderingly; probably the genuineness of Ivan\u2019s horror struck him. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean to say you really did not know?\u201d he faltered mistrustfully, looking with a forced smile into his eyes. Ivan still gazed at him, and seemed unable to speak. Ach, Vanka\u2019s gone to Petersburg; I won\u2019t wait till he comes back, suddenly echoed in his head. \u201cDo you know, I am afraid that you are a dream, a phantom sitting before me,\u201d he muttered. \u201cThere\u2019s no phantom here, but only us two and one other. No doubt he is here, that third, between us.\u201d \u201cWho is he? Who is here? What third person?\u201d Ivan cried in alarm, looking about him, his eyes hastily searching in every corner. \u201cThat third is God Himself\u2014Providence. He is the third beside us now. Only don\u2019t look for Him, you won\u2019t find Him.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a lie that you killed him!\u201d Ivan cried madly."], "In front of the monks, Dmitri accuses Fyodor of conspiring with Grushenka to do what?": [" He was trembling all over. He seemed frantic. \u201cBut you\u2019ve seen for yourself that she hasn\u2019t come,\u201d cried Ivan. \u201cBut she may have come by that other entrance.\u201d \u201cYou know that entrance is locked, and you have the key.\u201d Dmitri suddenly reappeared in the drawing\u2010room. He had, of course, found the other entrance locked, and the key actually was in Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s pocket. The windows of all the rooms were also closed, so Grushenka could not have come in anywhere nor have run out anywhere. \u201cHold him!\u201d shrieked Fyodor Pavlovitch, as soon as he saw him again. \u201cHe\u2019s been stealing money in my bedroom.\u201d And tearing himself from Ivan he rushed again at Dmitri. But Dmitri threw up both hands and suddenly clutched the old man by the two tufts of hair that remained on his temples, tugged at them, and flung him with a crash on the floor. He kicked him two or three times with his heel in the face. The old man moaned shrilly. Ivan, though not so strong as Dmitri, threw his arms round him, and with all his might pulled him away. Alyosha helped him with his slender strength, holding Dmitri in front. \u201cMadman! You\u2019ve killed him!\u201d cried Ivan. \u201cServe him right!\u201d shouted Dmitri breathlessly. \u201cIf I haven\u2019t killed him, I\u2019ll come again and kill him. You can\u2019t protect him!\u201d \u201cDmitri! Go away at once!\u201d cried Alyosha commandingly. \u201cAlexey! You tell me. It\u2019s only you I can believe; was she here just now, or not?", " From some rumor, or perhaps from some stray word of Grushenka\u2019s, he had gathered further that the old man would perhaps prefer him to Fyodor Pavlovitch for Grushenka. Possibly many of the readers of my novel will feel that in reckoning on such assistance, and being ready to take his bride, so to speak, from the hands of her protector, Dmitri showed great coarseness and want of delicacy. I will only observe that Mitya looked upon Grushenka\u2019s past as something completely over. He looked on that past with infinite pity and resolved with all the fervor of his passion that when once Grushenka told him she loved him and would marry him, it would mean the beginning of a new Grushenka and a new Dmitri, free from every vice. They would forgive one another and would begin their lives afresh. As for Kuzma Samsonov, Dmitri looked upon him as a man who had exercised a fateful influence in that remote past of Grushenka\u2019s, though she had never loved him, and who was now himself a thing of the past, completely done with, and, so to say, non\u2010existent. Besides, Mitya hardly looked upon him as a man at all, for it was known to every one in the town that he was only a shattered wreck, whose relations with Grushenka had changed their character and were now simply paternal, and that this had been so for a long time. In any case there was much simplicity on Mitya\u2019s part in all this, for in spite of all his vices, he was a very simple\u2010hearted man.", " Seeing this, Dmitri uttered a scream rather than a shout and rushed at Grigory. \u201cThen she\u2019s there! She\u2019s hidden there! Out of the way, scoundrel!\u201d He tried to pull Grigory away, but the old servant pushed him back. Beside himself with fury, Dmitri struck out, and hit Grigory with all his might. The old man fell like a log, and Dmitri, leaping over him, broke in the door. Smerdyakov remained pale and trembling at the other end of the room, huddling close to Fyodor Pavlovitch. \u201cShe\u2019s here!\u201d shouted Dmitri. \u201cI saw her turn towards the house just now, but I couldn\u2019t catch her. Where is she? Where is she?\u201d That shout, \u201cShe\u2019s here!\u201d produced an indescribable effect on Fyodor Pavlovitch. All his terror left him. \u201cHold him! Hold him!\u201d he cried, and dashed after Dmitri. Meanwhile Grigory had got up from the floor, but still seemed stunned. Ivan and Alyosha ran after their father. In the third room something was heard to fall on the floor with a ringing crash: it was a large glass vase\u2014not an expensive one\u2014on a marble pedestal which Dmitri had upset as he ran past it. \u201cAt him!\u201d shouted the old man. \u201cHelp!\u201d Ivan and Alyosha caught the old man and were forcibly bringing him back. \u201cWhy do you run after him? He\u2019ll murder you outright,\u201d Ivan cried wrathfully at his father. \u201cIvan! Alyosha! She must be here. Grushenka\u2019s here. He said he saw her himself, running.\u201d He was choking. He was not expecting Grushenka at the time, and the sudden news that she was here made him beside himself.", " For him the whole tormenting question lay between him and Fyodor Pavlovitch. Here, we must note, by the way, one certain fact: he was firmly persuaded that Fyodor Pavlovitch would offer, or perhaps had offered, Grushenka lawful wedlock, and did not for a moment believe that the old voluptuary hoped to gain his object for three thousand roubles. Mitya had reached this conclusion from his knowledge of Grushenka and her character. That was how it was that he could believe at times that all Grushenka\u2019s uneasiness rose from not knowing which of them to choose, which was most to her advantage. Strange to say, during those days it never occurred to him to think of the approaching return of the \u201cofficer,\u201d that is, of the man who had been such a fatal influence in Grushenka\u2019s life, and whose arrival she was expecting with such emotion and dread. It is true that of late Grushenka had been very silent about it. Yet he was perfectly aware of a letter she had received a month ago from her seducer, and had heard of it from her own lips. He partly knew, too, what the letter contained. In a moment of spite Grushenka had shown him that letter, but to her astonishment he attached hardly any consequence to it. It would be hard to say why this was. Perhaps, weighed down by all the hideous horror of his struggle with his own father for this woman, he was incapable of imagining any danger more terrible, at any rate for the time."], "What does Zosima do before leaving the room?": [" He seemed to have slept for two hours or more. He was waked up by his head aching so unbearably that he could have screamed. There was a hammering in his temples, and the top of his head ached. It was a long time before he could wake up fully and understand what had happened to him. At last he realized that the room was full of charcoal fumes from the stove, and that he might die of suffocation. And the drunken peasant still lay snoring. The candle guttered and was about to go out. Mitya cried out, and ran staggering across the passage into the forester\u2019s room. The forester waked up at once, but hearing that the other room was full of fumes, to Mitya\u2019s surprise and annoyance, accepted the fact with strange unconcern, though he did go to see to it. \u201cBut he\u2019s dead, he\u2019s dead! and ... what am I to do then?\u201d cried Mitya frantically. They threw open the doors, opened a window and the chimney. Mitya brought a pail of water from the passage. First he wetted his own head, then, finding a rag of some sort, dipped it into the water, and put it on Lyagavy\u2019s head. The forester still treated the matter contemptuously, and when he opened the window said grumpily: \u201cIt\u2019ll be all right, now.\u201d He went back to sleep, leaving Mitya a lighted lantern. Mitya fussed about the drunken peasant for half an hour, wetting his head, and gravely resolved not to sleep all night. But he was so worn out that when he sat down for a moment to take breath, he closed his eyes, unconsciously stretched himself full length on the bench and slept like the dead.", " But just as he reached the tavern, a window was flung open, and his brother Ivan called down to him from it. \u201cAlyosha, can\u2019t you come up here to me? I shall be awfully grateful.\u201d \u201cTo be sure I can, only I don\u2019t quite know whether in this dress\u2014\u201d \u201cBut I am in a room apart. Come up the steps; I\u2019ll run down to meet you.\u201d A minute later Alyosha was sitting beside his brother. Ivan was alone dining. Chapter III. The Brothers Make Friends Ivan was not, however, in a separate room, but only in a place shut off by a screen, so that it was unseen by other people in the room. It was the first room from the entrance with a buffet along the wall. Waiters were continually darting to and fro in it. The only customer in the room was an old retired military man drinking tea in a corner. But there was the usual bustle going on in the other rooms of the tavern; there were shouts for the waiters, the sound of popping corks, the click of billiard balls, the drone of the organ. Alyosha knew that Ivan did not usually visit this tavern and disliked taverns in general. So he must have come here, he reflected, simply to meet Dmitri by arrangement. Yet Dmitri was not there. \u201cShall I order you fish, soup or anything. You don\u2019t live on tea alone, I suppose,\u201d cried Ivan, apparently delighted at having got hold of Alyosha. He had finished dinner and was drinking tea. \u201cLet me have soup, and tea afterwards, I am hungry,\u201d said Alyosha gayly.", " And if it doesn\u2019t come to pass\u2014\u201d Alyosha went thoughtfully towards his father\u2019s house. Chapter VI. Smerdyakov He did in fact find his father still at table. Though there was a dining\u2010 room in the house, the table was laid as usual in the drawing\u2010room, which was the largest room, and furnished with old\u2010fashioned ostentation. The furniture was white and very old, upholstered in old, red, silky material. In the spaces between the windows there were mirrors in elaborate white and gilt frames, of old\u2010fashioned carving. On the walls, covered with white paper, which was torn in many places, there hung two large portraits\u2014one of some prince who had been governor of the district thirty years before, and the other of some bishop, also long since dead. In the corner opposite the door there were several ikons, before which a lamp was lighted at nightfall ... not so much for devotional purposes as to light the room. Fyodor Pavlovitch used to go to bed very late, at three or four o\u2019clock in the morning, and would wander about the room at night or sit in an arm\u2010chair, thinking. This had become a habit with him. He often slept quite alone in the house, sending his servants to the lodge; but usually Smerdyakov remained, sleeping on a bench in the hall. When Alyosha came in, dinner was over, but coffee and preserves had been served. Fyodor Pavlovitch liked sweet things with brandy after dinner. Ivan was also at table, sipping coffee.", " Kolya maintained stoutly that he would. At first they laughed at him, called him a little liar, a braggart, but that only egged him on. What piqued him most was that these boys of fifteen turned up their noses at him too superciliously, and were at first disposed to treat him as \u201ca small boy,\u201d not fit to associate with them, and that was an unendurable insult. And so it was resolved to go in the evening, half a mile from the station, so that the train might have time to get up full speed after leaving the station. The boys assembled. It was a pitch\u2010dark night without a moon. At the time fixed, Kolya lay down between the rails. The five others who had taken the bet waited among the bushes below the embankment, their hearts beating with suspense, which was followed by alarm and remorse. At last they heard in the distance the rumble of the train leaving the station. Two red lights gleamed out of the darkness; the monster roared as it approached. \u201cRun, run away from the rails,\u201d the boys cried to Kolya from the bushes, breathless with terror. But it was too late: the train darted up and flew past. The boys rushed to Kolya. He lay without moving. They began pulling at him, lifting him up. He suddenly got up and walked away without a word. Then he explained that he had lain there as though he were insensible to frighten them, but the fact was that he really had lost consciousness, as he confessed long after to his mother."], "Zosima advises Alyosha to do what with his life?": [" Only think, he realizes for the first time how he has wounded you, the first time in his life; he had never grasped it before so fully. He said, \u2018If she refuses to come I shall be unhappy all my life.\u2019 Do you hear? though he is condemned to penal servitude for twenty years, he is still planning to be happy\u2014is not that piteous? Think\u2014you must visit him; though he is ruined, he is innocent,\u201d broke like a challenge from Alyosha. \u201cHis hands are clean, there is no blood on them! For the sake of his infinite sufferings in the future visit him now. Go, greet him on his way into the darkness\u2014stand at his door, that is all.... You ought to do it, you ought to!\u201d Alyosha concluded, laying immense stress on the word \u201cought.\u201d \u201cI ought to ... but I cannot....\u201d Katya moaned. \u201cHe will look at me.... I can\u2019t.\u201d \u201cYour eyes ought to meet. How will you live all your life, if you don\u2019t make up your mind to do it now?\u201d \u201cBetter suffer all my life.\u201d \u201cYou ought to go, you ought to go,\u201d Alyosha repeated with merciless emphasis. \u201cBut why to\u2010day, why at once?... I can\u2019t leave our patient\u2014\u201d \u201cYou can for a moment. It will only be a moment. If you don\u2019t come, he will be in delirium by to\u2010night. I would not tell you a lie; have pity on him!\u201d \u201cHave pity on _me!_\u201d Katya said, with bitter reproach, and she burst into tears. \u201cThen you will come,\u201d said Alyosha firmly, seeing her tears. \u201cI\u2019ll go and tell him you will come directly.\u201d \u201cNo, don\u2019t tell him so on any account,\u201d cried Katya in alarm.", " At thirty, though, I shall be sure to leave the cup, even if I\u2019ve not emptied it, and turn away\u2014where I don\u2019t know. But till I am thirty, I know that my youth will triumph over everything\u2014every disillusionment, every disgust with life. I\u2019ve asked myself many times whether there is in the world any despair that would overcome this frantic and perhaps unseemly thirst for life in me, and I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that there isn\u2019t, that is till I am thirty, and then I shall lose it of myself, I fancy. Some driveling consumptive moralists\u2014and poets especially\u2014often call that thirst for life base. It\u2019s a feature of the Karamazovs, it\u2019s true, that thirst for life regardless of everything; you have it no doubt too, but why is it base? The centripetal force on our planet is still fearfully strong, Alyosha. I have a longing for life, and I go on living in spite of logic. Though I may not believe in the order of the universe, yet I love the sticky little leaves as they open in spring. I love the blue sky, I love some people, whom one loves you know sometimes without knowing why. I love some great deeds done by men, though I\u2019ve long ceased perhaps to have faith in them, yet from old habit one\u2019s heart prizes them. Here they have brought the soup for you, eat it, it will do you good. It\u2019s first\u2010rate soup, they know how to make it here. I want to travel in Europe, Alyosha, I shall set off from here.", " \u201cHave you asked him whether he believes it?\u201d asked Alyosha. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t. I wanted to, but I couldn\u2019t. I hadn\u2019t the courage. But I saw it from his eyes. Well, good\u2010by!\u201d Once more they kissed hurriedly, and Alyosha was just going out, when Mitya suddenly called him back. \u201cStand facing me! That\u2019s right!\u201d And again he seized Alyosha, putting both hands on his shoulders. His face became suddenly quite pale, so that it was dreadfully apparent, even through the gathering darkness. His lips twitched, his eyes fastened upon Alyosha. \u201cAlyosha, tell me the whole truth, as you would before God. Do you believe I did it? Do you, do you in yourself, believe it? The whole truth, don\u2019t lie!\u201d he cried desperately. Everything seemed heaving before Alyosha, and he felt something like a stab at his heart. \u201cHush! What do you mean?\u201d he faltered helplessly. \u201cThe whole truth, the whole, don\u2019t lie!\u201d repeated Mitya. \u201cI\u2019ve never for one instant believed that you were the murderer!\u201d broke in a shaking voice from Alyosha\u2019s breast, and he raised his right hand in the air, as though calling God to witness his words. Mitya\u2019s whole face was lighted up with bliss. \u201cThank you!\u201d he articulated slowly, as though letting a sigh escape him after fainting. \u201cNow you have given me new life. Would you believe it, till this moment I\u2019ve been afraid to ask you, you, even you. Well, go! You\u2019ve given me strength for to\u2010morrow.", " He had not gone three steps before the biggest stone the boy had in his pocket hit him a painful blow in the back. \u201cSo you\u2019ll hit a man from behind! They tell the truth, then, when they say that you attack on the sly,\u201d said Alyosha, turning round again. This time the boy threw a stone savagely right into Alyosha\u2019s face; but Alyosha just had time to guard himself, and the stone struck him on the elbow. \u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed? What have I done to you?\u201d he cried. The boy waited in silent defiance, certain that now Alyosha would attack him. Seeing that even now he would not, his rage was like a little wild beast\u2019s; he flew at Alyosha himself, and before Alyosha had time to move, the spiteful child had seized his left hand with both of his and bit his middle finger. He fixed his teeth in it and it was ten seconds before he let go. Alyosha cried out with pain and pulled his finger away with all his might. The child let go at last and retreated to his former distance. Alyosha\u2019s finger had been badly bitten to the bone, close to the nail; it began to bleed. Alyosha took out his handkerchief and bound it tightly round his injured hand. He was a full minute bandaging it. The boy stood waiting all the time. At last Alyosha raised his gentle eyes and looked at him. \u201cVery well,\u201d he said, \u201cyou see how badly you\u2019ve bitten me. That\u2019s enough, isn\u2019t it? Now tell me, what have I done to you?\u201d The boy stared in amazement."], "In a conversation with Alyosha, Ratikin accuses the Karamazovs of being what?": [" But whether this was only the conversation that took place then, or whether he added to it his notes of parts of former conversations with his teacher, I cannot determine. In his account, Father Zossima\u2019s talk goes on without interruption, as though he told his life to his friends in the form of a story, though there is no doubt, from other accounts of it, that the conversation that evening was general. Though the guests did not interrupt Father Zossima much, yet they too talked, perhaps even told something themselves. Besides, Father Zossima could not have carried on an uninterrupted narrative, for he was sometimes gasping for breath, his voice failed him, and he even lay down to rest on his bed, though he did not fall asleep and his visitors did not leave their seats. Once or twice the conversation was interrupted by Father Pa\u00efssy\u2019s reading the Gospel. It is worthy of note, too, that no one of them supposed that he would die that night, for on that evening of his life after his deep sleep in the day he seemed suddenly to have found new strength, which kept him up through this long conversation. It was like a last effort of love which gave him marvelous energy; only for a little time, however, for his life was cut short immediately.... But of that later. I will only add now that I have preferred to confine myself to the account given by Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov. It will be shorter and not so fatiguing, though of course, as I must repeat, Alyosha took a great deal from previous conversations and added them to it.", " \u201cIf I thought of anything then,\u201d he began again, \u201cit was solely of some wickedness on your part. Dmitri might kill him, but that he would steal\u2014I did not believe that then.... But I was prepared for any wickedness from you. You told me yourself you could sham a fit. What did you say that for?\u201d \u201cIt was just through my simplicity, and I never have shammed a fit on purpose in my life. And I only said so then to boast to you. It was just foolishness. I liked you so much then, and was open\u2010hearted with you.\u201d \u201cMy brother directly accuses you of the murder and theft.\u201d \u201cWhat else is left for him to do?\u201d said Smerdyakov, with a bitter grin. \u201cAnd who will believe him with all the proofs against him? Grigory Vassilyevitch saw the door open. What can he say after that? But never mind him! He is trembling to save himself.\u201d He slowly ceased speaking; then suddenly, as though on reflection, added: \u201cAnd look here again. He wants to throw it on me and make out that it is the work of my hands\u2014I\u2019ve heard that already. But as to my being clever at shamming a fit: should I have told you beforehand that I could sham one, if I really had had such a design against your father? If I had been planning such a murder could I have been such a fool as to give such evidence against myself beforehand? And to his son, too! Upon my word! Is that likely? As if that could be, such a thing has never happened. No one hears this talk of ours now, except Providence itself, and if you were to tell of it to the prosecutor and Nikolay Parfenovitch you might defend me completely by doing so, for who would be likely to be such a criminal, if he is so open\u2010hearted beforehand?", " I will not, however, omit to mention something strange, which came for a time to the surface of Alyosha\u2019s mind at this fatal and obscure moment. This new something was the harassing impression left by the conversation with Ivan, which now persistently haunted Alyosha\u2019s mind. At this moment it haunted him. Oh, it was not that something of the fundamental, elemental, so to speak, faith of his soul had been shaken. He loved his God and believed in Him steadfastly, though he was suddenly murmuring against Him. Yet a vague but tormenting and evil impression left by his conversation with Ivan the day before, suddenly revived again now in his soul and seemed forcing its way to the surface of his consciousness. It had begun to get dusk when Rakitin, crossing the pine copse from the hermitage to the monastery, suddenly noticed Alyosha, lying face downwards on the ground under a tree, not moving and apparently asleep. He went up and called him by his name. \u201cYou here, Alexey? Can you have\u2014\u201d he began wondering but broke off. He had meant to say, \u201cCan you have come to this?\u201d Alyosha did not look at him, but from a slight movement Rakitin at once saw that he heard and understood him. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he went on; but the surprise in his face gradually passed into a smile that became more and more ironical. \u201cI say, I\u2019ve been looking for you for the last two hours. You suddenly disappeared.", " \u201cDamnation take you all and each of you!\u201d he cried suddenly, \u201cwhy the devil did I take you up? I don\u2019t want to know you from this time forward. Go alone, there\u2019s your road!\u201d And he turned abruptly into another street, leaving Alyosha alone in the dark. Alyosha came out of the town and walked across the fields to the monastery. Chapter IV. Cana Of Galilee It was very late, according to the monastery ideas, when Alyosha returned to the hermitage; the door\u2010keeper let him in by a special entrance. It had struck nine o\u2019clock\u2014the hour of rest and repose after a day of such agitation for all. Alyosha timidly opened the door and went into the elder\u2019s cell where his coffin was now standing. There was no one in the cell but Father Pa\u00efssy, reading the Gospel in solitude over the coffin, and the young novice Porfiry, who, exhausted by the previous night\u2019s conversation and the disturbing incidents of the day, was sleeping the deep sound sleep of youth on the floor of the other room. Though Father Pa\u00efssy heard Alyosha come in, he did not even look in his direction. Alyosha turned to the right from the door to the corner, fell on his knees and began to pray. His soul was overflowing but with mingled feelings; no single sensation stood out distinctly; on the contrary, one drove out another in a slow, continual rotation. But there was a sweetness in his heart and, strange to say, Alyosha was not surprised at it."], "What causes the townspeople to conclude that Fyodor is the man who seduced Lizaveta, the slow-witted girl who died in childbirth?": [" The most likely explanation is that it happened naturally\u2014that Lizaveta, accustomed to clambering over hurdles to sleep in gardens, had somehow managed to climb this fence, in spite of her condition, and had leapt down, injuring herself. Grigory rushed to Marfa and sent her to Lizaveta, while he ran to fetch an old midwife who lived close by. They saved the baby, but Lizaveta died at dawn. Grigory took the baby, brought it home, and making his wife sit down, put it on her lap. \u201cA child of God\u2014an orphan is akin to all,\u201d he said, \u201cand to us above others. Our little lost one has sent us this, who has come from the devil\u2019s son and a holy innocent. Nurse him and weep no more.\u201d So Marfa brought up the child. He was christened Pavel, to which people were not slow in adding Fyodorovitch (son of Fyodor). Fyodor Pavlovitch did not object to any of this, and thought it amusing, though he persisted vigorously in denying his responsibility. The townspeople were pleased at his adopting the foundling. Later on, Fyodor Pavlovitch invented a surname for the child, calling him Smerdyakov, after his mother\u2019s nickname. So this Smerdyakov became Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s second servant, and was living in the lodge with Grigory and Marfa at the time our story begins. He was employed as cook. I ought to say something of this Smerdyakov, but I am ashamed of keeping my readers\u2019 attention so long occupied with these common menials, and I will go back to my story, hoping to say more of Smerdyakov in the course of it.", " He listened and said he thought it was more like some one groaning, \u201cit might be a woman.\u201d He got up and dressed. It was a rather warm night in May. As he went down the steps, he distinctly heard groans coming from the garden. But the gate from the yard into the garden was locked at night, and there was no other way of entering it, for it was enclosed all round by a strong, high fence. Going back into the house, Grigory lighted a lantern, took the garden key, and taking no notice of the hysterical fears of his wife, who was still persuaded that she heard a child crying, and that it was her own baby crying and calling for her, went into the garden in silence. There he heard at once that the groans came from the bath\u2010house that stood near the garden gate, and that they were the groans of a woman. Opening the door of the bath\u2010house, he saw a sight which petrified him. An idiot girl, who wandered about the streets and was known to the whole town by the nickname of Lizaveta Smerdyastchaya (Stinking Lizaveta), had got into the bath\u2010 house and had just given birth to a child. She lay dying with the baby beside her. She said nothing, for she had never been able to speak. But her story needs a chapter to itself. Chapter II. Lizaveta There was one circumstance which struck Grigory particularly, and confirmed a very unpleasant and revolting suspicion. This Lizaveta was a dwarfish creature, \u201cnot five foot within a wee bit,\u201d as many of the pious old women said pathetically about her, after her death.", " And if you love you are of God. All things are atoned for, all things are saved by love. If I, a sinner, even as you are, am tender with you and have pity on you, how much more will God. Love is such a priceless treasure that you can redeem the whole world by it, and expiate not only your own sins but the sins of others.\u201d He signed her three times with the cross, took from his own neck a little ikon and put it upon her. She bowed down to the earth without speaking. He got up and looked cheerfully at a healthy peasant woman with a tiny baby in her arms. \u201cFrom Vyshegorye, dear Father.\u201d \u201cFive miles you have dragged yourself with the baby. What do you want?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve come to look at you. I have been to you before\u2014or have you forgotten? You\u2019ve no great memory if you\u2019ve forgotten me. They told us you were ill. Thinks I, I\u2019ll go and see him for myself. Now I see you, and you\u2019re not ill! You\u2019ll live another twenty years. God bless you! There are plenty to pray for you; how should you be ill?\u201d \u201cI thank you for all, daughter.\u201d \u201cBy the way, I have a thing to ask, not a great one. Here are sixty copecks. Give them, dear Father, to some one poorer than me. I thought as I came along, better give through him. He\u2019ll know whom to give to.\u201d \u201cThanks, my dear, thanks! You are a good woman. I love you. I will do so certainly. Is that your little girl?\u201d \u201cMy little girl, Father, Lizaveta.\u201d \u201cMay the Lord bless you both, you and your babe Lizaveta!", " Father Zossima stood on the top step, put on his stole, and began blessing the women who thronged about him. One crazy woman was led up to him. As soon as she caught sight of the elder she began shrieking and writhing as though in the pains of childbirth. Laying the stole on her forehead, he read a short prayer over her, and she was at once soothed and quieted. I do not know how it may be now, but in my childhood I often happened to see and hear these \u201cpossessed\u201d women in the villages and monasteries. They used to be brought to mass; they would squeal and bark like a dog so that they were heard all over the church. But when the sacrament was carried in and they were led up to it, at once the \u201cpossession\u201d ceased, and the sick women were always soothed for a time. I was greatly impressed and amazed at this as a child; but then I heard from country neighbors and from my town teachers that the whole illness was simulated to avoid work, and that it could always be cured by suitable severity; various anecdotes were told to confirm this. But later on I learnt with astonishment from medical specialists that there is no pretense about it, that it is a terrible illness to which women are subject, specially prevalent among us in Russia, and that it is due to the hard lot of the peasant women. It is a disease, I was told, arising from exhausting toil too soon after hard, abnormal and unassisted labor in childbirth, and from the hopeless misery, from beatings, and so on, which some women were not able to endure like others."], "When Alyosha leaves the monastery, where does he head before going home?": [" It stands over there. Give it me.\u201d Alyosha gave him a little round folding looking\u2010glass which stood on the chest of drawers. The old man looked at himself in it; his nose was considerably swollen, and on the left side of his forehead there was a rather large crimson bruise. \u201cWhat does Ivan say? Alyosha, my dear, my only son, I\u2019m afraid of Ivan. I\u2019m more afraid of Ivan than the other. You\u2019re the only one I\u2019m not afraid of....\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of Ivan either. He is angry, but he\u2019ll defend you.\u201d \u201cAlyosha, and what of the other? He\u2019s run to Grushenka. My angel, tell me the truth, was she here just now or not?\u201d \u201cNo one has seen her. It was a mistake. She has not been here.\u201d \u201cYou know Mitya wants to marry her, to marry her.\u201d \u201cShe won\u2019t marry him.\u201d \u201cShe won\u2019t. She won\u2019t. She won\u2019t. She won\u2019t on any account!\u201d The old man fairly fluttered with joy, as though nothing more comforting could have been said to him. In his delight he seized Alyosha\u2019s hand and pressed it warmly to his heart. Tears positively glittered in his eyes. \u201cThat image of the Mother of God of which I was telling you just now,\u201d he said. \u201cTake it home and keep it for yourself. And I\u2019ll let you go back to the monastery.... I was joking this morning, don\u2019t be angry with me. My head aches, Alyosha.... Alyosha, comfort my heart. Be an angel and tell me the truth!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re still asking whether she has been here or not?\u201d Alyosha said sorrowfully.", " By what will you escape it? That\u2019s impossible with your ideas.\u201d \u201cIn the Karamazov way, again.\u201d \u201c \u2018Everything is lawful,\u2019 you mean? Everything is lawful, is that it?\u201d Ivan scowled, and all at once turned strangely pale. \u201cAh, you\u2019ve caught up yesterday\u2019s phrase, which so offended Mi\u00fcsov\u2014and which Dmitri pounced upon so na\u00efvely, and paraphrased!\u201d he smiled queerly. \u201cYes, if you like, \u2018everything is lawful\u2019 since the word has been said. I won\u2019t deny it. And Mitya\u2019s version isn\u2019t bad.\u201d Alyosha looked at him in silence. \u201cI thought that going away from here I have you at least,\u201d Ivan said suddenly, with unexpected feeling; \u201cbut now I see that there is no place for me even in your heart, my dear hermit. The formula, \u2018all is lawful,\u2019 I won\u2019t renounce\u2014will you renounce me for that, yes?\u201d Alyosha got up, went to him and softly kissed him on the lips. \u201cThat\u2019s plagiarism,\u201d cried Ivan, highly delighted. \u201cYou stole that from my poem. Thank you though. Get up, Alyosha, it\u2019s time we were going, both of us.\u201d They went out, but stopped when they reached the entrance of the restaurant. \u201cListen, Alyosha,\u201d Ivan began in a resolute voice, \u201cif I am really able to care for the sticky little leaves I shall only love them, remembering you. It\u2019s enough for me that you are somewhere here, and I shan\u2019t lose my desire for life yet. Is that enough for you? Take it as a declaration of love if you like. And now you go to the right and I to the left.", " The old man longed for Him to say something, however bitter and terrible. But He suddenly approached the old man in silence and softly kissed him on his bloodless aged lips. That was all His answer. The old man shuddered. His lips moved. He went to the door, opened it, and said to Him: \u2018Go, and come no more ... come not at all, never, never!\u2019 And he let Him out into the dark alleys of the town. The Prisoner went away.\u201d \u201cAnd the old man?\u201d \u201cThe kiss glows in his heart, but the old man adheres to his idea.\u201d \u201cAnd you with him, you too?\u201d cried Alyosha, mournfully. Ivan laughed. \u201cWhy, it\u2019s all nonsense, Alyosha. It\u2019s only a senseless poem of a senseless student, who could never write two lines of verse. Why do you take it so seriously? Surely you don\u2019t suppose I am going straight off to the Jesuits, to join the men who are correcting His work? Good Lord, it\u2019s no business of mine. I told you, all I want is to live on to thirty, and then ... dash the cup to the ground!\u201d \u201cBut the little sticky leaves, and the precious tombs, and the blue sky, and the woman you love! How will you live, how will you love them?\u201d Alyosha cried sorrowfully. \u201cWith such a hell in your heart and your head, how can you? No, that\u2019s just what you are going away for, to join them ... if not, you will kill yourself, you can\u2019t endure it!\u201d \u201cThere is a strength to endure everything,\u201d Ivan said with a cold smile. \u201cWhat strength?\u201d \u201cThe strength of the Karamazovs\u2014the strength of the Karamazov baseness.\u201d \u201cTo sink into debauchery, to stifle your soul with corruption, yes?\u201d \u201cPossibly even that ... only perhaps till I am thirty I shall escape it, and then\u2014\u201d \u201cHow will you escape it?", " \u201cNot a step, not a word!

She\u2019ll go away\u2014she\u2019ll go at once.\u201d At that instant Katerina Ivanovna\u2019s two aunts ran in at her cry, and with them a maid\u2010servant. All hurried to her. \u201cI will go away,\u201d said Grushenka, taking up her mantle from the sofa. \u201cAlyosha, darling, see me home!\u201d \u201cGo away\u2014go away, make haste!\u201d cried Alyosha, clasping his hands imploringly. \u201cDear little Alyosha, see me home!

See me home, dear, you\u2019ll be glad of it afterwards.\u201d Alyosha turned away, wringing his hands. Grushenka ran out of the house, laughing musically. Katerina Ivanovna went into a fit of hysterics. She sobbed, and was shaken with convulsions. Every one fussed round her. \u201cI warned you,\u201d said the elder of her aunts. \u201cI tried to prevent your doing this. You\u2019re too impulsive. How could you do such a thing?

He! He could be so dishonorable, so inhuman!"], "Dimitri aks Alyosha to tell Katerina what?": [" They\u2019ve planned it together, the three of them\u2014Mitya, Katerina, and Ivan Fyodorovitch. Alyosha, I\u2019ve been wanting to ask you a long time. A week ago he suddenly told me that Ivan was in love with Katerina, because he often goes to see her. Did he tell me the truth or not? Tell me, on your conscience, tell me the worst.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t tell you a lie. Ivan is not in love with Katerina Ivanovna, I think.\u201d \u201cOh, that\u2019s what I thought! He is lying to me, shameless deceiver, that\u2019s what it is! And he was jealous of me just now, so as to put the blame on me afterwards. He is stupid, he can\u2019t disguise what he is doing; he is so open, you know.... But I\u2019ll give it to him, I\u2019ll give it to him! \u2018You believe I did it,\u2019 he said. He said that to me, to me. He reproached me with that! God forgive him! You wait, I\u2019ll make it hot for Katerina at the trial! I\u2019ll just say a word then ... I\u2019ll tell everything then!\u201d And again she cried bitterly. \u201cThis I can tell you for certain, Grushenka,\u201d Alyosha said, getting up. \u201cFirst, that he loves you, loves you more than any one in the world, and you only, believe me. I know. I do know. The second thing is that I don\u2019t want to worm his secret out of him, but if he\u2019ll tell me of himself to\u2010 day, I shall tell him straight out that I have promised to tell you. Then I\u2019ll come to you to\u2010day, and tell you. Only ... I fancy ... Katerina Ivanovna has nothing to do with it, and that the secret is about something else.", " \u201cNot a step, not a word!

He was cheerful before, though, indeed, he is cheerful to\u2010day.\u201d \u201cBut you said he was worried.\u201d \u201cYes, he is worried and yet cheerful. He keeps on being irritable for a minute and then cheerful and then irritable again. And you know, Alyosha, I am constantly wondering at him\u2014with this awful thing hanging over him, he sometimes laughs at such trifles as though he were a baby himself.\u201d \u201cAnd did he really tell you not to tell me about Ivan? Did he say, \u2018Don\u2019t tell him\u2019?\u201d \u201cYes, he told me, \u2018Don\u2019t tell him.\u2019 It\u2019s you that Mitya\u2019s most afraid of.

Then it must be so, if you agree. It\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it, Alyosha? That\u2019s the Russian faith all over, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cNo, Smerdyakov has not the Russian faith at all,\u201d said Alyosha firmly and gravely. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about his faith. I mean those two in the desert, only that idea. Surely that\u2019s Russian, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cYes, that\u2019s purely Russian,\u201d said Alyosha smiling. \u201cYour words are worth a gold piece, O ass, and I\u2019ll give it to you to\u2010day. But as to the rest you talk nonsense, nonsense, nonsense. Let me tell you, stupid, that we here are all of little faith, only from carelessness, because we haven\u2019t time; things are too much for us, and, in the second place, the Lord God has given us so little time, only twenty\u2010four hours in the day, so that one hasn\u2019t even time to get sleep enough, much less to repent of one\u2019s sins. While you have denied your faith to your enemies when you\u2019d nothing else to think about but to show your faith! So I consider, brother, that it constitutes a sin.\u201d \u201cConstitute a sin it may, but consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch, that it only extenuates it, if it does constitute. If I had believed then in very truth, as I ought to have believed, then it really would have been sinful if I had not faced tortures for my faith, and had gone over to the pagan Mohammedan faith. But, of course, it wouldn\u2019t have come to torture then, because I should only have had to say at that instant to the mountain, \u2018Move and crush the tormentor,\u2019 and it would have moved and at the very instant have crushed him like a black\u2010beetle, and I should have walked away as though nothing had happened, praising and glorifying God.", " Well, Grigory Vassilyevitch, if I\u2019m without faith and you have so great a faith that you are continually swearing at me, you try yourself telling this mountain, not to move into the sea for that\u2019s a long way off, but even to our stinking little river which runs at the bottom of the garden. You\u2019ll see for yourself that it won\u2019t budge, but will remain just where it is however much you shout at it, and that shows, Grigory Vassilyevitch, that you haven\u2019t faith in the proper manner, and only abuse others about it. Again, taking into consideration that no one in our day, not only you, but actually no one, from the highest person to the lowest peasant, can shove mountains into the sea\u2014except perhaps some one man in the world, or, at most, two, and they most likely are saving their souls in secret somewhere in the Egyptian desert, so you wouldn\u2019t find them\u2014if so it be, if all the rest have no faith, will God curse all the rest? that is, the population of the whole earth, except about two hermits in the desert, and in His well\u2010known mercy will He not forgive one of them? And so I\u2019m persuaded that though I may once have doubted I shall be forgiven if I shed tears of repentance.\u201d \u201cStay!\u201d cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, in a transport of delight. \u201cSo you do suppose there are two who can move mountains? Ivan, make a note of it, write it down. There you have the Russian all over!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re quite right in saying it\u2019s characteristic of the people\u2019s faith,\u201d Ivan assented, with an approving smile.", " Ha ha! I see through you, Mr. Prosecutor. You thought, of course, that I should jump at that, catch at your prompting, and shout with all my might, \u2018Aie! it\u2019s Smerdyakov; he\u2019s the murderer.\u2019 Confess that\u2019s what you thought. Confess, and I\u2019ll go on.\u201d But the prosecutor did not confess. He held his tongue and waited. \u201cYou\u2019re mistaken.

From the very beginning, almost from the moment when I ran out to you from behind the curtain, I\u2019ve had the thought of Smerdyakov in my mind.

In fact, I, too, thought of Smerdyakov just now; but only for a second. Almost at once I thought, \u2018No, it\u2019s not Smerdyakov.\u2019 It\u2019s not his doing, gentlemen.\u201d \u201cIn that case is there anybody else you suspect?\u201d Nikolay Parfenovitch inquired cautiously. \u201cI don\u2019t know any one it could be, whether it\u2019s the hand of Heaven or Satan, but ... not Smerdyakov,\u201d Mitya jerked out with decision. \u201cBut what makes you affirm so confidently and emphatically that it\u2019s not he?\u201d \u201cFrom my conviction\u2014my impression. Because Smerdyakov is a man of the most abject character and a coward. He\u2019s not a coward, he\u2019s the epitome of all the cowardice in the world walking on two legs.", " Ivan, speak, is there a God or not? Stay, speak the truth, speak seriously. Why are you laughing again?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m laughing that you should have made a clever remark just now about Smerdyakov\u2019s belief in the existence of two saints who could move mountains.\u201d \u201cWhy, am I like him now, then?\u201d \u201cVery much.\u201d \u201cWell, that shows I\u2019m a Russian, too, and I have a Russian characteristic. And you may be caught in the same way, though you are a philosopher. Shall I catch you? What do you bet that I\u2019ll catch you to\u2010morrow. Speak, all the same, is there a God, or not? Only, be serious. I want you to be serious now.\u201d \u201cNo, there is no God.\u201d \u201cAlyosha, is there a God?\u201d \u201cThere is.\u201d \u201cIvan, and is there immortality of some sort, just a little, just a tiny bit?\u201d \u201cThere is no immortality either.\u201d \u201cNone at all?\u201d \u201cNone at all.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s absolute nothingness then. Perhaps there is just something? Anything is better than nothing!\u201d \u201cAbsolute nothingness.\u201d \u201cAlyosha, is there immortality?\u201d \u201cThere is.\u201d \u201cGod and immortality?\u201d \u201cGod and immortality. In God is immortality.\u201d \u201cH\u2019m! It\u2019s more likely Ivan\u2019s right. Good Lord! to think what faith, what force of all kinds, man has lavished for nothing, on that dream, and for how many thousand years. Who is it laughing at man? Ivan! For the last time, once for all, is there a God or not? I ask for the last time!\u201d \u201cAnd for the last time there is not.\u201d \u201cWho is laughing at mankind, Ivan?\u201d \u201cIt must be the devil,\u201d said Ivan, smiling."], "Alyosha receives a letter from whom?": [" To which Father Zossima had answered sternly, forbidding her to do so, and saying that to pray for the living as though they were dead was a kind of sorcery. He afterwards forgave her on account of her ignorance, and added, \u201cas though reading the book of the future\u201d (this was Madame Hohlakov\u2019s expression), words of comfort: \u201cthat her son Vassya was certainly alive and he would either come himself very shortly or send a letter, and that she was to go home and expect him.\u201d And \u201cWould you believe it?\u201d exclaimed Madame Hohlakov enthusiastically, \u201cthe prophecy has been fulfilled literally indeed, and more than that.\u201d Scarcely had the old woman reached home when they gave her a letter from Siberia which had been awaiting her. But that was not all; in the letter written on the road from Ekaterinenburg, Vassya informed his mother that he was returning to Russia with an official, and that three weeks after her receiving the letter he hoped \u201cto embrace his mother.\u201d Madame Hohlakov warmly entreated Alyosha to report this new \u201cmiracle of prediction\u201d to the Superior and all the brotherhood. \u201cAll, all, ought to know of it!\u201d she concluded. The letter had been written in haste, the excitement of the writer was apparent in every line of it. But Alyosha had no need to tell the monks, for all knew of it already. Rakitin had commissioned the monk who brought his message \u201cto inform most respectfully his reverence Father Pa\u00efssy, that he, Rakitin, has a matter to speak of with him, of such gravity that he dare not defer it for a moment, and humbly begs forgiveness for his presumption.\u201d As the monk had given the message to Father Pa\u00efssy before that to Alyosha, the latter found after reading the letter, there was nothing left for him to do but to hand it to Father Pa\u00efssy in confirmation of the story.", " It was the letter written by Mitya to Katerina Ivanovna when he was drunk, on the very evening he met Alyosha at the crossroads on the way to the monastery, after the scene at Katerina Ivanovna\u2019s, when Grushenka had insulted her. Then, parting from Alyosha, Mitya had rushed to Grushenka. I don\u2019t know whether he saw her, but in the evening he was at the \u201cMetropolis,\u201d where he got thoroughly drunk. Then he asked for pen and paper and wrote a document of weighty consequences to himself. It was a wordy, disconnected, frantic letter, a drunken letter in fact. It was like the talk of a drunken man, who, on his return home, begins with extraordinary heat telling his wife or one of his household how he has just been insulted, what a rascal had just insulted him, what a fine fellow he is on the other hand, and how he will pay that scoundrel out; and all that at great length, with great excitement and incoherence, with drunken tears and blows on the table. The letter was written on a dirty piece of ordinary paper of the cheapest kind. It had been provided by the tavern and there were figures scrawled on the back of it. There was evidently not space enough for his drunken verbosity and Mitya not only filled the margins but had written the last line right across the rest. The letter ran as follows: FATAL KATYA: To\u2010morrow I will get the money and repay your three thousand and farewell, woman of great wrath, but farewell, too, my love!", " I am a worthless creature,\u201d said Maximov, with tears in his voice. \u201cYou would do better to spend your kindness on people of more use than me.\u201d \u201cEch, every one is of use, Maximushka, and how can we tell who\u2019s of most use? If only that Pole didn\u2019t exist, Alyosha. He\u2019s taken it into his head to fall ill, too, to\u2010day. I\u2019ve been to see him also. And I shall send him some pies, too, on purpose. I hadn\u2019t sent him any, but Mitya accused me of it, so now I shall send some! Ah, here\u2019s Fenya with a letter! Yes, it\u2019s from the Poles\u2014begging again!\u201d Pan Mussyalovitch had indeed sent an extremely long and characteristically eloquent letter in which he begged her to lend him three roubles. In the letter was enclosed a receipt for the sum, with a promise to repay it within three months, signed by Pan Vrublevsky as well. Grushenka had received many such letters, accompanied by such receipts, from her former lover during the fortnight of her convalescence. But she knew that the two Poles had been to ask after her health during her illness. The first letter Grushenka got from them was a long one, written on large notepaper and with a big family crest on the seal. It was so obscure and rhetorical that Grushenka put it down before she had read half, unable to make head or tail of it. She could not attend to letters then. The first letter was followed next day by another in which Pan Mussyalovitch begged her for a loan of two thousand roubles for a very short period.", " But you must find out for me about that horrid boy and tell me all about it, for there\u2019s some mystery in it.

He was cheerful before, though, indeed, he is cheerful to\u2010day.\u201d \u201cBut you said he was worried.\u201d \u201cYes, he is worried and yet cheerful. He keeps on being irritable for a minute and then cheerful and then irritable again. And you know, Alyosha, I am constantly wondering at him\u2014with this awful thing hanging over him, he sometimes laughs at such trifles as though he were a baby himself.\u201d \u201cAnd did he really tell you not to tell me about Ivan? Did he say, \u2018Don\u2019t tell him\u2019?\u201d \u201cYes, he told me, \u2018Don\u2019t tell him.\u2019 It\u2019s you that Mitya\u2019s most afraid of.

I mean even if I don\u2019t go away to\u2010morrow (I think I certainly shall go) and we meet again, don\u2019t say a word more on these subjects. I beg that particularly.

It was just as Dmitri had left Alyosha the day before, though the parting had been very different. The strange resemblance flashed like an arrow through Alyosha\u2019s mind in the distress and dejection of that moment. He waited a little, looking after his brother. He suddenly noticed that Ivan swayed as he walked and that his right shoulder looked lower than his left. He had never noticed it before.", " By the way, how is she now? What happened after I departed?\u201d Alyosha told him she had been hysterical, and that she was now, he heard, unconscious and delirious. \u201cIsn\u2019t Madame Hohlakov laying it on?\u201d \u201cI think not.\u201d \u201cI must find out.

We\u2019ve plenty of time before I go, an eternity!\u201d \u201cIf you are going away to\u2010morrow, what do you mean by an eternity?\u201d \u201cBut what does it matter to us?\u201d laughed Ivan. \u201cWe\u2019ve time enough for our talk, for what brought us here. Why do you look so surprised? Answer: why have we met here? To talk of my love for Katerina Ivanovna, of the old man and Dmitri?", " And how do you know? I may not be going to make it up at all. It\u2019s a stupid expression.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not Karamazov at all; it\u2019s not his doing. Our fellows began going there of themselves. Of course, they went with Karamazov at first. And there\u2019s been nothing of that sort\u2014no silliness. First one went, and then another. His father was awfully pleased to see us. You know he will simply go out of his mind if Ilusha dies. He sees that Ilusha\u2019s dying. And he seems so glad we\u2019ve made it up with Ilusha. Ilusha asked after you, that was all. He just asks and says no more. His father will go out of his mind or hang himself. He behaved like a madman before. You know he is a very decent man. We made a mistake then. It\u2019s all the fault of that murderer who beat him then.\u201d \u201cKaramazov\u2019s a riddle to me all the same. I might have made his acquaintance long ago, but I like to have a proper pride in some cases. Besides, I have a theory about him which I must work out and verify.\u201d Kolya subsided into dignified silence. Smurov, too, was silent. Smurov, of course, worshiped Krassotkin and never dreamed of putting himself on a level with him. Now he was tremendously interested at Kolya\u2019s saying that he was \u201cgoing of himself\u201d to see Ilusha. He felt that there must be some mystery in Kolya\u2019s suddenly taking it into his head to go to him that day. They crossed the market\u2010place, in which at that hour were many loaded wagons from the country and a great number of live fowls."], "What happens to Alyosha when he tries to help a frail boy who is being attacked by bullies?": [" He had not gone three steps before the biggest stone the boy had in his pocket hit him a painful blow in the back. \u201cSo you\u2019ll hit a man from behind! They tell the truth, then, when they say that you attack on the sly,\u201d said Alyosha, turning round again. This time the boy threw a stone savagely right into Alyosha\u2019s face; but Alyosha just had time to guard himself, and the stone struck him on the elbow. \u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed? What have I done to you?\u201d he cried. The boy waited in silent defiance, certain that now Alyosha would attack him. Seeing that even now he would not, his rage was like a little wild beast\u2019s; he flew at Alyosha himself, and before Alyosha had time to move, the spiteful child had seized his left hand with both of his and bit his middle finger. He fixed his teeth in it and it was ten seconds before he let go. Alyosha cried out with pain and pulled his finger away with all his might. The child let go at last and retreated to his former distance. Alyosha\u2019s finger had been badly bitten to the bone, close to the nail; it began to bleed. Alyosha took out his handkerchief and bound it tightly round his injured hand. He was a full minute bandaging it. The boy stood waiting all the time. At last Alyosha raised his gentle eyes and looked at him. \u201cVery well,\u201d he said, \u201cyou see how badly you\u2019ve bitten me. That\u2019s enough, isn\u2019t it? Now tell me, what have I done to you?\u201d The boy stared in amazement.", " He was an undersized weakly boy with a thin pale face, with large dark eyes that gazed at him vindictively. He was dressed in a rather shabby old overcoat, which he had monstrously outgrown. His bare arms stuck out beyond his sleeves. There was a large patch on the right knee of his trousers, and in his right boot just at the toe there was a big hole in the leather, carefully blackened with ink. Both the pockets of his great\u2010coat were weighed down with stones. Alyosha stopped two steps in front of him, looking inquiringly at him. The boy, seeing at once from Alyosha\u2019s eyes that he wouldn\u2019t beat him, became less defiant, and addressed him first. \u201cI am alone, and there are six of them. I\u2019ll beat them all, alone!\u201d he said suddenly, with flashing eyes. \u201cI think one of the stones must have hurt you badly,\u201d observed Alyosha. \u201cBut I hit Smurov on the head!\u201d cried the boy. \u201cThey told me that you know me, and that you threw a stone at me on purpose,\u201d said Alyosha. The boy looked darkly at him. \u201cI don\u2019t know you. Do you know me?\u201d Alyosha continued. \u201cLet me alone!\u201d the boy cried irritably; but he did not move, as though he were expecting something, and again there was a vindictive light in his eyes. \u201cVery well, I am going,\u201d said Alyosha; \u201conly I don\u2019t know you and I don\u2019t tease you. They told me how they tease you, but I don\u2019t want to tease you. Good\u2010by!\u201d \u201cMonk in silk trousers!\u201d cried the boy, following Alyosha with the same vindictive and defiant expression, and he threw himself into an attitude of defense, feeling sure that now Alyosha would fall upon him; but Alyosha turned, looked at him, and walked away.", " \u2018Father,\u2019 he kept crying, \u2018dear father, how he insulted you!\u2019 And I sobbed too. We sat shaking in each other\u2019s arms. \u2018Ilusha,\u2019 I said to him, \u2018Ilusha darling.\u2019 No one saw us then. God alone saw us, I hope He will record it to my credit. You must thank your brother, Alexey Fyodorovitch. No, sir, I won\u2019t thrash my boy for your satisfaction.\u201d He had gone back to his original tone of resentful buffoonery. Alyosha felt though that he trusted him, and that if there had been some one else in his, Alyosha\u2019s place, the man would not have spoken so openly and would not have told what he had just told. This encouraged Alyosha, whose heart was trembling on the verge of tears. \u201cAh, how I would like to make friends with your boy!\u201d he cried. \u201cIf you could arrange it\u2014\u201d \u201cCertainly, sir,\u201d muttered the captain. \u201cBut now listen to something quite different!\u201d Alyosha went on. \u201cI have a message for you. That same brother of mine, Dmitri, has insulted his betrothed, too, a noble\u2010hearted girl of whom you have probably heard. I have a right to tell you of her wrong; I ought to do so, in fact, for hearing of the insult done to you and learning all about your unfortunate position, she commissioned me at once\u2014just now\u2014to bring you this help from her\u2014but only from her alone, not from Dmitri, who has abandoned her. Nor from me, his brother, nor from any one else, but from her, only from her! She entreats you to accept her help.... You have both been insulted by the same man.", " But Smurov, the left\u2010handed boy, needed no telling, and at once revenged himself; he threw a stone, but it missed the boy and hit the ground. The boy the other side of the ditch, the pocket of whose coat was visibly bulging with stones, flung another stone at the group; this time it flew straight at Alyosha and hit him painfully on the shoulder. \u201cHe aimed it at you, he meant it for you. You are Karamazov, Karamazov!\u201d the boys shouted, laughing. \u201cCome, all throw at him at once!\u201d and six stones flew at the boy. One struck the boy on the head and he fell down, but at once leapt up and began ferociously returning their fire. Both sides threw stones incessantly. Many of the group had their pockets full too. \u201cWhat are you about! Aren\u2019t you ashamed? Six against one! Why, you\u2019ll kill him,\u201d cried Alyosha. He ran forward and met the flying stones to screen the solitary boy. Three or four ceased throwing for a minute. \u201cHe began first!\u201d cried a boy in a red shirt in an angry childish voice. \u201cHe is a beast, he stabbed Krassotkin in class the other day with a penknife. It bled. Krassotkin wouldn\u2019t tell tales, but he must be thrashed.\u201d \u201cBut what for? I suppose you tease him.\u201d \u201cThere, he sent a stone in your back again, he knows you,\u201d cried the children. \u201cIt\u2019s you he is throwing at now, not us.

That\u2019s not his character, he tells us, he couldn\u2019t have had such feelings. But yet he talked himself of the broad Karamazov nature; he cried out about the two extremes which a Karamazov can contemplate at once. Karamazov is just such a two\u2010sided nature, fluctuating between two extremes, that even when moved by the most violent craving for riotous gayety, he can pull himself up, if something strikes him on the other side. And on the other side is love\u2014that new love which had flamed up in his heart, and for that love he needed money; oh, far more than for carousing with his mistress. If she were to say to him, \u2018I am yours, I won\u2019t have Fyodor Pavlovitch,\u2019 then he must have money to take her away. That was more important than carousing. Could a Karamazov fail to understand it? That anxiety was just what he was suffering from\u2014what is there improbable in his laying aside that money and concealing it in case of emergency? \u201cBut time passed, and Fyodor Pavlovitch did not give the prisoner the expected three thousand; on the contrary, the latter heard that he meant to use this sum to seduce the woman he, the prisoner, loved. \u2018If Fyodor Pavlovitch doesn\u2019t give the money,\u2019 he thought, \u2018I shall be put in the position of a thief before Katerina Ivanovna.\u2019 And then the idea presented itself to him that he would go to Katerina Ivanovna, lay before her the fifteen hundred roubles he still carried round his neck, and say, \u2018I am a scoundrel, but not a thief.\u2019 So here we have already a twofold reason why he should guard that sum of money as the apple of his eye, why he shouldn\u2019t unpick the little bag, and spend it a hundred at a time.", " Is that so or not, Grigory Vassilyevitch?\u201d He addressed Grigory with obvious satisfaction, though he was really answering Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s questions, and was well aware of it, and intentionally pretending that Grigory had asked the questions. \u201cIvan,\u201d cried Fyodor Pavlovitch suddenly, \u201cstoop down for me to whisper.

He was watching Smerdyakov with great curiosity. \u201cYou\u2019re anathema accursed, as it is,\u201d Grigory suddenly burst out, \u201cand how dare you argue, you rascal, after that, if\u2014\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t scold him, Grigory, don\u2019t scold him,\u201d Fyodor Pavlovitch cut him short. \u201cYou should wait, Grigory Vassilyevitch, if only a short time, and listen, for I haven\u2019t finished all I had to say. For at the very moment I become accursed, at that same highest moment, I become exactly like a heathen, and my christening is taken off me and becomes of no avail. Isn\u2019t that so?\u201d \u201cMake haste and finish, my boy,\u201d Fyodor Pavlovitch urged him, sipping from his wine\u2010glass with relish.", " Come up, Alyosha, and you, Ivan Fyodorovitch, you must come back, you must. Do you hear?\u201d There was such a peremptory note in Katya\u2019s voice that Ivan, after a moment\u2019s hesitation, made up his mind to go back with Alyosha. \u201cShe was listening,\u201d he murmured angrily to himself, but Alyosha heard it. \u201cExcuse my keeping my greatcoat on,\u201d said Ivan, going into the drawing\u2010 room. \u201cI won\u2019t sit down. I won\u2019t stay more than a minute.\u201d \u201cSit down, Alexey Fyodorovitch,\u201d said Katerina Ivanovna, though she remained standing. She had changed very little during this time, but there was an ominous gleam in her dark eyes. Alyosha remembered afterwards that she had struck him as particularly handsome at that moment. \u201cWhat did he ask you to tell me?\u201d \u201cOnly one thing,\u201d said Alyosha, looking her straight in the face, \u201cthat you would spare yourself and say nothing at the trial of what\u201d (he was a little confused) \u201c... passed between you ... at the time of your first acquaintance ... in that town.\u201d \u201cAh! that I bowed down to the ground for that money!\u201d She broke into a bitter laugh. \u201cWhy, is he afraid for me or for himself? He asks me to spare\u2014whom? Him or myself? Tell me, Alexey Fyodorovitch!\u201d Alyosha watched her intently, trying to understand her. \u201cBoth yourself and him,\u201d he answered softly. \u201cI am glad to hear it,\u201d she snapped out maliciously, and she suddenly blushed. \u201cYou don\u2019t know me yet, Alexey Fyodorovitch,\u201d she said menacingly.", " Go, run after him....\u201d Alyosha jumped up and ran after Ivan, who was not fifty paces ahead of him. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d He turned quickly on Alyosha, seeing that he was running after him. \u201cShe told you to catch me up, because I\u2019m mad. I know it all by heart,\u201d he added irritably. \u201cShe is mistaken, of course; but she is right that you are ill,\u201d said Alyosha. \u201cI was looking at your face just now. You look very ill, Ivan.\u201d Ivan walked on without stopping. Alyosha followed him. \u201cAnd do you know, Alexey Fyodorovitch, how people do go out of their mind?\u201d Ivan asked in a voice suddenly quiet, without a trace of irritation, with a note of the simplest curiosity. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I suppose there are all kinds of insanity.\u201d \u201cAnd can one observe that one\u2019s going mad oneself?\u201d \u201cI imagine one can\u2019t see oneself clearly in such circumstances,\u201d Alyosha answered with surprise. Ivan paused for half a minute. \u201cIf you want to talk to me, please change the subject,\u201d he said suddenly. \u201cOh, while I think of it, I have a letter for you,\u201d said Alyosha timidly, and he took Lise\u2019s note from his pocket and held it out to Ivan. They were just under a lamp\u2010post. Ivan recognized the handwriting at once. \u201cAh, from that little demon!\u201d he laughed maliciously, and, without opening the envelope, he tore it into bits and threw it in the air. The bits were scattered by the wind. \u201cShe\u2019s not sixteen yet, I believe, and already offering herself,\u201d he said contemptuously, striding along the street again."], "Alyosha tries to convince Katerina to recognize her love for whom?": [" They\u2019ve planned it together, the three of them\u2014Mitya, Katerina, and Ivan Fyodorovitch. Alyosha, I\u2019ve been wanting to ask you a long time. A week ago he suddenly told me that Ivan was in love with Katerina, because he often goes to see her. Did he tell me the truth or not? Tell me, on your conscience, tell me the worst.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t tell you a lie. Ivan is not in love with Katerina Ivanovna, I think.\u201d \u201cOh, that\u2019s what I thought! He is lying to me, shameless deceiver, that\u2019s what it is! And he was jealous of me just now, so as to put the blame on me afterwards. He is stupid, he can\u2019t disguise what he is doing; he is so open, you know.... But I\u2019ll give it to him, I\u2019ll give it to him! \u2018You believe I did it,\u2019 he said. He said that to me, to me. He reproached me with that! God forgive him! You wait, I\u2019ll make it hot for Katerina at the trial! I\u2019ll just say a word then ... I\u2019ll tell everything then!\u201d And again she cried bitterly. \u201cThis I can tell you for certain, Grushenka,\u201d Alyosha said, getting up. \u201cFirst, that he loves you, loves you more than any one in the world, and you only, believe me. I know. I do know. The second thing is that I don\u2019t want to worm his secret out of him, but if he\u2019ll tell me of himself to\u2010 day, I shall tell him straight out that I have promised to tell you. Then I\u2019ll come to you to\u2010day, and tell you. Only ... I fancy ... Katerina Ivanovna has nothing to do with it, and that the secret is about something else.", " \u201cWhat I see is that perhaps you don\u2019t love Dmitri at all ... and never have, from the beginning.... And Dmitri, too, has never loved you ... and only esteems you.... I really don\u2019t know how I dare to say all this, but somebody must tell the truth ... for nobody here will tell the truth.\u201d \u201cWhat truth?\u201d cried Katerina Ivanovna, and there was an hysterical ring in her voice. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you,\u201d Alyosha went on with desperate haste, as though he were jumping from the top of a house. \u201cCall Dmitri; I will fetch him\u2014and let him come here and take your hand and take Ivan\u2019s and join your hands. For you\u2019re torturing Ivan, simply because you love him\u2014and torturing him, because you love Dmitri through \u2018self\u2010laceration\u2019\u2014with an unreal love\u2014because you\u2019ve persuaded yourself.\u201d Alyosha broke off and was silent. \u201cYou ... you ... you are a little religious idiot\u2014that\u2019s what you are!\u201d Katerina Ivanovna snapped. Her face was white and her lips were moving with anger. Ivan suddenly laughed and got up. His hat was in his hand. \u201cYou are mistaken, my good Alyosha,\u201d he said, with an expression Alyosha had never seen in his face before\u2014an expression of youthful sincerity and strong, irresistibly frank feeling. \u201cKaterina Ivanovna has never cared for me! She has known all the time that I cared for her\u2014though I never said a word of my love to her\u2014she knew, but she didn\u2019t care for me. I have never been her friend either, not for one moment; she is too proud to need my friendship.", " It\u2019s appalling! I\u2019ll go in with you, and if they don\u2019t turn me out, I\u2019ll stay to the end.\u201d Chapter V. A Laceration In The Drawing\u2010Room But in the drawing\u2010room the conversation was already over. Katerina Ivanovna was greatly excited, though she looked resolute. At the moment Alyosha and Madame Hohlakov entered, Ivan Fyodorovitch stood up to take leave. His face was rather pale, and Alyosha looked at him anxiously. For this moment was to solve a doubt, a harassing enigma which had for some time haunted Alyosha. During the preceding month it had been several times suggested to him that his brother Ivan was in love with Katerina Ivanovna, and, what was more, that he meant \u201cto carry her off\u201d from Dmitri. Until quite lately the idea seemed to Alyosha monstrous, though it worried him extremely. He loved both his brothers, and dreaded such rivalry between them. Meantime, Dmitri had said outright on the previous day that he was glad that Ivan was his rival, and that it was a great assistance to him, Dmitri. In what way did it assist him? To marry Grushenka? But that Alyosha considered the worst thing possible. Besides all this, Alyosha had till the evening before implicitly believed that Katerina Ivanovna had a steadfast and passionate love for Dmitri; but he had only believed it till the evening before. He had fancied, too, that she was incapable of loving a man like Ivan, and that she did love Dmitri, and loved him just as he was, in spite of all the strangeness of such a passion.", " You despise me. You have come to me and despised me in my own house.\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019m going away. You\u2019ve had too much brandy.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve begged you for Christ\u2019s sake to go to Tchermashnya for a day or two, and you don\u2019t go.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll go to\u2010morrow if you\u2019re so set upon it.\u201d \u201cYou won\u2019t go. You want to keep an eye on me. That\u2019s what you want, spiteful fellow. That\u2019s why you won\u2019t go.\u201d The old man persisted. He had reached that state of drunkenness when the drunkard who has till then been inoffensive tries to pick a quarrel and to assert himself. \u201cWhy are you looking at me? Why do you look like that? Your eyes look at me and say, \u2018You ugly drunkard!\u2019 Your eyes are mistrustful. They\u2019re contemptuous.... You\u2019ve come here with some design. Alyosha, here, looks at me and his eyes shine. Alyosha doesn\u2019t despise me. Alexey, you mustn\u2019t love Ivan.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be ill\u2010tempered with my brother. Leave off attacking him,\u201d Alyosha said emphatically. \u201cOh, all right. Ugh, my head aches. Take away the brandy, Ivan. It\u2019s the third time I\u2019ve told you.\u201d He mused, and suddenly a slow, cunning grin spread over his face. \u201cDon\u2019t be angry with a feeble old man, Ivan. I know you don\u2019t love me, but don\u2019t be angry all the same. You\u2019ve nothing to love me for. You go to Tchermashnya. I\u2019ll come to you myself and bring you a present. I\u2019ll show you a little wench there. I\u2019ve had my eye on her a long time. She\u2019s still running about bare\u2010foot."], "Katerina tries to send money to whom?": [" She spoke softly but clearly, so that she was heard all over the court. She expressed herself with composure, or at least tried to appear composed. The President began his examination discreetly and very respectfully, as though afraid to touch on \u201ccertain chords,\u201d and showing consideration for her great unhappiness. But in answer to one of the first questions Katerina Ivanovna replied firmly that she had been formerly betrothed to the prisoner, \u201cuntil he left me of his own accord...\u201d she added quietly. When they asked her about the three thousand she had entrusted to Mitya to post to her relations, she said firmly, \u201cI didn\u2019t give him the money simply to send it off. I felt at the time that he was in great need of money.... I gave him the three thousand on the understanding that he should post it within the month if he cared to. There was no need for him to worry himself about that debt afterwards.\u201d I will not repeat all the questions asked her and all her answers in detail. I will only give the substance of her evidence. \u201cI was firmly convinced that he would send off that sum as soon as he got money from his father,\u201d she went on. \u201cI have never doubted his disinterestedness and his honesty ... his scrupulous honesty ... in money matters. He felt quite certain that he would receive the money from his father, and spoke to me several times about it. I knew he had a feud with his father and have always believed that he had been unfairly treated by his father.", " I said I had sent the money and would bring the receipt, and so far I haven\u2019t brought it. I\u2019ve forgotten it. Now what do you think you\u2019re going to her to\u2010day to say? \u2018He sends his compliments,\u2019 and she\u2019ll ask you, \u2018What about the money?\u2019 You might still have said to her, \u2018He\u2019s a degraded sensualist, and a low creature, with uncontrolled passions. He didn\u2019t send your money then, but wasted it, because, like a low brute, he couldn\u2019t control himself.\u2019 But still you might have added, \u2018He isn\u2019t a thief though. Here is your three thousand; he sends it back. Send it yourself to Agafya Ivanovna. But he told me to say \u201che sends his compliments.\u201d \u2019 But, as it is, she will ask, \u2018But where is the money?\u2019 \u201d \u201cMitya, you are unhappy, yes! But not as unhappy as you think. Don\u2019t worry yourself to death with despair.\u201d \u201cWhat, do you suppose I\u2019d shoot myself because I can\u2019t get three thousand to pay back? That\u2019s just it. I shan\u2019t shoot myself. I haven\u2019t the strength now. Afterwards, perhaps. But now I\u2019m going to Grushenka. I don\u2019t care what happens.\u201d \u201cAnd what then?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be her husband if she deigns to have me, and when lovers come, I\u2019ll go into the next room. I\u2019ll clean her friends\u2019 goloshes, blow up their samovar, run their errands.\u201d \u201cKaterina Ivanovna will understand it all,\u201d Alyosha said solemnly. \u201cShe\u2019ll understand how great this trouble is and will forgive. She has a lofty mind, and no one could be more unhappy than you.", " Oo! what a coincidence! Why was I waiting for you? Hungering and thirsting for you in every cranny of my soul and even in my ribs? Why, to send you to father and to her, Katerina Ivanovna, so as to have done with her and with father. To send an angel. I might have sent any one, but I wanted to send an angel. And here you are on your way to see father and her.\u201d \u201cDid you really mean to send me?\u201d cried Alyosha with a distressed expression. \u201cStay! You knew it! And I see you understand it all at once. But be quiet, be quiet for a time. Don\u2019t be sorry, and don\u2019t cry.\u201d Dmitri stood up, thought a moment, and put his finger to his forehead. \u201cShe\u2019s asked you, written to you a letter or something, that\u2019s why you\u2019re going to her? You wouldn\u2019t be going except for that?\u201d \u201cHere is her note.\u201d Alyosha took it out of his pocket. Mitya looked through it quickly. \u201cAnd you were going the back\u2010way! Oh, gods, I thank you for sending him by the back\u2010way, and he came to me like the golden fish to the silly old fishermen in the fable! Listen, Alyosha, listen, brother! Now I mean to tell you everything, for I must tell some one. An angel in heaven I\u2019ve told already; but I want to tell an angel on earth. You are an angel on earth. You will hear and judge and forgive. And that\u2019s what I need, that some one above me should forgive. Listen! If two people break away from everything on earth and fly off into the unknown, or at least one of them, and before flying off or going to ruin he comes to some one else and says, \u2018Do this for me\u2019\u2014some favor never asked before that could only be asked on one\u2019s deathbed\u2014would that other refuse, if he were a friend or a brother?\u201d \u201cI will do it, but tell me what it is, and make haste,\u201d said Alyosha.", " If she were to say to him: \u201cI\u2019m yours; take me away,\u201d how could he take her away? Where had he the means, the money to do it? It was just at this time that all sources of revenue from Fyodor Pavlovitch, doles which had gone on without interruption for so many years, ceased. Grushenka had money, of course, but with regard to this Mitya suddenly evinced extraordinary pride; he wanted to carry her away and begin the new life with her himself, at his own expense, not at hers. He could not conceive of taking her money, and the very idea caused him a pang of intense repulsion. I won\u2019t enlarge on this fact or analyze it here, but confine myself to remarking that this was his attitude at the moment. All this may have arisen indirectly and unconsciously from the secret stings of his conscience for the money of Katerina Ivanovna that he had dishonestly appropriated. \u201cI\u2019ve been a scoundrel to one of them, and I shall be a scoundrel again to the other directly,\u201d was his feeling then, as he explained after: \u201cand when Grushenka knows, she won\u2019t care for such a scoundrel.\u201d Where then was he to get the means, where was he to get the fateful money? Without it, all would be lost and nothing could be done, \u201cand only because I hadn\u2019t the money. Oh, the shame of it!\u201d To anticipate things: he did, perhaps, know where to get the money, knew, perhaps, where it lay at that moment. I will say no more of this here, as it will all be clear later."], "Alyosha begins to plan a marriage with whom?": [" Again he saw that coffin before him, the hidden dead figure so precious to him, but the weeping and poignant grief of the morning was no longer aching in his soul. As soon as he came in, he fell down before the coffin as before a holy shrine, but joy, joy was glowing in his mind and in his heart. The one window of the cell was open, the air was fresh and cool. \u201cSo the smell must have become stronger, if they opened the window,\u201d thought Alyosha. But even this thought of the smell of corruption, which had seemed to him so awful and humiliating a few hours before, no longer made him feel miserable or indignant. He began quietly praying, but he soon felt that he was praying almost mechanically. Fragments of thought floated through his soul, flashed like stars and went out again at once, to be succeeded by others. But yet there was reigning in his soul a sense of the wholeness of things\u2014something steadfast and comforting\u2014and he was aware of it himself. Sometimes he began praying ardently, he longed to pour out his thankfulness and love.... But when he had begun to pray, he passed suddenly to something else, and sank into thought, forgetting both the prayer and what had interrupted it. He began listening to what Father Pa\u00efssy was reading, but worn out with exhaustion he gradually began to doze. \u201c_And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee;_\u201d read Father Pa\u00efssy. \u201c_And the mother of Jesus was there; And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage._\u201d \u201cMarriage?", " Chapter II. Smerdyakov With A Guitar He had no time to lose indeed. Even while he was saying good\u2010by to Lise, the thought had struck him that he must attempt some stratagem to find his brother Dmitri, who was evidently keeping out of his way. It was getting late, nearly three o\u2019clock. Alyosha\u2019s whole soul turned to the monastery, to his dying saint, but the necessity of seeing Dmitri outweighed everything. The conviction that a great inevitable catastrophe was about to happen grew stronger in Alyosha\u2019s mind with every hour. What that catastrophe was, and what he would say at that moment to his brother, he could perhaps not have said definitely. \u201cEven if my benefactor must die without me, anyway I won\u2019t have to reproach myself all my life with the thought that I might have saved something and did not, but passed by and hastened home. If I do as I intend, I shall be following his great precept.\u201d His plan was to catch his brother Dmitri unawares, to climb over the fence, as he had the day before, get into the garden and sit in the summer\u2010house. If Dmitri were not there, thought Alyosha, he would not announce himself to Foma or the women of the house, but would remain hidden in the summer\u2010house, even if he had to wait there till evening. If, as before, Dmitri were lying in wait for Grushenka to come, he would be very likely to come to the summer\u2010house. Alyosha did not, however, give much thought to the details of his plan, but resolved to act upon it, even if it meant not getting back to the monastery that day.", " But this time he had specially urgent business, and he foresaw how difficult it would be to approach the subject, yet he was in great haste. He had another engagement that could not be put off for that same morning, and there was need of haste. They had been talking for a quarter of an hour. Katerina Ivanovna was pale and terribly fatigued, yet at the same time in a state of hysterical excitement. She had a presentiment of the reason why Alyosha had come to her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about his decision,\u201d she said, with confident emphasis to Alyosha. \u201cOne way or another he is bound to come to it. He must escape. That unhappy man, that hero of honor and principle\u2014not he, not Dmitri Fyodorovitch, but the man lying the other side of that door, who has sacrificed himself for his brother,\u201d Katya added, with flashing eyes\u2014\u201ctold me the whole plan of escape long ago. You know he has already entered into negotiations.... I\u2019ve told you something already.... You see, it will probably come off at the third _\u00e9tape_ from here, when the party of prisoners is being taken to Siberia. Oh, it\u2019s a long way off yet. Ivan Fyodorovitch has already visited the superintendent of the third _\u00e9tape_. But we don\u2019t know yet who will be in charge of the party, and it\u2019s impossible to find that out so long beforehand. To\u2010morrow perhaps I will show you in detail the whole plan which Ivan Fyodorovitch left me on the eve of the trial in case of need.... That was when\u2014do you remember?\u2014you found us quarreling.", " I dare say they won\u2019t recognize us. And if they do, let them send us to Siberia. I don\u2019t care. It will show it\u2019s our fate. We\u2019ll work on the land here, too, somewhere in the wilds, and I\u2019ll make up as an American all my life. But we shall die on our own soil. That\u2019s my plan, and it shan\u2019t be altered. Do you approve?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Alyosha, not wanting to contradict him. Mitya paused for a minute and said suddenly: \u201cAnd how they worked it up at the trial! Didn\u2019t they work it up!\u201d \u201cIf they had not, you would have been convicted just the same,\u201d said Alyosha, with a sigh. \u201cYes, people are sick of me here! God bless them, but it\u2019s hard,\u201d Mitya moaned miserably. Again there was silence for a minute. \u201cAlyosha, put me out of my misery at once!\u201d he exclaimed suddenly. \u201cTell me, is she coming now, or not? Tell me? What did she say? How did she say it?\u201d \u201cShe said she would come, but I don\u2019t know whether she will come to\u2010day. It\u2019s hard for her, you know,\u201d Alyosha looked timidly at his brother. \u201cI should think it is hard for her! Alyosha, it will drive me out of my mind. Grusha keeps looking at me. She understands. My God, calm my heart: what is it I want? I want Katya! Do I understand what I want? It\u2019s the headstrong, evil Karamazov spirit! No, I am not fit for suffering. I am a scoundrel, that\u2019s all one can say.\u201d \u201cHere she is!\u201d cried Alyosha. At that instant Katya appeared in the doorway. For a moment she stood still, gazing at Mitya with a dazed expression."], "Alyosha decides to help Dmitri, but he would much rather visit whom?": [" \u201cIt was so, too; it was not a matter of guessing. But didn\u2019t you fancy then that what I wished was just that \u2018one reptile should devour another\u2019; that is, just that Dmitri should kill father, and as soon as possible ... and that I myself was even prepared to help to bring that about?\u201d Alyosha turned rather pale, and looked silently into his brother\u2019s face. \u201cSpeak!\u201d cried Ivan, \u201cI want above everything to know what you thought then. I want the truth, the truth!\u201d He drew a deep breath, looking angrily at Alyosha before his answer came. \u201cForgive me, I did think that, too, at the time,\u201d whispered Alyosha, and he did not add one softening phrase. \u201cThanks,\u201d snapped Ivan, and, leaving Alyosha, he went quickly on his way. From that time Alyosha noticed that Ivan began obviously to avoid him and seemed even to have taken a dislike to him, so much so that Alyosha gave up going to see him. Immediately after that meeting with him, Ivan had not gone home, but went straight to Smerdyakov again. Chapter VII. The Second Visit To Smerdyakov By that time Smerdyakov had been discharged from the hospital. Ivan knew his new lodging, the dilapidated little wooden house, divided in two by a passage on one side of which lived Marya Kondratyevna and her mother, and on the other, Smerdyakov. No one knew on what terms he lived with them, whether as a friend or as a lodger. It was supposed afterwards that he had come to stay with them as Marya Kondratyevna\u2019s betrothed, and was living there for a time without paying for board or lodging.", " Seeing this, Dmitri uttered a scream rather than a shout and rushed at Grigory. \u201cThen she\u2019s there! She\u2019s hidden there! Out of the way, scoundrel!\u201d He tried to pull Grigory away, but the old servant pushed him back. Beside himself with fury, Dmitri struck out, and hit Grigory with all his might. The old man fell like a log, and Dmitri, leaping over him, broke in the door. Smerdyakov remained pale and trembling at the other end of the room, huddling close to Fyodor Pavlovitch. \u201cShe\u2019s here!\u201d shouted Dmitri. \u201cI saw her turn towards the house just now, but I couldn\u2019t catch her. Where is she? Where is she?\u201d That shout, \u201cShe\u2019s here!\u201d produced an indescribable effect on Fyodor Pavlovitch. All his terror left him. \u201cHold him! Hold him!\u201d he cried, and dashed after Dmitri. Meanwhile Grigory had got up from the floor, but still seemed stunned. Ivan and Alyosha ran after their father. In the third room something was heard to fall on the floor with a ringing crash: it was a large glass vase\u2014not an expensive one\u2014on a marble pedestal which Dmitri had upset as he ran past it. \u201cAt him!\u201d shouted the old man. \u201cHelp!\u201d Ivan and Alyosha caught the old man and were forcibly bringing him back. \u201cWhy do you run after him? He\u2019ll murder you outright,\u201d Ivan cried wrathfully at his father. \u201cIvan! Alyosha! She must be here. Grushenka\u2019s here. He said he saw her himself, running.\u201d He was choking. He was not expecting Grushenka at the time, and the sudden news that she was here made him beside himself.", " It\u2019s appalling! I\u2019ll go in with you, and if they don\u2019t turn me out, I\u2019ll stay to the end.\u201d Chapter V. A Laceration In The Drawing\u2010Room But in the drawing\u2010room the conversation was already over. Katerina Ivanovna was greatly excited, though she looked resolute. At the moment Alyosha and Madame Hohlakov entered, Ivan Fyodorovitch stood up to take leave. His face was rather pale, and Alyosha looked at him anxiously. For this moment was to solve a doubt, a harassing enigma which had for some time haunted Alyosha. During the preceding month it had been several times suggested to him that his brother Ivan was in love with Katerina Ivanovna, and, what was more, that he meant \u201cto carry her off\u201d from Dmitri. Until quite lately the idea seemed to Alyosha monstrous, though it worried him extremely. He loved both his brothers, and dreaded such rivalry between them. Meantime, Dmitri had said outright on the previous day that he was glad that Ivan was his rival, and that it was a great assistance to him, Dmitri. In what way did it assist him? To marry Grushenka? But that Alyosha considered the worst thing possible. Besides all this, Alyosha had till the evening before implicitly believed that Katerina Ivanovna had a steadfast and passionate love for Dmitri; but he had only believed it till the evening before. He had fancied, too, that she was incapable of loving a man like Ivan, and that she did love Dmitri, and loved him just as he was, in spite of all the strangeness of such a passion.", " \u2018Father,\u2019 he kept crying, \u2018dear father, how he insulted you!\u2019 And I sobbed too. We sat shaking in each other\u2019s arms. \u2018Ilusha,\u2019 I said to him, \u2018Ilusha darling.\u2019 No one saw us then. God alone saw us, I hope He will record it to my credit. You must thank your brother, Alexey Fyodorovitch. No, sir, I won\u2019t thrash my boy for your satisfaction.\u201d He had gone back to his original tone of resentful buffoonery. Alyosha felt though that he trusted him, and that if there had been some one else in his, Alyosha\u2019s place, the man would not have spoken so openly and would not have told what he had just told. This encouraged Alyosha, whose heart was trembling on the verge of tears. \u201cAh, how I would like to make friends with your boy!\u201d he cried. \u201cIf you could arrange it\u2014\u201d \u201cCertainly, sir,\u201d muttered the captain. \u201cBut now listen to something quite different!\u201d Alyosha went on. \u201cI have a message for you. That same brother of mine, Dmitri, has insulted his betrothed, too, a noble\u2010hearted girl of whom you have probably heard. I have a right to tell you of her wrong; I ought to do so, in fact, for hearing of the insult done to you and learning all about your unfortunate position, she commissioned me at once\u2014just now\u2014to bring you this help from her\u2014but only from her alone, not from Dmitri, who has abandoned her. Nor from me, his brother, nor from any one else, but from her, only from her! She entreats you to accept her help.... You have both been insulted by the same man."], "At the restaurant, what does Ivan say about his responsibility to Fyodor and Dmitri?": [" On the other hand, Ivan Fyodorovitch sent me first thing this morning to your brother\u2019s lodging in Lake Street, without a letter, but with a message to Dmitri Fyodorovitch to go to dine with him at the restaurant here, in the market\u2010place. I went, but didn\u2019t find Dmitri Fyodorovitch at home, though it was eight o\u2019clock. \u2018He\u2019s been here, but he is quite gone,\u2019 those were the very words of his landlady. It\u2019s as though there was an understanding between them. Perhaps at this moment he is in the restaurant with Ivan Fyodorovitch, for Ivan Fyodorovitch has not been home to dinner and Fyodor Pavlovitch dined alone an hour ago, and is gone to lie down. But I beg you most particularly not to speak of me and of what I have told you, for he\u2019d kill me for nothing at all.\u201d \u201cBrother Ivan invited Dmitri to the restaurant to\u2010day?\u201d repeated Alyosha quickly. \u201cThat\u2019s so.\u201d \u201cThe Metropolis tavern in the market\u2010place?\u201d \u201cThe very same.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s quite likely,\u201d cried Alyosha, much excited. \u201cThank you, Smerdyakov; that\u2019s important. I\u2019ll go there at once.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t betray me,\u201d Smerdyakov called after him. \u201cOh, no, I\u2019ll go to the tavern as though by chance. Don\u2019t be anxious.\u201d \u201cBut wait a minute, I\u2019ll open the gate to you,\u201d cried Marya Kondratyevna. \u201cNo; it\u2019s a short cut, I\u2019ll get over the fence again.\u201d What he had heard threw Alyosha into great agitation. He ran to the tavern. It was impossible for him to go into the tavern in his monastic dress, but he could inquire at the entrance for his brothers and call them down.", " He was trembling all over. He seemed frantic. \u201cBut you\u2019ve seen for yourself that she hasn\u2019t come,\u201d cried Ivan. \u201cBut she may have come by that other entrance.\u201d \u201cYou know that entrance is locked, and you have the key.\u201d Dmitri suddenly reappeared in the drawing\u2010room. He had, of course, found the other entrance locked, and the key actually was in Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s pocket. The windows of all the rooms were also closed, so Grushenka could not have come in anywhere nor have run out anywhere. \u201cHold him!\u201d shrieked Fyodor Pavlovitch, as soon as he saw him again. \u201cHe\u2019s been stealing money in my bedroom.\u201d And tearing himself from Ivan he rushed again at Dmitri. But Dmitri threw up both hands and suddenly clutched the old man by the two tufts of hair that remained on his temples, tugged at them, and flung him with a crash on the floor. He kicked him two or three times with his heel in the face. The old man moaned shrilly. Ivan, though not so strong as Dmitri, threw his arms round him, and with all his might pulled him away. Alyosha helped him with his slender strength, holding Dmitri in front. \u201cMadman! You\u2019ve killed him!\u201d cried Ivan. \u201cServe him right!\u201d shouted Dmitri breathlessly. \u201cIf I haven\u2019t killed him, I\u2019ll come again and kill him. You can\u2019t protect him!\u201d \u201cDmitri! Go away at once!\u201d cried Alyosha commandingly. \u201cAlexey! You tell me. It\u2019s only you I can believe; was she here just now, or not?", " Seeing this, Dmitri uttered a scream rather than a shout and rushed at Grigory. \u201cThen she\u2019s there! She\u2019s hidden there! Out of the way, scoundrel!\u201d He tried to pull Grigory away, but the old servant pushed him back. Beside himself with fury, Dmitri struck out, and hit Grigory with all his might. The old man fell like a log, and Dmitri, leaping over him, broke in the door. Smerdyakov remained pale and trembling at the other end of the room, huddling close to Fyodor Pavlovitch. \u201cShe\u2019s here!\u201d shouted Dmitri. \u201cI saw her turn towards the house just now, but I couldn\u2019t catch her. Where is she? Where is she?\u201d That shout, \u201cShe\u2019s here!\u201d produced an indescribable effect on Fyodor Pavlovitch. All his terror left him. \u201cHold him! Hold him!\u201d he cried, and dashed after Dmitri. Meanwhile Grigory had got up from the floor, but still seemed stunned. Ivan and Alyosha ran after their father. In the third room something was heard to fall on the floor with a ringing crash: it was a large glass vase\u2014not an expensive one\u2014on a marble pedestal which Dmitri had upset as he ran past it. \u201cAt him!\u201d shouted the old man. \u201cHelp!\u201d Ivan and Alyosha caught the old man and were forcibly bringing him back. \u201cWhy do you run after him? He\u2019ll murder you outright,\u201d Ivan cried wrathfully at his father. \u201cIvan! Alyosha! She must be here. Grushenka\u2019s here. He said he saw her himself, running.\u201d He was choking. He was not expecting Grushenka at the time, and the sudden news that she was here made him beside himself.", " By what will you escape it? That\u2019s impossible with your ideas.\u201d \u201cIn the Karamazov way, again.\u201d \u201c \u2018Everything is lawful,\u2019 you mean? Everything is lawful, is that it?\u201d Ivan scowled, and all at once turned strangely pale. \u201cAh, you\u2019ve caught up yesterday\u2019s phrase, which so offended Mi\u00fcsov\u2014and which Dmitri pounced upon so na\u00efvely, and paraphrased!\u201d he smiled queerly. \u201cYes, if you like, \u2018everything is lawful\u2019 since the word has been said. I won\u2019t deny it. And Mitya\u2019s version isn\u2019t bad.\u201d Alyosha looked at him in silence. \u201cI thought that going away from here I have you at least,\u201d Ivan said suddenly, with unexpected feeling; \u201cbut now I see that there is no place for me even in your heart, my dear hermit. The formula, \u2018all is lawful,\u2019 I won\u2019t renounce\u2014will you renounce me for that, yes?\u201d Alyosha got up, went to him and softly kissed him on the lips. \u201cThat\u2019s plagiarism,\u201d cried Ivan, highly delighted. \u201cYou stole that from my poem. Thank you though. Get up, Alyosha, it\u2019s time we were going, both of us.\u201d They went out, but stopped when they reached the entrance of the restaurant. \u201cListen, Alyosha,\u201d Ivan began in a resolute voice, \u201cif I am really able to care for the sticky little leaves I shall only love them, remembering you. It\u2019s enough for me that you are somewhere here, and I shan\u2019t lose my desire for life yet. Is that enough for you? Take it as a declaration of love if you like. And now you go to the right and I to the left."], "In a conversation with Alyosha, Ivan explains that he has trouble doing what?": [" \u201cThen you have said all that in your evidence?\u201d said Ivan, somewhat taken aback. He had meant to frighten him with the threat of repeating their conversation, and it appeared that Smerdyakov had already reported it all himself. \u201cWhat have I to be afraid of? Let them write down the whole truth,\u201d Smerdyakov pronounced firmly. \u201cAnd have you told them every word of our conversation at the gate?\u201d \u201cNo, not to say every word.\u201d \u201cAnd did you tell them that you can sham fits, as you boasted then?\u201d \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t tell them that either.\u201d \u201cTell me now, why did you send me then to Tchermashnya?\u201d \u201cI was afraid you\u2019d go away to Moscow; Tchermashnya is nearer, anyway.\u201d \u201cYou are lying; you suggested my going away yourself; you told me to get out of the way of trouble.\u201d \u201cThat was simply out of affection and my sincere devotion to you, foreseeing trouble in the house, to spare you. Only I wanted to spare myself even more. That\u2019s why I told you to get out of harm\u2019s way, that you might understand that there would be trouble in the house, and would remain at home to protect your father.\u201d \u201cYou might have said it more directly, you blockhead!\u201d Ivan suddenly fired up. \u201cHow could I have said it more directly then? It was simply my fear that made me speak, and you might have been angry, too. I might well have been apprehensive that Dmitri Fyodorovitch would make a scene and carry away that money, for he considered it as good as his own; but who could tell that it would end in a murder like this?", " But whether this was only the conversation that took place then, or whether he added to it his notes of parts of former conversations with his teacher, I cannot determine. In his account, Father Zossima\u2019s talk goes on without interruption, as though he told his life to his friends in the form of a story, though there is no doubt, from other accounts of it, that the conversation that evening was general. Though the guests did not interrupt Father Zossima much, yet they too talked, perhaps even told something themselves. Besides, Father Zossima could not have carried on an uninterrupted narrative, for he was sometimes gasping for breath, his voice failed him, and he even lay down to rest on his bed, though he did not fall asleep and his visitors did not leave their seats. Once or twice the conversation was interrupted by Father Pa\u00efssy\u2019s reading the Gospel. It is worthy of note, too, that no one of them supposed that he would die that night, for on that evening of his life after his deep sleep in the day he seemed suddenly to have found new strength, which kept him up through this long conversation. It was like a last effort of love which gave him marvelous energy; only for a little time, however, for his life was cut short immediately.... But of that later. I will only add now that I have preferred to confine myself to the account given by Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov. It will be shorter and not so fatiguing, though of course, as I must repeat, Alyosha took a great deal from previous conversations and added them to it.", " He even succeeded in insulting Ivan during their first interview, telling him sharply that it was not for people who declared that \u201ceverything was lawful,\u201d to suspect and question him. Altogether he was anything but friendly with Ivan on that occasion. Immediately after that interview with Mitya, Ivan went for the first time to see Smerdyakov. In the railway train on his way from Moscow, he kept thinking of Smerdyakov and of his last conversation with him on the evening before he went away. Many things seemed to him puzzling and suspicious. But when he gave his evidence to the investigating lawyer Ivan said nothing, for the time, of that conversation. He put that off till he had seen Smerdyakov, who was at that time in the hospital. Doctor Herzenstube and Varvinsky, the doctor he met in the hospital, confidently asserted in reply to Ivan\u2019s persistent questions, that Smerdyakov\u2019s epileptic attack was unmistakably genuine, and were surprised indeed at Ivan asking whether he might not have been shamming on the day of the catastrophe. They gave him to understand that the attack was an exceptional one, the fits persisting and recurring several times, so that the patient\u2019s life was positively in danger, and it was only now, after they had applied remedies, that they could assert with confidence that the patient would survive. \u201cThough it might well be,\u201d added Doctor Herzenstube, \u201cthat his reason would be impaired for a considerable period, if not permanently.\u201d On Ivan\u2019s asking impatiently whether that meant that he was now mad, they told him that this was not yet the case, in the full sense of the word, but that certain abnormalities were perceptible.", " I will not, however, omit to mention something strange, which came for a time to the surface of Alyosha\u2019s mind at this fatal and obscure moment. This new something was the harassing impression left by the conversation with Ivan, which now persistently haunted Alyosha\u2019s mind. At this moment it haunted him. Oh, it was not that something of the fundamental, elemental, so to speak, faith of his soul had been shaken. He loved his God and believed in Him steadfastly, though he was suddenly murmuring against Him. Yet a vague but tormenting and evil impression left by his conversation with Ivan the day before, suddenly revived again now in his soul and seemed forcing its way to the surface of his consciousness. It had begun to get dusk when Rakitin, crossing the pine copse from the hermitage to the monastery, suddenly noticed Alyosha, lying face downwards on the ground under a tree, not moving and apparently asleep. He went up and called him by his name. \u201cYou here, Alexey? Can you have\u2014\u201d he began wondering but broke off. He had meant to say, \u201cCan you have come to this?\u201d Alyosha did not look at him, but from a slight movement Rakitin at once saw that he heard and understood him. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he went on; but the surprise in his face gradually passed into a smile that became more and more ironical. \u201cI say, I\u2019ve been looking for you for the last two hours. You suddenly disappeared."], "Ivan says that his belief in God is inhibited by what?": [" Ivan, speak, is there a God or not? Stay, speak the truth, speak seriously. Why are you laughing again?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m laughing that you should have made a clever remark just now about Smerdyakov\u2019s belief in the existence of two saints who could move mountains.\u201d \u201cWhy, am I like him now, then?\u201d \u201cVery much.\u201d \u201cWell, that shows I\u2019m a Russian, too, and I have a Russian characteristic. And you may be caught in the same way, though you are a philosopher. Shall I catch you? What do you bet that I\u2019ll catch you to\u2010morrow. Speak, all the same, is there a God, or not? Only, be serious. I want you to be serious now.\u201d \u201cNo, there is no God.\u201d \u201cAlyosha, is there a God?\u201d \u201cThere is.\u201d \u201cIvan, and is there immortality of some sort, just a little, just a tiny bit?\u201d \u201cThere is no immortality either.\u201d \u201cNone at all?\u201d \u201cNone at all.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s absolute nothingness then. Perhaps there is just something? Anything is better than nothing!\u201d \u201cAbsolute nothingness.\u201d \u201cAlyosha, is there immortality?\u201d \u201cThere is.\u201d \u201cGod and immortality?\u201d \u201cGod and immortality. In God is immortality.\u201d \u201cH\u2019m! It\u2019s more likely Ivan\u2019s right. Good Lord! to think what faith, what force of all kinds, man has lavished for nothing, on that dream, and for how many thousand years. Who is it laughing at man? Ivan! For the last time, once for all, is there a God or not? I ask for the last time!\u201d \u201cAnd for the last time there is not.\u201d \u201cWho is laughing at mankind, Ivan?\u201d \u201cIt must be the devil,\u201d said Ivan, smiling.", " \u201cNever mind him, anyway; have done with him and forget him. And let him take with him all that you curse now, and never come back!\u201d \u201cYes, but he is spiteful. He laughed at me. He was impudent, Alyosha,\u201d Ivan said, with a shudder of offense. \u201cBut he was unfair to me, unfair to me about lots of things. He told lies about me to my face. \u2018Oh, you are going to perform an act of heroic virtue: to confess you murdered your father, that the valet murdered him at your instigation.\u2019 \u201d \u201cBrother,\u201d Alyosha interposed, \u201crestrain yourself. It was not you murdered him. It\u2019s not true!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what he says, he, and he knows it. \u2018You are going to perform an act of heroic virtue, and you don\u2019t believe in virtue; that\u2019s what tortures you and makes you angry, that\u2019s why you are so vindictive.\u2019 He said that to me about me and he knows what he says.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s you say that, not he,\u201d exclaimed Alyosha mournfully, \u201cand you say it because you are ill and delirious, tormenting yourself.\u201d \u201cNo, he knows what he says. \u2018You are going from pride,\u2019 he says. \u2018You\u2019ll stand up and say it was I killed him, and why do you writhe with horror? You are lying! I despise your opinion, I despise your horror!\u2019 He said that about me. \u2018And do you know you are longing for their praise\u2014\u201che is a criminal, a murderer, but what a generous soul; he wanted to save his brother and he confessed.\u201d \u2019 That\u2019s a lie, Alyosha!\u201d Ivan cried suddenly, with flashing eyes.", " God bless you! Come, go along! Love Ivan!\u201d was Mitya\u2019s last word. Alyosha went out in tears. Such distrustfulness in Mitya, such lack of confidence even to him, to Alyosha\u2014all this suddenly opened before Alyosha an unsuspected depth of hopeless grief and despair in the soul of his unhappy brother. Intense, infinite compassion overwhelmed him instantly. There was a poignant ache in his torn heart. \u201cLove Ivan!\u201d\u2014he suddenly recalled Mitya\u2019s words. And he was going to Ivan. He badly wanted to see Ivan all day. He was as much worried about Ivan as about Mitya, and more than ever now. Chapter V. Not You, Not You! On the way to Ivan he had to pass the house where Katerina Ivanovna was living. There was light in the windows. He suddenly stopped and resolved to go in. He had not seen Katerina Ivanovna for more than a week. But now it struck him that Ivan might be with her, especially on the eve of the terrible day. Ringing, and mounting the staircase, which was dimly lighted by a Chinese lantern, he saw a man coming down, and as they met, he recognized him as his brother. So he was just coming from Katerina Ivanovna. \u201cAh, it\u2019s only you,\u201d said Ivan dryly. \u201cWell, good\u2010by! You are going to her?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t advise you to; she\u2019s upset and you\u2019ll upset her more.\u201d A door was instantly flung open above, and a voice cried suddenly: \u201cNo, no! Alexey Fyodorovitch, have you come from him?\u201d \u201cYes, I have been with him.\u201d \u201cHas he sent me any message?", " By the way, let us say a word or two of Ivan\u2019s feeling to his brother Dmitri. He positively disliked him; at most, felt sometimes a compassion for him, and even that was mixed with great contempt, almost repugnance. Mitya\u2019s whole personality, even his appearance, was extremely unattractive to him. Ivan looked with indignation on Katerina Ivanovna\u2019s love for his brother. Yet he went to see Mitya on the first day of his arrival, and that interview, far from shaking Ivan\u2019s belief in his guilt, positively strengthened it. He found his brother agitated, nervously excited. Mitya had been talkative, but very absent\u2010minded and incoherent. He used violent language, accused Smerdyakov, and was fearfully muddled. He talked principally about the three thousand roubles, which he said had been \u201cstolen\u201d from him by his father. \u201cThe money was mine, it was my money,\u201d Mitya kept repeating. \u201cEven if I had stolen it, I should have had the right.\u201d He hardly contested the evidence against him, and if he tried to turn a fact to his advantage, it was in an absurd and incoherent way. He hardly seemed to wish to defend himself to Ivan or any one else. Quite the contrary, he was angry and proudly scornful of the charges against him; he was continually firing up and abusing every one. He only laughed contemptuously at Grigory\u2019s evidence about the open door, and declared that it was \u201cthe devil that opened it.\u201d But he could not bring forward any coherent explanation of the fact."], "Who is the author of \u201cThe Grand Inquisitor\u201d?": [" Do you know, Alyosha\u2014don\u2019t laugh! I made a poem about a year ago. If you can waste another ten minutes on me, I\u2019ll tell it to you.\u201d \u201cYou wrote a poem?\u201d \u201cOh, no, I didn\u2019t write it,\u201d laughed Ivan, \u201cand I\u2019ve never written two lines of poetry in my life. But I made up this poem in prose and I remembered it. I was carried away when I made it up. You will be my first reader\u2014that is listener. Why should an author forego even one listener?\u201d smiled Ivan. \u201cShall I tell it to you?\u201d \u201cI am all attention,\u201d said Alyosha. \u201cMy poem is called \u2018The Grand Inquisitor\u2019; it\u2019s a ridiculous thing, but I want to tell it to you.\u201d Chapter V. The Grand Inquisitor \u201cEven this must have a preface\u2014that is, a literary preface,\u201d laughed Ivan, \u201cand I am a poor hand at making one. You see, my action takes place in the sixteenth century, and at that time, as you probably learnt at school, it was customary in poetry to bring down heavenly powers on earth. Not to speak of Dante, in France, clerks, as well as the monks in the monasteries, used to give regular performances in which the Madonna, the saints, the angels, Christ, and God himself were brought on the stage. In those days it was done in all simplicity. In Victor Hugo\u2019s _Notre Dame de Paris_ an edifying and gratuitous spectacle was provided for the people in the H\u00f4tel de Ville of Paris in the reign of Louis XI. in honor of the birth of the dauphin. It was called _Le bon jugement de la tr\u00e8s sainte et gracieuse Vierge Marie_, and she appears herself on the stage and pronounces her _bon jugement_.", " He sees everything; he sees them set the coffin down at His feet, sees the child rise up, and his face darkens. He knits his thick gray brows and his eyes gleam with a sinister fire. He holds out his finger and bids the guards take Him. And such is his power, so completely are the people cowed into submission and trembling obedience to him, that the crowd immediately makes way for the guards, and in the midst of deathlike silence they lay hands on Him and lead Him away. The crowd instantly bows down to the earth, like one man, before the old Inquisitor. He blesses the people in silence and passes on. The guards lead their prisoner to the close, gloomy vaulted prison in the ancient palace of the Holy Inquisition and shut Him in it. The day passes and is followed by the dark, burning, \u2018breathless\u2019 night of Seville. The air is \u2018fragrant with laurel and lemon.\u2019 In the pitch darkness the iron door of the prison is suddenly opened and the Grand Inquisitor himself comes in with a light in his hand. He is alone; the door is closed at once behind him. He stands in the doorway and for a minute or two gazes into His face. At last he goes up slowly, sets the light on the table and speaks. \u201c \u2018Is it Thou? Thou?\u2019 but receiving no answer, he adds at once, \u2018Don\u2019t answer, be silent. What canst Thou say, indeed? I know too well what Thou wouldst say. And Thou hast no right to add anything to what Thou hadst said of old.", " I tell you frankly that I firmly believe that there has always been such a man among those who stood at the head of the movement. Who knows, there may have been some such even among the Roman Popes. Who knows, perhaps the spirit of that accursed old man who loves mankind so obstinately in his own way, is to be found even now in a whole multitude of such old men, existing not by chance but by agreement, as a secret league formed long ago for the guarding of the mystery, to guard it from the weak and the unhappy, so as to make them happy. No doubt it is so, and so it must be indeed. I fancy that even among the Masons there\u2019s something of the same mystery at the bottom, and that that\u2019s why the Catholics so detest the Masons as their rivals breaking up the unity of the idea, while it is so essential that there should be one flock and one shepherd.... But from the way I defend my idea I might be an author impatient of your criticism. Enough of it.\u201d \u201cYou are perhaps a Mason yourself!\u201d broke suddenly from Alyosha. \u201cYou don\u2019t believe in God,\u201d he added, speaking this time very sorrowfully. He fancied besides that his brother was looking at him ironically. \u201cHow does your poem end?\u201d he asked, suddenly looking down. \u201cOr was it the end?\u201d \u201cI meant to end it like this. When the Inquisitor ceased speaking he waited some time for his Prisoner to answer him. His silence weighed down upon him. He saw that the Prisoner had listened intently all the time, looking gently in his face and evidently not wishing to reply.", " The article dealt with a subject which was being debated everywhere at the time\u2014the position of the ecclesiastical courts. After discussing several opinions on the subject he went on to explain his own view. What was most striking about the article was its tone, and its unexpected conclusion. Many of the Church party regarded him unquestioningly as on their side. And yet not only the secularists but even atheists joined them in their applause. Finally some sagacious persons opined that the article was nothing but an impudent satirical burlesque. I mention this incident particularly because this article penetrated into the famous monastery in our neighborhood, where the inmates, being particularly interested in the question of the ecclesiastical courts, were completely bewildered by it. Learning the author\u2019s name, they were interested in his being a native of the town and the son of \u201cthat Fyodor Pavlovitch.\u201d And just then it was that the author himself made his appearance among us. Why Ivan Fyodorovitch had come amongst us I remember asking myself at the time with a certain uneasiness. This fateful visit, which was the first step leading to so many consequences, I never fully explained to myself. It seemed strange on the face of it that a young man so learned, so proud, and apparently so cautious, should suddenly visit such an infamous house and a father who had ignored him all his life, hardly knew him, never thought of him, and would not under any circumstances have given him money, though he was always afraid that his sons Ivan and Alexey would also come to ask him for it."], "In the prose poem, the Grand Inquisitor tells Christ that what is at odds with the Church?": [" Do you know, Alyosha\u2014don\u2019t laugh!

In those days it was done in all simplicity.

It was called _Le bon jugement de la tr\u00e8s sainte et gracieuse Vierge Marie_, and she appears herself on the stage and pronounces her _bon jugement_.", " \u201cI ask you, what would become of the excluded? He would be cut off then not only from men, as now, but from Christ. By his crime he would have transgressed not only against men but against the Church of Christ. This is so even now, of course, strictly speaking, but it is not clearly enunciated, and very, very often the criminal of to\u2010day compromises with his conscience: \u2018I steal,\u2019 he says, \u2018but I don\u2019t go against the Church. I\u2019m not an enemy of Christ.\u2019 That\u2019s what the criminal of to\u2010day is continually saying to himself, but when the Church takes the place of the State it will be difficult for him, in opposition to the Church all over the world, to say: \u2018All men are mistaken, all in error, all mankind are the false Church. I, a thief and murderer, am the only true Christian Church.\u2019 It will be very difficult to say this to himself; it requires a rare combination of unusual circumstances. Now, on the other side, take the Church\u2019s own view of crime: is it not bound to renounce the present almost pagan attitude, and to change from a mechanical cutting off of its tainted member for the preservation of society, as at present, into completely and honestly adopting the idea of the regeneration of the man, of his reformation and salvation?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean? I fail to understand again,\u201d Mi\u00fcsov interrupted. \u201cSome sort of dream again. Something shapeless and even incomprehensible. What is excommunication?", " And if the Church resists and is unwilling, some corner will be set apart for her in the State, and even that under control\u2014and this will be so everywhere in all modern European countries. But Russian hopes and conceptions demand not that the Church should pass as from a lower into a higher type into the State, but, on the contrary, that the State should end by being worthy to become only the Church and nothing else. So be it! So be it!\u201d \u201cWell, I confess you\u2019ve reassured me somewhat,\u201d Mi\u00fcsov said smiling, again crossing his legs. \u201cSo far as I understand, then, the realization of such an ideal is infinitely remote, at the second coming of Christ. That\u2019s as you please. It\u2019s a beautiful Utopian dream of the abolition of war, diplomacy, banks, and so on\u2014something after the fashion of socialism, indeed. But I imagined that it was all meant seriously, and that the Church might be _now_ going to try criminals, and sentence them to beating, prison, and even death.\u201d \u201cBut if there were none but the ecclesiastical court, the Church would not even now sentence a criminal to prison or to death. Crime and the way of regarding it would inevitably change, not all at once of course, but fairly soon,\u201d Ivan replied calmly, without flinching. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d Mi\u00fcsov glanced keenly at him. \u201cIf everything became the Church, the Church would exclude all the criminal and disobedient, and would not cut off their heads,\u201d Ivan went on.", " In the Gospel, the words \u2018not of this world\u2019 are not used in that sense. To play with such words is indefensible. Our Lord Jesus Christ came to set up the Church upon earth. The Kingdom of Heaven, of course, is not of this world, but in Heaven; but it is only entered through the Church which has been founded and established upon earth. And so a frivolous play upon words in such a connection is unpardonable and improper. The Church is, in truth, a kingdom and ordained to rule, and in the end must undoubtedly become the kingdom ruling over all the earth. For that we have the divine promise.\u201d He ceased speaking suddenly, as though checking himself. After listening attentively and respectfully Ivan went on, addressing the elder with perfect composure and as before with ready cordiality: \u201cThe whole point of my article lies in the fact that during the first three centuries Christianity only existed on earth in the Church and was nothing but the Church. When the pagan Roman Empire desired to become Christian, it inevitably happened that, by becoming Christian, it included the Church but remained a pagan State in very many of its departments. In reality this was bound to happen. But Rome as a State retained too much of the pagan civilization and culture, as, for example, in the very objects and fundamental principles of the State. The Christian Church entering into the State could, of course, surrender no part of its fundamental principles\u2014the rock on which it stands\u2014and could pursue no other aims than those which have been ordained and revealed by God Himself, and among them that of drawing the whole world, and therefore the ancient pagan State itself, into the Church."], "According to the Grand Inquisitor, what is an impossible burden for humans?": [" Do you know, Alyosha\u2014don\u2019t laugh!

All at once his face betrayed extraordinary excitement. \u201cAlyosha,\u201d he whispered apprehensively, \u201cwhere\u2019s Ivan?\u201d \u201cIn the yard. He\u2019s got a headache. He\u2019s on the watch.\u201d \u201cGive me that looking\u2010glass.", " Alyosha did not leave him. The thought passed through his mind to run for a doctor, but he was afraid to leave his brother alone: there was no one to whom he could leave him. By degrees Ivan lost consciousness completely at last. He still went on talking, talking incessantly, but quite incoherently, and even articulated his words with difficulty. Suddenly he staggered violently; but Alyosha was in time to support him. Ivan let him lead him to his bed. Alyosha undressed him somehow and put him to bed. He sat watching over him for another two hours. The sick man slept soundly, without stirring, breathing softly and evenly. Alyosha took a pillow and lay down on the sofa, without undressing. As he fell asleep he prayed for Mitya and Ivan. He began to understand Ivan\u2019s illness. \u201cThe anguish of a proud determination. An earnest conscience!\u201d God, in Whom he disbelieved, and His truth were gaining mastery over his heart, which still refused to submit. \u201cYes,\u201d the thought floated through Alyosha\u2019s head as it lay on the pillow, \u201cyes, if Smerdyakov is dead, no one will believe Ivan\u2019s evidence; but he will go and give it.\u201d Alyosha smiled softly. \u201cGod will conquer!\u201d he thought. \u201cHe will either rise up in the light of truth, or ... he\u2019ll perish in hate, revenging on himself and on every one his having served the cause he does not believe in,\u201d Alyosha added bitterly, and again he prayed for Ivan."], "Who does Ivan dread seeing?": [" Go, run after him....\u201d Alyosha jumped up and ran after Ivan, who was not fifty paces ahead of him. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d He turned quickly on Alyosha, seeing that he was running after him. \u201cShe told you to catch me up, because I\u2019m mad. I know it all by heart,\u201d he added irritably. \u201cShe is mistaken, of course; but she is right that you are ill,\u201d said Alyosha. \u201cI was looking at your face just now. You look very ill, Ivan.\u201d Ivan walked on without stopping. Alyosha followed him. \u201cAnd do you know, Alexey Fyodorovitch, how people do go out of their mind?\u201d Ivan asked in a voice suddenly quiet, without a trace of irritation, with a note of the simplest curiosity. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I suppose there are all kinds of insanity.\u201d \u201cAnd can one observe that one\u2019s going mad oneself?\u201d \u201cI imagine one can\u2019t see oneself clearly in such circumstances,\u201d Alyosha answered with surprise. Ivan paused for half a minute. \u201cIf you want to talk to me, please change the subject,\u201d he said suddenly. \u201cOh, while I think of it, I have a letter for you,\u201d said Alyosha timidly, and he took Lise\u2019s note from his pocket and held it out to Ivan. They were just under a lamp\u2010post. Ivan recognized the handwriting at once. \u201cAh, from that little demon!\u201d he laughed maliciously, and, without opening the envelope, he tore it into bits and threw it in the air. The bits were scattered by the wind. \u201cShe\u2019s not sixteen yet, I believe, and already offering herself,\u201d he said contemptuously, striding along the street again.", " Your Inquisitor does not believe in God, that\u2019s his secret!\u201d \u201cWhat if it is so! At last you have guessed it. It\u2019s perfectly true, it\u2019s true that that\u2019s the whole secret, but isn\u2019t that suffering, at least for a man like that, who has wasted his whole life in the desert and yet could not shake off his incurable love of humanity? In his old age he reached the clear conviction that nothing but the advice of the great dread spirit could build up any tolerable sort of life for the feeble, unruly, \u2018incomplete, empirical creatures created in jest.\u2019 And so, convinced of this, he sees that he must follow the counsel of the wise spirit, the dread spirit of death and destruction, and therefore accept lying and deception, and lead men consciously to death and destruction, and yet deceive them all the way so that they may not notice where they are being led, that the poor blind creatures may at least on the way think themselves happy. And note, the deception is in the name of Him in Whose ideal the old man had so fervently believed all his life long. Is not that tragic? And if only one such stood at the head of the whole army \u2018filled with the lust of power only for the sake of filthy gain\u2019\u2014would not one such be enough to make a tragedy? More than that, one such standing at the head is enough to create the actual leading idea of the Roman Church with all its armies and Jesuits, its highest idea.", " God bless you! Come, go along! Love Ivan!\u201d was Mitya\u2019s last word. Alyosha went out in tears. Such distrustfulness in Mitya, such lack of confidence even to him, to Alyosha\u2014all this suddenly opened before Alyosha an unsuspected depth of hopeless grief and despair in the soul of his unhappy brother. Intense, infinite compassion overwhelmed him instantly. There was a poignant ache in his torn heart. \u201cLove Ivan!\u201d\u2014he suddenly recalled Mitya\u2019s words. And he was going to Ivan. He badly wanted to see Ivan all day. He was as much worried about Ivan as about Mitya, and more than ever now. Chapter V. Not You, Not You! On the way to Ivan he had to pass the house where Katerina Ivanovna was living. There was light in the windows. He suddenly stopped and resolved to go in. He had not seen Katerina Ivanovna for more than a week. But now it struck him that Ivan might be with her, especially on the eve of the terrible day. Ringing, and mounting the staircase, which was dimly lighted by a Chinese lantern, he saw a man coming down, and as they met, he recognized him as his brother. So he was just coming from Katerina Ivanovna. \u201cAh, it\u2019s only you,\u201d said Ivan dryly. \u201cWell, good\u2010by! You are going to her?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t advise you to; she\u2019s upset and you\u2019ll upset her more.\u201d A door was instantly flung open above, and a voice cried suddenly: \u201cNo, no! Alexey Fyodorovitch, have you come from him?\u201d \u201cYes, I have been with him.\u201d \u201cHas he sent me any message?", " It was to him Ivan was going now, drawn by a sudden and irresistible prompting. Chapter VI. The First Interview With Smerdyakov This was the third time that Ivan had been to see Smerdyakov since his return from Moscow. The first time he had seen him and talked to him was on the first day of his arrival, then he had visited him once more, a fortnight later. But his visits had ended with that second one, so that it was now over a month since he had seen him. And he had scarcely heard anything of him. Ivan had only returned five days after his father\u2019s death, so that he was not present at the funeral, which took place the day before he came back. The cause of his delay was that Alyosha, not knowing his Moscow address, had to apply to Katerina Ivanovna to telegraph to him, and she, not knowing his address either, telegraphed to her sister and aunt, reckoning on Ivan\u2019s going to see them as soon as he arrived in Moscow. But he did not go to them till four days after his arrival. When he got the telegram, he had, of course, set off post\u2010haste to our town. The first to meet him was Alyosha, and Ivan was greatly surprised to find that, in opposition to the general opinion of the town, he refused to entertain a suspicion against Mitya, and spoke openly of Smerdyakov as the murderer. Later on, after seeing the police captain and the prosecutor, and hearing the details of the charge and the arrest, he was still more surprised at Alyosha, and ascribed his opinion only to his exaggerated brotherly feeling and sympathy with Mitya, of whom Alyosha, as Ivan knew, was very fond."], "Smerdyakov tells Ivan about the secret signs Grushenka might send to whom?": [" I know! He was cheerful before, though, indeed, he is cheerful to\u2010day.\u201d \u201cBut you said he was worried.\u201d \u201cYes, he is worried and yet cheerful. He keeps on being irritable for a minute and then cheerful and then irritable again. And you know, Alyosha, I am constantly wondering at him\u2014with this awful thing hanging over him, he sometimes laughs at such trifles as though he were a baby himself.\u201d \u201cAnd did he really tell you not to tell me about Ivan? Did he say, \u2018Don\u2019t tell him\u2019?\u201d \u201cYes, he told me, \u2018Don\u2019t tell him.\u2019 It\u2019s you that Mitya\u2019s most afraid of. Because it\u2019s a secret: he said himself it was a secret. Alyosha, darling, go to him and find out what their secret is and come and tell me,\u201d Grushenka besought him with sudden eagerness. \u201cSet my mind at rest that I may know the worst that\u2019s in store for me. That\u2019s why I sent for you.\u201d \u201cYou think it\u2019s something to do with you? If it were, he wouldn\u2019t have told you there was a secret.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. Perhaps he wants to tell me, but doesn\u2019t dare to. He warns me. There is a secret, he tells me, but he won\u2019t tell me what it is.\u201d \u201cWhat do you think yourself?\u201d \u201cWhat do I think? It\u2019s the end for me, that\u2019s what I think. They all three have been plotting my end, for Katerina\u2019s in it. It\u2019s all Katerina, it all comes from her. She is this and that, and that means that I am not. He tells me that beforehand\u2014warns me. He is planning to throw me over, that\u2019s the whole secret.", " He does jobs for them. He\u2019s watchman at night and goes grouse\u2010shooting in the day\u2010time; and that\u2019s how he lives. I\u2019ve established myself in his room. Neither he nor the women of the house know the secret\u2014that is, that I am on the watch here.\u201d \u201cNo one but Smerdyakov knows, then?\u201d \u201cNo one else. He will let me know if she goes to the old man.\u201d \u201cIt was he told you about the money, then?\u201d \u201cYes. It\u2019s a dead secret. Even Ivan doesn\u2019t know about the money, or anything. The old man is sending Ivan to Tchermashnya on a two or three days\u2019 journey. A purchaser has turned up for the copse: he\u2019ll give eight thousand for the timber. So the old man keeps asking Ivan to help him by going to arrange it. It will take him two or three days. That\u2019s what the old man wants, so that Grushenka can come while he\u2019s away.\u201d \u201cThen he\u2019s expecting Grushenka to\u2010day?\u201d \u201cNo, she won\u2019t come to\u2010day; there are signs. She\u2019s certain not to come,\u201d cried Mitya suddenly. \u201cSmerdyakov thinks so, too. Father\u2019s drinking now. He\u2019s sitting at table with Ivan. Go to him, Alyosha, and ask for the three thousand.\u201d \u201cMitya, dear, what\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d cried Alyosha, jumping up from his place, and looking keenly at his brother\u2019s frenzied face. For one moment the thought struck him that Dmitri was mad. \u201cWhat is it? I\u2019m not insane,\u201d said Dmitri, looking intently and earnestly at him. \u201cNo fear. I am sending you to father, and I know what I\u2019m saying.", " It\u2019s his going to see him, that\u2019s what it is,\u201d Grushenka began, and suddenly broke off. Alyosha gazed at her in amazement. \u201cIvan\u2019s going? Has he been to see him? Mitya told me himself that Ivan hasn\u2019t been once.\u201d \u201cThere ... there! What a girl I am! Blurting things out!\u201d exclaimed Grushenka, confused and suddenly blushing. \u201cStay, Alyosha, hush! Since I\u2019ve said so much I\u2019ll tell the whole truth\u2014he\u2019s been to see him twice, the first directly he arrived. He galloped here from Moscow at once, of course, before I was taken ill; and the second time was a week ago. He told Mitya not to tell you about it, under any circumstances; and not to tell any one, in fact. He came secretly.\u201d Alyosha sat plunged in thought, considering something. The news evidently impressed him. \u201cIvan doesn\u2019t talk to me of Mitya\u2019s case,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cHe\u2019s said very little to me these last two months. And whenever I go to see him, he seems vexed at my coming, so I\u2019ve not been to him for the last three weeks. H\u2019m!... if he was there a week ago ... there certainly has been a change in Mitya this week.\u201d \u201cThere has been a change,\u201d Grushenka assented quickly. \u201cThey have a secret, they have a secret! Mitya told me himself there was a secret, and such a secret that Mitya can\u2019t rest. Before then, he was cheerful\u2014and, indeed, he is cheerful now\u2014but when he shakes his head like that, you know, and strides about the room and keeps pulling at the hair on his right temple with his right hand, I know there is something on his mind worrying him....", " \u201cPrecisely so,\u201d said Smerdyakov, softly and reasonably, watching Ivan intently, however. \u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018precisely so\u2019?\u201d Ivan questioned him, with a menacing light in his eyes, restraining himself with difficulty. \u201cI spoke because I felt sorry for you. If I were in your place I should simply throw it all up ... rather than stay on in such a position,\u201d answered Smerdyakov, with the most candid air looking at Ivan\u2019s flashing eyes. They were both silent. \u201cYou seem to be a perfect idiot, and what\u2019s more ... an awful scoundrel, too.\u201d Ivan rose suddenly from the bench. He was about to pass straight through the gate, but he stopped short and turned to Smerdyakov. Something strange followed. Ivan, in a sudden paroxysm, bit his lip, clenched his fists, and, in another minute, would have flung himself on Smerdyakov. The latter, anyway, noticed it at the same moment, started, and shrank back. But the moment passed without mischief to Smerdyakov, and Ivan turned in silence, as it seemed in perplexity, to the gate. \u201cI am going away to Moscow to\u2010morrow, if you care to know\u2014early to\u2010morrow morning. That\u2019s all!\u201d he suddenly said aloud angrily, and wondered himself afterwards what need there was to say this then to Smerdyakov. \u201cThat\u2019s the best thing you can do,\u201d he responded, as though he had expected to hear it; \u201cexcept that you can always be telegraphed for from Moscow, if anything should happen here.\u201d Ivan stopped again, and again turned quickly to Smerdyakov."], "Smerdyakov says he is nervous that ___ will hurt Fyodor.": [" Chapter III. The Confession Of A Passionate Heart\u2014In Verse Alyosha remained for some time irresolute after hearing the command his father shouted to him from the carriage. But in spite of his uneasiness he did not stand still. That was not his way. He went at once to the kitchen to find out what his father had been doing above. Then he set off, trusting that on the way he would find some answer to the doubt tormenting him. I hasten to add that his father\u2019s shouts, commanding him to return home \u201cwith his mattress and pillow\u201d did not frighten him in the least. He understood perfectly that those peremptory shouts were merely \u201ca flourish\u201d to produce an effect. In the same way a tradesman in our town who was celebrating his name\u2010day with a party of friends, getting angry at being refused more vodka, smashed up his own crockery and furniture and tore his own and his wife\u2019s clothes, and finally broke his windows, all for the sake of effect. Next day, of course, when he was sober, he regretted the broken cups and saucers. Alyosha knew that his father would let him go back to the monastery next day, possibly even that evening. Moreover, he was fully persuaded that his father might hurt any one else, but would not hurt him. Alyosha was certain that no one in the whole world ever would want to hurt him, and, what is more, he knew that no one could hurt him. This was for him an axiom, assumed once for all without question, and he went his way without hesitation, relying on it.", " \u201cFenya, get up, don\u2019t kneel to me. Mitya won\u2019t hurt any one, the silly fool won\u2019t hurt any one again. But I say, Fenya,\u201d he shouted, after having taken his seat. \u201cI hurt you just now, so forgive me and have pity on me, forgive a scoundrel.... But it doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t. It\u2019s all the same now. Now then, Andrey, look alive, fly along full speed!\u201d Andrey whipped up the horses, and the bells began ringing. \u201cGood\u2010by, Pyotr Ilyitch! My last tear is for you!...\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s not drunk, but he keeps babbling like a lunatic,\u201d Pyotr Ilyitch thought as he watched him go. He had half a mind to stay and see the cart packed with the remaining wines and provisions, knowing that they would deceive and defraud Mitya. But, suddenly feeling vexed with himself, he turned away with a curse and went to the tavern to play billiards. \u201cHe\u2019s a fool, though he\u2019s a good fellow,\u201d he muttered as he went. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of that officer, Grushenka\u2019s former flame. Well, if he has turned up.... Ech, those pistols! Damn it all! I\u2019m not his nurse! Let them do what they like! Besides, it\u2019ll all come to nothing. They\u2019re a set of brawlers, that\u2019s all. They\u2019ll drink and fight, fight and make friends again. They are not men who do anything real. What does he mean by \u2018I\u2019m stepping aside, I\u2019m punishing myself?\u2019 It\u2019ll come to nothing! He\u2019s shouted such phrases a thousand times, drunk, in the taverns. But now he\u2019s not drunk.", " Ha ha! I see through you, Mr. Prosecutor. You thought, of course, that I should jump at that, catch at your prompting, and shout with all my might, \u2018Aie! it\u2019s Smerdyakov; he\u2019s the murderer.\u2019 Confess that\u2019s what you thought. Confess, and I\u2019ll go on.\u201d But the prosecutor did not confess. He held his tongue and waited. \u201cYou\u2019re mistaken. I\u2019m not going to shout \u2018It\u2019s Smerdyakov,\u2019 \u201d said Mitya. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t even suspect him?\u201d \u201cWhy, do you suspect him?\u201d \u201cHe is suspected, too.\u201d Mitya fixed his eyes on the floor. \u201cJoking apart,\u201d he brought out gloomily. \u201cListen. From the very beginning, almost from the moment when I ran out to you from behind the curtain, I\u2019ve had the thought of Smerdyakov in my mind. I\u2019ve been sitting here, shouting that I\u2019m innocent and thinking all the time \u2018Smerdyakov!\u2019 I can\u2019t get Smerdyakov out of my head. In fact, I, too, thought of Smerdyakov just now; but only for a second. Almost at once I thought, \u2018No, it\u2019s not Smerdyakov.\u2019 It\u2019s not his doing, gentlemen.\u201d \u201cIn that case is there anybody else you suspect?\u201d Nikolay Parfenovitch inquired cautiously. \u201cI don\u2019t know any one it could be, whether it\u2019s the hand of Heaven or Satan, but ... not Smerdyakov,\u201d Mitya jerked out with decision. \u201cBut what makes you affirm so confidently and emphatically that it\u2019s not he?\u201d \u201cFrom my conviction\u2014my impression. Because Smerdyakov is a man of the most abject character and a coward. He\u2019s not a coward, he\u2019s the epitome of all the cowardice in the world walking on two legs.", " \u201cCan you talk to me?\u201d asked Ivan. \u201cI won\u2019t tire you much.\u201d \u201cCertainly I can,\u201d mumbled Smerdyakov, in a faint voice. \u201cHas your honor been back long?\u201d he added patronizingly, as though encouraging a nervous visitor. \u201cI only arrived to\u2010day.... To see the mess you are in here.\u201d Smerdyakov sighed. \u201cWhy do you sigh? You knew of it all along,\u201d Ivan blurted out. Smerdyakov was stolidly silent for a while. \u201cHow could I help knowing? It was clear beforehand. But how could I tell it would turn out like that?\u201d \u201cWhat would turn out? Don\u2019t prevaricate! You\u2019ve foretold you\u2019d have a fit; on the way down to the cellar, you know. You mentioned the very spot.\u201d \u201cHave you said so at the examination yet?\u201d Smerdyakov queried with composure. Ivan felt suddenly angry. \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t yet, but I certainly shall. You must explain a great deal to me, my man; and let me tell you, I am not going to let you play with me!\u201d \u201cWhy should I play with you, when I put my whole trust in you, as in God Almighty?\u201d said Smerdyakov, with the same composure, only for a moment closing his eyes. \u201cIn the first place,\u201d began Ivan, \u201cI know that epileptic fits can\u2019t be told beforehand. I\u2019ve inquired; don\u2019t try and take me in. You can\u2019t foretell the day and the hour. How was it you told me the day and the hour beforehand, and about the cellar, too? How could you tell that you would fall down the cellar stairs in a fit, if you didn\u2019t sham a fit on purpose?\u201d \u201cI had to go to the cellar anyway, several times a day, indeed,\u201d Smerdyakov drawled deliberately."], "Ivan suspects that Smerdyakov has shared information in order to put whom in danger?": [" \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I learn them so as to improve my education, supposing that I may myself chance to go some day to those happy parts of Europe?\u201d \u201cListen, monster.\u201d Ivan\u2019s eyes flashed and he trembled all over. \u201cI am not afraid of your accusations; you can say what you like about me, and if I don\u2019t beat you to death, it\u2019s simply because I suspect you of that crime and I\u2019ll drag you to justice. I\u2019ll unmask you.\u201d \u201cTo my thinking, you\u2019d better keep quiet, for what can you accuse me of, considering my absolute innocence? and who would believe you? Only if you begin, I shall tell everything, too, for I must defend myself.\u201d \u201cDo you think I am afraid of you now?\u201d \u201cIf the court doesn\u2019t believe all I\u2019ve said to you just now, the public will, and you will be ashamed.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s as much as to say, \u2018It\u2019s always worth while speaking to a sensible man,\u2019 eh?\u201d snarled Ivan. \u201cYou hit the mark, indeed. And you\u2019d better be sensible.\u201d Ivan got up, shaking all over with indignation, put on his coat, and without replying further to Smerdyakov, without even looking at him, walked quickly out of the cottage. The cool evening air refreshed him. There was a bright moon in the sky. A nightmare of ideas and sensations filled his soul. \u201cShall I go at once and give information against Smerdyakov? But what information can I give? He is not guilty, anyway. On the contrary, he\u2019ll accuse me. And in fact, why did I set off for Tchermashnya then?", " He even succeeded in insulting Ivan during their first interview, telling him sharply that it was not for people who declared that \u201ceverything was lawful,\u201d to suspect and question him. Altogether he was anything but friendly with Ivan on that occasion. Immediately after that interview with Mitya, Ivan went for the first time to see Smerdyakov. In the railway train on his way from Moscow, he kept thinking of Smerdyakov and of his last conversation with him on the evening before he went away. Many things seemed to him puzzling and suspicious. But when he gave his evidence to the investigating lawyer Ivan said nothing, for the time, of that conversation. He put that off till he had seen Smerdyakov, who was at that time in the hospital. Doctor Herzenstube and Varvinsky, the doctor he met in the hospital, confidently asserted in reply to Ivan\u2019s persistent questions, that Smerdyakov\u2019s epileptic attack was unmistakably genuine, and were surprised indeed at Ivan asking whether he might not have been shamming on the day of the catastrophe. They gave him to understand that the attack was an exceptional one, the fits persisting and recurring several times, so that the patient\u2019s life was positively in danger, and it was only now, after they had applied remedies, that they could assert with confidence that the patient would survive. \u201cThough it might well be,\u201d added Doctor Herzenstube, \u201cthat his reason would be impaired for a considerable period, if not permanently.\u201d On Ivan\u2019s asking impatiently whether that meant that he was now mad, they told him that this was not yet the case, in the full sense of the word, but that certain abnormalities were perceptible.", " \u201cPrecisely so,\u201d said Smerdyakov, softly and reasonably, watching Ivan intently, however. \u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018precisely so\u2019?\u201d Ivan questioned him, with a menacing light in his eyes, restraining himself with difficulty. \u201cI spoke because I felt sorry for you. If I were in your place I should simply throw it all up ... rather than stay on in such a position,\u201d answered Smerdyakov, with the most candid air looking at Ivan\u2019s flashing eyes. They were both silent. \u201cYou seem to be a perfect idiot, and what\u2019s more ... an awful scoundrel, too.\u201d Ivan rose suddenly from the bench. He was about to pass straight through the gate, but he stopped short and turned to Smerdyakov. Something strange followed. Ivan, in a sudden paroxysm, bit his lip, clenched his fists, and, in another minute, would have flung himself on Smerdyakov. The latter, anyway, noticed it at the same moment, started, and shrank back. But the moment passed without mischief to Smerdyakov, and Ivan turned in silence, as it seemed in perplexity, to the gate. \u201cI am going away to Moscow to\u2010morrow, if you care to know\u2014early to\u2010morrow morning. That\u2019s all!\u201d he suddenly said aloud angrily, and wondered himself afterwards what need there was to say this then to Smerdyakov. \u201cThat\u2019s the best thing you can do,\u201d he responded, as though he had expected to hear it; \u201cexcept that you can always be telegraphed for from Moscow, if anything should happen here.\u201d Ivan stopped again, and again turned quickly to Smerdyakov.", " P.P.P.S.\u2014Katya, pray to God that some one\u2019ll give me the money. Then I shall not be steeped in gore, and if no one does\u2014I shall! Kill me! Your slave and enemy, D. KARAMAZOV. When Ivan read this \u201cdocument\u201d he was convinced. So then it was his brother, not Smerdyakov. And if not Smerdyakov, then not he, Ivan. This letter at once assumed in his eyes the aspect of a logical proof. There could be no longer the slightest doubt of Mitya\u2019s guilt. The suspicion never occurred to Ivan, by the way, that Mitya might have committed the murder in conjunction with Smerdyakov, and, indeed, such a theory did not fit in with the facts. Ivan was completely reassured. The next morning he only thought of Smerdyakov and his gibes with contempt. A few days later he positively wondered how he could have been so horribly distressed at his suspicions. He resolved to dismiss him with contempt and forget him. So passed a month. He made no further inquiry about Smerdyakov, but twice he happened to hear that he was very ill and out of his mind. \u201cHe\u2019ll end in madness,\u201d the young doctor Varvinsky observed about him, and Ivan remembered this. During the last week of that month Ivan himself began to feel very ill. He went to consult the Moscow doctor who had been sent for by Katerina Ivanovna just before the trial. And just at that time his relations with Katerina Ivanovna became acutely strained. They were like two enemies in love with one another."], "What happens to Smerdyakov, about which he had earlier expressed fear?": [" Ha ha! I see through you, Mr. Prosecutor. You thought, of course, that I should jump at that, catch at your prompting, and shout with all my might, \u2018Aie! it\u2019s Smerdyakov; he\u2019s the murderer.\u2019 Confess that\u2019s what you thought. Confess, and I\u2019ll go on.\u201d But the prosecutor did not confess. He held his tongue and waited. \u201cYou\u2019re mistaken. I\u2019m not going to shout \u2018It\u2019s Smerdyakov,\u2019 \u201d said Mitya. \u201cAnd you don\u2019t even suspect him?\u201d \u201cWhy, do you suspect him?\u201d \u201cHe is suspected, too.\u201d Mitya fixed his eyes on the floor. \u201cJoking apart,\u201d he brought out gloomily. \u201cListen. From the very beginning, almost from the moment when I ran out to you from behind the curtain, I\u2019ve had the thought of Smerdyakov in my mind. I\u2019ve been sitting here, shouting that I\u2019m innocent and thinking all the time \u2018Smerdyakov!\u2019 I can\u2019t get Smerdyakov out of my head. In fact, I, too, thought of Smerdyakov just now; but only for a second. Almost at once I thought, \u2018No, it\u2019s not Smerdyakov.\u2019 It\u2019s not his doing, gentlemen.\u201d \u201cIn that case is there anybody else you suspect?\u201d Nikolay Parfenovitch inquired cautiously. \u201cI don\u2019t know any one it could be, whether it\u2019s the hand of Heaven or Satan, but ... not Smerdyakov,\u201d Mitya jerked out with decision. \u201cBut what makes you affirm so confidently and emphatically that it\u2019s not he?\u201d \u201cFrom my conviction\u2014my impression. Because Smerdyakov is a man of the most abject character and a coward. He\u2019s not a coward, he\u2019s the epitome of all the cowardice in the world walking on two legs.", " He had to be on the alert. Dmitri might be on the watch for her somewhere, and when she knocked on the window (Smerdyakov had informed him two days before that he had told her where and how to knock) the door must be opened at once. She must not be a second in the passage, for fear\u2014which God forbid!\u2014that she should be frightened and run away. Fyodor Pavlovitch had much to think of, but never had his heart been steeped in such voluptuous hopes. This time he could say almost certainly that she would come! Book VI. The Russian Monk Chapter I. Father Zossima And His Visitors When with an anxious and aching heart Alyosha went into his elder\u2019s cell, he stood still almost astonished. Instead of a sick man at his last gasp, perhaps unconscious, as he had feared to find him, he saw him sitting up in his chair and, though weak and exhausted, his face was bright and cheerful, he was surrounded by visitors and engaged in a quiet and joyful conversation. But he had only got up from his bed a quarter of an hour before Alyosha\u2019s arrival; his visitors had gathered together in his cell earlier, waiting for him to wake, having received a most confident assurance from Father Pa\u00efssy that \u201cthe teacher would get up, and as he had himself promised in the morning, converse once more with those dear to his heart.\u201d This promise and indeed every word of the dying elder Father Pa\u00efssy put implicit trust in.", " Chapter VIII. A Treatise On Smerdyakov \u201cTo begin with, what was the source of this suspicion?\u201d (Ippolit Kirillovitch began.) \u201cThe first person who cried out that Smerdyakov had committed the murder was the prisoner himself at the moment of his arrest, yet from that time to this he had not brought forward a single fact to confirm the charge, nor the faintest suggestion of a fact. The charge is confirmed by three persons only\u2014the two brothers of the prisoner and Madame Svyetlov. The elder of these brothers expressed his suspicions only to\u2010day, when he was undoubtedly suffering from brain fever. But we know that for the last two months he has completely shared our conviction of his brother\u2019s guilt and did not attempt to combat that idea. But of that later. The younger brother has admitted that he has not the slightest fact to support his notion of Smerdyakov\u2019s guilt, and has only been led to that conclusion from the prisoner\u2019s own words and the expression of his face. Yes, that astounding piece of evidence has been brought forward twice to\u2010 day by him. Madame Svyetlov was even more astounding. \u2018What the prisoner tells you, you must believe; he is not a man to tell a lie.\u2019 That is all the evidence against Smerdyakov produced by these three persons, who are all deeply concerned in the prisoner\u2019s fate. And yet the theory of Smerdyakov\u2019s guilt has been noised about, has been and is still maintained.", " \u201cPrecisely so,\u201d said Smerdyakov, softly and reasonably, watching Ivan intently, however. \u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018precisely so\u2019?\u201d Ivan questioned him, with a menacing light in his eyes, restraining himself with difficulty. \u201cI spoke because I felt sorry for you. If I were in your place I should simply throw it all up ... rather than stay on in such a position,\u201d answered Smerdyakov, with the most candid air looking at Ivan\u2019s flashing eyes. They were both silent. \u201cYou seem to be a perfect idiot, and what\u2019s more ... an awful scoundrel, too.\u201d Ivan rose suddenly from the bench. He was about to pass straight through the gate, but he stopped short and turned to Smerdyakov. Something strange followed.

But the moment passed without mischief to Smerdyakov, and Ivan turned in silence, as it seemed in perplexity, to the gate. \u201cI am going away to Moscow to\u2010morrow, if you care to know\u2014early to\u2010morrow morning. That\u2019s all!\u201d he suddenly said aloud angrily, and wondered himself afterwards what need there was to say this then to Smerdyakov. \u201cThat\u2019s the best thing you can do,\u201d he responded, as though he had expected to hear it; \u201cexcept that you can always be telegraphed for from Moscow, if anything should happen here.\u201d Ivan stopped again, and again turned quickly to Smerdyakov."], "Zosima warns Alyosha about whose pain and suffering?": [" I know! He was cheerful before, though, indeed, he is cheerful to\u2010day.\u201d \u201cBut you said he was worried.\u201d \u201cYes, he is worried and yet cheerful. He keeps on being irritable for a minute and then cheerful and then irritable again. And you know, Alyosha, I am constantly wondering at him\u2014with this awful thing hanging over him, he sometimes laughs at such trifles as though he were a baby himself.\u201d \u201cAnd did he really tell you not to tell me about Ivan? Did he say, \u2018Don\u2019t tell him\u2019?\u201d \u201cYes, he told me, \u2018Don\u2019t tell him.\u2019 It\u2019s you that Mitya\u2019s most afraid of. Because it\u2019s a secret: he said himself it was a secret. Alyosha, darling, go to him and find out what their secret is and come and tell me,\u201d Grushenka besought him with sudden eagerness. \u201cSet my mind at rest that I may know the worst that\u2019s in store for me. That\u2019s why I sent for you.\u201d \u201cYou think it\u2019s something to do with you? If it were, he wouldn\u2019t have told you there was a secret.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. Perhaps he wants to tell me, but doesn\u2019t dare to. He warns me. There is a secret, he tells me, but he won\u2019t tell me what it is.\u201d \u201cWhat do you think yourself?\u201d \u201cWhat do I think? It\u2019s the end for me, that\u2019s what I think. They all three have been plotting my end, for Katerina\u2019s in it. It\u2019s all Katerina, it all comes from her. She is this and that, and that means that I am not. He tells me that beforehand\u2014warns me. He is planning to throw me over, that\u2019s the whole secret.", " Another can never know how much I suffer, because he is another and not I. And what\u2019s more, a man is rarely ready to admit another\u2019s suffering (as though it were a distinction). Why won\u2019t he admit it, do you think? Because I smell unpleasant, because I have a stupid face, because I once trod on his foot. Besides, there is suffering and suffering; degrading, humiliating suffering such as humbles me\u2014hunger, for instance\u2014my benefactor will perhaps allow me; but when you come to higher suffering\u2014for an idea, for instance\u2014he will very rarely admit that, perhaps because my face strikes him as not at all what he fancies a man should have who suffers for an idea. And so he deprives me instantly of his favor, and not at all from badness of heart. Beggars, especially genteel beggars, ought never to show themselves, but to ask for charity through the newspapers. One can love one\u2019s neighbors in the abstract, or even at a distance, but at close quarters it\u2019s almost impossible. If it were as on the stage, in the ballet, where if beggars come in, they wear silken rags and tattered lace and beg for alms dancing gracefully, then one might like looking at them. But even then we should not love them. But enough of that. I simply wanted to show you my point of view. I meant to speak of the suffering of mankind generally, but we had better confine ourselves to the sufferings of the children. That reduces the scope of my argument to a tenth of what it would be.", " \u201cThe stuff\u2019s been too much for the woman,\u201d Grigory thought, glancing at her, and groaning, he went out on the steps. No doubt he only intended to look out from the steps, for he was hardly able to walk, the pain in his back and his right leg was intolerable. But he suddenly remembered that he had not locked the little gate into the garden that evening. He was the most punctual and precise of men, a man who adhered to an unchangeable routine, and habits that lasted for years. Limping and writhing with pain he went down the steps and towards the garden. Yes, the gate stood wide open. Mechanically he stepped into the garden. Perhaps he fancied something, perhaps caught some sound, and, glancing to the left he saw his master\u2019s window open. No one was looking out of it then. \u201cWhat\u2019s it open for? It\u2019s not summer now,\u201d thought Grigory, and suddenly, at that very instant he caught a glimpse of something extraordinary before him in the garden. Forty paces in front of him a man seemed to be running in the dark, a sort of shadow was moving very fast. \u201cGood Lord!\u201d cried Grigory beside himself, and forgetting the pain in his back, he hurried to intercept the running figure. He took a short cut, evidently he knew the garden better; the flying figure went towards the bath\u2010house, ran behind it and rushed to the garden fence. Grigory followed, not losing sight of him, and ran, forgetting everything.", " The elder had sent Porfiry the evening before to a widow, whose house had been burnt down lately, and who after the fire had gone with her children begging alms. Porfiry hastened to reply that he had given the money, as he had been instructed, \u201cfrom an unknown benefactress.\u201d \u201cGet up, my dear boy,\u201d the elder went on to Alyosha. \u201cLet me look at you. Have you been home and seen your brother?\u201d It seemed strange to Alyosha that he asked so confidently and precisely, about one of his brothers only\u2014but which one? Then perhaps he had sent him out both yesterday and to\u2010day for the sake of that brother. \u201cI have seen one of my brothers,\u201d answered Alyosha. \u201cI mean the elder one, to whom I bowed down.\u201d \u201cI only saw him yesterday and could not find him to\u2010day,\u201d said Alyosha. \u201cMake haste to find him, go again to\u2010morrow and make haste, leave everything and make haste. Perhaps you may still have time to prevent something terrible. I bowed down yesterday to the great suffering in store for him.\u201d He was suddenly silent and seemed to be pondering. The words were strange. Father Iosif, who had witnessed the scene yesterday, exchanged glances with Father Pa\u00efssy. Alyosha could not resist asking: \u201cFather and teacher,\u201d he began with extreme emotion, \u201cyour words are too obscure.... What is this suffering in store for him?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t inquire.

And let him take with him all that you curse now, and never come back!\u201d \u201cYes, but he is spiteful. He laughed at me. He was impudent, Alyosha,\u201d Ivan said, with a shudder of offense. \u201cBut he was unfair to me, unfair to me about lots of things. He told lies about me to my face. \u2018Oh, you are going to perform an act of heroic virtue: to confess you murdered your father, that the valet murdered him at your instigation.\u2019 \u201d \u201cBrother,\u201d Alyosha interposed, \u201crestrain yourself. It was not you murdered him.

You are lying! I despise your opinion, I despise your horror!\u2019 He said that about me. \u2018And do you know you are longing for their praise\u2014\u201che is a criminal, a murderer, but what a generous soul; he wanted to save his brother and he confessed.\u201d \u2019 That\u2019s a lie, Alyosha!\u201d Ivan cried suddenly, with flashing eyes.", " He was suddenly drunk, although till that moment he had been quite sober, he remembered that. From that moment everything whirled about him, as though he were delirious. He walked, laughed, talked to everybody, without knowing what he was doing. Only one persistent burning sensation made itself felt continually, \u201clike a red\u2010hot coal in his heart,\u201d he said afterwards. He went up to her, sat beside her, gazed at her, listened to her.... She became very talkative, kept calling every one to her, and beckoned to different girls out of the chorus. When the girl came up, she either kissed her, or made the sign of the cross over her. In another minute she might have cried. She was greatly amused by the \u201clittle old man,\u201d as she called Maximov. He ran up every minute to kiss her hands, \u201ceach little finger,\u201d and finally he danced another dance to an old song, which he sang himself. He danced with special vigor to the refrain: The little pig says\u2014umph! umph! umph! The little calf says\u2014moo, moo, moo, The little duck says\u2014quack, quack, quack, The little goose says\u2014ga, ga, ga.

Ah, the poor, the insulted!... Do you know, Mitya, I shall go into a nunnery. No, I really shall one day, Alyosha said something to me to\u2010day that I shall remember all my life....", " Go to the door, open it gently, and see whether mamma is listening,\u201d said Lise, in a nervous, hurried whisper. Alyosha went, opened the door, and reported that no one was listening. \u201cCome here, Alexey Fyodorovitch,\u201d Lise went on, flushing redder and redder. \u201cGive me your hand\u2014that\u2019s right. I have to make a great confession, I didn\u2019t write to you yesterday in joke, but in earnest,\u201d and she hid her eyes with her hand. It was evident that she was greatly ashamed of the confession. Suddenly she snatched his hand and impulsively kissed it three times. \u201cAh, Lise, what a good thing!\u201d cried Alyosha joyfully. \u201cYou know, I was perfectly sure you were in earnest.\u201d \u201cSure? Upon my word!\u201d She put aside his hand, but did not leave go of it, blushing hotly, and laughing a little happy laugh. \u201cI kiss his hand and he says, \u2018What a good thing!\u2019 \u201d But her reproach was undeserved. Alyosha, too, was greatly overcome. \u201cI should like to please you always, Lise, but I don\u2019t know how to do it,\u201d he muttered, blushing too. \u201cAlyosha, dear, you are cold and rude.

Why, that\u2019s impertinence\u2014that\u2019s what it is.\u201d \u201cWhy, was it wrong of me to feel sure?\u201d Alyosha asked, laughing suddenly. \u201cAh, Alyosha, on the contrary, it was delightfully right,\u201d cried Lise, looking tenderly and happily at him.

Lise looked rather embarrassed, and at once flushed crimson. She was evidently ashamed of something, and, as people always do in such cases, she began immediately talking of other things, as though they were of absorbing interest to her at the moment. \u201cMamma has just told me all about the two hundred roubles, Alexey Fyodorovitch, and your taking them to that poor officer ... and she told me all the awful story of how he had been insulted ... and you know, although mamma muddles things ... she always rushes from one thing to another ...

Alyosha sat down to the table and began to tell his story, but at the first words he lost his embarrassment and gained the whole of Lise\u2019s attention as well.

There is a secret, he tells me, but he won\u2019t tell me what it is.\u201d \u201cWhat do you think yourself?\u201d \u201cWhat do I think? It\u2019s the end for me, that\u2019s what I think. They all three have been plotting my end, for Katerina\u2019s in it. It\u2019s all Katerina, it all comes from her. She is this and that, and that means that I am not. He tells me that beforehand\u2014warns me. He is planning to throw me over, that\u2019s the whole secret.", " He was an undersized weakly boy with a thin pale face, with large dark eyes that gazed at him vindictively. He was dressed in a rather shabby old overcoat, which he had monstrously outgrown. His bare arms stuck out beyond his sleeves. There was a large patch on the right knee of his trousers, and in his right boot just at the toe there was a big hole in the leather, carefully blackened with ink. Both the pockets of his great\u2010coat were weighed down with stones. Alyosha stopped two steps in front of him, looking inquiringly at him. The boy, seeing at once from Alyosha\u2019s eyes that he wouldn\u2019t beat him, became less defiant, and addressed him first. \u201cI am alone, and there are six of them. I\u2019ll beat them all, alone!\u201d he said suddenly, with flashing eyes. \u201cI think one of the stones must have hurt you badly,\u201d observed Alyosha. \u201cBut I hit Smurov on the head!\u201d cried the boy. \u201cThey told me that you know me, and that you threw a stone at me on purpose,\u201d said Alyosha. The boy looked darkly at him. \u201cI don\u2019t know you. Do you know me?\u201d Alyosha continued. \u201cLet me alone!\u201d the boy cried irritably; but he did not move, as though he were expecting something, and again there was a vindictive light in his eyes. \u201cVery well, I am going,\u201d said Alyosha; \u201conly I don\u2019t know you and I don\u2019t tease you. They told me how they tease you, but I don\u2019t want to tease you. Good\u2010by!\u201d \u201cMonk in silk trousers!\u201d cried the boy, following Alyosha with the same vindictive and defiant expression, and he threw himself into an attitude of defense, feeling sure that now Alyosha would fall upon him; but Alyosha turned, looked at him, and walked away."], "Zosima tells Alyosha that monks are close to whom?": [" For they expected something quite different. And, behold, soon after midday there were signs of something, at first only observed in silence by those who came in and out and were evidently each afraid to communicate the thought in his mind. But by three o\u2019clock those signs had become so clear and unmistakable, that the news swiftly reached all the monks and visitors in the hermitage, promptly penetrated to the monastery, throwing all the monks into amazement, and finally, in the shortest possible time, spread to the town, exciting every one in it, believers and unbelievers alike. The unbelievers rejoiced, and as for the believers some of them rejoiced even more than the unbelievers, for \u201cmen love the downfall and disgrace of the righteous,\u201d as the deceased elder had said in one of his exhortations. The fact is that a smell of decomposition began to come from the coffin, growing gradually more marked, and by three o\u2019clock it was quite unmistakable. In all the past history of our monastery, no such scandal could be recalled, and in no other circumstances could such a scandal have been possible, as showed itself in unseemly disorder immediately after this discovery among the very monks themselves. Afterwards, even many years afterwards, some sensible monks were amazed and horrified, when they recalled that day, that the scandal could have reached such proportions. For in the past, monks of very holy life had died, God\u2010fearing old men, whose saintliness was acknowledged by all, yet from their humble coffins, too, the breath of corruption had come, naturally, as from all dead bodies, but that had caused no scandal nor even the slightest excitement.", " Alyosha noticed that many, almost all, went in to the elder for the first time with apprehension and uneasiness, but came out with bright and happy faces. Alyosha was particularly struck by the fact that Father Zossima was not at all stern. On the contrary, he was always almost gay. The monks used to say that he was more drawn to those who were more sinful, and the greater the sinner the more he loved him. There were, no doubt, up to the end of his life, among the monks some who hated and envied him, but they were few in number and they were silent, though among them were some of great dignity in the monastery, one, for instance, of the older monks distinguished for his strict keeping of fasts and vows of silence. But the majority were on Father Zossima\u2019s side and very many of them loved him with all their hearts, warmly and sincerely. Some were almost fanatically devoted to him, and declared, though not quite aloud, that he was a saint, that there could be no doubt of it, and, seeing that his end was near, they anticipated miracles and great glory to the monastery in the immediate future from his relics. Alyosha had unquestioning faith in the miraculous power of the elder, just as he had unquestioning faith in the story of the coffin that flew out of the church. He saw many who came with sick children or relatives and besought the elder to lay hands on them and to pray over them, return shortly after\u2014some the next day\u2014and, falling in tears at the elder\u2019s feet, thank him for healing their sick.", " The nearest friends of the deceased and those whose duty it was from their position began to lay out the corpse according to the ancient ritual, and all the monks gathered together in the church. And before dawn the news of the death reached the town. By the morning all the town was talking of the event, and crowds were flocking from the town to the monastery. But this subject will be treated in the next book; I will only add here that before a day had passed something happened so unexpected, so strange, upsetting, and bewildering in its effect on the monks and the townspeople, that after all these years, that day of general suspense is still vividly remembered in the town. PART III Book VII. Alyosha Chapter I. The Breath Of Corruption The body of Father Zossima was prepared for burial according to the established ritual. As is well known, the bodies of dead monks and hermits are not washed. In the words of the Church Ritual: \u201cIf any one of the monks depart in the Lord, the monk designated (that is, whose office it is) shall wipe the body with warm water, making first the sign of the cross with a sponge on the forehead of the deceased, on the breast, on the hands and feet and on the knees, and that is enough.\u201d All this was done by Father Pa\u00efssy, who then clothed the deceased in his monastic garb and wrapped him in his cloak, which was, according to custom, somewhat slit to allow of its being folded about him in the form of a cross.", " I know! He was cheerful before, though, indeed, he is cheerful to\u2010day.\u201d \u201cBut you said he was worried.\u201d \u201cYes, he is worried and yet cheerful. He keeps on being irritable for a minute and then cheerful and then irritable again. And you know, Alyosha, I am constantly wondering at him\u2014with this awful thing hanging over him, he sometimes laughs at such trifles as though he were a baby himself.\u201d \u201cAnd did he really tell you not to tell me about Ivan? Did he say, \u2018Don\u2019t tell him\u2019?\u201d \u201cYes, he told me, \u2018Don\u2019t tell him.\u2019 It\u2019s you that Mitya\u2019s most afraid of. Because it\u2019s a secret: he said himself it was a secret. Alyosha, darling, go to him and find out what their secret is and come and tell me,\u201d Grushenka besought him with sudden eagerness. \u201cSet my mind at rest that I may know the worst that\u2019s in store for me. That\u2019s why I sent for you.\u201d \u201cYou think it\u2019s something to do with you? If it were, he wouldn\u2019t have told you there was a secret.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. Perhaps he wants to tell me, but doesn\u2019t dare to. He warns me. There is a secret, he tells me, but he won\u2019t tell me what it is.\u201d \u201cWhat do you think yourself?\u201d \u201cWhat do I think? It\u2019s the end for me, that\u2019s what I think. They all three have been plotting my end, for Katerina\u2019s in it. It\u2019s all Katerina, it all comes from her. She is this and that, and that means that I am not. He tells me that beforehand\u2014warns me. He is planning to throw me over, that\u2019s the whole secret."], "Before dying, Zosima does what?": [" \u201cMake haste with the lint and the lotion, mamma. That\u2019s simply Goulard\u2019s water, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I remember the name now, but it\u2019s a splendid lotion. Would you believe it, mamma, on the way here he had a fight with the boys in the street, and it was a boy bit his finger, isn\u2019t he a child, a child himself? Is he fit to be married after that? For only fancy, he wants to be married, mamma. Just think of him married, wouldn\u2019t it be funny, wouldn\u2019t it be awful?\u201d And Lise kept laughing her thin hysterical giggle, looking slyly at Alyosha. \u201cBut why married, Lise? What makes you talk of such a thing? It\u2019s quite out of place\u2014and perhaps the boy was rabid.\u201d \u201cWhy, mamma! As though there were rabid boys!\u201d \u201cWhy not, Lise, as though I had said something stupid! Your boy might have been bitten by a mad dog and he would become mad and bite any one near him. How well she has bandaged it, Alexey Fyodorovitch! I couldn\u2019t have done it. Do you still feel the pain?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s nothing much now.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t feel afraid of water?\u201d asked Lise. \u201cCome, that\u2019s enough, Lise, perhaps I really was rather too quick talking of the boy being rabid, and you pounced upon it at once Katerina Ivanovna has only just heard that you are here, Alexey Fyodorovitch, she simply rushed at me, she\u2019s dying to see you, dying!\u201d \u201cAch, mamma, go to them yourself. He can\u2019t go just now, he is in too much pain.\u201d \u201cNot at all, I can go quite well,\u201d said Alyosha.", " And it\u2019s enough, do you hear, enough. I mean even if I don\u2019t go away to\u2010morrow (I think I certainly shall go) and we meet again, don\u2019t say a word more on these subjects. I beg that particularly. And about Dmitri too, I ask you specially, never speak to me again,\u201d he added, with sudden irritation; \u201cit\u2019s all exhausted, it has all been said over and over again, hasn\u2019t it? And I\u2019ll make you one promise in return for it. When at thirty, I want to \u2018dash the cup to the ground,\u2019 wherever I may be I\u2019ll come to have one more talk with you, even though it were from America, you may be sure of that. I\u2019ll come on purpose. It will be very interesting to have a look at you, to see what you\u2019ll be by that time. It\u2019s rather a solemn promise, you see. And we really may be parting for seven years or ten. Come, go now to your Pater Seraphicus, he is dying. If he dies without you, you will be angry with me for having kept you. Good\u2010by, kiss me once more; that\u2019s right, now go.\u201d Ivan turned suddenly and went his way without looking back. It was just as Dmitri had left Alyosha the day before, though the parting had been very different. The strange resemblance flashed like an arrow through Alyosha\u2019s mind in the distress and dejection of that moment. He waited a little, looking after his brother. He suddenly noticed that Ivan swayed as he walked and that his right shoulder looked lower than his left. He had never noticed it before.", " But I am so unhappy! Though it\u2019s such nonsense, it\u2019s a great blow to me. I feel like Famusov in the last scene of _Sorrow from Wit_. You are Tchatsky and she is Sofya, and, only fancy, I\u2019ve run down to meet you on the stairs, and in the play the fatal scene takes place on the staircase. I heard it all; I almost dropped. So this is the explanation of her dreadful night and her hysterics of late! It means love to the daughter but death to the mother. I might as well be in my grave at once. And a more serious matter still, what is this letter she has written? Show it me at once, at once!\u201d \u201cNo, there\u2019s no need. Tell me, how is Katerina Ivanovna now? I must know.\u201d \u201cShe still lies in delirium; she has not regained consciousness. Her aunts are here; but they do nothing but sigh and give themselves airs. Herzenstube came, and he was so alarmed that I didn\u2019t know what to do for him. I nearly sent for a doctor to look after him. He was driven home in my carriage. And on the top of it all, you and this letter! It\u2019s true nothing can happen for a year and a half. In the name of all that\u2019s holy, in the name of your dying elder, show me that letter, Alexey Fyodorovitch. I\u2019m her mother. Hold it in your hand, if you like, and I will read it so.\u201d \u201cNo, I won\u2019t show it to you. Even if she sanctioned it, I wouldn\u2019t. I am coming to\u2010morrow, and if you like, we can talk over many things, but now good\u2010by!\u201d And Alyosha ran downstairs and into the street.", " He was weak, yellow, his hands trembled, he gasped for breath, but his face was full of tender and happy feeling. \u201cIt is done!\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve long been yearning to see you, why didn\u2019t you come?\u201d I did not tell him that they would not let me see him. \u201cGod has had pity on me and is calling me to Himself. I know I am dying, but I feel joy and peace for the first time after so many years. There was heaven in my heart from the moment I had done what I had to do. Now I dare to love my children and to kiss them. Neither my wife nor the judges, nor any one has believed it. My children will never believe it either. I see in that God\u2019s mercy to them. I shall die, and my name will be without a stain for them. And now I feel God near, my heart rejoices as in Heaven ... I have done my duty.\u201d He could not speak, he gasped for breath, he pressed my hand warmly, looking fervently at me. We did not talk for long, his wife kept peeping in at us. But he had time to whisper to me: \u201cDo you remember how I came back to you that second time, at midnight? I told you to remember it. You know what I came back for? I came to kill you!\u201d I started. \u201cI went out from you then into the darkness, I wandered about the streets, struggling with myself. And suddenly I hated you so that I could hardly bear it. Now, I thought, he is all that binds me, and he is my judge. I can\u2019t refuse to face my punishment to\u2010morrow, for he knows all."], "After Zosima\u2019s death, what do some people in the monastery expect?": [" I repeat, it is incomplete and fragmentary. Biographical details, for instance, cover only Father Zossima\u2019s earliest youth. Of his teaching and opinions we find brought together sayings evidently uttered on very different occasions. His utterances during the last few hours have not been kept separate from the rest, but their general character can be gathered from what we have in Alexey Fyodorovitch\u2019s manuscript. The elder\u2019s death came in the end quite unexpectedly. For although those who were gathered about him that last evening realized that his death was approaching, yet it was difficult to imagine that it would come so suddenly. On the contrary, his friends, as I observed already, seeing him that night apparently so cheerful and talkative, were convinced that there was at least a temporary change for the better in his condition. Even five minutes before his death, they said afterwards wonderingly, it was impossible to foresee it. He seemed suddenly to feel an acute pain in his chest, he turned pale and pressed his hands to his heart. All rose from their seats and hastened to him. But though suffering, he still looked at them with a smile, sank slowly from his chair on to his knees, then bowed his face to the ground, stretched out his arms and as though in joyful ecstasy, praying and kissing the ground, quietly and joyfully gave up his soul to God. The news of his death spread at once through the hermitage and reached the monastery.", " It was a long list. Four of the witnesses were not present\u2014Mi\u00fcsov, who had given evidence at the preliminary inquiry, but was now in Paris; Madame Hohlakov and Maximov, who were absent through illness; and Smerdyakov, through his sudden death, of which an official statement from the police was presented. The news of Smerdyakov\u2019s death produced a sudden stir and whisper in the court. Many of the audience, of course, had not heard of the sudden suicide. What struck people most was Mitya\u2019s sudden outburst. As soon as the statement of Smerdyakov\u2019s death was made, he cried out aloud from his place: \u201cHe was a dog and died like a dog!\u201d I remember how his counsel rushed to him, and how the President addressed him, threatening to take stern measures, if such an irregularity were repeated. Mitya nodded and in a subdued voice repeated several times abruptly to his counsel, with no show of regret: \u201cI won\u2019t again, I won\u2019t. It escaped me. I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d And, of course, this brief episode did him no good with the jury or the public. His character was displayed, and it spoke for itself. It was under the influence of this incident that the opening statement was read. It was rather short, but circumstantial. It only stated the chief reasons why he had been arrested, why he must be tried, and so on. Yet it made a great impression on me. The clerk read it loudly and distinctly. The whole tragedy was suddenly unfolded before us, concentrated, in bold relief, in a fatal and pitiless light.", " Alyosha told Ivan that their father had waked up, was conscious, and had let him go back to sleep at the monastery. \u201cAlyosha, I should be very glad to meet you to\u2010morrow morning,\u201d said Ivan cordially, standing up. His cordiality was a complete surprise to Alyosha. \u201cI shall be at the Hohlakovs\u2019 to\u2010morrow,\u201d answered Alyosha, \u201cI may be at Katerina Ivanovna\u2019s, too, if I don\u2019t find her now.\u201d \u201cBut you\u2019re going to her now, anyway? For that \u2018compliments and farewell,\u2019 \u201d said Ivan smiling. Alyosha was disconcerted. \u201cI think I quite understand his exclamations just now, and part of what went before. Dmitri has asked you to go to her and say that he\u2014well, in fact\u2014takes his leave of her?\u201d \u201cBrother, how will all this horror end between father and Dmitri?\u201d exclaimed Alyosha. \u201cOne can\u2019t tell for certain. Perhaps in nothing: it may all fizzle out. That woman is a beast. In any case we must keep the old man indoors and not let Dmitri in the house.\u201d \u201cBrother, let me ask one thing more: has any man a right to look at other men and decide which is worthy to live?\u201d \u201cWhy bring in the question of worth? The matter is most often decided in men\u2019s hearts on other grounds much more natural. And as for rights\u2014who has not the right to wish?\u201d \u201cNot for another man\u2019s death?\u201d \u201cWhat even if for another man\u2019s death? Why lie to oneself since all men live so and perhaps cannot help living so. Are you referring to what I said just now\u2014that one reptile will devour the other?", " \u201cThe money alone is no proof. A week ago, quite by chance, the fact came to the knowledge of myself and two other persons in this court that Ivan Fyodorovitch had sent two five per cent. coupons of five thousand each\u2014that is, ten thousand in all\u2014to the chief town of the province to be changed. I only mention this to point out that any one may have money, and that it can\u2019t be proved that these notes are the same as were in Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s envelope. \u201cIvan Karamazov, after receiving yesterday a communication of such importance from the real murderer, did not stir. Why didn\u2019t he report it at once? Why did he put it all off till morning? I think I have a right to conjecture why. His health had been giving way for a week past: he had admitted to a doctor and to his most intimate friends that he was suffering from hallucinations and seeing phantoms of the dead: he was on the eve of the attack of brain fever by which he has been stricken down to\u2010day. In this condition he suddenly heard of Smerdyakov\u2019s death, and at once reflected, \u2018The man is dead, I can throw the blame on him and save my brother. I have money. I will take a roll of notes and say that Smerdyakov gave them me before his death.\u2019 You will say that was dishonorable: it\u2019s dishonorable to slander even the dead, and even to save a brother. True, but what if he slandered him unconsciously? What if, finally unhinged by the sudden news of the valet\u2019s death, he imagined it really was so?"], "What omen causes people within the monastery to disagree about Zosima?": [" A Liberal of the forties and fifties, a freethinker and atheist, he may have been led on by boredom or the hope of frivolous diversion. He was suddenly seized with the desire to see the monastery and the holy man. As his lawsuit with the monastery still dragged on, he made it the pretext for seeing the Superior, in order to attempt to settle it amicably. A visitor coming with such laudable intentions might be received with more attention and consideration than if he came from simple curiosity. Influences from within the monastery were brought to bear on the elder, who of late had scarcely left his cell, and had been forced by illness to deny even his ordinary visitors. In the end he consented to see them, and the day was fixed. \u201cWho has made me a judge over them?\u201d was all he said, smilingly, to Alyosha. Alyosha was much perturbed when he heard of the proposed visit. Of all the wrangling, quarrelsome party, Dmitri was the only one who could regard the interview seriously. All the others would come from frivolous motives, perhaps insulting to the elder. Alyosha was well aware of that. Ivan and Mi\u00fcsov would come from curiosity, perhaps of the coarsest kind, while his father might be contemplating some piece of buffoonery. Though he said nothing, Alyosha thoroughly understood his father. The boy, I repeat, was far from being so simple as every one thought him. He awaited the day with a heavy heart.", " It is my private opinion that several different causes were simultaneously at work, one of which was the deeply\u2010rooted hostility to the institution of elders as a pernicious innovation, an antipathy hidden deep in the hearts of many of the monks. Even more powerful was jealousy of the dead man\u2019s saintliness, so firmly established during his lifetime that it was almost a forbidden thing to question it. For though the late elder had won over many hearts, more by love than by miracles, and had gathered round him a mass of loving adherents, none the less, in fact, rather the more on that account he had awakened jealousy and so had come to have bitter enemies, secret and open, not only in the monastery but in the world outside it. He did no one any harm, but \u201cWhy do they think him so saintly?\u201d And that question alone, gradually repeated, gave rise at last to an intense, insatiable hatred of him. That, I believe, was why many people were extremely delighted at the smell of decomposition which came so quickly, for not a day had passed since his death. At the same time there were some among those who had been hitherto reverently devoted to the elder, who were almost mortified and personally affronted by this incident. This was how the thing happened. As soon as signs of decomposition had begun to appear, the whole aspect of the monks betrayed their secret motives in entering the cell. They went in, stayed a little while and hastened out to confirm the news to the crowd of other monks waiting outside.", " \u201cYou have quite forgotten us, Alexey Fyodorovitch,\u201d she said; \u201cyou never come to see us. Yet Lise has told me twice that she is never happy except with you.\u201d Alyosha raised his downcast eyes and again flushed, and again smiled without knowing why. But the elder was no longer watching him. He had begun talking to a monk who, as mentioned before, had been awaiting his entrance by Lise\u2019s chair. He was evidently a monk of the humblest, that is of the peasant, class, of a narrow outlook, but a true believer, and, in his own way, a stubborn one. He announced that he had come from the far north, from Obdorsk, from Saint Sylvester, and was a member of a poor monastery, consisting of only ten monks. The elder gave him his blessing and invited him to come to his cell whenever he liked. \u201cHow can you presume to do such deeds?\u201d the monk asked suddenly, pointing solemnly and significantly at Lise. He was referring to her \u201chealing.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s too early, of course, to speak of that. Relief is not complete cure, and may proceed from different causes. But if there has been any healing, it is by no power but God\u2019s will. It\u2019s all from God. Visit me, Father,\u201d he added to the monk. \u201cIt\u2019s not often I can see visitors. I am ill, and I know that my days are numbered.\u201d \u201cOh, no, no! God will not take you from us. You will live a long, long time yet,\u201d cried the lady. \u201cAnd in what way are you ill? You look so well, so gay and happy.\u201d \u201cI am extraordinarily better to\u2010day.", " And even that austere and cautious man, though he frowned as he read the news of the \u201cmiracle,\u201d could not completely restrain some inner emotion. His eyes gleamed, and a grave and solemn smile came into his lips. \u201cWe shall see greater things!\u201d broke from him. \u201cWe shall see greater things, greater things yet!\u201d the monks around repeated. But Father Pa\u00efssy, frowning again, begged all of them, at least for a time, not to speak of the matter \u201ctill it be more fully confirmed, seeing there is so much credulity among those of this world, and indeed this might well have chanced naturally,\u201d he added, prudently, as it were to satisfy his conscience, though scarcely believing his own disavowal, a fact his listeners very clearly perceived. Within the hour the \u201cmiracle\u201d was of course known to the whole monastery, and many visitors who had come for the mass. No one seemed more impressed by it than the monk who had come the day before from St. Sylvester, from the little monastery of Obdorsk in the far North. It was he who had been standing near Madame Hohlakov the previous day and had asked Father Zossima earnestly, referring to the \u201chealing\u201d of the lady\u2019s daughter, \u201cHow can you presume to do such things?\u201d He was now somewhat puzzled and did not know whom to believe. The evening before he had visited Father Ferapont in his cell apart, behind the apiary, and had been greatly impressed and overawed by the visit."], "Who teases Alyosha about his unhappiness and convinces him to visit Grushenka?": [" Grushenka snatched the letter from her and carried it to the candle. It was only a note, a few lines. She read it in one instant. \u201cHe has sent for me,\u201d she cried, her face white and distorted, with a wan smile; \u201che whistles! Crawl back, little dog!\u201d But only for one instant she stood as though hesitating; suddenly the blood rushed to her head and sent a glow to her cheeks. \u201cI will go,\u201d she cried; \u201cfive years of my life! Good\u2010by! Good\u2010by, Alyosha, my fate is sealed. Go, go, leave me all of you, don\u2019t let me see you again! Grushenka is flying to a new life.... Don\u2019t you remember evil against me either, Rakitin. I may be going to my death! Ugh! I feel as though I were drunk!\u201d She suddenly left them and ran into her bedroom. \u201cWell, she has no thoughts for us now!\u201d grumbled Rakitin. \u201cLet\u2019s go, or we may hear that feminine shriek again. I am sick of all these tears and cries.\u201d Alyosha mechanically let himself be led out. In the yard stood a covered cart. Horses were being taken out of the shafts, men were running to and fro with a lantern. Three fresh horses were being led in at the open gate. But when Alyosha and Rakitin reached the bottom of the steps, Grushenka\u2019s bedroom window was suddenly opened and she called in a ringing voice after Alyosha: \u201cAlyosha, give my greetings to your brother Mitya and tell him not to remember evil against me, though I have brought him misery. And tell him, too, in my words: \u2018Grushenka has fallen to a scoundrel, and not to you, noble heart.\u2019 And add, too, that Grushenka loved him only one hour, only one short hour she loved him\u2014so let him remember that hour all his life\u2014say, \u2018Grushenka tells you to!\u2019 \u201d She ended in a voice full of sobs.", " I\u2019ll be back directly, but I have a great, great sorrow!\u201d And he ran out of the room. Chapter VI. A Laceration In The Cottage He certainly was really grieved in a way he had seldom been before. He had rushed in like a fool, and meddled in what? In a love\u2010affair. \u201cBut what do I know about it? What can I tell about such things?\u201d he repeated to himself for the hundredth time, flushing crimson. \u201cOh, being ashamed would be nothing; shame is only the punishment I deserve. The trouble is I shall certainly have caused more unhappiness.... And Father Zossima sent me to reconcile and bring them together. Is this the way to bring them together?\u201d Then he suddenly remembered how he had tried to join their hands, and he felt fearfully ashamed again. \u201cThough I acted quite sincerely, I must be more sensible in the future,\u201d he concluded suddenly, and did not even smile at his conclusion. Katerina Ivanovna\u2019s commission took him to Lake Street, and his brother Dmitri lived close by, in a turning out of Lake Street. Alyosha decided to go to him in any case before going to the captain, though he had a presentiment that he would not find his brother. He suspected that he would intentionally keep out of his way now, but he must find him anyhow. Time was passing: the thought of his dying elder had not left Alyosha for one minute from the time he set off from the monastery. There was one point which interested him particularly about Katerina Ivanovna\u2019s commission; when she had mentioned the captain\u2019s son, the little schoolboy who had run beside his father crying, the idea had at once struck Alyosha that this must be the schoolboy who had bitten his finger when he, Alyosha, asked him what he had done to hurt him.", " So she tried to prevent Katya, but she wouldn\u2019t listen to her! She thinks she can overcome everything, that everything will give way to her. She thought she could bewitch Grushenka if she liked, and she believed it herself: she plays a part to herself, and whose fault is it? Do you think she kissed Grushenka\u2019s hand first, on purpose, with a motive? No, she really was fascinated by Grushenka, that\u2019s to say, not by Grushenka, but by her own dream, her own delusion\u2014because it was _her_ dream, _her_ delusion! Alyosha, darling, how did you escape from them, those women? Did you pick up your cassock and run? Ha ha ha!\u201d \u201cBrother, you don\u2019t seem to have noticed how you\u2019ve insulted Katerina Ivanovna by telling Grushenka about that day. And she flung it in her face just now that she had gone to gentlemen in secret to sell her beauty! Brother, what could be worse than that insult?\u201d What worried Alyosha more than anything was that, incredible as it seemed, his brother appeared pleased at Katerina Ivanovna\u2019s humiliation. \u201cBah!\u201d Dmitri frowned fiercely, and struck his forehead with his hand. He only now realized it, though Alyosha had just told him of the insult, and Katerina Ivanovna\u2019s cry: \u201cYour brother is a scoundrel!\u201d \u201cYes, perhaps, I really did tell Grushenka about that \u2018fatal day,\u2019 as Katya calls it. Yes, I did tell her, I remember! It was that time at Mokroe. I was drunk, the gypsies were singing....", " Questioning him more in detail, Grushenka learned from him that he had literally nowhere to go, and that \u201cMr. Kalganov, my benefactor, told me straight that he wouldn\u2019t receive me again and gave me five roubles.\u201d \u201cWell, God bless you, you\u2019d better stay, then,\u201d Grushenka decided in her grief, smiling compassionately at him. Her smile wrung the old man\u2019s heart and his lips twitched with grateful tears. And so the destitute wanderer had stayed with her ever since. He did not leave the house even when she was ill. Fenya and her grandmother, the cook, did not turn him out, but went on serving him meals and making up his bed on the sofa. Grushenka had grown used to him, and coming back from seeing Mitya (whom she had begun to visit in prison before she was really well) she would sit down and begin talking to \u201cMaximushka\u201d about trifling matters, to keep her from thinking of her sorrow. The old man turned out to be a good story\u2010teller on occasions, so that at last he became necessary to her. Grushenka saw scarcely any one else beside Alyosha, who did not come every day and never stayed long. Her old merchant lay seriously ill at this time, \u201cat his last gasp\u201d as they said in the town, and he did, in fact, die a week after Mitya\u2019s trial. Three weeks before his death, feeling the end approaching, he made his sons, their wives and children, come upstairs to him at last and bade them not leave him again."], "When Alyosha and Rakitin arrive, Grushenka tells them that she is awaiting a message from whom?": [" The window was shut with a slam. \u201cH\u2019m, h\u2019m!\u201d growled Rakitin, laughing, \u201cshe murders your brother Mitya and then tells him to remember it all his life! What ferocity!\u201d Alyosha made no reply, he seemed not to have heard. He walked fast beside Rakitin as though in a terrible hurry. He was lost in thought and moved mechanically. Rakitin felt a sudden twinge as though he had been touched on an open wound. He had expected something quite different by bringing Grushenka and Alyosha together. Something very different from what he had hoped for had happened. \u201cHe is a Pole, that officer of hers,\u201d he began again, restraining himself; \u201cand indeed he is not an officer at all now. He served in the customs in Siberia, somewhere on the Chinese frontier, some puny little beggar of a Pole, I expect. Lost his job, they say. He\u2019s heard now that Grushenka\u2019s saved a little money, so he\u2019s turned up again\u2014that\u2019s the explanation of the mystery.\u201d Again Alyosha seemed not to hear. Rakitin could not control himself. \u201cWell, so you\u2019ve saved the sinner?\u201d he laughed spitefully. \u201cHave you turned the Magdalene into the true path? Driven out the seven devils, eh? So you see the miracles you were looking out for just now have come to pass!\u201d \u201cHush, Rakitin,\u201d Alyosha answered with an aching heart. \u201cSo you despise me now for those twenty\u2010five roubles? I\u2019ve sold my friend, you think. But you are not Christ, you know, and I am not Judas.\u201d \u201cOh, Rakitin, I assure you I\u2019d forgotten about it,\u201d cried Alyosha, \u201cyou remind me of it yourself....\u201d But this was the last straw for Rakitin.", " You\u2019ve raised my soul from the depths.\u201d Alyosha\u2019s lips were quivering and he caught his breath. \u201cShe has saved you, it seems,\u201d laughed Rakitin spitefully. \u201cAnd she meant to get you in her clutches, do you realize that?\u201d \u201cStay, Rakitin.\u201d Grushenka jumped up. \u201cHush, both of you. Now I\u2019ll tell you all about it. Hush, Alyosha, your words make me ashamed, for I am bad and not good\u2014that\u2019s what I am. And you hush, Rakitin, because you are telling lies. I had the low idea of trying to get him in my clutches, but now you are lying, now it\u2019s all different. And don\u2019t let me hear anything more from you, Rakitin.\u201d All this Grushenka said with extreme emotion. \u201cThey are both crazy,\u201d said Rakitin, looking at them with amazement. \u201cI feel as though I were in a madhouse. They\u2019re both getting so feeble they\u2019ll begin crying in a minute.\u201d \u201cI shall begin to cry, I shall,\u201d repeated Grushenka. \u201cHe called me his sister and I shall never forget that. Only let me tell you, Rakitin, though I am bad, I did give away an onion.\u201d \u201cAn onion? Hang it all, you really are crazy.\u201d Rakitin wondered at their enthusiasm. He was aggrieved and annoyed, though he might have reflected that each of them was just passing through a spiritual crisis such as does not come often in a lifetime. But though Rakitin was very sensitive about everything that concerned himself, he was very obtuse as regards the feelings and sensations of others\u2014partly from his youth and inexperience, partly from his intense egoism.", " Grushenka snatched the letter from her and carried it to the candle. It was only a note, a few lines. She read it in one instant. \u201cHe has sent for me,\u201d she cried, her face white and distorted, with a wan smile; \u201che whistles! Crawl back, little dog!\u201d But only for one instant she stood as though hesitating; suddenly the blood rushed to her head and sent a glow to her cheeks. \u201cI will go,\u201d she cried; \u201cfive years of my life! Good\u2010by! Good\u2010by, Alyosha, my fate is sealed. Go, go, leave me all of you, don\u2019t let me see you again! Grushenka is flying to a new life.... Don\u2019t you remember evil against me either, Rakitin. I may be going to my death! Ugh!

Though I am so stingy, I\u2019ll stand a bottle, not for you, Rakitin, you\u2019re a toadstool, but he is a falcon! And though my heart is full of something very different, so be it, I\u2019ll drink with you. I long for some dissipation.\u201d \u201cBut what is the matter with you? And what is this message, may I ask, or is it a secret?\u201d Rakitin put in inquisitively, doing his best to pretend not to notice the snubs that were being continually aimed at him. \u201cEch, it\u2019s not a secret, and you know it, too,\u201d Grushenka said, in a voice suddenly anxious, turning her head towards Rakitin, and drawing a little away from Alyosha, though she still sat on his knee with her arm round his neck. \u201cMy officer is coming, Rakitin, my officer is coming.\u201d \u201cI heard he was coming, but is he so near?\u201d \u201cHe is at Mokroe now; he\u2019ll send a messenger from there, so he wrote; I got a letter from him to\u2010day. I am expecting the messenger every minute.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t say so! Why at Mokroe?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a long story, I\u2019ve told you enough.\u201d \u201cMitya\u2019ll be up to something now\u2014I say! Does he know or doesn\u2019t he?\u201d \u201cHe know! Of course he doesn\u2019t. If he knew, there would be murder. But I am not afraid of that now, I am not afraid of his knife. Be quiet, Rakitin, don\u2019t remind me of Dmitri Fyodorovitch, he has bruised my heart. And I don\u2019t want to think of that at this moment. I can think of Alyosha here, I can look at Alyosha ... smile at me, dear, cheer up, smile at my foolishness, at my pleasure.... Ah, he\u2019s smiling, he\u2019s smiling!"], "In a dream, Zosima tells Alyosha that he has redeemed whom?": [" Lucky fellow! Listen, your brother is being tried now for murdering his father and every one loves his having killed his father.\u201d \u201cLoves his having killed his father?\u201d \u201cYes, loves it; every one loves it! Everybody says it\u2019s so awful, but secretly they simply love it. I for one love it.\u201d \u201cThere is some truth in what you say about every one,\u201d said Alyosha softly. \u201cOh, what ideas you have!\u201d Lise shrieked in delight. \u201cAnd you a monk, too! You wouldn\u2019t believe how I respect you, Alyosha, for never telling lies. Oh, I must tell you a funny dream of mine. I sometimes dream of devils. It\u2019s night; I am in my room with a candle and suddenly there are devils all over the place, in all the corners, under the table, and they open the doors; there\u2019s a crowd of them behind the doors and they want to come and seize me. And they are just coming, just seizing me. But I suddenly cross myself and they all draw back, though they don\u2019t go away altogether, they stand at the doors and in the corners, waiting. And suddenly I have a frightful longing to revile God aloud, and so I begin, and then they come crowding back to me, delighted, and seize me again and I cross myself again and they all draw back. It\u2019s awful fun. it takes one\u2019s breath away.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve had the same dream, too,\u201d said Alyosha suddenly. \u201cReally?\u201d cried Lise, surprised. \u201cI say, Alyosha, don\u2019t laugh, that\u2019s awfully important. Could two different people have the same dream?\u201d \u201cIt seems they can.\u201d \u201cAlyosha, I tell you, it\u2019s awfully important,\u201d Lise went on, with really excessive amazement.", " He had, in fact, an awful inclination to get up and declare that he wouldn\u2019t say another word, \u201cnot if you hang me for it.\u201d \u201cYou see, gentlemen,\u201d he said at last, with difficulty controlling himself, \u201cyou see. I listen to you and am haunted by a dream.... It\u2019s a dream I have sometimes, you know.... I often dream it\u2014it\u2019s always the same ... that some one is hunting me, some one I\u2019m awfully afraid of ... that he\u2019s hunting me in the dark, in the night ... tracking me, and I hide somewhere from him, behind a door or cupboard, hide in a degrading way, and the worst of it is, he always knows where I am, but he pretends not to know where I am on purpose, to prolong my agony, to enjoy my terror.... That\u2019s just what you\u2019re doing now. It\u2019s just like that!\u201d \u201cIs that the sort of thing you dream about?\u201d inquired the prosecutor. \u201cYes, it is. Don\u2019t you want to write it down?\u201d said Mitya, with a distorted smile. \u201cNo; no need to write it down. But still you do have curious dreams.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of dreams now, gentlemen\u2014this is realism, this is real life! I\u2019m a wolf and you\u2019re the hunters. Well, hunt him down!\u201d \u201cYou are wrong to make such comparisons ...\u201d began Nikolay Parfenovitch, with extraordinary softness. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not wrong, not at all!\u201d Mitya flared up again, though his outburst of wrath had obviously relieved his heart. He grew more good\u2010 humored at every word. \u201cYou may not trust a criminal or a man on trial tortured by your questions, but an honorable man, the honorable impulses of the heart (I say that boldly!)\u2014no!", " Ivan wanted to rush to the window, but something seemed to fetter his arms and legs. He strained every effort to break his chains, but in vain. The knocking at the window grew louder and louder. At last the chains were broken and Ivan leapt up from the sofa. He looked round him wildly. Both candles had almost burnt out, the glass he had just thrown at his visitor stood before him on the table, and there was no one on the sofa opposite. The knocking on the window frame went on persistently, but it was by no means so loud as it had seemed in his dream; on the contrary, it was quite subdued. \u201cIt was not a dream! No, I swear it was not a dream, it all happened just now!\u201d cried Ivan. He rushed to the window and opened the movable pane. \u201cAlyosha, I told you not to come,\u201d he cried fiercely to his brother. \u201cIn two words, what do you want? In two words, do you hear?\u201d \u201cAn hour ago Smerdyakov hanged himself,\u201d Alyosha answered from the yard. \u201cCome round to the steps, I\u2019ll open at once,\u201d said Ivan, going to open the door to Alyosha. Chapter X. \u201cIt Was He Who Said That\u201d Alyosha coming in told Ivan that a little over an hour ago Marya Kondratyevna had run to his rooms and informed him Smerdyakov had taken his own life. \u201cI went in to clear away the samovar and he was hanging on a nail in the wall.\u201d On Alyosha\u2019s inquiring whether she had informed the police, she answered that she had told no one, \u201cbut I flew straight to you, I\u2019ve run all the way.\u201d She seemed perfectly crazy, Alyosha reported, and was shaking like a leaf.", " I know! He was cheerful before, though, indeed, he is cheerful to\u2010day.\u201d \u201cBut you said he was worried.\u201d \u201cYes, he is worried and yet cheerful. He keeps on being irritable for a minute and then cheerful and then irritable again. And you know, Alyosha, I am constantly wondering at him\u2014with this awful thing hanging over him, he sometimes laughs at such trifles as though he were a baby himself.\u201d \u201cAnd did he really tell you not to tell me about Ivan? Did he say, \u2018Don\u2019t tell him\u2019?\u201d \u201cYes, he told me, \u2018Don\u2019t tell him.\u2019 It\u2019s you that Mitya\u2019s most afraid of. Because it\u2019s a secret: he said himself it was a secret. Alyosha, darling, go to him and find out what their secret is and come and tell me,\u201d Grushenka besought him with sudden eagerness. \u201cSet my mind at rest that I may know the worst that\u2019s in store for me. That\u2019s why I sent for you.\u201d \u201cYou think it\u2019s something to do with you? If it were, he wouldn\u2019t have told you there was a secret.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. Perhaps he wants to tell me, but doesn\u2019t dare to. He warns me. There is a secret, he tells me, but he won\u2019t tell me what it is.\u201d \u201cWhat do you think yourself?\u201d \u201cWhat do I think? It\u2019s the end for me, that\u2019s what I think. They all three have been plotting my end, for Katerina\u2019s in it. It\u2019s all Katerina, it all comes from her. She is this and that, and that means that I am not. He tells me that beforehand\u2014warns me. He is planning to throw me over, that\u2019s the whole secret."], "What does Dmitri attempt to sell to merchants?": [" Chapter II. Smerdyakov With A Guitar He had no time to lose indeed. Even while he was saying good\u2010by to Lise, the thought had struck him that he must attempt some stratagem to find his brother Dmitri, who was evidently keeping out of his way. It was getting late, nearly three o\u2019clock. Alyosha\u2019s whole soul turned to the monastery, to his dying saint, but the necessity of seeing Dmitri outweighed everything. The conviction that a great inevitable catastrophe was about to happen grew stronger in Alyosha\u2019s mind with every hour. What that catastrophe was, and what he would say at that moment to his brother, he could perhaps not have said definitely. \u201cEven if my benefactor must die without me, anyway I won\u2019t have to reproach myself all my life with the thought that I might have saved something and did not, but passed by and hastened home. If I do as I intend, I shall be following his great precept.\u201d His plan was to catch his brother Dmitri unawares, to climb over the fence, as he had the day before, get into the garden and sit in the summer\u2010house. If Dmitri were not there, thought Alyosha, he would not announce himself to Foma or the women of the house, but would remain hidden in the summer\u2010house, even if he had to wait there till evening. If, as before, Dmitri were lying in wait for Grushenka to come, he would be very likely to come to the summer\u2010house. Alyosha did not, however, give much thought to the details of his plan, but resolved to act upon it, even if it meant not getting back to the monastery that day.", " Let him read them how the brothers afterwards journeyed into Egypt for corn, and Joseph, already a great ruler, unrecognized by them, tormented them, accused them, kept his brother Benjamin, and all through love: \u201cI love you, and loving you I torment you.\u201d For he remembered all his life how they had sold him to the merchants in the burning desert by the well, and how, wringing his hands, he had wept and besought his brothers not to sell him as a slave in a strange land. And how, seeing them again after many years, he loved them beyond measure, but he harassed and tormented them in love. He left them at last not able to bear the suffering of his heart, flung himself on his bed and wept. Then, wiping his tears away, he went out to them joyful and told them, \u201cBrothers, I am your brother Joseph!\u201d Let him read them further how happy old Jacob was on learning that his darling boy was still alive, and how he went to Egypt leaving his own country, and died in a foreign land, bequeathing his great prophecy that had lain mysteriously hidden in his meek and timid heart all his life, that from his offspring, from Judah, will come the great hope of the world, the Messiah and Saviour. Fathers and teachers, forgive me and don\u2019t be angry, that like a little child I\u2019ve been babbling of what you know long ago, and can teach me a hundred times more skillfully. I only speak from rapture, and forgive my tears, for I love the Bible.", " He was trembling all over. He seemed frantic. \u201cBut you\u2019ve seen for yourself that she hasn\u2019t come,\u201d cried Ivan. \u201cBut she may have come by that other entrance.\u201d \u201cYou know that entrance is locked, and you have the key.\u201d Dmitri suddenly reappeared in the drawing\u2010room. He had, of course, found the other entrance locked, and the key actually was in Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s pocket. The windows of all the rooms were also closed, so Grushenka could not have come in anywhere nor have run out anywhere. \u201cHold him!\u201d shrieked Fyodor Pavlovitch, as soon as he saw him again. \u201cHe\u2019s been stealing money in my bedroom.\u201d And tearing himself from Ivan he rushed again at Dmitri. But Dmitri threw up both hands and suddenly clutched the old man by the two tufts of hair that remained on his temples, tugged at them, and flung him with a crash on the floor. He kicked him two or three times with his heel in the face. The old man moaned shrilly. Ivan, though not so strong as Dmitri, threw his arms round him, and with all his might pulled him away. Alyosha helped him with his slender strength, holding Dmitri in front. \u201cMadman! You\u2019ve killed him!\u201d cried Ivan. \u201cServe him right!\u201d shouted Dmitri breathlessly. \u201cIf I haven\u2019t killed him, I\u2019ll come again and kill him. You can\u2019t protect him!\u201d \u201cDmitri! Go away at once!\u201d cried Alyosha commandingly. \u201cAlexey! You tell me. It\u2019s only you I can believe; was she here just now, or not?", " Dmitri\u2014despises her,\u201d said Alyosha, with a sort of shudder. \u201cGrushenka? No, brother, he doesn\u2019t despise her. Since he has openly abandoned his betrothed for her, he doesn\u2019t despise her. There\u2019s something here, my dear boy, that you don\u2019t understand yet. A man will fall in love with some beauty, with a woman\u2019s body, or even with a part of a woman\u2019s body (a sensualist can understand that), and he\u2019ll abandon his own children for her, sell his father and mother, and his country, Russia, too. If he\u2019s honest, he\u2019ll steal; if he\u2019s humane, he\u2019ll murder; if he\u2019s faithful, he\u2019ll deceive. Pushkin, the poet of women\u2019s feet, sung of their feet in his verse. Others don\u2019t sing their praises, but they can\u2019t look at their feet without a thrill\u2014and it\u2019s not only their feet. Contempt\u2019s no help here, brother, even if he did despise Grushenka. He does, but he can\u2019t tear himself away.\u201d \u201cI understand that,\u201d Alyosha jerked out suddenly. \u201cReally? Well, I dare say you do understand, since you blurt it out at the first word,\u201d said Rakitin, malignantly. \u201cThat escaped you unawares, and the confession\u2019s the more precious. So it\u2019s a familiar subject; you\u2019ve thought about it already, about sensuality, I mean! Oh, you virgin soul! You\u2019re a quiet one, Alyosha, you\u2019re a saint, I know, but the devil only knows what you\u2019ve thought about, and what you know already!

Are we to leave it all to the Jews? You will found institutions and enterprises of all sorts. You will help the poor, and they will bless you. This is the age of railways, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You\u2019ll become famous and indispensable to the Department of Finance, which is so badly off at present.

But Dmitri threw up both hands and suddenly clutched the old man by the two tufts of hair that remained on his temples, tugged at them, and flung him with a crash on the floor. He kicked him two or three times with his heel in the face. The old man moaned shrilly. Ivan, though not so strong as Dmitri, threw his arms round him, and with all his might pulled him away. Alyosha helped him with his slender strength, holding Dmitri in front. \u201cMadman!

What have I to do with it? Am I my brother Dmitri\u2019s keeper?\u201d Ivan snapped irritably, but then he suddenly smiled bitterly. \u201cCain\u2019s answer about his murdered brother, wasn\u2019t it? Perhaps that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking at this moment? Well, damn it all, I can\u2019t stay here to be their keeper, can I? I\u2019ve finished what I had to do, and I am going. Do you imagine I am jealous of Dmitri, that I\u2019ve been trying to steal his beautiful Katerina Ivanovna for the last three months? Nonsense, I had business of my own. I finished it. I am going. I finished it just now, you were witness.\u201d \u201cAt Katerina Ivanovna\u2019s?\u201d \u201cYes, and I\u2019ve released myself once for all. And after all, what have I to do with Dmitri? Dmitri doesn\u2019t come in. I had my own business to settle with Katerina Ivanovna. You know, on the contrary, that Dmitri behaved as though there was an understanding between us. I didn\u2019t ask him to do it, but he solemnly handed her over to me and gave us his blessing. It\u2019s all too funny. Ah, Alyosha, if you only knew how light my heart is now! Would you believe, it, I sat here eating my dinner and was nearly ordering champagne to celebrate my first hour of freedom. Tfoo! It\u2019s been going on nearly six months, and all at once I\u2019ve thrown it off. I could never have guessed even yesterday, how easy it would be to put an end to it if I wanted.\u201d \u201cYou are speaking of your love, Ivan?\u201d \u201cOf my love, if you like.", " It\u2019s appalling!

A Laceration In The Drawing\u2010Room But in the drawing\u2010room the conversation was already over. Katerina Ivanovna was greatly excited, though she looked resolute. At the moment Alyosha and Madame Hohlakov entered, Ivan Fyodorovitch stood up to take leave. His face was rather pale, and Alyosha looked at him anxiously. For this moment was to solve a doubt, a harassing enigma which had for some time haunted Alyosha. During the preceding month it had been several times suggested to him that his brother Ivan was in love with Katerina Ivanovna, and, what was more, that he meant \u201cto carry her off\u201d from Dmitri. Until quite lately the idea seemed to Alyosha monstrous, though it worried him extremely. He loved both his brothers, and dreaded such rivalry between them. Meantime, Dmitri had said outright on the previous day that he was glad that Ivan was his rival, and that it was a great assistance to him, Dmitri. In what way did it assist him? To marry Grushenka? But that Alyosha considered the worst thing possible. Besides all this, Alyosha had till the evening before implicitly believed that Katerina Ivanovna had a steadfast and passionate love for Dmitri; but he had only believed it till the evening before. He had fancied, too, that she was incapable of loving a man like Ivan, and that she did love Dmitri, and loved him just as he was, in spite of all the strangeness of such a passion."], "At Fyodor\u2019s house, Dmitri does what to determine that Grushenka is not there?": [" From some rumor, or perhaps from some stray word of Grushenka\u2019s, he had gathered further that the old man would perhaps prefer him to Fyodor Pavlovitch for Grushenka. Possibly many of the readers of my novel will feel that in reckoning on such assistance, and being ready to take his bride, so to speak, from the hands of her protector, Dmitri showed great coarseness and want of delicacy. I will only observe that Mitya looked upon Grushenka\u2019s past as something completely over. He looked on that past with infinite pity and resolved with all the fervor of his passion that when once Grushenka told him she loved him and would marry him, it would mean the beginning of a new Grushenka and a new Dmitri, free from every vice. They would forgive one another and would begin their lives afresh. As for Kuzma Samsonov, Dmitri looked upon him as a man who had exercised a fateful influence in that remote past of Grushenka\u2019s, though she had never loved him, and who was now himself a thing of the past, completely done with, and, so to say, non\u2010existent. Besides, Mitya hardly looked upon him as a man at all, for it was known to every one in the town that he was only a shattered wreck, whose relations with Grushenka had changed their character and were now simply paternal, and that this had been so for a long time. In any case there was much simplicity on Mitya\u2019s part in all this, for in spite of all his vices, he was a very simple\u2010hearted man.", " Seeing this, Dmitri uttered a scream rather than a shout and rushed at Grigory. \u201cThen she\u2019s there! She\u2019s hidden there! Out of the way, scoundrel!\u201d He tried to pull Grigory away, but the old servant pushed him back. Beside himself with fury, Dmitri struck out, and hit Grigory with all his might. The old man fell like a log, and Dmitri, leaping over him, broke in the door. Smerdyakov remained pale and trembling at the other end of the room, huddling close to Fyodor Pavlovitch. \u201cShe\u2019s here!\u201d shouted Dmitri. \u201cI saw her turn towards the house just now, but I couldn\u2019t catch her. Where is she? Where is she?\u201d That shout, \u201cShe\u2019s here!\u201d produced an indescribable effect on Fyodor Pavlovitch. All his terror left him. \u201cHold him! Hold him!\u201d he cried, and dashed after Dmitri. Meanwhile Grigory had got up from the floor, but still seemed stunned. Ivan and Alyosha ran after their father. In the third room something was heard to fall on the floor with a ringing crash: it was a large glass vase\u2014not an expensive one\u2014on a marble pedestal which Dmitri had upset as he ran past it. \u201cAt him!\u201d shouted the old man. \u201cHelp!\u201d Ivan and Alyosha caught the old man and were forcibly bringing him back. \u201cWhy do you run after him? He\u2019ll murder you outright,\u201d Ivan cried wrathfully at his father. \u201cIvan! Alyosha! She must be here. Grushenka\u2019s here. He said he saw her himself, running.\u201d He was choking. He was not expecting Grushenka at the time, and the sudden news that she was here made him beside himself.", " Chapter II. Smerdyakov With A Guitar He had no time to lose indeed. Even while he was saying good\u2010by to Lise, the thought had struck him that he must attempt some stratagem to find his brother Dmitri, who was evidently keeping out of his way. It was getting late, nearly three o\u2019clock. Alyosha\u2019s whole soul turned to the monastery, to his dying saint, but the necessity of seeing Dmitri outweighed everything. The conviction that a great inevitable catastrophe was about to happen grew stronger in Alyosha\u2019s mind with every hour. What that catastrophe was, and what he would say at that moment to his brother, he could perhaps not have said definitely. \u201cEven if my benefactor must die without me, anyway I won\u2019t have to reproach myself all my life with the thought that I might have saved something and did not, but passed by and hastened home. If I do as I intend, I shall be following his great precept.\u201d His plan was to catch his brother Dmitri unawares, to climb over the fence, as he had the day before, get into the garden and sit in the summer\u2010house. If Dmitri were not there, thought Alyosha, he would not announce himself to Foma or the women of the house, but would remain hidden in the summer\u2010house, even if he had to wait there till evening. If, as before, Dmitri were lying in wait for Grushenka to come, he would be very likely to come to the summer\u2010house. Alyosha did not, however, give much thought to the details of his plan, but resolved to act upon it, even if it meant not getting back to the monastery that day.", " He was trembling all over. He seemed frantic. \u201cBut you\u2019ve seen for yourself that she hasn\u2019t come,\u201d cried Ivan. \u201cBut she may have come by that other entrance.\u201d \u201cYou know that entrance is locked, and you have the key.\u201d Dmitri suddenly reappeared in the drawing\u2010room.

It\u2019s only you I can believe; was she here just now, or not?"], "Whom does Dmitri attack with the pestle?": [" But did he murder him after all? The charge of robbery I repudiate with indignation. A man cannot be accused of robbery, if it\u2019s impossible to state accurately what he has stolen; that\u2019s an axiom. But did he murder him without robbery, did he murder him at all? Is that proved? Isn\u2019t that, too, a romance?\u201d Chapter XII. And There Was No Murder Either \u201cAllow me, gentlemen of the jury, to remind you that a man\u2019s life is at stake and that you must be careful. We have heard the prosecutor himself admit that until to\u2010day he hesitated to accuse the prisoner of a full and conscious premeditation of the crime; he hesitated till he saw that fatal drunken letter which was produced in court to\u2010day. \u2018All was done as written.\u2019 But, I repeat again, he was running to her, to seek her, solely to find out where she was. That\u2019s a fact that can\u2019t be disputed. Had she been at home, he would not have run away, but would have remained at her side, and so would not have done what he promised in the letter. He ran unexpectedly and accidentally, and by that time very likely he did not even remember his drunken letter. \u2018He snatched up the pestle,\u2019 they say, and you will remember how a whole edifice of psychology was built on that pestle\u2014why he was bound to look at that pestle as a weapon, to snatch it up, and so on, and so on. A very commonplace idea occurs to me at this point: What if that pestle had not been in sight, had not been lying on the shelf from which it was snatched by the prisoner, but had been put away in a cupboard?", " He was feeling more and more ashamed at having told \u201csuch people\u201d the story of his jealousy so sincerely and spontaneously. \u201cBother the pestle!\u201d broke from him suddenly. \u201cBut still\u2014\u201d \u201cOh, to keep off dogs.... Oh, because it was dark.... In case anything turned up.\u201d \u201cBut have you ever on previous occasions taken a weapon with you when you went out, since you\u2019re afraid of the dark?\u201d \u201cUgh! damn it all, gentlemen! There\u2019s positively no talking to you!\u201d cried Mitya, exasperated beyond endurance, and turning to the secretary, crimson with anger, he said quickly, with a note of fury in his voice: \u201cWrite down at once ... at once ... \u2018that I snatched up the pestle to go and kill my father ... Fyodor Pavlovitch ... by hitting him on the head with it!\u2019 Well, now are you satisfied, gentlemen? Are your minds relieved?\u201d he said, glaring defiantly at the lawyers. \u201cWe quite understand that you made that statement just now through exasperation with us and the questions we put to you, which you consider trivial, though they are, in fact, essential,\u201d the prosecutor remarked dryly in reply. \u201cWell, upon my word, gentlemen! Yes, I took the pestle.... What does one pick things up for at such moments? I don\u2019t know what for. I snatched it up and ran\u2014that\u2019s all. For to me, gentlemen, _passons_, or I declare I won\u2019t tell you any more.\u201d He sat with his elbows on the table and his head in his hand. He sat sideways to them and gazed at the wall, struggling against a feeling of nausea.", " \u201cAie! Aie!\u201d shrieked the old woman, but Mitya had vanished. He ran with all his might to the house where Grushenka lived. At the moment he reached it, Grushenka was on her way to Mokroe. It was not more than a quarter of an hour after her departure. Fenya was sitting with her grandmother, the old cook, Matryona, in the kitchen when \u201cthe captain\u201d ran in. Fenya uttered a piercing shriek on seeing him. \u201cYou scream?\u201d roared Mitya, \u201cwhere is she?\u201d But without giving the terror\u2010stricken Fenya time to utter a word, he fell all of a heap at her feet. \u201cFenya, for Christ\u2019s sake, tell me, where is she?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. Dmitri Fyodorovitch, my dear, I don\u2019t know. You may kill me but I can\u2019t tell you.\u201d Fenya swore and protested. \u201cYou went out with her yourself not long ago\u2014\u201d \u201cShe came back!\u201d \u201cIndeed she didn\u2019t. By God I swear she didn\u2019t come back.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re lying!\u201d shouted Mitya. \u201cFrom your terror I know where she is.\u201d He rushed away. Fenya in her fright was glad she had got off so easily. But she knew very well that it was only that he was in such haste, or she might not have fared so well. But as he ran, he surprised both Fenya and old Matryona by an unexpected action. On the table stood a brass mortar, with a pestle in it, a small brass pestle, not much more than six inches long. Mitya already had opened the door with one hand when, with the other, he snatched up the pestle, and thrust it in his side\u2010pocket.", " He reached the fence at the very moment the man was climbing over it. Grigory cried out, beside himself, pounced on him, and clutched his leg in his two hands. Yes, his foreboding had not deceived him. He recognized him, it was he, the \u201cmonster,\u201d the \u201cparricide.\u201d \u201cParricide!\u201d the old man shouted so that the whole neighborhood could hear, but he had not time to shout more, he fell at once, as though struck by lightning. Mitya jumped back into the garden and bent over the fallen man. In Mitya\u2019s hands was a brass pestle, and he flung it mechanically in the grass. The pestle fell two paces from Grigory, not in the grass but on the path, in a most conspicuous place. For some seconds he examined the prostrate figure before him. The old man\u2019s head was covered with blood. Mitya put out his hand and began feeling it. He remembered afterwards clearly, that he had been awfully anxious to make sure whether he had broken the old man\u2019s skull, or simply stunned him with the pestle. But the blood was flowing horribly; and in a moment Mitya\u2019s fingers were drenched with the hot stream. He remembered taking out of his pocket the clean white handkerchief with which he had provided himself for his visit to Madame Hohlakov, and putting it to the old man\u2019s head, senselessly trying to wipe the blood from his face and temples. But the handkerchief was instantly soaked with blood. \u201cGood heavens! what am I doing it for?\u201d thought Mitya, suddenly pulling himself together."], "After Dmitri is reunited with Grushenka, officers arrive and arrest whom for the murder of Fyodor?": [" Seeing this, Dmitri uttered a scream rather than a shout and rushed at Grigory. \u201cThen she\u2019s there!

Questioning Fenya, Alyosha learned that her mistress had been particularly distressed since the previous day. During the two months that had passed since Mitya\u2019s arrest, Alyosha had called frequently at the widow Morozov\u2019s house, both from his own inclination and to take messages for Mitya. Three days after Mitya\u2019s arrest, Grushenka was taken very ill and was ill for nearly five weeks. For one whole week she was unconscious.

He kicked him two or three times with his heel in the face. The old man moaned shrilly. Ivan, though not so strong as Dmitri, threw his arms round him, and with all his might pulled him away. Alyosha helped him with his slender strength, holding Dmitri in front. \u201cMadman! You\u2019ve killed him!\u201d cried Ivan. \u201cServe him right!\u201d shouted Dmitri breathlessly. \u201cIf I haven\u2019t killed him, I\u2019ll come again and kill him. You can\u2019t protect him!\u201d \u201cDmitri! Go away at once!\u201d cried Alyosha commandingly. \u201cAlexey! You tell me. It\u2019s only you I can believe; was she here just now, or not?", " At first he was worried at the arrest of the servant, but his illness and death soon set his mind at rest, for the man\u2019s death was apparently (so he reflected at the time) not owing to his arrest or his fright, but a chill he had taken on the day he ran away, when he had lain all night dead drunk on the damp ground. The theft of the money and other things troubled him little, for he argued that the theft had not been committed for gain but to avert suspicion. The sum stolen was small, and he shortly afterwards subscribed the whole of it, and much more, towards the funds for maintaining an almshouse in the town. He did this on purpose to set his conscience at rest about the theft, and it\u2019s a remarkable fact that for a long time he really was at peace\u2014he told me this himself. He entered then upon a career of great activity in the service, volunteered for a difficult and laborious duty, which occupied him two years, and being a man of strong will almost forgot the past. Whenever he recalled it, he tried not to think of it at all. He became active in philanthropy too, founded and helped to maintain many institutions in the town, did a good deal in the two capitals, and in both Moscow and Petersburg was elected a member of philanthropic societies. At last, however, he began brooding over the past, and the strain of it was too much for him. Then he was attracted by a fine and intelligent girl and soon after married her, hoping that marriage would dispel his lonely depression, and that by entering on a new life and scrupulously doing his duty to his wife and children, he would escape from old memories altogether.", " \u201cBut are you really going so soon, brother?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWhat of Dmitri and father? how will it end?\u201d asked Alyosha anxiously. \u201cYou are always harping upon it! What have I to do with it? Am I my brother Dmitri\u2019s keeper?\u201d Ivan snapped irritably, but then he suddenly smiled bitterly. \u201cCain\u2019s answer about his murdered brother, wasn\u2019t it? Perhaps that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking at this moment? Well, damn it all, I can\u2019t stay here to be their keeper, can I? I\u2019ve finished what I had to do, and I am going. Do you imagine I am jealous of Dmitri, that I\u2019ve been trying to steal his beautiful Katerina Ivanovna for the last three months? Nonsense, I had business of my own. I finished it. I am going. I finished it just now, you were witness.\u201d \u201cAt Katerina Ivanovna\u2019s?\u201d \u201cYes, and I\u2019ve released myself once for all. And after all, what have I to do with Dmitri? Dmitri doesn\u2019t come in. I had my own business to settle with Katerina Ivanovna. You know, on the contrary, that Dmitri behaved as though there was an understanding between us. I didn\u2019t ask him to do it, but he solemnly handed her over to me and gave us his blessing. It\u2019s all too funny. Ah, Alyosha, if you only knew how light my heart is now! Would you believe, it, I sat here eating my dinner and was nearly ordering champagne to celebrate my first hour of freedom. Tfoo! It\u2019s been going on nearly six months, and all at once I\u2019ve thrown it off. I could never have guessed even yesterday, how easy it would be to put an end to it if I wanted.\u201d \u201cYou are speaking of your love, Ivan?\u201d \u201cOf my love, if you like.", " Seeing this, Dmitri uttered a scream rather than a shout and rushed at Grigory. \u201cThen she\u2019s there! She\u2019s hidden there! Out of the way, scoundrel!\u201d He tried to pull Grigory away, but the old servant pushed him back. Beside himself with fury, Dmitri struck out, and hit Grigory with all his might. The old man fell like a log, and Dmitri, leaping over him, broke in the door. Smerdyakov remained pale and trembling at the other end of the room, huddling close to Fyodor Pavlovitch. \u201cShe\u2019s here!\u201d shouted Dmitri. \u201cI saw her turn towards the house just now, but I couldn\u2019t catch her. Where is she? Where is she?\u201d That shout, \u201cShe\u2019s here!\u201d produced an indescribable effect on Fyodor Pavlovitch. All his terror left him. \u201cHold him! Hold him!\u201d he cried, and dashed after Dmitri. Meanwhile Grigory had got up from the floor, but still seemed stunned. Ivan and Alyosha ran after their father. In the third room something was heard to fall on the floor with a ringing crash: it was a large glass vase\u2014not an expensive one\u2014on a marble pedestal which Dmitri had upset as he ran past it. \u201cAt him!\u201d shouted the old man. \u201cHelp!\u201d Ivan and Alyosha caught the old man and were forcibly bringing him back. \u201cWhy do you run after him? He\u2019ll murder you outright,\u201d Ivan cried wrathfully at his father. \u201cIvan! Alyosha! She must be here. Grushenka\u2019s here. He said he saw her himself, running.\u201d He was choking. He was not expecting Grushenka at the time, and the sudden news that she was here made him beside himself."], "How does Grushenka react when Dmitri is accused of murdering Fyodor?": [" Why not accept such an interpretation of the facts? What trustworthy proof have we that the prisoner is lying? \u201cBut we shall be told at once again, \u2018There is his father\u2019s corpse! If he ran away without murdering him, who did murder him?\u2019 Here, I repeat, you have the whole logic of the prosecution. Who murdered him, if not he? There\u2019s no one to put in his place. \u201cGentlemen of the jury, is that really so? Is it positively, actually true that there is no one else at all? We\u2019ve heard the prosecutor count on his fingers all the persons who were in that house that night. They were five in number; three of them, I agree, could not have been responsible\u2014the murdered man himself, old Grigory, and his wife. There are left then the prisoner and Smerdyakov, and the prosecutor dramatically exclaims that the prisoner pointed to Smerdyakov because he had no one else to fix on, that had there been a sixth person, even a phantom of a sixth person, he would have abandoned the charge against Smerdyakov at once in shame and have accused that other. But, gentlemen of the jury, why may I not draw the very opposite conclusion? There are two persons\u2014the prisoner and Smerdyakov. Why can I not say that you accuse my client, simply because you have no one else to accuse? And you have no one else only because you have determined to exclude Smerdyakov from all suspicion. \u201cIt\u2019s true, indeed, Smerdyakov is accused only by the prisoner, his two brothers, and Madame Svyetlov.", " From some rumor, or perhaps from some stray word of Grushenka\u2019s, he had gathered further that the old man would perhaps prefer him to Fyodor Pavlovitch for Grushenka. Possibly many of the readers of my novel will feel that in reckoning on such assistance, and being ready to take his bride, so to speak, from the hands of her protector, Dmitri showed great coarseness and want of delicacy. I will only observe that Mitya looked upon Grushenka\u2019s past as something completely over. He looked on that past with infinite pity and resolved with all the fervor of his passion that when once Grushenka told him she loved him and would marry him, it would mean the beginning of a new Grushenka and a new Dmitri, free from every vice. They would forgive one another and would begin their lives afresh. As for Kuzma Samsonov, Dmitri looked upon him as a man who had exercised a fateful influence in that remote past of Grushenka\u2019s, though she had never loved him, and who was now himself a thing of the past, completely done with, and, so to say, non\u2010existent. Besides, Mitya hardly looked upon him as a man at all, for it was known to every one in the town that he was only a shattered wreck, whose relations with Grushenka had changed their character and were now simply paternal, and that this had been so for a long time. In any case there was much simplicity on Mitya\u2019s part in all this, for in spite of all his vices, he was a very simple\u2010hearted man.", " Seeing this, Dmitri uttered a scream rather than a shout and rushed at Grigory. \u201cThen she\u2019s there!

Luckily he had them all in his trunk. You can keep your own socks and underclothes.\u201d Mitya flew into a passion. \u201cI won\u2019t have other people\u2019s clothes!\u201d he shouted menacingly, \u201cgive me my own!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s impossible!\u201d \u201cGive me my own. Damn Kalganov and his clothes, too!\u201d It was a long time before they could persuade him. But they succeeded somehow in quieting him down. They impressed upon him that his clothes, being stained with blood, must be \u201cincluded with the other material evidence,\u201d and that they \u201chad not even the right to let him have them now ... taking into consideration the possible outcome of the case.\u201d Mitya at last understood this. He subsided into gloomy silence and hurriedly dressed himself. He merely observed, as he put them on, that the clothes were much better than his old ones, and that he disliked \u201cgaining by the change.\u201d The coat was, besides, \u201cridiculously tight. Am I to be dressed up like a fool ... for your amusement?\u201d They urged upon him again that he was exaggerating, that Kalganov was only a little taller, so that only the trousers might be a little too long.

The report of the search was drawn up, and at last Nikolay Parfenovitch went out, and the clothes were carried out after him. Ippolit Kirillovitch went out, too. Mitya was left alone with the peasants, who stood in silence, never taking their eyes off him. Mitya wrapped himself up in the quilt. He felt cold. His bare feet stuck out, and he couldn\u2019t pull the quilt over so as to cover them. Nikolay Parfenovitch seemed to be gone a long time, \u201can insufferable time.\u201d \u201cHe thinks of me as a puppy,\u201d thought Mitya, gnashing his teeth. \u201cThat rotten prosecutor has gone, too, contemptuous no doubt, it disgusts him to see me naked!\u201d Mitya imagined, however, that his clothes would be examined and returned to him.

That\u2019s all that\u2019s left for you,\u201d he said, clenching his teeth and addressing the prosecutor.

Moreover, in the \u201cofficer\u2019s\u201d first letter which had been shown to Mitya, the possibility of his new rival\u2019s visit was very vaguely suggested. The letter was very indefinite, high\u2010flown, and full of sentimentality. It must be noted that Grushenka had concealed from him the last lines of the letter, in which his return was alluded to more definitely. He had, besides, noticed at that moment, he remembered afterwards, a certain involuntary proud contempt for this missive from Siberia on Grushenka\u2019s face. Grushenka told him nothing of what had passed later between her and this rival; so that by degrees he had completely forgotten the officer\u2019s existence. He felt that whatever might come later, whatever turn things might take, his final conflict with Fyodor Pavlovitch was close upon him, and must be decided before anything else. With a sinking heart he was expecting every moment Grushenka\u2019s decision, always believing that it would come suddenly, on the impulse of the moment. All of a sudden she would say to him: \u201cTake me, I\u2019m yours for ever,\u201d and it would all be over. He would seize her and bear her away at once to the ends of the earth. Oh, then he would bear her away at once, as far, far away as possible; to the farthest end of Russia, if not of the earth, then he would marry her, and settle down with her incognito, so that no one would know anything about them, there, here, or anywhere.", " From some rumor, or perhaps from some stray word of Grushenka\u2019s, he had gathered further that the old man would perhaps prefer him to Fyodor Pavlovitch for Grushenka. Possibly many of the readers of my novel will feel that in reckoning on such assistance, and being ready to take his bride, so to speak, from the hands of her protector, Dmitri showed great coarseness and want of delicacy. I will only observe that Mitya looked upon Grushenka\u2019s past as something completely over. He looked on that past with infinite pity and resolved with all the fervor of his passion that when once Grushenka told him she loved him and would marry him, it would mean the beginning of a new Grushenka and a new Dmitri, free from every vice. They would forgive one another and would begin their lives afresh. As for Kuzma Samsonov, Dmitri looked upon him as a man who had exercised a fateful influence in that remote past of Grushenka\u2019s, though she had never loved him, and who was now himself a thing of the past, completely done with, and, so to say, non\u2010existent. Besides, Mitya hardly looked upon him as a man at all, for it was known to every one in the town that he was only a shattered wreck, whose relations with Grushenka had changed their character and were now simply paternal, and that this had been so for a long time. In any case there was much simplicity on Mitya\u2019s part in all this, for in spite of all his vices, he was a very simple\u2010hearted man.", " \u201cI had no thoughts for either of them all this last month. I was expecting another man who had wronged me. But I think,\u201d she said in conclusion, \u201cthat there\u2019s no need for you to inquire about that, nor for me to answer you, for that\u2019s my own affair.\u201d Nikolay Parfenovitch immediately acted upon this hint. He again dismissed the \u201cromantic\u201d aspect of the case and passed to the serious one, that is, to the question of most importance, concerning the three thousand roubles. Grushenka confirmed the statement that three thousand roubles had certainly been spent on the first carousal at Mokroe, and, though she had not counted the money herself, she had heard that it was three thousand from Dmitri Fyodorovitch\u2019s own lips. \u201cDid he tell you that alone, or before some one else, or did you only hear him speak of it to others in your presence?\u201d the prosecutor inquired immediately. To which Grushenka replied that she had heard him say so before other people, and had heard him say so when they were alone. \u201cDid he say it to you alone once, or several times?\u201d inquired the prosecutor, and learned that he had told Grushenka so several times. Ippolit Kirillovitch was very well satisfied with this piece of evidence. Further examination elicited that Grushenka knew, too, where that money had come from, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had got it from Katerina Ivanovna. \u201cAnd did you never, once, hear that the money spent a month ago was not three thousand, but less, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had saved half that sum for his own use?\u201d \u201cNo, I never heard that,\u201d answered Grushenka.", " For him the whole tormenting question lay between him and Fyodor Pavlovitch. Here, we must note, by the way, one certain fact: he was firmly persuaded that Fyodor Pavlovitch would offer, or perhaps had offered, Grushenka lawful wedlock, and did not for a moment believe that the old voluptuary hoped to gain his object for three thousand roubles. Mitya had reached this conclusion from his knowledge of Grushenka and her character. That was how it was that he could believe at times that all Grushenka\u2019s uneasiness rose from not knowing which of them to choose, which was most to her advantage. Strange to say, during those days it never occurred to him to think of the approaching return of the \u201cofficer,\u201d that is, of the man who had been such a fatal influence in Grushenka\u2019s life, and whose arrival she was expecting with such emotion and dread. It is true that of late Grushenka had been very silent about it. Yet he was perfectly aware of a letter she had received a month ago from her seducer, and had heard of it from her own lips. He partly knew, too, what the letter contained. In a moment of spite Grushenka had shown him that letter, but to her astonishment he attached hardly any consequence to it. It would be hard to say why this was. Perhaps, weighed down by all the hideous horror of his struggle with his own father for this woman, he was incapable of imagining any danger more terrible, at any rate for the time."], "Which of the following is not true of Kolya?": [" His charming face always had a good\u2010humored expression; but there was a gentleness and serenity in his good\u2010humor.

I respect your brother!\u201d \u201cAnd so do I!\u201d the boy, who had once declared that he knew who had founded Troy, cried suddenly and unexpectedly, and he blushed up to his ears like a peony as he had done on that occasion.", " \u201cThat\u2019s not ridiculous, is it?\u201d \u201cNot at all ridiculous, and if it were, it wouldn\u2019t matter, because it\u2019s been a good thing.\u201d Alyosha smiled brightly. \u201cBut do you know, Karamazov, you must admit that you are a little ashamed yourself, now.... I see it by your eyes.\u201d Kolya smiled with a sort of sly happiness. \u201cWhy ashamed?\u201d \u201cWell, why are you blushing?\u201d \u201cIt was you made me blush,\u201d laughed Alyosha, and he really did blush. \u201cOh, well, I am a little, goodness knows why, I don\u2019t know...\u201d he muttered, almost embarrassed. \u201cOh, how I love you and admire you at this moment just because you are rather ashamed! Because you are just like me,\u201d cried Kolya, in positive ecstasy. His cheeks glowed, his eyes beamed. \u201cYou know, Kolya, you will be very unhappy in your life,\u201d something made Alyosha say suddenly. \u201cI know, I know. How you know it all beforehand!\u201d Kolya agreed at once. \u201cBut you will bless life on the whole, all the same.\u201d \u201cJust so, hurrah! You are a prophet. Oh, we shall get on together, Karamazov! Do you know, what delights me most, is that you treat me quite like an equal. But we are not equals, no, we are not, you are better! But we shall get on. Do you know, all this last month, I\u2019ve been saying to myself, \u2018Either we shall be friends at once, for ever, or we shall part enemies to the grave!\u2019 \u201d \u201cAnd saying that, of course, you loved me,\u201d Alyosha laughed gayly. \u201cI did. I loved you awfully."], "According to what Kolya tells Alyosha, what event ended the friendship between Kolya and Ilyusha?": [" His charming face always had a good\u2010humored expression; but there was a gentleness and serenity in his good\u2010humor. To Kolya\u2019s surprise, Alyosha came out to him just as he was, without an overcoat. He had evidently come in haste. He held out his hand to Kolya at once. \u201cHere you are at last! How anxious we\u2019ve been to see you!\u201d \u201cThere were reasons which you shall know directly. Anyway, I am glad to make your acquaintance. I\u2019ve long been hoping for an opportunity, and have heard a great deal about you,\u201d Kolya muttered, a little breathless. \u201cWe should have met anyway. I\u2019ve heard a great deal about you, too; but you\u2019ve been a long time coming here.\u201d \u201cTell me, how are things going?\u201d \u201cIlusha is very ill. He is certainly dying.\u201d \u201cHow awful! You must admit that medicine is a fraud, Karamazov,\u201d cried Kolya warmly. \u201cIlusha has mentioned you often, very often, even in his sleep, in delirium, you know. One can see that you used to be very, very dear to him ... before the incident ... with the knife.... Then there\u2019s another reason.... Tell me, is that your dog?\u201d \u201cYes, Perezvon.\u201d \u201cNot Zhutchka?\u201d Alyosha looked at Kolya with eyes full of pity. \u201cIs she lost for ever?\u201d \u201cI know you would all like it to be Zhutchka. I\u2019ve heard all about it.\u201d Kolya smiled mysteriously. \u201cListen, Karamazov, I\u2019ll tell you all about it. That\u2019s what I came for; that\u2019s what I asked you to come out here for, to explain the whole episode to you before we go in,\u201d he began with animation.", " There was a wrathful note in Kolya\u2019s voice. He used the word apothecary instead of doctor on purpose, and, as he explained afterwards, used it \u201cto insult him.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d The doctor flung up his head, staring with surprise at Kolya. \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d he addressed Alyosha, as though asking him to explain. \u201cIt\u2019s Perezvon\u2019s master, don\u2019t worry about me,\u201d Kolya said incisively again. \u201cPerezvon?\u201d(7) repeated the doctor, perplexed. \u201cHe hears the bell, but where it is he cannot tell. Good\u2010by, we shall meet in Syracuse.\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s this? Who\u2019s this?\u201d The doctor flew into a terrible rage. \u201cHe is a schoolboy, doctor, he is a mischievous boy; take no notice of him,\u201d said Alyosha, frowning and speaking quickly. \u201cKolya, hold your tongue!\u201d he cried to Krassotkin. \u201cTake no notice of him, doctor,\u201d he repeated, rather impatiently. \u201cHe wants a thrashing, a good thrashing!\u201d The doctor stamped in a perfect fury. \u201cAnd you know, apothecary, my Perezvon might bite!\u201d said Kolya, turning pale, with quivering voice and flashing eyes. \u201c_Ici_, Perezvon!\u201d \u201cKolya, if you say another word, I\u2019ll have nothing more to do with you,\u201d Alyosha cried peremptorily. \u201cThere is only one man in the world who can command Nikolay Krassotkin\u2014this is the man\u201d; Kolya pointed to Alyosha. \u201cI obey him, good\u2010 by!\u201d He stepped forward, opened the door, and quickly went into the inner room. Perezvon flew after him. The doctor stood still for five seconds in amazement, looking at Alyosha; then, with a curse, he went out quickly to the carriage, repeating aloud, \u201cThis is ... this is ...", " He wore a long blue coat and a peaked cap, and looked like a merchant\u2019s clerk. He was in a state of stupid excitement and brandished his fist at Kolya. \u201cI know you!\u201d he cried angrily, \u201cI know you!\u201d Kolya stared at him. He could not recall when he could have had a row with the man. But he had been in so many rows in the street that he could hardly remember them all. \u201cDo you?\u201d he asked sarcastically. \u201cI know you! I know you!\u201d the man repeated idiotically. \u201cSo much the better for you. Well, it\u2019s time I was going. Good\u2010by!\u201d \u201cYou are at your saucy pranks again?\u201d cried the man. \u201cYou are at your saucy pranks again? I know, you are at it again!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not your business, brother, if I am at my saucy pranks again,\u201d said Kolya, standing still and scanning him. \u201cNot my business?\u201d \u201cNo; it\u2019s not your business.\u201d \u201cWhose then? Whose then? Whose then?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Trifon Nikititch\u2019s business, not yours.\u201d \u201cWhat Trifon Nikititch?\u201d asked the youth, staring with loutish amazement at Kolya, but still as angry as ever. Kolya scanned him gravely. \u201cHave you been to the Church of the Ascension?\u201d he suddenly asked him, with stern emphasis. \u201cWhat Church of Ascension? What for? No, I haven\u2019t,\u201d said the young man, somewhat taken aback. \u201cDo you know Sabaneyev?\u201d Kolya went on even more emphatically and even more severely. \u201cWhat Sabaneyev? No, I don\u2019t know him.\u201d \u201cWell then you can go to the devil,\u201d said Kolya, cutting short the conversation; and turning sharply to the right he strode quickly on his way as though he disdained further conversation with a dolt who did not even know Sabaneyev.", " \u201cThat\u2019s not ridiculous, is it?\u201d \u201cNot at all ridiculous, and if it were, it wouldn\u2019t matter, because it\u2019s been a good thing.\u201d Alyosha smiled brightly. \u201cBut do you know, Karamazov, you must admit that you are a little ashamed yourself, now....

Ici, Perezvon!\u201d The dog leapt up and bounded about, whining with delight. The captain ran back with a piece of cooked beef. \u201cIs it hot?\u201d Kolya inquired hurriedly, with a business\u2010like air, taking the meat. \u201cDogs don\u2019t like hot things. No, it\u2019s all right. Look, everybody, look, Ilusha, look, old man; why aren\u2019t you looking? He does not look at him, now I\u2019ve brought him.\u201d The new trick consisted in making the dog stand motionless with his nose out and putting a tempting morsel of meat just on his nose. The luckless dog had to stand without moving, with the meat on his nose, as long as his master chose to keep him, without a movement, perhaps for half an hour. But he kept Perezvon only for a brief moment. \u201cPaid for!\u201d cried Kolya, and the meat passed in a flash from the dog\u2019s nose to his mouth. The audience, of course, expressed enthusiasm and surprise. \u201cCan you really have put off coming all this time simply to train the dog?\u201d exclaimed Alyosha, with an involuntary note of reproach in his voice. \u201cSimply for that!\u201d answered Kolya, with perfect simplicity. \u201cI wanted to show him in all his glory.\u201d \u201cPerezvon! Perezvon,\u201d called Ilusha suddenly, snapping his thin fingers and beckoning to the dog. \u201cWhat is it? Let him jump up on the bed! _Ici_, Perezvon!\u201d Kolya slapped the bed and Perezvon darted up by Ilusha.", " There was a wrathful note in Kolya\u2019s voice.

It must have died after a meal like that,\u201d Kolya pronounced pitilessly, though he seemed a little breathless. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got a dog, Perezvon ... A Slavonic name.... I\u2019ve brought him to show you.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want him!\u201d said Ilusha suddenly. \u201cNo, no, you really must see him ... it will amuse you. I brought him on purpose.... He\u2019s the same sort of shaggy dog.... You allow me to call in my dog, madam?\u201d He suddenly addressed Madame Snegiryov, with inexplicable excitement in his manner. \u201cI don\u2019t want him, I don\u2019t want him!\u201d cried Ilusha, with a mournful break in his voice. There was a reproachful light in his eyes. \u201cYou\u2019d better,\u201d the captain started up from the chest by the wall on which he had just sat down, \u201cyou\u2019d better ... another time,\u201d he muttered, but Kolya could not be restrained. He hurriedly shouted to Smurov, \u201cOpen the door,\u201d and as soon as it was open, he blew his whistle. Perezvon dashed headlong into the room. \u201cJump, Perezvon, beg! Beg!\u201d shouted Kolya, jumping up, and the dog stood erect on its hind\u2010legs by Ilusha\u2019s bedside. What followed was a surprise to every one: Ilusha started, lurched violently forward, bent over Perezvon and gazed at him, faint with suspense. \u201cIt\u2019s ... Zhutchka!\u201d he cried suddenly, in a voice breaking with joy and suffering. \u201cAnd who did you think it was?\u201d Krassotkin shouted with all his might, in a ringing, happy voice, and bending down he seized the dog and lifted him up to Ilusha.", " Mamma, this is Zhutchka!\u201d He was almost weeping. \u201cAnd I never guessed!\u201d cried Smurov regretfully. \u201cBravo, Krassotkin! I said he\u2019d find the dog and here he\u2019s found him.\u201d \u201cHere he\u2019s found him!\u201d another boy repeated gleefully. \u201cKrassotkin\u2019s a brick!\u201d cried a third voice. \u201cHe\u2019s a brick, he\u2019s a brick!\u201d cried the other boys, and they began clapping. \u201cWait, wait,\u201d Krassotkin did his utmost to shout above them all. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you how it happened, that\u2019s the whole point. I found him, I took him home and hid him at once. I kept him locked up at home and did not show him to any one till to\u2010day. Only Smurov has known for the last fortnight, but I assured him this dog was called Perezvon and he did not guess. And meanwhile I taught the dog all sorts of tricks. You should only see all the things he can do! I trained him so as to bring you a well\u2010trained dog, in good condition, old man, so as to be able to say to you, \u2018See, old man, what a fine dog your Zhutchka is now!\u2019 Haven\u2019t you a bit of meat? He\u2019ll show you a trick that will make you die with laughing. A piece of meat, haven\u2019t you got any?\u201d The captain ran across the passage to the landlady, where their cooking was done. Not to lose precious time, Kolya, in desperate haste, shouted to Perezvon, \u201cDead!\u201d And the dog immediately turned round and lay on his back with its four paws in the air. The boys laughed. Ilusha looked on with the same suffering smile, but the person most delighted with the dog\u2019s performance was \u201cmamma.\u201d She laughed at the dog and began snapping her fingers and calling it, \u201cPerezvon, Perezvon!\u201d \u201cNothing will make him get up, nothing!\u201d Kolya cried triumphantly, proud of his success."], "Grushenka tells Alyosha that she is afraid of what?": [" It stands over there. Give it me.\u201d Alyosha gave him a little round folding looking\u2010glass which stood on the chest of drawers. The old man looked at himself in it; his nose was considerably swollen, and on the left side of his forehead there was a rather large crimson bruise. \u201cWhat does Ivan say? Alyosha, my dear, my only son, I\u2019m afraid of Ivan. I\u2019m more afraid of Ivan than the other. You\u2019re the only one I\u2019m not afraid of....\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid of Ivan either. He is angry, but he\u2019ll defend you.\u201d \u201cAlyosha, and what of the other?

She has not been here.\u201d \u201cYou know Mitya wants to marry her, to marry her.\u201d \u201cShe won\u2019t marry him.\u201d \u201cShe won\u2019t. She won\u2019t. She won\u2019t. She won\u2019t on any account!\u201d The old man fairly fluttered with joy, as though nothing more comforting could have been said to him. In his delight he seized Alyosha\u2019s hand and pressed it warmly to his heart. Tears positively glittered in his eyes. \u201cThat image of the Mother of God of which I was telling you just now,\u201d he said. \u201cTake it home and keep it for yourself. And I\u2019ll let you go back to the monastery.... I was joking this morning, don\u2019t be angry with me. My head aches, Alyosha.... Alyosha, comfort my heart. Be an angel and tell me the truth!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re still asking whether she has been here or not?\u201d Alyosha said sorrowfully.", " Grushenka snatched the letter from her and carried it to the candle. It was only a note, a few lines. She read it in one instant. \u201cHe has sent for me,\u201d she cried, her face white and distorted, with a wan smile; \u201che whistles! Crawl back, little dog!\u201d But only for one instant she stood as though hesitating; suddenly the blood rushed to her head and sent a glow to her cheeks. \u201cI will go,\u201d she cried; \u201cfive years of my life! Good\u2010by! Good\u2010by, Alyosha, my fate is sealed. Go, go, leave me all of you, don\u2019t let me see you again! Grushenka is flying to a new life.... Don\u2019t you remember evil against me either, Rakitin. I may be going to my death! Ugh! I feel as though I were drunk!\u201d She suddenly left them and ran into her bedroom. \u201cWell, she has no thoughts for us now!\u201d grumbled Rakitin. \u201cLet\u2019s go, or we may hear that feminine shriek again. I am sick of all these tears and cries.\u201d Alyosha mechanically let himself be led out. In the yard stood a covered cart. Horses were being taken out of the shafts, men were running to and fro with a lantern. Three fresh horses were being led in at the open gate. But when Alyosha and Rakitin reached the bottom of the steps, Grushenka\u2019s bedroom window was suddenly opened and she called in a ringing voice after Alyosha: \u201cAlyosha, give my greetings to your brother Mitya and tell him not to remember evil against me, though I have brought him misery. And tell him, too, in my words: \u2018Grushenka has fallen to a scoundrel, and not to you, noble heart.\u2019 And add, too, that Grushenka loved him only one hour, only one short hour she loved him\u2014so let him remember that hour all his life\u2014say, \u2018Grushenka tells you to!\u2019 \u201d She ended in a voice full of sobs.", " I know! He was cheerful before, though, indeed, he is cheerful to\u2010day.\u201d \u201cBut you said he was worried.\u201d \u201cYes, he is worried and yet cheerful. He keeps on being irritable for a minute and then cheerful and then irritable again. And you know, Alyosha, I am constantly wondering at him\u2014with this awful thing hanging over him, he sometimes laughs at such trifles as though he were a baby himself.\u201d \u201cAnd did he really tell you not to tell me about Ivan? Did he say, \u2018Don\u2019t tell him\u2019?\u201d \u201cYes, he told me, \u2018Don\u2019t tell him.\u2019 It\u2019s you that Mitya\u2019s most afraid of. Because it\u2019s a secret: he said himself it was a secret. Alyosha, darling, go to him and find out what their secret is and come and tell me,\u201d Grushenka besought him with sudden eagerness. \u201cSet my mind at rest that I may know the worst that\u2019s in store for me. That\u2019s why I sent for you.\u201d \u201cYou think it\u2019s something to do with you? If it were, he wouldn\u2019t have told you there was a secret.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. Perhaps he wants to tell me, but doesn\u2019t dare to. He warns me. There is a secret, he tells me, but he won\u2019t tell me what it is.\u201d \u201cWhat do you think yourself?\u201d \u201cWhat do I think? It\u2019s the end for me, that\u2019s what I think. They all three have been plotting my end, for Katerina\u2019s in it. It\u2019s all Katerina, it all comes from her. She is this and that, and that means that I am not. He tells me that beforehand\u2014warns me. He is planning to throw me over, that\u2019s the whole secret.", " From that moment he gave strict orders to his servants not to admit Grushenka and to tell her if she came, \u201cThe master wishes you long life and happiness and tells you to forget him.\u201d But Grushenka sent almost every day to inquire after him. \u201cYou\u2019ve come at last!\u201d she cried, flinging down the cards and joyfully greeting Alyosha, \u201cand Maximushka\u2019s been scaring me that perhaps you wouldn\u2019t come. Ah, how I need you! Sit down to the table. What will you have\u2014coffee?\u201d \u201cYes, please,\u201d said Alyosha, sitting down at the table. \u201cI am very hungry.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right. Fenya, Fenya, coffee,\u201d cried Grushenka. \u201cIt\u2019s been made a long time ready for you. And bring some little pies, and mind they are hot. Do you know, we\u2019ve had a storm over those pies to\u2010day. I took them to the prison for him, and would you believe it, he threw them back to me: he would not eat them. He flung one of them on the floor and stamped on it. So I said to him: \u2018I shall leave them with the warder; if you don\u2019t eat them before evening, it will be that your venomous spite is enough for you!\u2019 With that I went away. We quarreled again, would you believe it? Whenever I go we quarrel.\u201d Grushenka said all this in one breath in her agitation. Maximov, feeling nervous, at once smiled and looked on the floor. \u201cWhat did you quarrel about this time?\u201d asked Alyosha. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect it in the least. Only fancy, he is jealous of the Pole."], "When Alyosha speaks to Lise, she asks him to deliver a note to whom?": [" Lise assumed an important air. \u201cKaterina Ivanovna has sent you this through me.\u201d She handed him a little note. \u201cShe particularly begs you to go and see her as soon as possible; that you will not fail her, but will be sure to come.\u201d \u201cShe asks me to go and see her? Me? What for?\u201d Alyosha muttered in great astonishment. His face at once looked anxious. \u201cOh, it\u2019s all to do with Dmitri Fyodorovitch and\u2014what has happened lately,\u201d the mother explained hurriedly. \u201cKaterina Ivanovna has made up her mind, but she must see you about it.... Why, of course, I can\u2019t say. But she wants to see you at once. And you will go to her, of course. It is a Christian duty.\u201d \u201cI have only seen her once,\u201d Alyosha protested with the same perplexity. \u201cOh, she is such a lofty, incomparable creature! If only for her suffering.... Think what she has gone through, what she is enduring now! Think what awaits her! It\u2019s all terrible, terrible!\u201d \u201cVery well, I will come,\u201d Alyosha decided, after rapidly scanning the brief, enigmatic note, which consisted of an urgent entreaty that he would come, without any sort of explanation. \u201cOh, how sweet and generous that would be of you!\u201d cried Lise with sudden animation. \u201cI told mamma you\u2019d be sure not to go. I said you were saving your soul. How splendid you are! I\u2019ve always thought you were splendid. How glad I am to tell you so!\u201d \u201cLise!\u201d said her mother impressively, though she smiled after she had said it.", " That\u2019s just as it ought to be. In such cases I am always against the woman, against all these feminine tears and hysterics. Run and say, Yulia, that I\u2019ll fly to her. As for Ivan Fyodorovitch\u2019s going away like that, it\u2019s her own fault. But he won\u2019t go away. Lise, for mercy\u2019s sake, don\u2019t scream! Oh, yes; you are not screaming. It\u2019s I am screaming. Forgive your mamma; but I am delighted, delighted, delighted! Did you notice, Alexey Fyodorovitch, how young, how young Ivan Fyodorovitch was just now when he went out, when he said all that and went out? I thought he was so learned, such a _savant_, and all of a sudden he behaved so warmly, openly, and youthfully, with such youthful inexperience, and it was all so fine, like you.... And the way he repeated that German verse, it was just like you! But I must fly, I must fly! Alexey Fyodorovitch, make haste to carry out her commission, and then make haste back. Lise, do you want anything now? For mercy\u2019s sake, don\u2019t keep Alexey Fyodorovitch a minute. He will come back to you at once.\u201d Madame Hohlakov at last ran off. Before leaving, Alyosha would have opened the door to see Lise. \u201cOn no account,\u201d cried Lise. \u201cOn no account now. Speak through the door. How have you come to be an angel? That\u2019s the only thing I want to know.\u201d \u201cFor an awful piece of stupidity, Lise! Good\u2010by!\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t dare to go away like that!\u201d Lise was beginning. \u201cLise, I have a real sorrow!", " \u201cI\u2019ll tell you later, Lise\u2014afterwards,\u201d said Alyosha, confused. \u201cNow you wouldn\u2019t understand it perhaps\u2014and perhaps I couldn\u2019t explain it.\u201d \u201cI know your brothers and your father are worrying you, too.\u201d \u201cYes, my brothers too,\u201d murmured Alyosha, pondering. \u201cI don\u2019t like your brother Ivan, Alyosha,\u201d said Lise suddenly. He noticed this remark with some surprise, but did not answer it. \u201cMy brothers are destroying themselves,\u201d he went on, \u201cmy father, too. And they are destroying others with them. It\u2019s \u2018the primitive force of the Karamazovs,\u2019 as Father Pa\u00efssy said the other day, a crude, unbridled, earthly force. Does the spirit of God move above that force? Even that I don\u2019t know. I only know that I, too, am a Karamazov.... Me a monk, a monk! Am I a monk, Lise? You said just now that I was.\u201d \u201cYes, I did.\u201d \u201cAnd perhaps I don\u2019t even believe in God.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t believe? What is the matter?\u201d said Lise quietly and gently. But Alyosha did not answer. There was something too mysterious, too subjective in these last words of his, perhaps obscure to himself, but yet torturing him. \u201cAnd now on the top of it all, my friend, the best man in the world, is going, is leaving the earth! If you knew, Lise, how bound up in soul I am with him! And then I shall be left alone.... I shall come to you, Lise.... For the future we will be together.\u201d \u201cYes, together, together! Henceforward we shall be always together, all our lives!", " We are in a regular plot to bring it about, and I am even staying on here perhaps on that account.\u201d \u201cBut she has been crying\u2014she has been wounded again,\u201d cried Alyosha. \u201cNever trust a woman\u2019s tears, Alexey Fyodorovitch. I am never for the women in such cases. I am always on the side of the men.\u201d \u201cMamma, you are spoiling him,\u201d Lise\u2019s little voice cried from behind the door. \u201cNo, it was all my fault. I am horribly to blame,\u201d Alyosha repeated unconsoled, hiding his face in his hands in an agony of remorse for his indiscretion. \u201cQuite the contrary; you behaved like an angel, like an angel. I am ready to say so a thousand times over.\u201d \u201cMamma, how has he behaved like an angel?\u201d Lise\u2019s voice was heard again. \u201cI somehow fancied all at once,\u201d Alyosha went on as though he had not heard Lise, \u201cthat she loved Ivan, and so I said that stupid thing.... What will happen now?\u201d \u201cTo whom, to whom?\u201d cried Lise. \u201cMamma, you really want to be the death of me. I ask you and you don\u2019t answer.\u201d At the moment the maid ran in. \u201cKaterina Ivanovna is ill.... She is crying, struggling ... hysterics.\u201d \u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d cried Lise, in a tone of real anxiety. \u201cMamma, I shall be having hysterics, and not she!\u201d \u201cLise, for mercy\u2019s sake, don\u2019t scream, don\u2019t persecute me. At your age one can\u2019t know everything that grown\u2010up people know. I\u2019ll come and tell you everything you ought to know. Oh, mercy on us! I am coming, I am coming.... Hysterics is a good sign, Alexey Fyodorovitch; it\u2019s an excellent thing that she is hysterical."], "At the prision, Dmitri tells Alyosha about whose visit?": [" It\u2019s appalling! I\u2019ll go in with you, and if they don\u2019t turn me out, I\u2019ll stay to the end.\u201d Chapter V. A Laceration In The Drawing\u2010Room But in the drawing\u2010room the conversation was already over. Katerina Ivanovna was greatly excited, though she looked resolute. At the moment Alyosha and Madame Hohlakov entered, Ivan Fyodorovitch stood up to take leave. His face was rather pale, and Alyosha looked at him anxiously. For this moment was to solve a doubt, a harassing enigma which had for some time haunted Alyosha. During the preceding month it had been several times suggested to him that his brother Ivan was in love with Katerina Ivanovna, and, what was more, that he meant \u201cto carry her off\u201d from Dmitri. Until quite lately the idea seemed to Alyosha monstrous, though it worried him extremely. He loved both his brothers, and dreaded such rivalry between them. Meantime, Dmitri had said outright on the previous day that he was glad that Ivan was his rival, and that it was a great assistance to him, Dmitri. In what way did it assist him? To marry Grushenka? But that Alyosha considered the worst thing possible. Besides all this, Alyosha had till the evening before implicitly believed that Katerina Ivanovna had a steadfast and passionate love for Dmitri; but he had only believed it till the evening before. He had fancied, too, that she was incapable of loving a man like Ivan, and that she did love Dmitri, and loved him just as he was, in spite of all the strangeness of such a passion.", " At the same instant a servant brought in two lighted candles and set them on the table. \u201cThank God! At last you have come too! I\u2019ve been simply praying for you all day! Sit down.\u201d Alyosha had been struck by Katerina Ivanovna\u2019s beauty when, three weeks before, Dmitri had first brought him, at Katerina Ivanovna\u2019s special request, to be introduced to her. There had been no conversation between them at that interview, however. Supposing Alyosha to be very shy, Katerina Ivanovna had talked all the time to Dmitri to spare him. Alyosha had been silent, but he had seen a great deal very clearly. He was struck by the imperiousness, proud ease, and self\u2010confidence of the haughty girl. And all that was certain, Alyosha felt that he was not exaggerating it. He thought her great glowing black eyes were very fine, especially with her pale, even rather sallow, longish face. But in those eyes and in the lines of her exquisite lips there was something with which his brother might well be passionately in love, but which perhaps could not be loved for long. He expressed this thought almost plainly to Dmitri when, after the visit, his brother besought and insisted that he should not conceal his impressions on seeing his betrothed. \u201cYou\u2019ll be happy with her, but perhaps\u2014not tranquilly happy.\u201d \u201cQuite so, brother. Such people remain always the same. They don\u2019t yield to fate. So you think I shan\u2019t love her for ever.\u201d \u201cNo; perhaps you will love her for ever.", " I know! He was cheerful before, though, indeed, he is cheerful to\u2010day.\u201d \u201cBut you said he was worried.\u201d \u201cYes, he is worried and yet cheerful. He keeps on being irritable for a minute and then cheerful and then irritable again. And you know, Alyosha, I am constantly wondering at him\u2014with this awful thing hanging over him, he sometimes laughs at such trifles as though he were a baby himself.\u201d \u201cAnd did he really tell you not to tell me about Ivan? Did he say, \u2018Don\u2019t tell him\u2019?\u201d \u201cYes, he told me, \u2018Don\u2019t tell him.\u2019 It\u2019s you that Mitya\u2019s most afraid of. Because it\u2019s a secret: he said himself it was a secret. Alyosha, darling, go to him and find out what their secret is and come and tell me,\u201d Grushenka besought him with sudden eagerness. \u201cSet my mind at rest that I may know the worst that\u2019s in store for me. That\u2019s why I sent for you.\u201d \u201cYou think it\u2019s something to do with you? If it were, he wouldn\u2019t have told you there was a secret.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. Perhaps he wants to tell me, but doesn\u2019t dare to. He warns me. There is a secret, he tells me, but he won\u2019t tell me what it is.\u201d \u201cWhat do you think yourself?\u201d \u201cWhat do I think? It\u2019s the end for me, that\u2019s what I think. They all three have been plotting my end, for Katerina\u2019s in it. It\u2019s all Katerina, it all comes from her. She is this and that, and that means that I am not. He tells me that beforehand\u2014warns me. He is planning to throw me over, that\u2019s the whole secret.", " He was trembling all over. He seemed frantic. \u201cBut you\u2019ve seen for yourself that she hasn\u2019t come,\u201d cried Ivan. \u201cBut she may have come by that other entrance.\u201d \u201cYou know that entrance is locked, and you have the key.\u201d Dmitri suddenly reappeared in the drawing\u2010room. He had, of course, found the other entrance locked, and the key actually was in Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s pocket. The windows of all the rooms were also closed, so Grushenka could not have come in anywhere nor have run out anywhere. \u201cHold him!\u201d shrieked Fyodor Pavlovitch, as soon as he saw him again. \u201cHe\u2019s been stealing money in my bedroom.\u201d And tearing himself from Ivan he rushed again at Dmitri. But Dmitri threw up both hands and suddenly clutched the old man by the two tufts of hair that remained on his temples, tugged at them, and flung him with a crash on the floor. He kicked him two or three times with his heel in the face. The old man moaned shrilly. Ivan, though not so strong as Dmitri, threw his arms round him, and with all his might pulled him away. Alyosha helped him with his slender strength, holding Dmitri in front. \u201cMadman! You\u2019ve killed him!\u201d cried Ivan. \u201cServe him right!\u201d shouted Dmitri breathlessly. \u201cIf I haven\u2019t killed him, I\u2019ll come again and kill him. You can\u2019t protect him!\u201d \u201cDmitri! Go away at once!\u201d cried Alyosha commandingly. \u201cAlexey! You tell me. It\u2019s only you I can believe; was she here just now, or not?"], "Based on what Dmitri tells Alyosha, who offered Dmitri a plan for escape?": [" He had just gone down\u2010stairs, but seeing you I made him come back; do you remember? Do you know what we were quarreling about then?\u201d \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d said Alyosha. \u201cOf course he did not tell you. It was about that plan of escape. He had told me the main idea three days before, and we began quarreling about it at once and quarreled for three days. We quarreled because, when he told me that if Dmitri Fyodorovitch were convicted he would escape abroad with that creature, I felt furious at once\u2014I can\u2019t tell you why, I don\u2019t know myself why.... Oh, of course, I was furious then about that creature, and that she, too, should go abroad with Dmitri!\u201d Katerina Ivanovna exclaimed suddenly, her lips quivering with anger. \u201cAs soon as Ivan Fyodorovitch saw that I was furious about that woman, he instantly imagined I was jealous of Dmitri and that I still loved Dmitri. That is how our first quarrel began. I would not give an explanation, I could not ask forgiveness. I could not bear to think that such a man could suspect me of still loving that ... and when I myself had told him long before that I did not love Dmitri, that I loved no one but him! It was only resentment against that creature that made me angry with him. Three days later, on the evening you came, he brought me a sealed envelope, which I was to open at once, if anything happened to him. Oh, he foresaw his illness! He told me that the envelope contained the details of the escape, and that if he died or was taken dangerously ill, I was to save Mitya alone.", " Chapter II. Smerdyakov With A Guitar He had no time to lose indeed. Even while he was saying good\u2010by to Lise, the thought had struck him that he must attempt some stratagem to find his brother Dmitri, who was evidently keeping out of his way. It was getting late, nearly three o\u2019clock. Alyosha\u2019s whole soul turned to the monastery, to his dying saint, but the necessity of seeing Dmitri outweighed everything. The conviction that a great inevitable catastrophe was about to happen grew stronger in Alyosha\u2019s mind with every hour. What that catastrophe was, and what he would say at that moment to his brother, he could perhaps not have said definitely. \u201cEven if my benefactor must die without me, anyway I won\u2019t have to reproach myself all my life with the thought that I might have saved something and did not, but passed by and hastened home. If I do as I intend, I shall be following his great precept.\u201d His plan was to catch his brother Dmitri unawares, to climb over the fence, as he had the day before, get into the garden and sit in the summer\u2010house. If Dmitri were not there, thought Alyosha, he would not announce himself to Foma or the women of the house, but would remain hidden in the summer\u2010house, even if he had to wait there till evening. If, as before, Dmitri were lying in wait for Grushenka to come, he would be very likely to come to the summer\u2010house. Alyosha did not, however, give much thought to the details of his plan, but resolved to act upon it, even if it meant not getting back to the monastery that day.", " But this time he had specially urgent business, and he foresaw how difficult it would be to approach the subject, yet he was in great haste. He had another engagement that could not be put off for that same morning, and there was need of haste. They had been talking for a quarter of an hour. Katerina Ivanovna was pale and terribly fatigued, yet at the same time in a state of hysterical excitement. She had a presentiment of the reason why Alyosha had come to her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about his decision,\u201d she said, with confident emphasis to Alyosha. \u201cOne way or another he is bound to come to it. He must escape. That unhappy man, that hero of honor and principle\u2014not he, not Dmitri Fyodorovitch, but the man lying the other side of that door, who has sacrificed himself for his brother,\u201d Katya added, with flashing eyes\u2014\u201ctold me the whole plan of escape long ago. You know he has already entered into negotiations.... I\u2019ve told you something already.... You see, it will probably come off at the third _\u00e9tape_ from here, when the party of prisoners is being taken to Siberia. Oh, it\u2019s a long way off yet. Ivan Fyodorovitch has already visited the superintendent of the third _\u00e9tape_. But we don\u2019t know yet who will be in charge of the party, and it\u2019s impossible to find that out so long beforehand. To\u2010morrow perhaps I will show you in detail the whole plan which Ivan Fyodorovitch left me on the eve of the trial in case of need.... That was when\u2014do you remember?\u2014you found us quarreling.", " He was trembling all over. He seemed frantic. \u201cBut you\u2019ve seen for yourself that she hasn\u2019t come,\u201d cried Ivan. \u201cBut she may have come by that other entrance.\u201d \u201cYou know that entrance is locked, and you have the key.\u201d Dmitri suddenly reappeared in the drawing\u2010room.

It\u2019s only you I can believe; was she here just now, or not?"], "Seeing an apparition of ___ causes Ivan to go mad.": [" Go, run after him....\u201d Alyosha jumped up and ran after Ivan, who was not fifty paces ahead of him. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d He turned quickly on Alyosha, seeing that he was running after him. \u201cShe told you to catch me up, because I\u2019m mad. I know it all by heart,\u201d he added irritably. \u201cShe is mistaken, of course; but she is right that you are ill,\u201d said Alyosha. \u201cI was looking at your face just now. You look very ill, Ivan.\u201d Ivan walked on without stopping. Alyosha followed him. \u201cAnd do you know, Alexey Fyodorovitch, how people do go out of their mind?\u201d Ivan asked in a voice suddenly quiet, without a trace of irritation, with a note of the simplest curiosity. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I suppose there are all kinds of insanity.\u201d \u201cAnd can one observe that one\u2019s going mad oneself?\u201d \u201cI imagine one can\u2019t see oneself clearly in such circumstances,\u201d Alyosha answered with surprise. Ivan paused for half a minute. \u201cIf you want to talk to me, please change the subject,\u201d he said suddenly. \u201cOh, while I think of it, I have a letter for you,\u201d said Alyosha timidly, and he took Lise\u2019s note from his pocket and held it out to Ivan. They were just under a lamp\u2010post. Ivan recognized the handwriting at once. \u201cAh, from that little demon!\u201d he laughed maliciously, and, without opening the envelope, he tore it into bits and threw it in the air. The bits were scattered by the wind. \u201cShe\u2019s not sixteen yet, I believe, and already offering herself,\u201d he said contemptuously, striding along the street again.", " Ivan always felt that Alyosha\u2019s opinion meant a great deal to him, and so he was astonished at it now. Another thing that was strange was that Alyosha did not make any attempt to talk about Mitya with Ivan, that he never began on the subject and only answered his questions. This, too, struck Ivan particularly. But he was very much preoccupied at that time with something quite apart from that. On his return from Moscow, he abandoned himself hopelessly to his mad and consuming passion for Katerina Ivanovna. This is not the time to begin to speak of this new passion of Ivan\u2019s, which left its mark on all the rest of his life: this would furnish the subject for another novel, which I may perhaps never write. But I cannot omit to mention here that when Ivan, on leaving Katerina Ivanovna with Alyosha, as I\u2019ve related already, told him, \u201cI am not keen on her,\u201d it was an absolute lie: he loved her madly, though at times he hated her so that he might have murdered her. Many causes helped to bring about this feeling. Shattered by what had happened with Mitya, she rushed on Ivan\u2019s return to meet him as her one salvation. She was hurt, insulted and humiliated in her feelings. And here the man had come back to her, who had loved her so ardently before (oh! she knew that very well), and whose heart and intellect she considered so superior to her own. But the sternly virtuous girl did not abandon herself altogether to the man she loved, in spite of the Karamazov violence of his passions and the great fascination he had for her.", " He\u2019s been brought from Petersburg for three thousand roubles, they say.\u201d \u201cWe gave these three thousand together\u2014Ivan, Katerina Ivanovna and I\u2014but she paid two thousand for the doctor from Moscow herself. The counsel Fetyukovitch would have charged more, but the case has become known all over Russia; it\u2019s talked of in all the papers and journals. Fetyukovitch agreed to come more for the glory of the thing, because the case has become so notorious. I saw him yesterday.\u201d \u201cWell? Did you talk to him?\u201d Grushenka put in eagerly. \u201cHe listened and said nothing. He told me that he had already formed his opinion. But he promised to give my words consideration.\u201d \u201cConsideration! Ah, they are swindlers! They\u2019ll ruin him. And why did she send for the doctor?\u201d \u201cAs an expert. They want to prove that Mitya\u2019s mad and committed the murder when he didn\u2019t know what he was doing\u201d; Alyosha smiled gently; \u201cbut Mitya won\u2019t agree to that.\u201d \u201cYes; but that would be the truth if he had killed him!\u201d cried Grushenka. \u201cHe was mad then, perfectly mad, and that was my fault, wretch that I am! But, of course, he didn\u2019t do it, he didn\u2019t do it! And they are all against him, the whole town. Even Fenya\u2019s evidence went to prove he had done it. And the people at the shop, and that official, and at the tavern, too, before, people had heard him say so! They are all, all against him, all crying out against him.\u201d \u201cYes, there\u2019s a fearful accumulation of evidence,\u201d Alyosha observed grimly.", " \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know myself yet. Perhaps you\u2019ll want to trample me under foot after my examination to\u2010morrow.\u201d \u201cYou will give your evidence honorably,\u201d said Alyosha; \u201cthat\u2019s all that\u2019s wanted.\u201d \u201cWomen are often dishonorable,\u201d she snarled. \u201cOnly an hour ago I was thinking I felt afraid to touch that monster ... as though he were a reptile ... but no, he is still a human being to me! But did he do it? Is he the murderer?\u201d she cried, all of a sudden, hysterically, turning quickly to Ivan. Alyosha saw at once that she had asked Ivan that question before, perhaps only a moment before he came in, and not for the first time, but for the hundredth, and that they had ended by quarreling. \u201cI\u2019ve been to see Smerdyakov.... It was you, you who persuaded me that he murdered his father. It\u2019s only you I believed!\u201d she continued, still addressing Ivan. He gave her a sort of strained smile. Alyosha started at her tone. He had not suspected such familiar intimacy between them. \u201cWell, that\u2019s enough, anyway,\u201d Ivan cut short the conversation. \u201cI am going. I\u2019ll come to\u2010morrow.\u201d And turning at once, he walked out of the room and went straight downstairs. With an imperious gesture, Katerina Ivanovna seized Alyosha by both hands. \u201cFollow him! Overtake him! Don\u2019t leave him alone for a minute!\u201d she said, in a hurried whisper. \u201cHe\u2019s mad! Don\u2019t you know that he\u2019s mad? He is in a fever, nervous fever. The doctor told me so."], "At Dmitri\u2019s trial, who serves on the jury?": [" He had never, never persuaded me that his brother was a murderer. On the contrary, it was I who persuaded him! Oh, my vile temper was the cause of everything! I paved the way to that hideous scene at the trial. He wanted to show me that he was an honorable man, and that, even if I loved his brother, he would not ruin him for revenge or jealousy. So he came to the court ... I am the cause of it all, I alone am to blame!\u201d Katya never had made such confessions to Alyosha before, and he felt that she was now at that stage of unbearable suffering when even the proudest heart painfully crushes its pride and falls vanquished by grief. Oh, Alyosha knew another terrible reason of her present misery, though she had carefully concealed it from him during those days since the trial; but it would have been for some reason too painful to him if she had been brought so low as to speak to him now about that. She was suffering for her \u201ctreachery\u201d at the trial, and Alyosha felt that her conscience was impelling her to confess it to him, to him, Alyosha, with tears and cries and hysterical writhings on the floor. But he dreaded that moment and longed to spare her. It made the commission on which he had come even more difficult. He spoke of Mitya again. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, it\u2019s all right, don\u2019t be anxious about him!\u201d she began again, sharply and stubbornly. \u201cAll that is only momentary, I know him, I know his heart only too well.", " \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d said Mitya, looking at him rather uncertainly. \u201cOh, you mean the trial! Damn it all! Till now we\u2019ve been talking of things that don\u2019t matter, about this trial, but I haven\u2019t said a word to you about the chief thing. Yes, the trial is to\u2010morrow; but it wasn\u2019t the trial I meant, when I said it was all over with me. Why do you look at me so critically?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean, Mitya?\u201d \u201cIdeas, ideas, that\u2019s all! Ethics! What is ethics?\u201d \u201cEthics?\u201d asked Alyosha, wondering. \u201cYes; is it a science?\u201d \u201cYes, there is such a science ... but ... I confess I can\u2019t explain to you what sort of science it is.\u201d \u201cRakitin knows. Rakitin knows a lot, damn him! He\u2019s not going to be a monk. He means to go to Petersburg. There he\u2019ll go in for criticism of an elevating tendency. Who knows, he may be of use and make his own career, too. Ough! they are first\u2010rate, these people, at making a career! Damn ethics, I am done for, Alexey, I am, you man of God! I love you more than any one. It makes my heart yearn to look at you. Who was Karl Bernard?\u201d \u201cKarl Bernard?\u201d Alyosha was surprised again. \u201cNo, not Karl. Stay, I made a mistake. Claude Bernard. What was he? Chemist or what?\u201d \u201cHe must be a savant,\u201d answered Alyosha; \u201cbut I confess I can\u2019t tell you much about him, either. I\u2019ve heard of him as a savant, but what sort I don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cWell, damn him, then! I don\u2019t know either,\u201d swore Mitya.", " Book XII. A Judicial Error Chapter I. The Fatal Day At ten o\u2019clock in the morning of the day following the events I have described, the trial of Dmitri Karamazov began in our district court. I hasten to emphasize the fact that I am far from esteeming myself capable of reporting all that took place at the trial in full detail, or even in the actual order of events. I imagine that to mention everything with full explanation would fill a volume, even a very large one. And so I trust I may not be reproached, for confining myself to what struck me. I may have selected as of most interest what was of secondary importance, and may have omitted the most prominent and essential details. But I see I shall do better not to apologize. I will do my best and the reader will see for himself that I have done all I can. And, to begin with, before entering the court, I will mention what surprised me most on that day. Indeed, as it appeared later, every one was surprised at it, too. We all knew that the affair had aroused great interest, that every one was burning with impatience for the trial to begin, that it had been a subject of talk, conjecture, exclamation and surmise for the last two months in local society. Every one knew, too, that the case had become known throughout Russia, but yet we had not imagined that it had aroused such burning, such intense, interest in every one, not only among ourselves, but all over Russia.", " He was in terrible distress. But as the table blocked his way, and there was hardly room to pass between the table and the wall, he only turned round where he stood and sat down again. Perhaps the impossibility of moving irritated him, as he suddenly cried out almost as furiously as before. \u201cListen, you miserable, contemptible creature! Don\u2019t you understand that if I haven\u2019t killed you, it\u2019s simply because I am keeping you to answer to\u2010morrow at the trial. God sees,\u201d Ivan raised his hand, \u201cperhaps I, too, was guilty; perhaps I really had a secret desire for my father\u2019s ... death, but I swear I was not as guilty as you think, and perhaps I didn\u2019t urge you on at all. No, no, I didn\u2019t urge you on! But no matter, I will give evidence against myself to\u2010morrow at the trial. I\u2019m determined to! I shall tell everything, everything. But we\u2019ll make our appearance together. And whatever you may say against me at the trial, whatever evidence you give, I\u2019ll face it; I am not afraid of you. I\u2019ll confirm it all myself! But you must confess, too! You must, you must; we\u2019ll go together. That\u2019s how it shall be!\u201d Ivan said this solemnly and resolutely and from his flashing eyes alone it could be seen that it would be so. \u201cYou are ill, I see; you are quite ill. Your eyes are yellow,\u201d Smerdyakov commented, without the least irony, with apparent sympathy in fact. \u201cWe\u2019ll go together,\u201d Ivan repeated. \u201cAnd if you won\u2019t go, no matter, I\u2019ll go alone.\u201d Smerdyakov paused as though pondering."], "In a reversal, which of the following witnesses blames Dmitri for the murder?": [" I remember how, immediately after it had been read, the President asked Mitya in a loud impressive voice: \u201cPrisoner, do you plead guilty?\u201d Mitya suddenly rose from his seat. \u201cI plead guilty to drunkenness and dissipation,\u201d he exclaimed, again in a startling, almost frenzied, voice, \u201cto idleness and debauchery. I meant to become an honest man for good, just at the moment when I was struck down by fate. But I am not guilty of the death of that old man, my enemy and my father. No, no, I am not guilty of robbing him! I could not be. Dmitri Karamazov is a scoundrel, but not a thief.\u201d He sat down again, visibly trembling all over. The President again briefly, but impressively, admonished him to answer only what was asked, and not to go off into irrelevant exclamations. Then he ordered the case to proceed. All the witnesses were led up to take the oath. Then I saw them all together. The brothers of the prisoner were, however, allowed to give evidence without taking the oath. After an exhortation from the priest and the President, the witnesses were led away and were made to sit as far as possible apart from one another. Then they began calling them up one by one. Chapter II. Dangerous Witnesses I do not know whether the witnesses for the defense and for the prosecution were separated into groups by the President, and whether it was arranged to call them in a certain order. But no doubt it was so.", " Judge and save us! We need not only your prayers but your prophecies!\u201d \u201cSpeak without buffoonery, and don\u2019t begin by insulting the members of your family,\u201d answered the elder, in a faint, exhausted voice. He was obviously getting more and more fatigued, and his strength was failing. \u201cAn unseemly farce which I foresaw when I came here!\u201d cried Dmitri indignantly. He too leapt up. \u201cForgive it, reverend Father,\u201d he added, addressing the elder. \u201cI am not a cultivated man, and I don\u2019t even know how to address you properly, but you have been deceived and you have been too good\u2010natured in letting us meet here. All my father wants is a scandal. Why he wants it only he can tell. He always has some motive. But I believe I know why\u2014\u201d \u201cThey all blame me, all of them!\u201d cried Fyodor Pavlovitch in his turn. \u201cPyotr Alexandrovitch here blames me too. You have been blaming me, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, you have!\u201d he turned suddenly to Mi\u00fcsov, although the latter was not dreaming of interrupting him. \u201cThey all accuse me of having hidden the children\u2019s money in my boots, and cheated them, but isn\u2019t there a court of law? There they will reckon out for you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, from your notes, your letters, and your agreements, how much money you had, how much you have spent, and how much you have left. Why does Pyotr Alexandrovitch refuse to pass judgment? Dmitri is not a stranger to him. Because they are all against me, while Dmitri Fyodorovitch is in debt to me, and not a little, but some thousands of which I have documentary proof.", " Here I\u2019ve torn my heart asunder before you, and you seize the opportunity and are fingering the wounds in both halves.... Oh, my God!\u201d In despair he hid his face in his hands. \u201cDon\u2019t worry yourself so, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,\u201d observed the prosecutor, \u201ceverything that is written down will be read over to you afterwards, and what you don\u2019t agree to we\u2019ll alter as you like. But now I\u2019ll ask you one little question for the second time. Has no one, absolutely no one, heard from you of that money you sewed up? That, I must tell you, is almost impossible to believe.\u201d \u201cNo one, no one, I told you so before, or you\u2019ve not understood anything! Let me alone!\u201d \u201cVery well, this matter is bound to be explained, and there\u2019s plenty of time for it, but meantime, consider; we have perhaps a dozen witnesses that you yourself spread it abroad, and even shouted almost everywhere about the three thousand you\u2019d spent here; three thousand, not fifteen hundred. And now, too, when you got hold of the money you had yesterday, you gave many people to understand that you had brought three thousand with you.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve got not dozens, but hundreds of witnesses, two hundred witnesses, two hundred have heard it, thousands have heard it!\u201d cried Mitya. \u201cWell, you see, all bear witness to it. And the word _all_ means something.\u201d \u201cIt means nothing. I talked rot, and every one began repeating it.\u201d \u201cBut what need had you to \u2018talk rot,\u2019 as you call it?\u201d \u201cThe devil knows.", " What for? What for?\u201d Ivan asked himself. \u201cYes, of course, I was expecting something and he is right....\u201d And he remembered for the hundredth time how, on the last night in his father\u2019s house, he had listened on the stairs. But he remembered it now with such anguish that he stood still on the spot as though he had been stabbed. \u201cYes, I expected it then, that\u2019s true! I wanted the murder, I did want the murder! Did I want the murder? Did I want it? I must kill Smerdyakov! If I don\u2019t dare kill Smerdyakov now, life is not worth living!\u201d Ivan did not go home, but went straight to Katerina Ivanovna and alarmed her by his appearance. He was like a madman. He repeated all his conversation with Smerdyakov, every syllable of it. He couldn\u2019t be calmed, however much she tried to soothe him: he kept walking about the room, speaking strangely, disconnectedly. At last he sat down, put his elbows on the table, leaned his head on his hands and pronounced this strange sentence: \u201cIf it\u2019s not Dmitri, but Smerdyakov who\u2019s the murderer, I share his guilt, for I put him up to it. Whether I did, I don\u2019t know yet. But if he is the murderer, and not Dmitri, then, of course, I am the murderer, too.\u201d When Katerina Ivanovna heard that, she got up from her seat without a word, went to her writing\u2010table, opened a box standing on it, took out a sheet of paper and laid it before Ivan. This was the document of which Ivan spoke to Alyosha later on as a \u201cconclusive proof\u201d that Dmitri had killed his father."], "What evidence does the prosecutor use to prove Dmitri\u2019s guilt?": [" Your peculiar view of the whole tragic episode is known to us already from the preliminary investigation. I won\u2019t attempt to conceal from you that it is highly individual and contradicts all the other evidence collected by the prosecution. And so I think it essential to press you to tell me what facts have led you to this conviction of your brother\u2019s innocence and of the guilt of another person against whom you gave evidence at the preliminary inquiry?\u201d \u201cI only answered the questions asked me at the preliminary inquiry,\u201d replied Alyosha, slowly and calmly. \u201cI made no accusation against Smerdyakov of myself.\u201d \u201cYet you gave evidence against him?\u201d \u201cI was led to do so by my brother Dmitri\u2019s words. I was told what took place at his arrest and how he had pointed to Smerdyakov before I was examined. I believe absolutely that my brother is innocent, and if he didn\u2019t commit the murder, then\u2014\u201d \u201cThen Smerdyakov? Why Smerdyakov? And why are you so completely persuaded of your brother\u2019s innocence?\u201d \u201cI cannot help believing my brother. I know he wouldn\u2019t lie to me. I saw from his face he wasn\u2019t lying.\u201d \u201cOnly from his face? Is that all the proof you have?\u201d \u201cI have no other proof.\u201d \u201cAnd of Smerdyakov\u2019s guilt you have no proof whatever but your brother\u2019s word and the expression of his face?\u201d \u201cNo, I have no other proof.\u201d The prosecutor dropped the examination at this point. The impression left by Alyosha\u2019s evidence on the public was most disappointing.", " But there are others who accuse him: there are vague rumors of a question, of a suspicion, an obscure report, a feeling of expectation. Finally, we have the evidence of a combination of facts very suggestive, though, I admit, inconclusive. In the first place we have precisely on the day of the catastrophe that fit, for the genuineness of which the prosecutor, for some reason, has felt obliged to make a careful defense. Then Smerdyakov\u2019s sudden suicide on the eve of the trial. Then the equally startling evidence given in court to\u2010day by the elder of the prisoner\u2019s brothers, who had believed in his guilt, but has to\u2010day produced a bundle of notes and proclaimed Smerdyakov as the murderer. Oh, I fully share the court\u2019s and the prosecutor\u2019s conviction that Ivan Karamazov is suffering from brain fever, that his statement may really be a desperate effort, planned in delirium, to save his brother by throwing the guilt on the dead man. But again Smerdyakov\u2019s name is pronounced, again there is a suggestion of mystery. There is something unexplained, incomplete. And perhaps it may one day be explained. But we won\u2019t go into that now. Of that later. \u201cThe court has resolved to go on with the trial, but, meantime, I might make a few remarks about the character\u2010sketch of Smerdyakov drawn with subtlety and talent by the prosecutor. But while I admire his talent I cannot agree with him. I have visited Smerdyakov, I have seen him and talked to him, and he made a very different impression on me.", " \u201cHe was certainly not in a normal state of mind: he told me himself that he saw visions when he was awake, that he met several persons in the street, who were dead, and that Satan visited him every evening,\u201d said the doctor, in conclusion. Having given his evidence, the celebrated doctor withdrew. The letter produced by Katerina Ivanovna was added to the material proofs. After some deliberation, the judges decided to proceed with the trial and to enter both the unexpected pieces of evidence (given by Ivan and Katerina Ivanovna) on the protocol. But I will not detail the evidence of the other witnesses, who only repeated and confirmed what had been said before, though all with their characteristic peculiarities. I repeat, all was brought together in the prosecutor\u2019s speech, which I shall quote immediately. Every one was excited, every one was electrified by the late catastrophe, and all were awaiting the speeches for the prosecution and the defense with intense impatience. Fetyukovitch was obviously shaken by Katerina Ivanovna\u2019s evidence. But the prosecutor was triumphant. When all the evidence had been taken, the court was adjourned for almost an hour. I believe it was just eight o\u2019clock when the President returned to his seat and our prosecutor, Ippolit Kirillovitch, began his speech. Chapter VI. The Prosecutor\u2019s Speech. Sketches Of Character Ippolit Kirillovitch began his speech, trembling with nervousness, with cold sweat on his forehead, feeling hot and cold all over by turns.", " Chapter VIII. A Treatise On Smerdyakov \u201cTo begin with, what was the source of this suspicion?\u201d (Ippolit Kirillovitch began.) \u201cThe first person who cried out that Smerdyakov had committed the murder was the prisoner himself at the moment of his arrest, yet from that time to this he had not brought forward a single fact to confirm the charge, nor the faintest suggestion of a fact. The charge is confirmed by three persons only\u2014the two brothers of the prisoner and Madame Svyetlov. The elder of these brothers expressed his suspicions only to\u2010day, when he was undoubtedly suffering from brain fever. But we know that for the last two months he has completely shared our conviction of his brother\u2019s guilt and did not attempt to combat that idea. But of that later. The younger brother has admitted that he has not the slightest fact to support his notion of Smerdyakov\u2019s guilt, and has only been led to that conclusion from the prisoner\u2019s own words and the expression of his face. Yes, that astounding piece of evidence has been brought forward twice to\u2010 day by him. Madame Svyetlov was even more astounding. \u2018What the prisoner tells you, you must believe; he is not a man to tell a lie.\u2019 That is all the evidence against Smerdyakov produced by these three persons, who are all deeply concerned in the prisoner\u2019s fate. And yet the theory of Smerdyakov\u2019s guilt has been noised about, has been and is still maintained."], "What happens after the jury spends time deliberating?": [" In the following days he became convinced of Mitya\u2019s guilt, as he got to know all the weight of evidence against him. There was evidence of people of no importance, Fenya and her mother, for instance, but the effect of it was almost overpowering. As to Perhotin, the people at the tavern, and at Plotnikov\u2019s shop, as well as the witnesses at Mokroe, their evidence seemed conclusive. It was the details that were so damning. The secret of the knocks impressed the lawyers almost as much as Grigory\u2019s evidence as to the open door. Grigory\u2019s wife, Marfa, in answer to Ivan\u2019s questions, declared that Smerdyakov had been lying all night the other side of the partition wall. \u201cHe was not three paces from our bed,\u201d and that although she was a sound sleeper she waked several times and heard him moaning, \u201cHe was moaning the whole time, moaning continually.\u201d Talking to Herzenstube, and giving it as his opinion that Smerdyakov was not mad, but only rather weak, Ivan only evoked from the old man a subtle smile. \u201cDo you know how he spends his time now?\u201d he asked; \u201clearning lists of French words by heart. He has an exercise\u2010book under his pillow with the French words written out in Russian letters for him by some one, he he he!\u201d Ivan ended by dismissing all doubts. He could not think of Dmitri without repulsion. Only one thing was strange, however. Alyosha persisted that Dmitri was not the murderer, and that \u201cin all probability\u201d Smerdyakov was.", " I give you my word before God I will! And if you will condemn me, I\u2019ll break my sword over my head myself and kiss the pieces. But spare me, do not rob me of my God! I know myself, I shall rebel! My heart is heavy, gentlemen ... spare me!\u201d He almost fell back in his place: his voice broke: he could hardly articulate the last phrase. Then the judges proceeded to put the questions and began to ask both sides to formulate their conclusions. But I will not describe the details. At last the jury rose to retire for consultation. The President was very tired, and so his last charge to the jury was rather feeble. \u201cBe impartial, don\u2019t be influenced by the eloquence of the defense, but yet weigh the arguments. Remember that there is a great responsibility laid upon you,\u201d and so on and so on. The jury withdrew and the court adjourned. People could get up, move about, exchange their accumulated impressions, refresh themselves at the buffet. It was very late, almost one o\u2019clock in the night, but nobody went away: the strain was so great that no one could think of repose. All waited with sinking hearts; though that is, perhaps, too much to say, for the ladies were only in a state of hysterical impatience and their hearts were untroubled. An acquittal, they thought, was inevitable. They all prepared themselves for a dramatic moment of general enthusiasm. I must own there were many among the men, too, who were convinced that an acquittal was inevitable.", " Why do you want to go meddling if your sacrifice is of no use to any one? Because you don\u2019t know yourself why you go! Oh, you\u2019d give a great deal to know yourself why you go! And can you have made up your mind? You\u2019ve not made up your mind. You\u2019ll sit all night deliberating whether to go or not. But you will go; you know you\u2019ll go. You know that whichever way you decide, the decision does not depend on you. You\u2019ll go because you won\u2019t dare not to go. Why won\u2019t you dare? You must guess that for yourself. That\u2019s a riddle for you!\u2019 He got up and went away. You came and he went. He called me a coward, Alyosha! _Le mot de l\u2019\u00e9nigme_ is that I am a coward. \u2018It is not for such eagles to soar above the earth.\u2019 It was he added that\u2014he! And Smerdyakov said the same. He must be killed! Katya despises me. I\u2019ve seen that for a month past. Even Lise will begin to despise me! \u2018You are going in order to be praised.\u2019 That\u2019s a brutal lie! And you despise me too, Alyosha. Now I am going to hate you again! And I hate the monster, too! I hate the monster! I don\u2019t want to save the monster. Let him rot in Siberia! He\u2019s begun singing a hymn! Oh, to\u2010morrow I\u2019ll go, stand before them, and spit in their faces!\u201d He jumped up in a frenzy, flung off the towel, and fell to pacing up and down the room again. Alyosha recalled what he had just said. \u201cI seem to be sleeping awake.... I walk, I speak, I see, but I am asleep.\u201d It seemed to be just like that now.", " Such a murder can only be reckoned parricide by prejudice. \u201cBut I appeal to you again and again from the depths of my soul; did this murder actually take place? Gentlemen of the jury, if we convict and punish him, he will say to himself: \u2018These people have done nothing for my bringing up, for my education, nothing to improve my lot, nothing to make me better, nothing to make me a man. These people have not given me to eat and to drink, have not visited me in prison and nakedness, and here they have sent me to penal servitude. I am quits, I owe them nothing now, and owe no one anything for ever. They are wicked and I will be wicked. They are cruel and I will be cruel.\u2019 That is what he will say, gentlemen of the jury. And I swear, by finding him guilty you will only make it easier for him: you will ease his conscience, he will curse the blood he has shed and will not regret it. At the same time you will destroy in him the possibility of becoming a new man, for he will remain in his wickedness and blindness all his life. \u201cBut do you want to punish him fearfully, terribly, with the most awful punishment that could be imagined, and at the same time to save him and regenerate his soul? If so, overwhelm him with your mercy! You will see, you will hear how he will tremble and be horror\u2010struck. \u2018How can I endure this mercy? How can I endure so much love? Am I worthy of it?\u2019 That\u2019s what he will exclaim."], "After the verdict, Dmitri says he forgives whom?": [" It\u2019s your decision will decide it. Perhaps it\u2019s you that is superior and not Ivan. You see, it\u2019s a question of conscience, question of the higher conscience\u2014the secret is so important that I can\u2019t settle it myself, and I\u2019ve put it off till I could speak to you. But anyway it\u2019s too early to decide now, for we must wait for the verdict. As soon as the verdict is given, you shall decide my fate. Don\u2019t decide it now. I\u2019ll tell you now. You listen, but don\u2019t decide. Stand and keep quiet. I won\u2019t tell you everything. I\u2019ll only tell you the idea, without details, and you keep quiet. Not a question, not a movement. You agree? But, goodness, what shall I do with your eyes? I\u2019m afraid your eyes will tell me your decision, even if you don\u2019t speak. Oo! I\u2019m afraid! Alyosha, listen! Ivan suggests my _escaping_. I won\u2019t tell you the details: it\u2019s all been thought out: it can all be arranged. Hush, don\u2019t decide. I should go to America with Grusha. You know I can\u2019t live without Grusha! What if they won\u2019t let her follow me to Siberia? Do they let convicts get married? Ivan thinks not. And without Grusha what should I do there underground with a hammer? I should only smash my skull with the hammer! But, on the other hand, my conscience? I should have run away from suffering. A sign has come, I reject the sign. I have a way of salvation and I turn my back on it. Ivan says that in America, \u2018with the good\u2010will,\u2019 I can be of more use than underground.", " Alyosha got up and went to Rakitin. \u201cMisha,\u201d he said, \u201cdon\u2019t be angry. She wounded you, but don\u2019t be angry. You heard what she said just now? You mustn\u2019t ask too much of human endurance, one must be merciful.\u201d Alyosha said this at the instinctive prompting of his heart. He felt obliged to speak and he turned to Rakitin. If Rakitin had not been there, he would have spoken to the air. But Rakitin looked at him ironically and Alyosha stopped short. \u201cYou were so primed up with your elder\u2019s teaching last night that now you have to let it off on me, Alexey, man of God!\u201d said Rakitin, with a smile of hatred. \u201cDon\u2019t laugh, Rakitin, don\u2019t smile, don\u2019t talk of the dead\u2014he was better than any one in the world!\u201d cried Alyosha, with tears in his voice. \u201cI didn\u2019t speak to you as a judge but as the lowest of the judged. What am I beside her? I came here seeking my ruin, and said to myself, \u2018What does it matter?\u2019 in my cowardliness, but she, after five years in torment, as soon as any one says a word from the heart to her\u2014it makes her forget everything, forgive everything, in her tears! The man who has wronged her has come back, he sends for her and she forgives him everything, and hastens joyfully to meet him and she won\u2019t take a knife with her. She won\u2019t! No, I am not like that. I don\u2019t know whether you are, Misha, but I am not like that. It\u2019s a lesson to me.... She is more loving than we.... Have you heard her speak before of what she has just told us?", " Yes, you represent Russia here at this moment, and your verdict will be heard not in this hall only but will re\u00ebcho throughout the whole of Russia, and all Russia will hear you, as her champions and her judges, and she will be encouraged or disheartened by your verdict. Do not disappoint Russia and her expectations. Our fatal troika dashes on in her headlong flight perhaps to destruction and in all Russia for long past men have stretched out imploring hands and called a halt to its furious reckless course. And if other nations stand aside from that troika that may be, not from respect, as the poet would fain believe, but simply from horror. From horror, perhaps from disgust. And well it is that they stand aside, but maybe they will cease one day to do so and will form a firm wall confronting the hurrying apparition and will check the frenzied rush of our lawlessness, for the sake of their own safety, enlightenment and civilization. Already we have heard voices of alarm from Europe, they already begin to sound. Do not tempt them! Do not heap up their growing hatred by a sentence justifying the murder of a father by his son!\u201d Though Ippolit Kirillovitch was genuinely moved, he wound up his speech with this rhetorical appeal\u2014and the effect produced by him was extraordinary. When he had finished his speech, he went out hurriedly and, as I have mentioned before, almost fainted in the adjoining room.", " \u201cNever mind him, anyway; have done with him and forget him. And let him take with him all that you curse now, and never come back!\u201d \u201cYes, but he is spiteful. He laughed at me. He was impudent, Alyosha,\u201d Ivan said, with a shudder of offense. \u201cBut he was unfair to me, unfair to me about lots of things. He told lies about me to my face. \u2018Oh, you are going to perform an act of heroic virtue: to confess you murdered your father, that the valet murdered him at your instigation.\u2019 \u201d \u201cBrother,\u201d Alyosha interposed, \u201crestrain yourself. It was not you murdered him. It\u2019s not true!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what he says, he, and he knows it. \u2018You are going to perform an act of heroic virtue, and you don\u2019t believe in virtue; that\u2019s what tortures you and makes you angry, that\u2019s why you are so vindictive.\u2019 He said that to me about me and he knows what he says.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s you say that, not he,\u201d exclaimed Alyosha mournfully, \u201cand you say it because you are ill and delirious, tormenting yourself.\u201d \u201cNo, he knows what he says. \u2018You are going from pride,\u2019 he says. \u2018You\u2019ll stand up and say it was I killed him, and why do you writhe with horror? You are lying! I despise your opinion, I despise your horror!\u2019 He said that about me. \u2018And do you know you are longing for their praise\u2014\u201che is a criminal, a murderer, but what a generous soul; he wanted to save his brother and he confessed.\u201d \u2019 That\u2019s a lie, Alyosha!\u201d Ivan cried suddenly, with flashing eyes."], "After the trial, Katerina tells Alyosha about a plan to do what?": [" They\u2019ve planned it together, the three of them\u2014Mitya, Katerina, and Ivan Fyodorovitch. Alyosha, I\u2019ve been wanting to ask you a long time. A week ago he suddenly told me that Ivan was in love with Katerina, because he often goes to see her. Did he tell me the truth or not? Tell me, on your conscience, tell me the worst.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t tell you a lie. Ivan is not in love with Katerina Ivanovna, I think.\u201d \u201cOh, that\u2019s what I thought! He is lying to me, shameless deceiver, that\u2019s what it is! And he was jealous of me just now, so as to put the blame on me afterwards. He is stupid, he can\u2019t disguise what he is doing; he is so open, you know.... But I\u2019ll give it to him, I\u2019ll give it to him! \u2018You believe I did it,\u2019 he said. He said that to me, to me. He reproached me with that! God forgive him! You wait, I\u2019ll make it hot for Katerina at the trial! I\u2019ll just say a word then ... I\u2019ll tell everything then!\u201d And again she cried bitterly. \u201cThis I can tell you for certain, Grushenka,\u201d Alyosha said, getting up. \u201cFirst, that he loves you, loves you more than any one in the world, and you only, believe me. I know. I do know. The second thing is that I don\u2019t want to worm his secret out of him, but if he\u2019ll tell me of himself to\u2010 day, I shall tell him straight out that I have promised to tell you. Then I\u2019ll come to you to\u2010day, and tell you. Only ... I fancy ... Katerina Ivanovna has nothing to do with it, and that the secret is about something else.", " I only remember a few exclamations I heard on the steps as I went out. \u201cHe\u2019ll have a twenty years\u2019 trip to the mines!\u201d \u201cNot less.\u201d \u201cWell, our peasants have stood firm.\u201d \u201cAnd have done for our Mitya.\u201d EPILOGUE Chapter I. Plans For Mitya\u2019s Escape Very early, at nine o\u2019clock in the morning, five days after the trial, Alyosha went to Katerina Ivanovna\u2019s to talk over a matter of great importance to both of them, and to give her a message. She sat and talked to him in the very room in which she had once received Grushenka. In the next room Ivan Fyodorovitch lay unconscious in a high fever. Katerina Ivanovna had immediately after the scene at the trial ordered the sick and unconscious man to be carried to her house, disregarding the inevitable gossip and general disapproval of the public. One of the two relations who lived with her had departed to Moscow immediately after the scene in court, the other remained. But if both had gone away, Katerina Ivanovna would have adhered to her resolution, and would have gone on nursing the sick man and sitting by him day and night. Varvinsky and Herzenstube were attending him. The famous doctor had gone back to Moscow, refusing to give an opinion as to the probable end of the illness. Though the doctors encouraged Katerina Ivanovna and Alyosha, it was evident that they could not yet give them positive hopes of recovery. Alyosha came to see his sick brother twice a day.", " Katerina Ivanovna\u2019s \u201creturns\u201d to Mitya, that is, her brief but violent revulsions of feeling in his favor, drove Ivan to perfect frenzy. Strange to say, until that last scene described above, when Alyosha came from Mitya to Katerina Ivanovna, Ivan had never once, during that month, heard her express a doubt of Mitya\u2019s guilt, in spite of those \u201creturns\u201d that were so hateful to him. It is remarkable, too, that while he felt that he hated Mitya more and more every day, he realized that it was not on account of Katya\u2019s \u201creturns\u201d that he hated him, but just _because he was the murderer of his father_. He was conscious of this and fully recognized it to himself. Nevertheless, he went to see Mitya ten days before the trial and proposed to him a plan of escape\u2014a plan he had obviously thought over a long time. He was partly impelled to do this by a sore place still left in his heart from a phrase of Smerdyakov\u2019s, that it was to his, Ivan\u2019s, advantage that his brother should be convicted, as that would increase his inheritance and Alyosha\u2019s from forty to sixty thousand roubles. He determined to sacrifice thirty thousand on arranging Mitya\u2019s escape. On his return from seeing him, he was very mournful and dispirited; he suddenly began to feel that he was anxious for Mitya\u2019s escape, not only to heal that sore place by sacrificing thirty thousand, but for another reason. \u201cIs it because I am as much a murderer at heart?\u201d he asked himself.", " But this time he had specially urgent business, and he foresaw how difficult it would be to approach the subject, yet he was in great haste. He had another engagement that could not be put off for that same morning, and there was need of haste. They had been talking for a quarter of an hour. Katerina Ivanovna was pale and terribly fatigued, yet at the same time in a state of hysterical excitement. She had a presentiment of the reason why Alyosha had come to her. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about his decision,\u201d she said, with confident emphasis to Alyosha. \u201cOne way or another he is bound to come to it. He must escape. That unhappy man, that hero of honor and principle\u2014not he, not Dmitri Fyodorovitch, but the man lying the other side of that door, who has sacrificed himself for his brother,\u201d Katya added, with flashing eyes\u2014\u201ctold me the whole plan of escape long ago.

Ivan Fyodorovitch has already visited the superintendent of the third _\u00e9tape_. But we don\u2019t know yet who will be in charge of the party, and it\u2019s impossible to find that out so long beforehand. To\u2010morrow perhaps I will show you in detail the whole plan which Ivan Fyodorovitch left me on the eve of the trial in case of need.... That was when\u2014do you remember?\u2014you found us quarreling."], "The escape plan will involve Dmitri moving where?": [" He had just gone down\u2010stairs, but seeing you I made him come back; do you remember? Do you know what we were quarreling about then?\u201d \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d said Alyosha. \u201cOf course he did not tell you. It was about that plan of escape. He had told me the main idea three days before, and we began quarreling about it at once and quarreled for three days. We quarreled because, when he told me that if Dmitri Fyodorovitch were convicted he would escape abroad with that creature, I felt furious at once\u2014I can\u2019t tell you why, I don\u2019t know myself why.... Oh, of course, I was furious then about that creature, and that she, too, should go abroad with Dmitri!\u201d Katerina Ivanovna exclaimed suddenly, her lips quivering with anger. \u201cAs soon as Ivan Fyodorovitch saw that I was furious about that woman, he instantly imagined I was jealous of Dmitri and that I still loved Dmitri. That is how our first quarrel began. I would not give an explanation, I could not ask forgiveness. I could not bear to think that such a man could suspect me of still loving that ... and when I myself had told him long before that I did not love Dmitri, that I loved no one but him! It was only resentment against that creature that made me angry with him. Three days later, on the evening you came, he brought me a sealed envelope, which I was to open at once, if anything happened to him. Oh, he foresaw his illness! He told me that the envelope contained the details of the escape, and that if he died or was taken dangerously ill, I was to save Mitya alone.", " Katerina Ivanovna\u2019s \u201creturns\u201d to Mitya, that is, her brief but violent revulsions of feeling in his favor, drove Ivan to perfect frenzy.

Even while he was saying good\u2010by to Lise, the thought had struck him that he must attempt some stratagem to find his brother Dmitri, who was evidently keeping out of his way. It was getting late, nearly three o\u2019clock. Alyosha\u2019s whole soul turned to the monastery, to his dying saint, but the necessity of seeing Dmitri outweighed everything. The conviction that a great inevitable catastrophe was about to happen grew stronger in Alyosha\u2019s mind with every hour. What that catastrophe was, and what he would say at that moment to his brother, he could perhaps not have said definitely. \u201cEven if my benefactor must die without me, anyway I won\u2019t have to reproach myself all my life with the thought that I might have saved something and did not, but passed by and hastened home. If I do as I intend, I shall be following his great precept.\u201d His plan was to catch his brother Dmitri unawares, to climb over the fence, as he had the day before, get into the garden and sit in the summer\u2010house. If Dmitri were not there, thought Alyosha, he would not announce himself to Foma or the women of the house, but would remain hidden in the summer\u2010house, even if he had to wait there till evening. If, as before, Dmitri were lying in wait for Grushenka to come, he would be very likely to come to the summer\u2010house. Alyosha did not, however, give much thought to the details of his plan, but resolved to act upon it, even if it meant not getting back to the monastery that day."], "Who refuses to forgive Katerina?": [" What do I care for a hell for oppressors? What good can hell do, since those children have already been tortured? And what becomes of harmony, if there is hell? I want to forgive. I want to embrace. I don\u2019t want more suffering. And if the sufferings of children go to swell the sum of sufferings which was necessary to pay for truth, then I protest that the truth is not worth such a price. I don\u2019t want the mother to embrace the oppressor who threw her son to the dogs! She dare not forgive him! Let her forgive him for herself, if she will, let her forgive the torturer for the immeasurable suffering of her mother\u2019s heart. But the sufferings of her tortured child she has no right to forgive; she dare not forgive the torturer, even if the child were to forgive him! And if that is so, if they dare not forgive, what becomes of harmony? Is there in the whole world a being who would have the right to forgive and could forgive? I don\u2019t want harmony. From love for humanity I don\u2019t want it. I would rather be left with the unavenged suffering. I would rather remain with my unavenged suffering and unsatisfied indignation, _even if I were wrong_. Besides, too high a price is asked for harmony; it\u2019s beyond our means to pay so much to enter on it. And so I hasten to give back my entrance ticket, and if I am an honest man I am bound to give it back as soon as possible. And that I am doing. It\u2019s not God that I don\u2019t accept, Alyosha, only I most respectfully return Him the ticket.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s rebellion,\u201d murmured Alyosha, looking down.", " They\u2019ve planned it together, the three of them\u2014Mitya, Katerina, and Ivan Fyodorovitch. Alyosha, I\u2019ve been wanting to ask you a long time. A week ago he suddenly told me that Ivan was in love with Katerina, because he often goes to see her. Did he tell me the truth or not?

It\u2019s more than I can bear now.\u201d She was getting up from her place, but suddenly uttered a loud scream and staggered back. Grushenka walked suddenly and noiselessly into the room. No one had expected her. Katya moved swiftly to the door, but when she reached Grushenka, she stopped suddenly, turned as white as chalk and moaned softly, almost in a whisper: \u201cForgive me!\u201d Grushenka stared at her and, pausing for an instant, in a vindictive, venomous voice, answered: \u201cWe are full of hatred, my girl, you and I! We are both full of hatred! As though we could forgive one another! Save him, and I\u2019ll worship you all my life.\u201d \u201cYou won\u2019t forgive her!\u201d cried Mitya, with frantic reproach. \u201cDon\u2019t be anxious, I\u2019ll save him for you!\u201d Katya whispered rapidly, and she ran out of the room. \u201cAnd you could refuse to forgive her when she begged your forgiveness herself?\u201d Mitya exclaimed bitterly again. \u201cMitya, don\u2019t dare to blame her; you have no right to!\u201d Alyosha cried hotly. \u201cHer proud lips spoke, not her heart,\u201d Grushenka brought out in a tone of disgust. \u201cIf she saves you I\u2019ll forgive her everything\u2014\u201d She stopped speaking, as though suppressing something. She could not yet recover herself. She had come in, as appeared afterwards, accidentally, with no suspicion of what she would meet.", " \u201cBut the prosecutor refuses to allow that he could the same day have set aside half the money and sewn it up in a little bag. That\u2019s not his character, he tells us, he couldn\u2019t have had such feelings. But yet he talked himself of the broad Karamazov nature; he cried out about the two extremes which a Karamazov can contemplate at once. Karamazov is just such a two\u2010sided nature, fluctuating between two extremes, that even when moved by the most violent craving for riotous gayety, he can pull himself up, if something strikes him on the other side. And on the other side is love\u2014that new love which had flamed up in his heart, and for that love he needed money; oh, far more than for carousing with his mistress. If she were to say to him, \u2018I am yours, I won\u2019t have Fyodor Pavlovitch,\u2019 then he must have money to take her away. That was more important than carousing. Could a Karamazov fail to understand it? That anxiety was just what he was suffering from\u2014what is there improbable in his laying aside that money and concealing it in case of emergency? \u201cBut time passed, and Fyodor Pavlovitch did not give the prisoner the expected three thousand; on the contrary, the latter heard that he meant to use this sum to seduce the woman he, the prisoner, loved. \u2018If Fyodor Pavlovitch doesn\u2019t give the money,\u2019 he thought, \u2018I shall be put in the position of a thief before Katerina Ivanovna.\u2019 And then the idea presented itself to him that he would go to Katerina Ivanovna, lay before her the fifteen hundred roubles he still carried round his neck, and say, \u2018I am a scoundrel, but not a thief.\u2019 So here we have already a twofold reason why he should guard that sum of money as the apple of his eye, why he shouldn\u2019t unpick the little bag, and spend it a hundred at a time."], "Whose funeral does Alyosha attend?": [" \u201cAlyosha, run after her!\u201d Mitya cried to his brother; \u201ctell her ... I don\u2019t know ... don\u2019t let her go away like this!\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll come to you again at nightfall,\u201d said Alyosha, and he ran after Katya. He overtook her outside the hospital grounds. She was walking fast, but as soon as Alyosha caught her up she said quickly: \u201cNo, before that woman I can\u2019t punish myself! I asked her forgiveness because I wanted to punish myself to the bitter end. She would not forgive me.... I like her for that!\u201d she added, in an unnatural voice, and her eyes flashed with fierce resentment. \u201cMy brother did not expect this in the least,\u201d muttered Alyosha. \u201cHe was sure she would not come\u2014\u201d \u201cNo doubt. Let us leave that,\u201d she snapped. \u201cListen: I can\u2019t go with you to the funeral now. I\u2019ve sent them flowers. I think they still have money. If necessary, tell them I\u2019ll never abandon them.... Now leave me, leave me, please. You are late as it is\u2014the bells are ringing for the service.... Leave me, please!\u201d Chapter III. Ilusha\u2019s Funeral. The Speech At The Stone He really was late. They had waited for him and had already decided to bear the pretty flower\u2010decked little coffin to the church without him. It was the coffin of poor little Ilusha. He had died two days after Mitya was sentenced. At the gate of the house Alyosha was met by the shouts of the boys, Ilusha\u2019s schoolfellows. They had all been impatiently expecting him and were glad that he had come at last.", " At one moment he went up to the coffin to set straight the cover or the wreath, when a candle fell out of the candlestick he rushed to replace it and was a fearful time fumbling over it, then he subsided and stood quietly by the coffin with a look of blank uneasiness and perplexity. After the Epistle he suddenly whispered to Alyosha, who was standing beside him, that the Epistle had not been read properly but did not explain what he meant. During the prayer, \u201cLike the Cherubim,\u201d he joined in the singing but did not go on to the end. Falling on his knees, he pressed his forehead to the stone floor and lay so for a long while. At last came the funeral service itself and candles were distributed. The distracted father began fussing about again, but the touching and impressive funeral prayers moved and roused his soul. He seemed suddenly to shrink together and broke into rapid, short sobs, which he tried at first to smother, but at last he sobbed aloud. When they began taking leave of the dead and closing the coffin, he flung his arms about, as though he would not allow them to cover Ilusha, and began greedily and persistently kissing his dead boy on the lips. At last they succeeded in persuading him to come away from the step, but suddenly he impulsively stretched out his hand and snatched a few flowers from the coffin. He looked at them and a new idea seemed to dawn upon him, so that he apparently forgot his grief for a minute.", " Of course there had been, in former times, saints in the monastery whose memory was carefully preserved and whose relics, according to tradition, showed no signs of corruption. This fact was regarded by the monks as touching and mysterious, and the tradition of it was cherished as something blessed and miraculous, and as a promise, by God\u2019s grace, of still greater glory from their tombs in the future. One such, whose memory was particularly cherished, was an old monk, Job, who had died seventy years before at the age of a hundred and five. He had been a celebrated ascetic, rigid in fasting and silence, and his tomb was pointed out to all visitors on their arrival with peculiar respect and mysterious hints of great hopes connected with it. (That was the very tomb on which Father Pa\u00efssy had found Alyosha sitting in the morning.) Another memory cherished in the monastery was that of the famous Father Varsonofy, who was only recently dead and had preceded Father Zossima in the eldership. He was reverenced during his lifetime as a crazy saint by all the pilgrims to the monastery. There was a tradition that both of these had lain in their coffins as though alive, that they had shown no signs of decomposition when they were buried and that there had been a holy light in their faces. And some people even insisted that a sweet fragrance came from their bodies. Yet, in spite of these edifying memories, it would be difficult to explain the frivolity, absurdity and malice that were manifested beside the coffin of Father Zossima.", " \u201cWhat do you think, Karamazov? Had we better come back here to\u2010night? He\u2019ll be drunk, you know.\u201d \u201cPerhaps he will. Let us come together, you and I, that will be enough, to spend an hour with them, with the mother and Nina. If we all come together we shall remind them of everything again,\u201d Alyosha suggested. \u201cThe landlady is laying the table for them now\u2014there\u2019ll be a funeral dinner or something, the priest is coming; shall we go back to it, Karamazov?\u201d \u201cOf course,\u201d said Alyosha. \u201cIt\u2019s all so strange, Karamazov, such sorrow and then pancakes after it, it all seems so unnatural in our religion.\u201d \u201cThey are going to have salmon, too,\u201d the boy who had discovered about Troy observed in a loud voice. \u201cI beg you most earnestly, Kartashov, not to interrupt again with your idiotic remarks, especially when one is not talking to you and doesn\u2019t care to know whether you exist or not!\u201d Kolya snapped out irritably. The boy flushed crimson but did not dare to reply. Meantime they were strolling slowly along the path and suddenly Smurov exclaimed: \u201cThere\u2019s Ilusha\u2019s stone, under which they wanted to bury him.\u201d They all stood still by the big stone. Alyosha looked and the whole picture of what Snegiryov had described to him that day, how Ilusha, weeping and hugging his father, had cried, \u201cFather, father, how he insulted you,\u201d rose at once before his imagination. A sudden impulse seemed to come into his soul."], "At the funeral, Alyosha encourages the schoolboys to hang on to what?": [" \u201cAlyosha, run after her!\u201d Mitya cried to his brother; \u201ctell her ... I don\u2019t know ... don\u2019t let her go away like this!\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll come to you again at nightfall,\u201d said Alyosha, and he ran after Katya. He overtook her outside the hospital grounds. She was walking fast, but as soon as Alyosha caught her up she said quickly: \u201cNo, before that woman I can\u2019t punish myself! I asked her forgiveness because I wanted to punish myself to the bitter end. She would not forgive me.... I like her for that!\u201d she added, in an unnatural voice, and her eyes flashed with fierce resentment. \u201cMy brother did not expect this in the least,\u201d muttered Alyosha. \u201cHe was sure she would not come\u2014\u201d \u201cNo doubt. Let us leave that,\u201d she snapped. \u201cListen: I can\u2019t go with you to the funeral now. I\u2019ve sent them flowers. I think they still have money. If necessary, tell them I\u2019ll never abandon them.... Now leave me, leave me, please. You are late as it is\u2014the bells are ringing for the service.... Leave me, please!\u201d Chapter III. Ilusha\u2019s Funeral. The Speech At The Stone He really was late. They had waited for him and had already decided to bear the pretty flower\u2010decked little coffin to the church without him. It was the coffin of poor little Ilusha. He had died two days after Mitya was sentenced. At the gate of the house Alyosha was met by the shouts of the boys, Ilusha\u2019s schoolfellows. They had all been impatiently expecting him and were glad that he had come at last.", " Your Herzenstube will come and say that he can make nothing of it! Water, water! Mamma, for goodness\u2019 sake go yourself and hurry Yulia, she is such a slowcoach and never can come quickly! Make haste, mamma, or I shall die.\u201d \u201cWhy, it\u2019s nothing much,\u201d cried Alyosha, frightened at this alarm. Yulia ran in with water and Alyosha put his finger in it. \u201cSome lint, mamma, for mercy\u2019s sake, bring some lint and that muddy caustic lotion for wounds, what\u2019s it called? We\u2019ve got some. You know where the bottle is, mamma; it\u2019s in your bedroom in the right\u2010hand cupboard, there\u2019s a big bottle of it there with the lint.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll bring everything in a minute, Lise, only don\u2019t scream and don\u2019t fuss. You see how bravely Alexey Fyodorovitch bears it. Where did you get such a dreadful wound, Alexey Fyodorovitch?\u201d Madame Hohlakov hastened away. This was all Lise was waiting for. \u201cFirst of all, answer the question, where did you get hurt like this?\u201d she asked Alyosha, quickly. \u201cAnd then I\u2019ll talk to you about something quite different. Well?\u201d Instinctively feeling that the time of her mother\u2019s absence was precious for her, Alyosha hastened to tell her of his enigmatic meeting with the schoolboys in the fewest words possible. Lise clasped her hands at his story. \u201cHow can you, and in that dress too, associate with schoolboys?\u201d she cried angrily, as though she had a right to control him. \u201cYou are nothing but a boy yourself if you can do that, a perfect boy!", " And what of Dmitri? He too will be harder than yesterday, he too must be spiteful and angry, and he too, no doubt, has made some plan. Oh, I must succeed in finding him to\u2010day, whatever happens.\u201d But Alyosha had not long to meditate. An incident occurred on the road, which, though apparently of little consequence, made a great impression on him. Just after he had crossed the square and turned the corner coming out into Mihailovsky Street, which is divided by a small ditch from the High Street (our whole town is intersected by ditches), he saw a group of schoolboys between the ages of nine and twelve, at the bridge. They were going home from school, some with their bags on their shoulders, others with leather satchels slung across them, some in short jackets, others in little overcoats. Some even had those high boots with creases round the ankles, such as little boys spoilt by rich fathers love to wear. The whole group was talking eagerly about something, apparently holding a council. Alyosha had never from his Moscow days been able to pass children without taking notice of them, and although he was particularly fond of children of three or thereabout, he liked schoolboys of ten and eleven too. And so, anxious as he was to\u2010day, he wanted at once to turn aside to talk to them. He looked into their excited rosy faces, and noticed at once that all the boys had stones in their hands.", " At one moment he went up to the coffin to set straight the cover or the wreath, when a candle fell out of the candlestick he rushed to replace it and was a fearful time fumbling over it, then he subsided and stood quietly by the coffin with a look of blank uneasiness and perplexity. After the Epistle he suddenly whispered to Alyosha, who was standing beside him, that the Epistle had not been read properly but did not explain what he meant. During the prayer, \u201cLike the Cherubim,\u201d he joined in the singing but did not go on to the end. Falling on his knees, he pressed his forehead to the stone floor and lay so for a long while. At last came the funeral service itself and candles were distributed. The distracted father began fussing about again, but the touching and impressive funeral prayers moved and roused his soul. He seemed suddenly to shrink together and broke into rapid, short sobs, which he tried at first to smother, but at last he sobbed aloud. When they began taking leave of the dead and closing the coffin, he flung his arms about, as though he would not allow them to cover Ilusha, and began greedily and persistently kissing his dead boy on the lips. At last they succeeded in persuading him to come away from the step, but suddenly he impulsively stretched out his hand and snatched a few flowers from the coffin. He looked at them and a new idea seemed to dawn upon him, so that he apparently forgot his grief for a minute."], "Which brother possesses a genuine love for mankind?": [" Alyosha had never seen such a smile on his face before. Chapter IV. Rebellion \u201cI must make you one confession,\u201d Ivan began. \u201cI could never understand how one can love one\u2019s neighbors. It\u2019s just one\u2019s neighbors, to my mind, that one can\u2019t love, though one might love those at a distance. I once read somewhere of John the Merciful, a saint, that when a hungry, frozen beggar came to him, he took him into his bed, held him in his arms, and began breathing into his mouth, which was putrid and loathsome from some awful disease. I am convinced that he did that from \u2018self\u2010laceration,\u2019 from the self\u2010laceration of falsity, for the sake of the charity imposed by duty, as a penance laid on him. For any one to love a man, he must be hidden, for as soon as he shows his face, love is gone.\u201d \u201cFather Zossima has talked of that more than once,\u201d observed Alyosha; \u201che, too, said that the face of a man often hinders many people not practiced in love, from loving him. But yet there\u2019s a great deal of love in mankind, and almost Christ\u2010like love. I know that myself, Ivan.\u201d \u201cWell, I know nothing of it so far, and can\u2019t understand it, and the innumerable mass of mankind are with me there. The question is, whether that\u2019s due to men\u2019s bad qualities or whether it\u2019s inherent in their nature. To my thinking, Christ\u2010like love for men is a miracle impossible on earth. He was God. But we are not gods. Suppose I, for instance, suffer intensely.", " He suddenly fancied that Alyosha might think he was trying to show off his knowledge and to prove that he was \u201cgrown up.\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t the slightest desire to show off my knowledge to him,\u201d Kolya thought indignantly. And all of a sudden he felt horribly annoyed. \u201cI must confess I can\u2019t endure entering on such discussions,\u201d he said with a final air. \u201cIt\u2019s possible for one who doesn\u2019t believe in God to love mankind, don\u2019t you think so? Voltaire didn\u2019t believe in God and loved mankind?\u201d (\u201cI am at it again,\u201d he thought to himself.) \u201cVoltaire believed in God, though not very much, I think, and I don\u2019t think he loved mankind very much either,\u201d said Alyosha quietly, gently, and quite naturally, as though he were talking to some one of his own age, or even older. Kolya was particularly struck by Alyosha\u2019s apparent diffidence about his opinion of Voltaire. He seemed to be leaving the question for him, little Kolya, to settle. \u201cHave you read Voltaire?\u201d Alyosha finished. \u201cNo, not to say read.... But I\u2019ve read _Candide_ in the Russian translation ... in an absurd, grotesque, old translation ... (At it again! again! )\u201d \u201cAnd did you understand it?\u201d \u201cOh, yes, everything.... That is ... Why do you suppose I shouldn\u2019t understand it? There\u2019s a lot of nastiness in it, of course.... Of course I can understand that it\u2019s a philosophical novel and written to advocate an idea....\u201d Kolya was getting mixed by now.", " Remember, too, every day, and whenever you can, repeat to yourself, \u201cLord, have mercy on all who appear before Thee to\u2010day.\u201d For every hour and every moment thousands of men leave life on this earth, and their souls appear before God. And how many of them depart in solitude, unknown, sad, dejected that no one mourns for them or even knows whether they have lived or not! And behold, from the other end of the earth perhaps, your prayer for their rest will rise up to God though you knew them not nor they you. How touching it must be to a soul standing in dread before the Lord to feel at that instant that, for him too, there is one to pray, that there is a fellow creature left on earth to love him too! And God will look on you both more graciously, for if you have had so much pity on him, how much will He have pity Who is infinitely more loving and merciful than you! And He will forgive him for your sake. Brothers, have no fear of men\u2019s sin. Love a man even in his sin, for that is the semblance of Divine Love and is the highest love on earth. Love all God\u2019s creation, the whole and every grain of sand in it. Love every leaf, every ray of God\u2019s light. Love the animals, love the plants, love everything. If you love everything, you will perceive the divine mystery in things. Once you perceive it, you will begin to comprehend it better every day. And you will come at last to love the whole world with an all\u2010 embracing love.", " Know the measure, know the times, study that. When you are left alone, pray. Love to throw yourself on the earth and kiss it. Kiss the earth and love it with an unceasing, consuming love. Love all men, love everything. Seek that rapture and ecstasy. Water the earth with the tears of your joy and love those tears. Don\u2019t be ashamed of that ecstasy, prize it, for it is a gift of God and a great one; it is not given to many but only to the elect. _(i) Of Hell and Hell Fire, a Mystic Reflection_ Fathers and teachers, I ponder, \u201cWhat is hell?\u201d I maintain that it is the suffering of being unable to love. Once in infinite existence, immeasurable in time and space, a spiritual creature was given on his coming to earth, the power of saying, \u201cI am and I love.\u201d Once, only once, there was given him a moment of active _living_ love, and for that was earthly life given him, and with it times and seasons. And that happy creature rejected the priceless gift, prized it and loved it not, scorned it and remained callous. Such a one, having left the earth, sees Abraham\u2019s bosom and talks with Abraham as we are told in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, and beholds heaven and can go up to the Lord. But that is just his torment, to rise up to the Lord without ever having loved, to be brought close to those who have loved when he has despised their love. For he sees clearly and says to himself, \u201cNow I have understanding, and though I now thirst to love, there will be nothing great, no sacrifice in my love, for my earthly life is over, and Abraham will not come even with a drop of living water (that is the gift of earthly active life) to cool the fiery thirst of spiritual love which burns in me now, though I despised it on earth; there is no more life for me and will be no more time!"], "Which brother is often swept away by passion, as demonstrated when he leaves his fiancee because he falls in love with another woman?": [" \u201cLove is over, Mitya!\u201d Katya began again, \u201cbut the past is painfully dear to me. Know that you will always be so. But now let what might have been come true for one minute,\u201d she faltered, with a drawn smile, looking into his face joyfully again. \u201cYou love another woman, and I love another man, and yet I shall love you for ever, and you will love me; do you know that? Do you hear? Love me, love me all your life!\u201d she cried, with a quiver almost of menace in her voice. \u201cI shall love you, and ... do you know, Katya,\u201d Mitya began, drawing a deep breath at each word, \u201cdo you know, five days ago, that same evening, I loved you.... When you fell down and were carried out ... All my life! So it will be, so it will always be\u2014\u201d So they murmured to one another frantic words, almost meaningless, perhaps not even true, but at that moment it was all true, and they both believed what they said implicitly. \u201cKatya,\u201d cried Mitya suddenly, \u201cdo you believe I murdered him? I know you don\u2019t believe it now, but then ... when you gave evidence.... Surely, surely you did not believe it!\u201d \u201cI did not believe it even then. I\u2019ve never believed it. I hated you, and for a moment I persuaded myself. While I was giving evidence I persuaded myself and believed it, but when I\u2019d finished speaking I left off believing it at once. Don\u2019t doubt that! I have forgotten that I came here to punish myself,\u201d she said, with a new expression in her voice, quite unlike the loving tones of a moment before.", " I have been false to Katya ... Katerina Ivanovna I should say.... Oh, I\u2019ve behaved inhumanly, dishonorably to her, but I fell in love here with another woman ... a woman whom you, madam, perhaps, despise, for you know everything already, but whom I cannot leave on any account, and therefore that three thousand now\u2014\u201d \u201cLeave everything, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,\u201d Madame Hohlakov interrupted in the most decisive tone. \u201cLeave everything, especially women. Gold\u2010mines are your goal, and there\u2019s no place for women there. Afterwards, when you come back rich and famous, you will find the girl of your heart in the highest society. That will be a modern girl, a girl of education and advanced ideas. By that time the dawning woman question will have gained ground, and the new woman will have appeared.\u201d \u201cMadam, that\u2019s not the point, not at all....\u201d Mitya clasped his hands in entreaty. \u201cYes, it is, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, just what you need; the very thing you\u2019re yearning for, though you don\u2019t realize it yourself. I am not at all opposed to the present woman movement, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. The development of woman, and even the political emancipation of woman in the near future\u2014that\u2019s my ideal. I\u2019ve a daughter myself, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, people don\u2019t know that side of me. I wrote a letter to the author, Shtchedrin, on that subject. He has taught me so much, so much about the vocation of woman. So last year I sent him an anonymous letter of two lines: \u2018I kiss and embrace you, my teacher, for the modern woman.", " Let him feel ashamed of himself, let him be ashamed of other people\u2019s knowing, but not of my knowing. He can tell God everything without shame. Why is it he still does not understand how much I am ready to bear for his sake? Why, why doesn\u2019t he know me? How dare he not know me after all that has happened? I want to save him for ever. Let him forget me as his betrothed. And here he fears that he is dishonored in my eyes. Why, he wasn\u2019t afraid to be open with you, Alexey Fyodorovitch. How is it that I don\u2019t deserve the same?\u201d The last words she uttered in tears. Tears gushed from her eyes. \u201cI must tell you,\u201d Alyosha began, his voice trembling too, \u201cwhat happened just now between him and my father.\u201d And he described the whole scene, how Dmitri had sent him to get the money, how he had broken in, knocked his father down, and after that had again specially and emphatically begged him to take his compliments and farewell. \u201cHe went to that woman,\u201d Alyosha added softly. \u201cAnd do you suppose that I can\u2019t put up with that woman? Does he think I can\u2019t? But he won\u2019t marry her,\u201d she suddenly laughed nervously. \u201cCould such a passion last for ever in a Karamazov? It\u2019s passion, not love. He won\u2019t marry her because she won\u2019t marry him.\u201d Again Katerina Ivanovna laughed strangely. \u201cHe may marry her,\u201d said Alyosha mournfully, looking down. \u201cHe won\u2019t marry her, I tell you. That girl is an angel. Do you know that?", " At thirty, though, I shall be sure to leave the cup, even if I\u2019ve not emptied it, and turn away\u2014where I don\u2019t know. But till I am thirty, I know that my youth will triumph over everything\u2014every disillusionment, every disgust with life. I\u2019ve asked myself many times whether there is in the world any despair that would overcome this frantic and perhaps unseemly thirst for life in me, and I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that there isn\u2019t, that is till I am thirty, and then I shall lose it of myself, I fancy. Some driveling consumptive moralists\u2014and poets especially\u2014often call that thirst for life base. It\u2019s a feature of the Karamazovs, it\u2019s true, that thirst for life regardless of everything; you have it no doubt too, but why is it base? The centripetal force on our planet is still fearfully strong, Alyosha. I have a longing for life, and I go on living in spite of logic. Though I may not believe in the order of the universe, yet I love the sticky little leaves as they open in spring. I love the blue sky, I love some people, whom one loves you know sometimes without knowing why. I love some great deeds done by men, though I\u2019ve long ceased perhaps to have faith in them, yet from old habit one\u2019s heart prizes them. Here they have brought the soup for you, eat it, it will do you good. It\u2019s first\u2010rate soup, they know how to make it here.

Then I shall not be steeped in gore, and if no one does\u2014I shall! Kill me! Your slave and enemy, D. KARAMAZOV. When Ivan read this \u201cdocument\u201d he was convinced. So then it was his brother, not Smerdyakov. And if not Smerdyakov, then not he, Ivan. This letter at once assumed in his eyes the aspect of a logical proof. There could be no longer the slightest doubt of Mitya\u2019s guilt. The suspicion never occurred to Ivan, by the way, that Mitya might have committed the murder in conjunction with Smerdyakov, and, indeed, such a theory did not fit in with the facts. Ivan was completely reassured. The next morning he only thought of Smerdyakov and his gibes with contempt. A few days later he positively wondered how he could have been so horribly distressed at his suspicions. He resolved to dismiss him with contempt and forget him. So passed a month. He made no further inquiry about Smerdyakov, but twice he happened to hear that he was very ill and out of his mind. \u201cHe\u2019ll end in madness,\u201d the young doctor Varvinsky observed about him, and Ivan remembered this. During the last week of that month Ivan himself began to feel very ill. He went to consult the Moscow doctor who had been sent for by Katerina Ivanovna just before the trial. And just at that time his relations with Katerina Ivanovna became acutely strained. They were like two enemies in love with one another.", " \u201cWhat can I say?\u2014that is, if you are in earnest\u2014\u201d \u201cIs there a God or not?\u201d Ivan cried with the same savage intensity. \u201cAh, then you are in earnest! My dear fellow, upon my word I don\u2019t know. There! I\u2019ve said it now!\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t know, but you see God? No, you are not some one apart, you are myself, you are I and nothing more! You are rubbish, you are my fancy!\u201d \u201cWell, if you like, I have the same philosophy as you, that would be true. _Je pense, donc je suis_, I know that for a fact; all the rest, all these worlds, God and even Satan\u2014all that is not proved, to my mind. Does all that exist of itself, or is it only an emanation of myself, a logical development of my ego which alone has existed for ever: but I make haste to stop, for I believe you will be jumping up to beat me directly.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019d better tell me some anecdote!\u201d said Ivan miserably. \u201cThere is an anecdote precisely on our subject, or rather a legend, not an anecdote. You reproach me with unbelief, you see, you say, yet you don\u2019t believe. But, my dear fellow, I am not the only one like that. We are all in a muddle over there now and all through your science. Once there used to be atoms, five senses, four elements, and then everything hung together somehow. There were atoms in the ancient world even, but since we\u2019ve learned that you\u2019ve discovered the chemical molecule and protoplasm and the devil knows what, we had to lower our crest.", " \u201cGetting out of bed, he goes almost unconsciously and with no definite motive towards the sound to see what\u2019s the matter. His head is still clouded with his attack, his faculties are half asleep; but, once in the garden, he walks to the lighted windows and he hears terrible news from his master, who would be, of course, glad to see him. His mind sets to work at once. He hears all the details from his frightened master, and gradually in his disordered brain there shapes itself an idea\u2014terrible, but seductive and irresistibly logical. To kill the old man, take the three thousand, and throw all the blame on to his young master. A terrible lust of money, of booty, might seize upon him as he realized his security from detection. Oh! these sudden and irresistible impulses come so often when there is a favorable opportunity, and especially with murderers who have had no idea of committing a murder beforehand. And Smerdyakov may have gone in and carried out his plan. With what weapon? Why, with any stone picked up in the garden. But what for, with what object? Why, the three thousand which means a career for him. Oh, I am not contradicting myself\u2014the money may have existed. And perhaps Smerdyakov alone knew where to find it, where his master kept it. And the covering of the money\u2014the torn envelope on the floor? \u201cJust now, when the prosecutor was explaining his subtle theory that only an inexperienced thief like Karamazov would have left the envelope on the floor, and not one like Smerdyakov, who would have avoided leaving a piece of evidence against himself, I thought as I listened that I was hearing something very familiar, and, would you believe it, I have heard that very argument, that very conjecture, of how Karamazov would have behaved, precisely two days before, from Smerdyakov himself.", " Mitya instantly slipped away into the shadow. \u201cShe may be there behind the screen. Perhaps she\u2019s asleep by now,\u201d he thought, with a pang at his heart. Fyodor Pavlovitch moved away from the window. \u201cHe\u2019s looking for her out of the window, so she\u2019s not there. Why should he stare out into the dark? He\u2019s wild with impatience.\u201d ... Mitya slipped back at once, and fell to gazing in at the window again. The old man was sitting down at the table, apparently disappointed. At last he put his elbow on the table, and laid his right cheek against his hand. Mitya watched him eagerly. \u201cHe\u2019s alone, he\u2019s alone!\u201d he repeated again. \u201cIf she were here, his face would be different.\u201d Strange to say, a queer, irrational vexation rose up in his heart that she was not here. \u201cIt\u2019s not that she\u2019s not here,\u201d he explained to himself, immediately, \u201cbut that I can\u2019t tell for certain whether she is or not.\u201d Mitya remembered afterwards that his mind was at that moment exceptionally clear, that he took in everything to the slightest detail, and missed no point. But a feeling of misery, the misery of uncertainty and indecision, was growing in his heart with every instant. \u201cIs she here or not?\u201d The angry doubt filled his heart, and suddenly, making up his mind, he put out his hand and softly knocked on the window frame. He knocked the signal the old man had agreed upon with Smerdyakov, twice slowly and then three times more quickly, the signal that meant \u201cGrushenka is here!\u201d The old man started, jerked up his head, and, jumping up quickly, ran to the window."], "Fyodor\u2019s life is guided by the pursuit of what?": [" He accompanied her himself to her protector.

Still he resists it; he goes off to a lady who has for some time been residing in the town, and who is highly esteemed among us, Madame Hohlakov. That lady, who had long watched his career with compassion, gave him the most judicious advice, to give up his dissipated life, his unseemly love\u2010affair, the waste of his youth and vigor in pot\u2010house debauchery, and to set off to Siberia to the gold\u2010 mines: \u2018that would be an outlet for your turbulent energies, your romantic character, your thirst for adventure.\u2019 \u201d After describing the result of this conversation and the moment when the prisoner learnt that Grushenka had not remained at Samsonov\u2019s, the sudden frenzy of the luckless man worn out with jealousy and nervous exhaustion, at the thought that she had deceived him and was now with his father, Ippolit Kirillovitch concluded by dwelling upon the fatal influence of chance. \u201cHad the maid told him that her mistress was at Mokroe with her former lover, nothing would have happened.

I\u2019ve done with the old world for ever, and may I have no news, no echo, from it. To a new life, new places and no looking back!\u201d But instead of delight his soul was filled with such gloom, and his heart ached with such anguish, as he had never known in his life before. He was thinking all the night. The train flew on, and only at daybreak, when he was approaching Moscow, he suddenly roused himself from his meditation. \u201cI am a scoundrel,\u201d he whispered to himself. Fyodor Pavlovitch remained well satisfied at having seen his son off. For two hours afterwards he felt almost happy, and sat drinking brandy. But suddenly something happened which was very annoying and unpleasant for every one in the house, and completely upset Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s equanimity at once. Smerdyakov went to the cellar for something and fell down from the top of the steps.", " Fyodor Pavlovitch was an obstinate and cunning buffoon, yet, though his will was strong enough \u201cin some of the affairs of life,\u201d as he expressed it, he found himself, to his surprise, extremely feeble in facing certain other emergencies. He knew his weaknesses and was afraid of them. There are positions in which one has to keep a sharp look out. And that\u2019s not easy without a trustworthy man, and Grigory was a most trustworthy man. Many times in the course of his life Fyodor Pavlovitch had only just escaped a sound thrashing through Grigory\u2019s intervention, and on each occasion the old servant gave him a good lecture. But it wasn\u2019t only thrashings that Fyodor Pavlovitch was afraid of. There were graver occasions, and very subtle and complicated ones, when Fyodor Pavlovitch could not have explained the extraordinary craving for some one faithful and devoted, which sometimes unaccountably came upon him all in a moment. It was almost a morbid condition. Corrupt and often cruel in his lust, like some noxious insect, Fyodor Pavlovitch was sometimes, in moments of drunkenness, overcome by superstitious terror and a moral convulsion which took an almost physical form. \u201cMy soul\u2019s simply quaking in my throat at those times,\u201d he used to say. At such moments he liked to feel that there was near at hand, in the lodge if not in the room, a strong, faithful man, virtuous and unlike himself, who had seen all his debauchery and knew all his secrets, but was ready in his devotion to overlook all that, not to oppose him, above all, not to reproach him or threaten him with anything, either in this world or in the next, and, in case of need, to defend him\u2014from whom?", " He used long afterwards to tell as a characteristic touch, that when he began to speak of Mitya, Fyodor Pavlovitch looked for some time as though he did not understand what child he was talking about, and even as though he was surprised to hear that he had a little son in the house. The story may have been exaggerated, yet it must have been something like the truth. Fyodor Pavlovitch was all his life fond of acting, of suddenly playing an unexpected part, sometimes without any motive for doing so, and even to his own direct disadvantage, as, for instance, in the present case. This habit, however, is characteristic of a very great number of people, some of them very clever ones, not like Fyodor Pavlovitch. Pyotr Alexandrovitch carried the business through vigorously, and was appointed, with Fyodor Pavlovitch, joint guardian of the child, who had a small property, a house and land, left him by his mother. Mitya did, in fact, pass into this cousin\u2019s keeping, but as the latter had no family of his own, and after securing the revenues of his estates was in haste to return at once to Paris, he left the boy in charge of one of his cousins, a lady living in Moscow. It came to pass that, settling permanently in Paris he, too, forgot the child, especially when the Revolution of February broke out, making an impression on his mind that he remembered all the rest of his life. The Moscow lady died, and Mitya passed into the care of one of her married daughters."], "Which brother sometimes hides his true feelings behind a mask of servitude?": [" I\u2019ve been shouting it aloud for the last month, any one can tell you that!... The fact stares you in the face, it speaks for itself, it cries aloud, but feelings, gentlemen, feelings are another matter. You see, gentlemen\u201d\u2014Mitya frowned\u2014\u201cit seems to me that about feelings you\u2019ve no right to question me. I know that you are bound by your office, I quite understand that, but that\u2019s my affair, my private, intimate affair, yet ... since I haven\u2019t concealed my feelings in the past ... in the tavern, for instance, I\u2019ve talked to every one, so ... so I won\u2019t make a secret of it now. You see, I understand, gentlemen, that there are terrible facts against me in this business. I told every one that I\u2019d kill him, and now, all of a sudden, he\u2019s been killed. So it must have been me! Ha ha! I can make allowances for you, gentlemen, I can quite make allowances. I\u2019m struck all of a heap myself, for who can have murdered him, if not I? That\u2019s what it comes to, isn\u2019t it? If not I, who can it be, who? Gentlemen, I want to know, I insist on knowing!\u201d he exclaimed suddenly. \u201cWhere was he murdered? How was he murdered? How, and with what? Tell me,\u201d he asked quickly, looking at the two lawyers. \u201cWe found him in his study, lying on his back on the floor, with his head battered in,\u201d said the prosecutor. \u201cThat\u2019s horrible!\u201d Mitya shuddered and, putting his elbows on the table, hid his face in his right hand.", " Every one will think his share too small and they will be always envying, complaining and attacking one another. You ask when it will come to pass; it will come to pass, but first we have to go through the period of isolation.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean by isolation?\u201d I asked him. \u201cWhy, the isolation that prevails everywhere, above all in our age\u2014it has not fully developed, it has not reached its limit yet. For every one strives to keep his individuality as apart as possible, wishes to secure the greatest possible fullness of life for himself; but meantime all his efforts result not in attaining fullness of life but self\u2010destruction, for instead of self\u2010realization he ends by arriving at complete solitude. All mankind in our age have split up into units, they all keep apart, each in his own groove; each one holds aloof, hides himself and hides what he has, from the rest, and he ends by being repelled by others and repelling them. He heaps up riches by himself and thinks, \u2018How strong I am now and how secure,\u2019 and in his madness he does not understand that the more he heaps up, the more he sinks into self\u2010destructive impotence. For he is accustomed to rely upon himself alone and to cut himself off from the whole; he has trained himself not to believe in the help of others, in men and in humanity, and only trembles for fear he should lose his money and the privileges that he has won for himself.", " But only Alyosha and Grushenka had visited Mitya. Rakitin had tried to force his way in twice, but Mitya persistently begged Varvinsky not to admit him. Alyosha found him sitting on his bed in a hospital dressing\u2010gown, rather feverish, with a towel, soaked in vinegar and water, on his head. He looked at Alyosha as he came in with an undefined expression, but there was a shade of something like dread discernible in it. He had become terribly preoccupied since the trial; sometimes he would be silent for half an hour together, and seemed to be pondering something heavily and painfully, oblivious of everything about him. If he roused himself from his brooding and began to talk, he always spoke with a kind of abruptness and never of what he really wanted to say. He looked sometimes with a face of suffering at his brother. He seemed to be more at ease with Grushenka than with Alyosha. It is true, he scarcely spoke to her at all, but as soon as she came in, his whole face lighted up with joy. Alyosha sat down beside him on the bed in silence. This time Mitya was waiting for Alyosha in suspense, but he did not dare ask him a question. He felt it almost unthinkable that Katya would consent to come, and at the same time he felt that if she did not come, something inconceivable would happen. Alyosha understood his feelings. \u201cTrifon Borissovitch,\u201d Mitya began nervously, \u201chas pulled his whole inn to pieces, I am told.", " He was weak in health, it is true; but in character, in spirit, he was by no means the weak man the prosecutor has made him out to be. I found in him no trace of the timidity on which the prosecutor so insisted. There was no simplicity about him, either. I found in him, on the contrary, an extreme mistrustfulness concealed under a mask of _na\u00efvet\u00e9_, and an intelligence of considerable range. The prosecutor was too simple in taking him for weak\u2010minded. He made a very definite impression on me: I left him with the conviction that he was a distinctly spiteful creature, excessively ambitious, vindictive, and intensely envious. I made some inquiries: he resented his parentage, was ashamed of it, and would clench his teeth when he remembered that he was the son of \u2018stinking Lizaveta.\u2019 He was disrespectful to the servant Grigory and his wife, who had cared for him in his childhood. He cursed and jeered at Russia. He dreamed of going to France and becoming a Frenchman. He used often to say that he hadn\u2019t the means to do so. I fancy he loved no one but himself and had a strangely high opinion of himself. His conception of culture was limited to good clothes, clean shirt\u2010fronts and polished boots. Believing himself to be the illegitimate son of Fyodor Pavlovitch (there is evidence of this), he might well have resented his position, compared with that of his master\u2019s legitimate sons. They had everything, he nothing."], "A relationship with ___ strengthens Alyosha\u2019s religious faith.": [" \u201cYou agree. Then it must be so, if you agree. It\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it, Alyosha? That\u2019s the Russian faith all over, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cNo, Smerdyakov has not the Russian faith at all,\u201d said Alyosha firmly and gravely. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about his faith. I mean those two in the desert, only that idea. Surely that\u2019s Russian, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cYes, that\u2019s purely Russian,\u201d said Alyosha smiling. \u201cYour words are worth a gold piece, O ass, and I\u2019ll give it to you to\u2010day. But as to the rest you talk nonsense, nonsense, nonsense. Let me tell you, stupid, that we here are all of little faith, only from carelessness, because we haven\u2019t time; things are too much for us, and, in the second place, the Lord God has given us so little time, only twenty\u2010four hours in the day, so that one hasn\u2019t even time to get sleep enough, much less to repent of one\u2019s sins. While you have denied your faith to your enemies when you\u2019d nothing else to think about but to show your faith! So I consider, brother, that it constitutes a sin.\u201d \u201cConstitute a sin it may, but consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch, that it only extenuates it, if it does constitute. If I had believed then in very truth, as I ought to have believed, then it really would have been sinful if I had not faced tortures for my faith, and had gone over to the pagan Mohammedan faith. But, of course, it wouldn\u2019t have come to torture then, because I should only have had to say at that instant to the mountain, \u2018Move and crush the tormentor,\u2019 and it would have moved and at the very instant have crushed him like a black\u2010beetle, and I should have walked away as though nothing had happened, praising and glorifying God.", " Well, Grigory Vassilyevitch, if I\u2019m without faith and you have so great a faith that you are continually swearing at me, you try yourself telling this mountain, not to move into the sea for that\u2019s a long way off, but even to our stinking little river which runs at the bottom of the garden. You\u2019ll see for yourself that it won\u2019t budge, but will remain just where it is however much you shout at it, and that shows, Grigory Vassilyevitch, that you haven\u2019t faith in the proper manner, and only abuse others about it. Again, taking into consideration that no one in our day, not only you, but actually no one, from the highest person to the lowest peasant, can shove mountains into the sea\u2014except perhaps some one man in the world, or, at most, two, and they most likely are saving their souls in secret somewhere in the Egyptian desert, so you wouldn\u2019t find them\u2014if so it be, if all the rest have no faith, will God curse all the rest? that is, the population of the whole earth, except about two hermits in the desert, and in His well\u2010known mercy will He not forgive one of them? And so I\u2019m persuaded that though I may once have doubted I shall be forgiven if I shed tears of repentance.\u201d \u201cStay!\u201d cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, in a transport of delight. \u201cSo you do suppose there are two who can move mountains? Ivan, make a note of it, write it down. There you have the Russian all over!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re quite right in saying it\u2019s characteristic of the people\u2019s faith,\u201d Ivan assented, with an approving smile.", " \u201cYou will come back again!\u201d murmured Father Pa\u00efssy, looking after him with sorrowful surprise. Chapter II. A Critical Moment Father Pa\u00efssy, of course, was not wrong when he decided that his \u201cdear boy\u201d would come back again. Perhaps indeed, to some extent, he penetrated with insight into the true meaning of Alyosha\u2019s spiritual condition. Yet I must frankly own that it would be very difficult for me to give a clear account of that strange, vague moment in the life of the young hero I love so much. To Father Pa\u00efssy\u2019s sorrowful question, \u201cAre you too with those of little faith?\u201d I could of course confidently answer for Alyosha, \u201cNo, he is not with those of little faith. Quite the contrary.\u201d Indeed, all his trouble came from the fact that he was of great faith. But still the trouble was there and was so agonizing that even long afterwards Alyosha thought of that sorrowful day as one of the bitterest and most fatal days of his life. If the question is asked: \u201cCould all his grief and disturbance have been only due to the fact that his elder\u2019s body had shown signs of premature decomposition instead of at once performing miracles?\u201d I must answer without beating about the bush, \u201cYes, it certainly was.\u201d I would only beg the reader not to be in too great a hurry to laugh at my young hero\u2019s pure heart. I am far from intending to apologize for him or to justify his innocent faith on the ground of his youth, or the little progress he had made in his studies, or any such reason.", " I may be only a priest\u2019s son, and dirt in the eyes of noblemen like you, but don\u2019t insult me so lightly and wantonly. I have a sense of honor, too, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I couldn\u2019t be a relation of Grushenka, a common harlot. I beg you to understand that!\u201d Rakitin was intensely irritated. \u201cForgive me, for goodness\u2019 sake, I had no idea ... besides ... how can you call her a harlot? Is she ... that sort of woman?\u201d Alyosha flushed suddenly. \u201cI tell you again, I heard that she was a relation of yours. You often go to see her, and you told me yourself you\u2019re not her lover. I never dreamed that you of all people had such contempt for her! Does she really deserve it?\u201d \u201cI may have reasons of my own for visiting her. That\u2019s not your business. But as for relationship, your brother, or even your father, is more likely to make her yours than mine. Well, here we are. You\u2019d better go to the kitchen. Hullo! what\u2019s wrong, what is it? Are we late? They can\u2019t have finished dinner so soon! Have the Karamazovs been making trouble again? No doubt they have. Here\u2019s your father and your brother Ivan after him. They\u2019ve broken out from the Father Superior\u2019s. And look, Father Isidor\u2019s shouting out something after them from the steps. And your father\u2019s shouting and waving his arms. I expect he\u2019s swearing. Bah, and there goes Mi\u00fcsov driving away in his carriage. You see, he\u2019s going. And there\u2019s old Maximov running!\u2014there must have been a row."], "Alyosha\u2019s perspective on life serves what role in the novel?": [" Ivan always felt that Alyosha\u2019s opinion meant a great deal to him, and so he was astonished at it now. Another thing that was strange was that Alyosha did not make any attempt to talk about Mitya with Ivan, that he never began on the subject and only answered his questions. This, too, struck Ivan particularly. But he was very much preoccupied at that time with something quite apart from that. On his return from Moscow, he abandoned himself hopelessly to his mad and consuming passion for Katerina Ivanovna. This is not the time to begin to speak of this new passion of Ivan\u2019s, which left its mark on all the rest of his life: this would furnish the subject for another novel, which I may perhaps never write. But I cannot omit to mention here that when Ivan, on leaving Katerina Ivanovna with Alyosha, as I\u2019ve related already, told him, \u201cI am not keen on her,\u201d it was an absolute lie: he loved her madly, though at times he hated her so that he might have murdered her. Many causes helped to bring about this feeling. Shattered by what had happened with Mitya, she rushed on Ivan\u2019s return to meet him as her one salvation. She was hurt, insulted and humiliated in her feelings. And here the man had come back to her, who had loved her so ardently before (oh! she knew that very well), and whose heart and intellect she considered so superior to her own. But the sternly virtuous girl did not abandon herself altogether to the man she loved, in spite of the Karamazov violence of his passions and the great fascination he had for her.", " I think she is awfully nice and pathetic.\u201d \u201cYes, yes! Well, you\u2019ll be coming often, you will see what she is like. It would do you a great deal of good to know people like that, to learn to value a great deal which you will find out from knowing these people,\u201d Alyosha observed warmly. \u201cThat would have more effect on you than anything.\u201d \u201cOh, how I regret and blame myself for not having come sooner!\u201d Kolya exclaimed, with bitter feeling. \u201cYes, it\u2019s a great pity. You saw for yourself how delighted the poor child was to see you. And how he fretted for you to come!\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t tell me! You make it worse! But it serves me right. What kept me from coming was my conceit, my egoistic vanity, and the beastly wilfullness, which I never can get rid of, though I\u2019ve been struggling with it all my life. I see that now. I am a beast in lots of ways, Karamazov!\u201d \u201cNo, you have a charming nature, though it\u2019s been distorted, and I quite understand why you have had such an influence on this generous, morbidly sensitive boy,\u201d Alyosha answered warmly. \u201cAnd you say that to me!\u201d cried Kolya; \u201cand would you believe it, I thought\u2014I\u2019ve thought several times since I\u2019ve been here\u2014that you despised me! If only you knew how I prize your opinion!\u201d \u201cBut are you really so sensitive? At your age! Would you believe it, just now, when you were telling your story, I thought, as I watched you, that you must be very sensitive!\u201d \u201cYou thought so?", " In the end this unhappy young woman, kept in terror from her childhood, fell into that kind of nervous disease which is most frequently found in peasant women who are said to be \u201cpossessed by devils.\u201d At times after terrible fits of hysterics she even lost her reason. Yet she bore Fyodor Pavlovitch two sons, Ivan and Alexey, the eldest in the first year of marriage and the second three years later. When she died, little Alexey was in his fourth year, and, strange as it seems, I know that he remembered his mother all his life, like a dream, of course. At her death almost exactly the same thing happened to the two little boys as to their elder brother, Mitya. They were completely forgotten and abandoned by their father. They were looked after by the same Grigory and lived in his cottage, where they were found by the tyrannical old lady who had brought up their mother. She was still alive, and had not, all those eight years, forgotten the insult done her. All that time she was obtaining exact information as to her Sofya\u2019s manner of life, and hearing of her illness and hideous surroundings she declared aloud two or three times to her retainers: \u201cIt serves her right. God has punished her for her ingratitude.\u201d Exactly three months after Sofya Ivanovna\u2019s death the general\u2019s widow suddenly appeared in our town, and went straight to Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s house. She spent only half an hour in the town but she did a great deal.", " He suddenly fancied that Alyosha might think he was trying to show off his knowledge and to prove that he was \u201cgrown up.\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t the slightest desire to show off my knowledge to him,\u201d Kolya thought indignantly. And all of a sudden he felt horribly annoyed. \u201cI must confess I can\u2019t endure entering on such discussions,\u201d he said with a final air. \u201cIt\u2019s possible for one who doesn\u2019t believe in God to love mankind, don\u2019t you think so? Voltaire didn\u2019t believe in God and loved mankind?\u201d (\u201cI am at it again,\u201d he thought to himself.) \u201cVoltaire believed in God, though not very much, I think, and I don\u2019t think he loved mankind very much either,\u201d said Alyosha quietly, gently, and quite naturally, as though he were talking to some one of his own age, or even older. Kolya was particularly struck by Alyosha\u2019s apparent diffidence about his opinion of Voltaire. He seemed to be leaving the question for him, little Kolya, to settle. \u201cHave you read Voltaire?\u201d Alyosha finished. \u201cNo, not to say read.... But I\u2019ve read _Candide_ in the Russian translation ... in an absurd, grotesque, old translation ... (At it again! again! )\u201d \u201cAnd did you understand it?\u201d \u201cOh, yes, everything.... That is ... Why do you suppose I shouldn\u2019t understand it? There\u2019s a lot of nastiness in it, of course.... Of course I can understand that it\u2019s a philosophical novel and written to advocate an idea....\u201d Kolya was getting mixed by now."], "Which character in the book experiences the most trauma and inner conflict?": [" I don\u2019t say that we were bad by nature, all these young men were good fellows, but they behaved badly, and I worst of all. What made it worse for me was that I had come into my own money, and so I flung myself into a life of pleasure, and plunged headlong into all the recklessness of youth. I was fond of reading, yet strange to say, the Bible was the one book I never opened at that time, though I always carried it about with me, and I was never separated from it; in very truth I was keeping that book \u201cfor the day and the hour, for the month and the year,\u201d though I knew it not. After four years of this life, I chanced to be in the town of K. where our regiment was stationed at the time. We found the people of the town hospitable, rich and fond of entertainments. I met with a cordial reception everywhere, as I was of a lively temperament and was known to be well off, which always goes a long way in the world. And then a circumstance happened which was the beginning of it all. I formed an attachment to a beautiful and intelligent young girl of noble and lofty character, the daughter of people much respected. They were well\u2010to\u2010do people of influence and position. They always gave me a cordial and friendly reception. I fancied that the young lady looked on me with favor and my heart was aflame at such an idea. Later on I saw and fully realized that I perhaps was not so passionately in love with her at all, but only recognized the elevation of her mind and character, which I could not indeed have helped doing.", " She jumped up and ran away. I was wearing my sword. I drew it and nearly stabbed myself with it on the spot; why, I don\u2019t know. It would have been frightfully stupid, of course. I suppose it was from delight. Can you understand that one might kill oneself from delight? But I didn\u2019t stab myself. I only kissed my sword and put it back in the scabbard\u2014which there was no need to have told you, by the way. And I fancy that in telling you about my inner conflict I have laid it on rather thick to glorify myself. But let it pass, and to hell with all who pry into the human heart! Well, so much for that \u2018adventure\u2019 with Katerina Ivanovna. So now Ivan knows of it, and you\u2014no one else.\u201d Dmitri got up, took a step or two in his excitement, pulled out his handkerchief and mopped his forehead, then sat down again, not in the same place as before, but on the opposite side, so that Alyosha had to turn quite round to face him. Chapter V. The Confession Of A Passionate Heart\u2014\"Heels Up\" \u201cNow,\u201d said Alyosha, \u201cI understand the first half.\u201d \u201cYou understand the first half. That half is a drama, and it was played out there. The second half is a tragedy, and it is being acted here.\u201d \u201cAnd I understand nothing of that second half so far,\u201d said Alyosha. \u201cAnd I? Do you suppose I understand it?\u201d \u201cStop, Dmitri. There\u2019s one important question. Tell me, you were betrothed, you are betrothed still?\u201d \u201cWe weren\u2019t betrothed at once, not for three months after that adventure.", " In that case let me ask you, do you think me like Dmitri capable of shedding \u00c6sop\u2019s blood, murdering him, eh?\u201d \u201cWhat are you saying, Ivan? Such an idea never crossed my mind. I don\u2019t think Dmitri is capable of it, either.\u201d \u201cThanks, if only for that,\u201d smiled Ivan. \u201cBe sure, I should always defend him. But in my wishes I reserve myself full latitude in this case. Good\u2010by till to\u2010morrow. Don\u2019t condemn me, and don\u2019t look on me as a villain,\u201d he added with a smile. They shook hands warmly as they had never done before. Alyosha felt that his brother had taken the first step towards him, and that he had certainly done this with some definite motive. Chapter X. Both Together Alyosha left his father\u2019s house feeling even more exhausted and dejected in spirit than when he had entered it. His mind too seemed shattered and unhinged, while he felt that he was afraid to put together the disjointed fragments and form a general idea from all the agonizing and conflicting experiences of the day. He felt something bordering upon despair, which he had never known till then. Towering like a mountain above all the rest stood the fatal, insoluble question: How would things end between his father and his brother Dmitri with this terrible woman? Now he had himself been a witness of it, he had been present and seen them face to face. Yet only his brother Dmitri could be made unhappy, terribly, completely unhappy: there was trouble awaiting him.", " Oh, give him every possible good in life (he couldn\u2019t be content with less), and put no obstacle in his way, and he will show that he, too, can be noble. He is not greedy, no, but he must have money, a great deal of money, and you will see how generously, with what scorn of filthy lucre, he will fling it all away in the reckless dissipation of one night. But if he has not money, he will show what he is ready to do to get it when he is in great need of it. But all this later, let us take events in their chronological order. \u201cFirst, we have before us a poor abandoned child, running about the back\u2010 yard \u2018without boots on his feet,\u2019 as our worthy and esteemed fellow citizen, of foreign origin, alas! expressed it just now. I repeat it again, I yield to no one the defense of the criminal. I am here to accuse him, but to defend him also. Yes, I, too, am human; I, too, can weigh the influence of home and childhood on the character. But the boy grows up and becomes an officer; for a duel and other reckless conduct he is exiled to one of the remote frontier towns of Russia. There he led a wild life as an officer. And, of course, he needed money, money before all things, and so after prolonged disputes he came to a settlement with his father, and the last six thousand was sent him. A letter is in existence in which he practically gives up his claim to the rest and settles his conflict with his father over the inheritance on the payment of this six thousand."], "The ending of the novel suggests what type of future for Ivan?": [" Then, oh, then, a new life would begin at once! Of this different, reformed and \u201cvirtuous\u201d life (\u201cit must, it must be virtuous\u201d) he dreamed feverishly at every moment. He thirsted for that reformation and renewal. The filthy morass, in which he had sunk of his own free will, was too revolting to him, and, like very many men in such cases, he put faith above all in change of place. If only it were not for these people, if only it were not for these circumstances, if only he could fly away from this accursed place\u2014he would be altogether regenerated, would enter on a new path. That was what he believed in, and what he was yearning for. But all this could only be on condition of the first, the _happy_ solution of the question. There was another possibility, a different and awful ending. Suddenly she might say to him: \u201cGo away. I have just come to terms with Fyodor Pavlovitch. I am going to marry him and don\u2019t want you\u201d\u2014and then ... but then.... But Mitya did not know what would happen then. Up to the last hour he didn\u2019t know. That must be said to his credit. He had no definite intentions, had planned no crime. He was simply watching and spying in agony, while he prepared himself for the first, happy solution of his destiny. He drove away any other idea, in fact. But for that ending a quite different anxiety arose, a new, incidental, but yet fatal and insoluble difficulty presented itself.", " Ivan always felt that Alyosha\u2019s opinion meant a great deal to him, and so he was astonished at it now. Another thing that was strange was that Alyosha did not make any attempt to talk about Mitya with Ivan, that he never began on the subject and only answered his questions. This, too, struck Ivan particularly. But he was very much preoccupied at that time with something quite apart from that. On his return from Moscow, he abandoned himself hopelessly to his mad and consuming passion for Katerina Ivanovna. This is not the time to begin to speak of this new passion of Ivan\u2019s, which left its mark on all the rest of his life: this would furnish the subject for another novel, which I may perhaps never write. But I cannot omit to mention here that when Ivan, on leaving Katerina Ivanovna with Alyosha, as I\u2019ve related already, told him, \u201cI am not keen on her,\u201d it was an absolute lie: he loved her madly, though at times he hated her so that he might have murdered her. Many causes helped to bring about this feeling. Shattered by what had happened with Mitya, she rushed on Ivan\u2019s return to meet him as her one salvation. She was hurt, insulted and humiliated in her feelings. And here the man had come back to her, who had loved her so ardently before (oh! she knew that very well), and whose heart and intellect she considered so superior to her own. But the sternly virtuous girl did not abandon herself altogether to the man she loved, in spite of the Karamazov violence of his passions and the great fascination he had for her.", " For the present I will only say that this \u201clandowner\u201d\u2014for so we used to call him, although he hardly spent a day of his life on his own estate\u2014was a strange type, yet one pretty frequently to be met with, a type abject and vicious and at the same time senseless. But he was one of those senseless persons who are very well capable of looking after their worldly affairs, and, apparently, after nothing else. Fyodor Pavlovitch, for instance, began with next to nothing; his estate was of the smallest; he ran to dine at other men\u2019s tables, and fastened on them as a toady, yet at his death it appeared that he had a hundred thousand roubles in hard cash. At the same time, he was all his life one of the most senseless, fantastical fellows in the whole district. I repeat, it was not stupidity\u2014the majority of these fantastical fellows are shrewd and intelligent enough\u2014but just senselessness, and a peculiar national form of it. He was married twice, and had three sons, the eldest, Dmitri, by his first wife, and two, Ivan and Alexey, by his second. Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s first wife, Adela\u00efda Ivanovna, belonged to a fairly rich and distinguished noble family, also landowners in our district, the Mi\u00fcsovs. How it came to pass that an heiress, who was also a beauty, and moreover one of those vigorous, intelligent girls, so common in this generation, but sometimes also to be found in the last, could have married such a worthless, puny weakling, as we all called him, I won\u2019t attempt to explain.", " It\u2019s your decision will decide it. Perhaps it\u2019s you that is superior and not Ivan. You see, it\u2019s a question of conscience, question of the higher conscience\u2014the secret is so important that I can\u2019t settle it myself, and I\u2019ve put it off till I could speak to you. But anyway it\u2019s too early to decide now, for we must wait for the verdict. As soon as the verdict is given, you shall decide my fate. Don\u2019t decide it now. I\u2019ll tell you now. You listen, but don\u2019t decide. Stand and keep quiet. I won\u2019t tell you everything. I\u2019ll only tell you the idea, without details, and you keep quiet. Not a question, not a movement. You agree? But, goodness, what shall I do with your eyes? I\u2019m afraid your eyes will tell me your decision, even if you don\u2019t speak. Oo! I\u2019m afraid! Alyosha, listen! Ivan suggests my _escaping_. I won\u2019t tell you the details: it\u2019s all been thought out: it can all be arranged. Hush, don\u2019t decide. I should go to America with Grusha. You know I can\u2019t live without Grusha! What if they won\u2019t let her follow me to Siberia? Do they let convicts get married? Ivan thinks not. And without Grusha what should I do there underground with a hammer? I should only smash my skull with the hammer! But, on the other hand, my conscience? I should have run away from suffering. A sign has come, I reject the sign. I have a way of salvation and I turn my back on it. Ivan says that in America, \u2018with the good\u2010will,\u2019 I can be of more use than underground."], "Where does Dmitri experience spiritual conversion?": [" Let him too weep, the priest of God, and be sure that the hearts of his listeners will throb in response. Only a little tiny seed is needed\u2014drop it into the heart of the peasant and it won\u2019t die, it will live in his soul all his life, it will be hidden in the midst of his darkness and sin, like a bright spot, like a great reminder. And there\u2019s no need of much teaching or explanation, he will understand it all simply. Do you suppose that the peasants don\u2019t understand? Try reading them the touching story of the fair Esther and the haughty Vashti; or the miraculous story of Jonah in the whale. Don\u2019t forget either the parables of Our Lord, choose especially from the Gospel of St. Luke (that is what I did), and then from the Acts of the Apostles the conversion of St. Paul (that you mustn\u2019t leave out on any account), and from the _Lives of the Saints_, for instance, the life of Alexey, the man of God and, greatest of all, the happy martyr and the seer of God, Mary of Egypt\u2014and you will penetrate their hearts with these simple tales. Give one hour a week to it in spite of your poverty, only one little hour. And you will see for yourselves that our people is gracious and grateful, and will repay you a hundred\u2010fold. Mindful of the kindness of their priest and the moving words they have heard from him, they will of their own accord help him in his fields and in his house, and will treat him with more respect than before\u2014so that it will even increase his worldly well\u2010being too.", " He was trembling all over. He seemed frantic. \u201cBut you\u2019ve seen for yourself that she hasn\u2019t come,\u201d cried Ivan. \u201cBut she may have come by that other entrance.\u201d \u201cYou know that entrance is locked, and you have the key.\u201d Dmitri suddenly reappeared in the drawing\u2010room. He had, of course, found the other entrance locked, and the key actually was in Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s pocket. The windows of all the rooms were also closed, so Grushenka could not have come in anywhere nor have run out anywhere. \u201cHold him!\u201d shrieked Fyodor Pavlovitch, as soon as he saw him again. \u201cHe\u2019s been stealing money in my bedroom.\u201d And tearing himself from Ivan he rushed again at Dmitri. But Dmitri threw up both hands and suddenly clutched the old man by the two tufts of hair that remained on his temples, tugged at them, and flung him with a crash on the floor. He kicked him two or three times with his heel in the face. The old man moaned shrilly. Ivan, though not so strong as Dmitri, threw his arms round him, and with all his might pulled him away. Alyosha helped him with his slender strength, holding Dmitri in front. \u201cMadman! You\u2019ve killed him!\u201d cried Ivan. \u201cServe him right!\u201d shouted Dmitri breathlessly. \u201cIf I haven\u2019t killed him, I\u2019ll come again and kill him. You can\u2019t protect him!\u201d \u201cDmitri! Go away at once!\u201d cried Alyosha commandingly. \u201cAlexey! You tell me. It\u2019s only you I can believe; was she here just now, or not?", " \u201cBut are you really going so soon, brother?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWhat of Dmitri and father? how will it end?\u201d asked Alyosha anxiously. \u201cYou are always harping upon it! What have I to do with it? Am I my brother Dmitri\u2019s keeper?\u201d Ivan snapped irritably, but then he suddenly smiled bitterly. \u201cCain\u2019s answer about his murdered brother, wasn\u2019t it? Perhaps that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking at this moment? Well, damn it all, I can\u2019t stay here to be their keeper, can I? I\u2019ve finished what I had to do, and I am going. Do you imagine I am jealous of Dmitri, that I\u2019ve been trying to steal his beautiful Katerina Ivanovna for the last three months? Nonsense, I had business of my own. I finished it. I am going. I finished it just now, you were witness.\u201d \u201cAt Katerina Ivanovna\u2019s?\u201d \u201cYes, and I\u2019ve released myself once for all. And after all, what have I to do with Dmitri? Dmitri doesn\u2019t come in. I had my own business to settle with Katerina Ivanovna. You know, on the contrary, that Dmitri behaved as though there was an understanding between us. I didn\u2019t ask him to do it, but he solemnly handed her over to me and gave us his blessing. It\u2019s all too funny. Ah, Alyosha, if you only knew how light my heart is now! Would you believe, it, I sat here eating my dinner and was nearly ordering champagne to celebrate my first hour of freedom. Tfoo! It\u2019s been going on nearly six months, and all at once I\u2019ve thrown it off. I could never have guessed even yesterday, how easy it would be to put an end to it if I wanted.\u201d \u201cYou are speaking of your love, Ivan?\u201d \u201cOf my love, if you like.", " And when the time comes they will show it to the tottering creeds of the world. That is a great thought. That star will rise out of the East. That is my view of the monk, and is it false? is it too proud? Look at the worldly and all who set themselves up above the people of God, has not God\u2019s image and His truth been distorted in them? They have science; but in science there is nothing but what is the object of sense. The spiritual world, the higher part of man\u2019s being is rejected altogether, dismissed with a sort of triumph, even with hatred. The world has proclaimed the reign of freedom, especially of late, but what do we see in this freedom of theirs? Nothing but slavery and self\u2010destruction! For the world says: \u201cYou have desires and so satisfy them, for you have the same rights as the most rich and powerful. Don\u2019t be afraid of satisfying them and even multiply your desires.\u201d That is the modern doctrine of the world. In that they see freedom. And what follows from this right of multiplication of desires? In the rich, isolation and spiritual suicide; in the poor, envy and murder; for they have been given rights, but have not been shown the means of satisfying their wants. They maintain that the world is getting more and more united, more and more bound together in brotherly community, as it overcomes distance and sets thoughts flying through the air. Alas, put no faith in such a bond of union."], "If Alyosha represents faith, then Ivan represents what?": [" \u201cYou agree. Then it must be so, if you agree. It\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it, Alyosha? That\u2019s the Russian faith all over, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cNo, Smerdyakov has not the Russian faith at all,\u201d said Alyosha firmly and gravely. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about his faith. I mean those two in the desert, only that idea. Surely that\u2019s Russian, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cYes, that\u2019s purely Russian,\u201d said Alyosha smiling. \u201cYour words are worth a gold piece, O ass, and I\u2019ll give it to you to\u2010day. But as to the rest you talk nonsense, nonsense, nonsense. Let me tell you, stupid, that we here are all of little faith, only from carelessness, because we haven\u2019t time; things are too much for us, and, in the second place, the Lord God has given us so little time, only twenty\u2010four hours in the day, so that one hasn\u2019t even time to get sleep enough, much less to repent of one\u2019s sins. While you have denied your faith to your enemies when you\u2019d nothing else to think about but to show your faith! So I consider, brother, that it constitutes a sin.\u201d \u201cConstitute a sin it may, but consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch, that it only extenuates it, if it does constitute. If I had believed then in very truth, as I ought to have believed, then it really would have been sinful if I had not faced tortures for my faith, and had gone over to the pagan Mohammedan faith. But, of course, it wouldn\u2019t have come to torture then, because I should only have had to say at that instant to the mountain, \u2018Move and crush the tormentor,\u2019 and it would have moved and at the very instant have crushed him like a black\u2010beetle, and I should have walked away as though nothing had happened, praising and glorifying God.", " Well, Grigory Vassilyevitch, if I\u2019m without faith and you have so great a faith that you are continually swearing at me, you try yourself telling this mountain, not to move into the sea for that\u2019s a long way off, but even to our stinking little river which runs at the bottom of the garden. You\u2019ll see for yourself that it won\u2019t budge, but will remain just where it is however much you shout at it, and that shows, Grigory Vassilyevitch, that you haven\u2019t faith in the proper manner, and only abuse others about it. Again, taking into consideration that no one in our day, not only you, but actually no one, from the highest person to the lowest peasant, can shove mountains into the sea\u2014except perhaps some one man in the world, or, at most, two, and they most likely are saving their souls in secret somewhere in the Egyptian desert, so you wouldn\u2019t find them\u2014if so it be, if all the rest have no faith, will God curse all the rest? that is, the population of the whole earth, except about two hermits in the desert, and in His well\u2010known mercy will He not forgive one of them? And so I\u2019m persuaded that though I may once have doubted I shall be forgiven if I shed tears of repentance.\u201d \u201cStay!\u201d cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, in a transport of delight. \u201cSo you do suppose there are two who can move mountains? Ivan, make a note of it, write it down. There you have the Russian all over!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re quite right in saying it\u2019s characteristic of the people\u2019s faith,\u201d Ivan assented, with an approving smile.", " I like people who are firm like that whatever it is they stand by, even if they are such little fellows as you. Your expectant eyes ceased to annoy me, I grew fond of them in the end, those expectant eyes. You seem to love me for some reason, Alyosha?\u201d \u201cI do love you, Ivan. Dmitri says of you\u2014Ivan is a tomb! I say of you, Ivan is a riddle. You are a riddle to me even now. But I understand something in you, and I did not understand it till this morning.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d laughed Ivan. \u201cYou won\u2019t be angry?\u201d Alyosha laughed too. \u201cWell?\u201d \u201cThat you are just as young as other young men of three and twenty, that you are just a young and fresh and nice boy, green in fact! Now, have I insulted you dreadfully?\u201d \u201cOn the contrary, I am struck by a coincidence,\u201d cried Ivan, warmly and good\u2010humoredly. \u201cWould you believe it that ever since that scene with her, I have thought of nothing else but my youthful greenness, and just as though you guessed that, you begin about it. Do you know I\u2019ve been sitting here thinking to myself: that if I didn\u2019t believe in life, if I lost faith in the woman I love, lost faith in the order of things, were convinced in fact that everything is a disorderly, damnable, and perhaps devil\u2010ridden chaos, if I were struck by every horror of man\u2019s disillusionment\u2014still I should want to live and, having once tasted of the cup, I would not turn away from it till I had drained it!", " \u201cYou will come back again!\u201d murmured Father Pa\u00efssy, looking after him with sorrowful surprise. Chapter II. A Critical Moment Father Pa\u00efssy, of course, was not wrong when he decided that his \u201cdear boy\u201d would come back again. Perhaps indeed, to some extent, he penetrated with insight into the true meaning of Alyosha\u2019s spiritual condition. Yet I must frankly own that it would be very difficult for me to give a clear account of that strange, vague moment in the life of the young hero I love so much. To Father Pa\u00efssy\u2019s sorrowful question, \u201cAre you too with those of little faith?\u201d I could of course confidently answer for Alyosha, \u201cNo, he is not with those of little faith. Quite the contrary.\u201d Indeed, all his trouble came from the fact that he was of great faith. But still the trouble was there and was so agonizing that even long afterwards Alyosha thought of that sorrowful day as one of the bitterest and most fatal days of his life. If the question is asked: \u201cCould all his grief and disturbance have been only due to the fact that his elder\u2019s body had shown signs of premature decomposition instead of at once performing miracles?\u201d I must answer without beating about the bush, \u201cYes, it certainly was.\u201d I would only beg the reader not to be in too great a hurry to laugh at my young hero\u2019s pure heart. I am far from intending to apologize for him or to justify his innocent faith on the ground of his youth, or the little progress he had made in his studies, or any such reason."], "According to the novel, what can be viewed as both a curse and a blessing?": [" \u201cAs for mutton, that\u2019s not so, and there\u2019ll be nothing there for this, and there shouldn\u2019t be either, if it\u2019s according to justice,\u201d Smerdyakov maintained stoutly. \u201cHow do you mean \u2018according to justice\u2019?\u201d Fyodor Pavlovitch cried still more gayly, nudging Alyosha with his knee. \u201cHe\u2019s a rascal, that\u2019s what he is!\u201d burst from Grigory. He looked Smerdyakov wrathfully in the face. \u201cAs for being a rascal, wait a little, Grigory Vassilyevitch,\u201d answered Smerdyakov with perfect composure. \u201cYou\u2019d better consider yourself that, once I am taken prisoner by the enemies of the Christian race, and they demand from me to curse the name of God and to renounce my holy christening, I am fully entitled to act by my own reason, since there would be no sin in it.\u201d \u201cBut you\u2019ve said that before. Don\u2019t waste words. Prove it,\u201d cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. \u201cSoup\u2010maker!\u201d muttered Grigory contemptuously. \u201cAs for being a soup\u2010maker, wait a bit, too, and consider for yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch, without abusing me. For as soon as I say to those enemies, \u2018No, I\u2019m not a Christian, and I curse my true God,\u2019 then at once, by God\u2019s high judgment, I become immediately and specially anathema accursed, and am cut off from the Holy Church, exactly as though I were a heathen, so that at that very instant, not only when I say it aloud, but when I think of saying it, before a quarter of a second has passed, I am cut off.", " \u201cMitya, Mitya, I loved him, you know. How I have loved him these five years, all that time! Did I love him or only my own anger? No, him, him! It\u2019s a lie that it was my anger I loved and not him. Mitya, I was only seventeen then; he was so kind to me, so merry; he used to sing to me.... Or so it seemed to a silly girl like me.... And now, O Lord, it\u2019s not the same man. Even his face is not the same; he\u2019s different altogether. I shouldn\u2019t have known him. I drove here with Timofey, and all the way I was thinking how I should meet him, what I should say to him, how we should look at one another. My soul was faint, and all of a sudden it was just as though he had emptied a pail of dirty water over me. He talked to me like a schoolmaster, all so grave and learned; he met me so solemnly that I was struck dumb. I couldn\u2019t get a word in. At first I thought he was ashamed to talk before his great big Pole. I sat staring at him and wondering why I couldn\u2019t say a word to him now. It must have been his wife that ruined him; you know he threw me up to get married. She must have changed him like that. Mitya, how shameful it is! Oh, Mitya, I\u2019m ashamed, I\u2019m ashamed for all my life. Curse it, curse it, curse those five years!\u201d And again she burst into tears, but clung tight to Mitya\u2019s hand and did not let it go. \u201cMitya, darling, stay, don\u2019t go away. I want to say one word to you,\u201d she whispered, and suddenly raised her face to him.", " Being in a subordinate and dependent position, and so not on an equality with the guests, he did not greet them with a bow. Father Zossima was accompanied by a novice, and by Alyosha. The two monks rose and greeted him with a very deep bow, touching the ground with their fingers; then kissed his hand. Blessing them, the elder replied with as deep a reverence to them, and asked their blessing. The whole ceremony was performed very seriously and with an appearance of feeling, not like an everyday rite. But Mi\u00fcsov fancied that it was all done with intentional impressiveness. He stood in front of the other visitors. He ought\u2014he had reflected upon it the evening before\u2014from simple politeness, since it was the custom here, to have gone up to receive the elder\u2019s blessing, even if he did not kiss his hand. But when he saw all this bowing and kissing on the part of the monks he instantly changed his mind. With dignified gravity he made a rather deep, conventional bow, and moved away to a chair. Fyodor Pavlovitch did the same, mimicking Mi\u00fcsov like an ape. Ivan bowed with great dignity and courtesy, but he too kept his hands at his sides, while Kalganov was so confused that he did not bow at all. The elder let fall the hand raised to bless them, and bowing to them again, asked them all to sit down. The blood rushed to Alyosha\u2019s cheeks. He was ashamed. His forebodings were coming true. Father Zossima sat down on a very old\u2010fashioned mahogany sofa, covered with leather, and made his visitors sit down in a row along the opposite wall on four mahogany chairs, covered with shabby black leather.", " The nearest friends of the deceased and those whose duty it was from their position began to lay out the corpse according to the ancient ritual, and all the monks gathered together in the church. And before dawn the news of the death reached the town. By the morning all the town was talking of the event, and crowds were flocking from the town to the monastery. But this subject will be treated in the next book; I will only add here that before a day had passed something happened so unexpected, so strange, upsetting, and bewildering in its effect on the monks and the townspeople, that after all these years, that day of general suspense is still vividly remembered in the town. PART III Book VII. Alyosha Chapter I. The Breath Of Corruption The body of Father Zossima was prepared for burial according to the established ritual. As is well known, the bodies of dead monks and hermits are not washed. In the words of the Church Ritual: \u201cIf any one of the monks depart in the Lord, the monk designated (that is, whose office it is) shall wipe the body with warm water, making first the sign of the cross with a sponge on the forehead of the deceased, on the breast, on the hands and feet and on the knees, and that is enough.\u201d All this was done by Father Pa\u00efssy, who then clothed the deceased in his monastic garb and wrapped him in his cloak, which was, according to custom, somewhat slit to allow of its being folded about him in the form of a cross."], "According to the novel, why is it necessary for people to forgive others?": [" What do I care for a hell for oppressors? What good can hell do, since those children have already been tortured? And what becomes of harmony, if there is hell? I want to forgive. I want to embrace. I don\u2019t want more suffering. And if the sufferings of children go to swell the sum of sufferings which was necessary to pay for truth, then I protest that the truth is not worth such a price. I don\u2019t want the mother to embrace the oppressor who threw her son to the dogs! She dare not forgive him! Let her forgive him for herself, if she will, let her forgive the torturer for the immeasurable suffering of her mother\u2019s heart. But the sufferings of her tortured child she has no right to forgive; she dare not forgive the torturer, even if the child were to forgive him! And if that is so, if they dare not forgive, what becomes of harmony? Is there in the whole world a being who would have the right to forgive and could forgive? I don\u2019t want harmony. From love for humanity I don\u2019t want it. I would rather be left with the unavenged suffering. I would rather remain with my unavenged suffering and unsatisfied indignation, _even if I were wrong_. Besides, too high a price is asked for harmony; it\u2019s beyond our means to pay so much to enter on it. And so I hasten to give back my entrance ticket, and if I am an honest man I am bound to give it back as soon as possible. And that I am doing. It\u2019s not God that I don\u2019t accept, Alyosha, only I most respectfully return Him the ticket.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s rebellion,\u201d murmured Alyosha, looking down.", " \u201cWoman, yours is a heavy burden,\u201d broke, as it were, involuntarily from Mitya. \u201cLet me go,\u201d she whispered. \u201cI\u2019ll come again. It\u2019s more than I can bear now.\u201d She was getting up from her place, but suddenly uttered a loud scream and staggered back. Grushenka walked suddenly and noiselessly into the room. No one had expected her. Katya moved swiftly to the door, but when she reached Grushenka, she stopped suddenly, turned as white as chalk and moaned softly, almost in a whisper: \u201cForgive me!\u201d Grushenka stared at her and, pausing for an instant, in a vindictive, venomous voice, answered: \u201cWe are full of hatred, my girl, you and I! We are both full of hatred! As though we could forgive one another! Save him, and I\u2019ll worship you all my life.\u201d \u201cYou won\u2019t forgive her!\u201d cried Mitya, with frantic reproach. \u201cDon\u2019t be anxious, I\u2019ll save him for you!\u201d Katya whispered rapidly, and she ran out of the room. \u201cAnd you could refuse to forgive her when she begged your forgiveness herself?\u201d Mitya exclaimed bitterly again. \u201cMitya, don\u2019t dare to blame her; you have no right to!\u201d Alyosha cried hotly. \u201cHer proud lips spoke, not her heart,\u201d Grushenka brought out in a tone of disgust. \u201cIf she saves you I\u2019ll forgive her everything\u2014\u201d She stopped speaking, as though suppressing something. She could not yet recover herself. She had come in, as appeared afterwards, accidentally, with no suspicion of what she would meet.", " From some rumor, or perhaps from some stray word of Grushenka\u2019s, he had gathered further that the old man would perhaps prefer him to Fyodor Pavlovitch for Grushenka. Possibly many of the readers of my novel will feel that in reckoning on such assistance, and being ready to take his bride, so to speak, from the hands of her protector, Dmitri showed great coarseness and want of delicacy. I will only observe that Mitya looked upon Grushenka\u2019s past as something completely over. He looked on that past with infinite pity and resolved with all the fervor of his passion that when once Grushenka told him she loved him and would marry him, it would mean the beginning of a new Grushenka and a new Dmitri, free from every vice. They would forgive one another and would begin their lives afresh. As for Kuzma Samsonov, Dmitri looked upon him as a man who had exercised a fateful influence in that remote past of Grushenka\u2019s, though she had never loved him, and who was now himself a thing of the past, completely done with, and, so to say, non\u2010existent. Besides, Mitya hardly looked upon him as a man at all, for it was known to every one in the town that he was only a shattered wreck, whose relations with Grushenka had changed their character and were now simply paternal, and that this had been so for a long time. In any case there was much simplicity on Mitya\u2019s part in all this, for in spite of all his vices, he was a very simple\u2010hearted man.", " The nearest friends of the deceased and those whose duty it was from their position began to lay out the corpse according to the ancient ritual, and all the monks gathered together in the church. And before dawn the news of the death reached the town. By the morning all the town was talking of the event, and crowds were flocking from the town to the monastery. But this subject will be treated in the next book; I will only add here that before a day had passed something happened so unexpected, so strange, upsetting, and bewildering in its effect on the monks and the townspeople, that after all these years, that day of general suspense is still vividly remembered in the town. PART III Book VII. Alyosha Chapter I. The Breath Of Corruption The body of Father Zossima was prepared for burial according to the established ritual. As is well known, the bodies of dead monks and hermits are not washed. In the words of the Church Ritual: \u201cIf any one of the monks depart in the Lord, the monk designated (that is, whose office it is) shall wipe the body with warm water, making first the sign of the cross with a sponge on the forehead of the deceased, on the breast, on the hands and feet and on the knees, and that is enough.\u201d All this was done by Father Pa\u00efssy, who then clothed the deceased in his monastic garb and wrapped him in his cloak, which was, according to custom, somewhat slit to allow of its being folded about him in the form of a cross."], "According to Zosima, what is the path to self-knowledge?": [" \u201cAgain, though he ran to see whether the witness was alive, he left another witness on the path, that brass pestle which he had taken from the two women, and which they could always recognize afterwards as theirs, and prove that he had taken it from them. And it is not as though he had forgotten it on the path, dropped it through carelessness or haste, no, he had flung away his weapon, for it was found fifteen paces from where Grigory lay. Why did he do so? Just because he was grieved at having killed a man, an old servant; and he flung away the pestle with a curse, as a murderous weapon. That\u2019s how it must have been, what other reason could he have had for throwing it so far? And if he was capable of feeling grief and pity at having killed a man, it shows that he was innocent of his father\u2019s murder. Had he murdered him, he would never have run to another victim out of pity; then he would have felt differently; his thoughts would have been centered on self\u2010preservation. He would have had none to spare for pity, that is beyond doubt. On the contrary, he would have broken his skull instead of spending five minutes looking after him. There was room for pity and good\u2010feeling just because his conscience had been clear till then. Here we have a different psychology. I have purposely resorted to this method, gentlemen of the jury, to show that you can prove anything by it. It all depends on who makes use of it.", " It had flourished and been glorious all over Russia through its elders, to see and hear whom pilgrims had flocked for thousands of miles from all parts. What was such an elder? An elder was one who took your soul, your will, into his soul and his will. When you choose an elder, you renounce your own will and yield it to him in complete submission, complete self\u2010 abnegation. This novitiate, this terrible school of abnegation, is undertaken voluntarily, in the hope of self\u2010conquest, of self\u2010mastery, in order, after a life of obedience, to attain perfect freedom, that is, from self; to escape the lot of those who have lived their whole life without finding their true selves in themselves. This institution of elders is not founded on theory, but was established in the East from the practice of a thousand years. The obligations due to an elder are not the ordinary \u201cobedience\u201d which has always existed in our Russian monasteries. The obligation involves confession to the elder by all who have submitted themselves to him, and to the indissoluble bond between him and them. The story is told, for instance, that in the early days of Christianity one such novice, failing to fulfill some command laid upon him by his elder, left his monastery in Syria and went to Egypt. There, after great exploits, he was found worthy at last to suffer torture and a martyr\u2019s death for the faith. When the Church, regarding him as a saint, was burying him, suddenly, at the deacon\u2019s exhortation, \u201cDepart all ye unbaptized,\u201d the coffin containing the martyr\u2019s body left its place and was cast forth from the church, and this took place three times.", " The nearest friends of the deceased and those whose duty it was from their position began to lay out the corpse according to the ancient ritual, and all the monks gathered together in the church. And before dawn the news of the death reached the town. By the morning all the town was talking of the event, and crowds were flocking from the town to the monastery. But this subject will be treated in the next book; I will only add here that before a day had passed something happened so unexpected, so strange, upsetting, and bewildering in its effect on the monks and the townspeople, that after all these years, that day of general suspense is still vividly remembered in the town.

You ask when it will come to pass; it will come to pass, but first we have to go through the period of isolation.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean by isolation?\u201d I asked him. \u201cWhy, the isolation that prevails everywhere, above all in our age\u2014it has not fully developed, it has not reached its limit yet. For every one strives to keep his individuality as apart as possible, wishes to secure the greatest possible fullness of life for himself; but meantime all his efforts result not in attaining fullness of life but self\u2010destruction, for instead of self\u2010realization he ends by arriving at complete solitude. All mankind in our age have split up into units, they all keep apart, each in his own groove; each one holds aloof, hides himself and hides what he has, from the rest, and he ends by being repelled by others and repelling them. He heaps up riches by himself and thinks, \u2018How strong I am now and how secure,\u2019 and in his madness he does not understand that the more he heaps up, the more he sinks into self\u2010destructive impotence. For he is accustomed to rely upon himself alone and to cut himself off from the whole; he has trained himself not to believe in the help of others, in men and in humanity, and only trembles for fear he should lose his money and the privileges that he has won for himself."], "Which of the following serves as a symbol of the necessity for faith to triumph over doubt?": [" \u201cYou agree. Then it must be so, if you agree. It\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it, Alyosha? That\u2019s the Russian faith all over, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cNo, Smerdyakov has not the Russian faith at all,\u201d said Alyosha firmly and gravely. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about his faith. I mean those two in the desert, only that idea. Surely that\u2019s Russian, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cYes, that\u2019s purely Russian,\u201d said Alyosha smiling. \u201cYour words are worth a gold piece, O ass, and I\u2019ll give it to you to\u2010day. But as to the rest you talk nonsense, nonsense, nonsense. Let me tell you, stupid, that we here are all of little faith, only from carelessness, because we haven\u2019t time; things are too much for us, and, in the second place, the Lord God has given us so little time, only twenty\u2010four hours in the day, so that one hasn\u2019t even time to get sleep enough, much less to repent of one\u2019s sins. While you have denied your faith to your enemies when you\u2019d nothing else to think about but to show your faith! So I consider, brother, that it constitutes a sin.\u201d \u201cConstitute a sin it may, but consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch, that it only extenuates it, if it does constitute. If I had believed then in very truth, as I ought to have believed, then it really would have been sinful if I had not faced tortures for my faith, and had gone over to the pagan Mohammedan faith. But, of course, it wouldn\u2019t have come to torture then, because I should only have had to say at that instant to the mountain, \u2018Move and crush the tormentor,\u2019 and it would have moved and at the very instant have crushed him like a black\u2010beetle, and I should have walked away as though nothing had happened, praising and glorifying God.", " Well, Grigory Vassilyevitch, if I\u2019m without faith and you have so great a faith that you are continually swearing at me, you try yourself telling this mountain, not to move into the sea for that\u2019s a long way off, but even to our stinking little river which runs at the bottom of the garden. You\u2019ll see for yourself that it won\u2019t budge, but will remain just where it is however much you shout at it, and that shows, Grigory Vassilyevitch, that you haven\u2019t faith in the proper manner, and only abuse others about it. Again, taking into consideration that no one in our day, not only you, but actually no one, from the highest person to the lowest peasant, can shove mountains into the sea\u2014except perhaps some one man in the world, or, at most, two, and they most likely are saving their souls in secret somewhere in the Egyptian desert, so you wouldn\u2019t find them\u2014if so it be, if all the rest have no faith, will God curse all the rest? that is, the population of the whole earth, except about two hermits in the desert, and in His well\u2010known mercy will He not forgive one of them? And so I\u2019m persuaded that though I may once have doubted I shall be forgiven if I shed tears of repentance.\u201d \u201cStay!\u201d cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, in a transport of delight. \u201cSo you do suppose there are two who can move mountains? Ivan, make a note of it, write it down. There you have the Russian all over!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re quite right in saying it\u2019s characteristic of the people\u2019s faith,\u201d Ivan assented, with an approving smile.", " I must declare, on the contrary, that I have genuine respect for the qualities of his heart. No doubt a youth who received impressions cautiously, whose love was lukewarm, and whose mind was too prudent for his age and so of little value, such a young man might, I admit, have avoided what happened to my hero. But in some cases it is really more creditable to be carried away by an emotion, however unreasonable, which springs from a great love, than to be unmoved. And this is even truer in youth, for a young man who is always sensible is to be suspected and is of little worth\u2014that\u2019s my opinion! \u201cBut,\u201d reasonable people will exclaim perhaps, \u201cevery young man cannot believe in such a superstition and your hero is no model for others.\u201d To this I reply again, \u201cYes! my hero had faith, a faith holy and steadfast, but still I am not going to apologize for him.\u201d Though I declared above, and perhaps too hastily, that I should not explain or justify my hero, I see that some explanation is necessary for the understanding of the rest of my story. Let me say then, it was not a question of miracles. There was no frivolous and impatient expectation of miracles in his mind. And Alyosha needed no miracles at the time, for the triumph of some preconceived idea\u2014oh, no, not at all\u2014what he saw before all was one figure\u2014the figure of his beloved elder, the figure of that holy man whom he revered with such adoration.", " Though he did not clearly understand what was said, he had caught something in this rigmarole, and stood, looking like a man who has just hit his head against a wall. Fyodor Pavlovitch emptied his glass and went off into his shrill laugh. \u201cAlyosha! Alyosha! What do you say to that! Ah, you casuist! He must have been with the Jesuits, somewhere, Ivan. Oh, you stinking Jesuit, who taught you? But you\u2019re talking nonsense, you casuist, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense. Don\u2019t cry, Grigory, we\u2019ll reduce him to smoke and ashes in a moment. Tell me this, O ass; you may be right before your enemies, but you have renounced your faith all the same in your own heart, and you say yourself that in that very hour you became anathema accursed. And if once you\u2019re anathema they won\u2019t pat you on the head for it in hell. What do you say to that, my fine Jesuit?\u201d \u201cThere is no doubt that I have renounced it in my own heart, but there was no special sin in that. Or if there was sin, it was the most ordinary.\u201d \u201cHow\u2019s that the most ordinary?\u201d \u201cYou lie, accursed one!\u201d hissed Grigory. \u201cConsider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch,\u201d Smerdyakov went on, staid and unruffled, conscious of his triumph, but, as it were, generous to the vanquished foe. \u201cConsider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch; it is said in the Scripture that if you have faith, even as a mustard seed, and bid a mountain move into the sea, it will move without the least delay at your bidding."]}
