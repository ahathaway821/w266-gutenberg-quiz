Are you so hopeless, brother?\u201d Alyosha said, with an apprehensive feeling. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d said Mitya, looking at him rather uncertainly. \u201cOh, you mean the trial! Damn it all! Till now we\u2019ve been talking of things that don\u2019t matter, about this trial, but I haven\u2019t said a word to you about the chief thing. Yes, the trial is to\u2010morrow; but it wasn\u2019t the trial I meant, when I said it was all over with me. Why do you look at me so critically?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean, Mitya?\u201d \u201cIdeas, ideas, that\u2019s all! Ethics! What is ethics?\u201d \u201cEthics?\u201d asked Alyosha, wondering. \u201cYes; is it a science?\u201d \u201cYes, there is such a science ... but ... I confess I can\u2019t explain to you what sort of science it is.\u201d \u201cRakitin knows. Rakitin knows a lot, damn him! He\u2019s not going to be a monk. He means to go to Petersburg. There he\u2019ll go in for criticism of an elevating tendency. Who knows, he may be of use and make his own career, too.", " I paved the way to that hideous scene at the trial. He wanted to show me that he was an honorable man, and that, even if I loved his brother, he would not ruin him for revenge or jealousy. So he came to the court ... I am the cause of it all, I alone am to blame!\u201d Katya never had made such confessions to Alyosha before, and he felt that she was now at that stage of unbearable suffering when even the proudest heart painfully crushes its pride and falls vanquished by grief. Oh, Alyosha knew another terrible reason of her present misery, though she had carefully concealed it from him during those days since the trial; but it would have been for some reason too painful to him if she had been brought so low as to speak to him now about that. She was suffering for her \u201ctreachery\u201d at the trial, and Alyosha felt that her conscience was impelling her to confess it to him, to him, Alyosha, with tears and cries and hysterical writhings on the floor.", " Book XII. A Judicial Error Chapter I. The Fatal Day At ten o\u2019clock in the morning of the day following the events I have described, the trial of Dmitri Karamazov began in our district court. I hasten to emphasize the fact that I am far from esteeming myself capable of reporting all that took place at the trial in full detail, or even in the actual order of events. I imagine that to mention everything with full explanation would fill a volume, even a very large one. And so I trust I may not be reproached, for confining myself to what struck me. I may have selected as of most interest what was of secondary importance, and may have omitted the most prominent and essential details. But I see I shall do better not to apologize. I will do my best and the reader will see for himself that I have done all I can. And, to begin with, before entering the court, I will mention what surprised me most on that day.", " \u201cBut he begged me not to tell Dmitri that he had told me about him,\u201d added Alyosha. Ivan frowned and pondered. \u201cAre you frowning on Smerdyakov\u2019s account?\u201d asked Alyosha. \u201cYes, on his account. Damn him, I certainly did want to see Dmitri, but now there\u2019s no need,\u201d said Ivan reluctantly. \u201cBut are you really going so soon, brother?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWhat of Dmitri and father? how will it end?\u201d asked Alyosha anxiously. \u201cYou are always harping upon it! What have I to do with it? Am I my brother Dmitri\u2019s keeper?\u201d Ivan snapped irritably, but then he suddenly smiled bitterly. \u201cCain\u2019s answer about his murdered brother, wasn\u2019t it? Perhaps that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking at this moment? Well, damn it all, I can\u2019t stay here to be their keeper, can I? I\u2019ve finished what I had to do, and I am going. Do you imagine I am jealous of Dmitri, that I\u2019ve been trying to steal his beautiful Katerina Ivanovna for the last three months?"], "Which of the Karamazovbrothers does Miusov help to raise?": [" This is a case of mathematics: you couldn\u2019t help coming, after all that has passed with Katerina Ivanovna; you couldn\u2019t, you couldn\u2019t, that\u2019s a mathematical certainty.\u201d \u201cThe realism of actual life, madam, that\u2019s what it is. But allow me to explain\u2014\u201d \u201cRealism indeed, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. I\u2019m all for realism now. I\u2019ve seen too much of miracles.

You could hardly fail to be, and whatever you may say to me, I know beforehand. I have long been thinking over your destiny, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, I am watching over it and studying it.... Oh, believe me, I\u2019m an experienced doctor of the soul, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.\u201d \u201cMadam, if you are an experienced doctor, I\u2019m certainly an experienced patient,\u201d said Mitya, with an effort to be polite, \u201cand I feel that if you are watching over my destiny in this way, you will come to my help in my ruin, and so allow me, at least to explain to you the plan with which I have ventured to come to you ... and what I am hoping of you....", " I shall have done with all this directly, and as soon as I\u2019m free, I\u2019ll be with her, she\u2019ll see, let her wait. Gentlemen,\u201d he said, turning to the two lawyers, \u201cnow I\u2019ll open my whole soul to you; I\u2019ll pour out everything. We\u2019ll finish this off directly, finish it off gayly. We shall laugh at it in the end, shan\u2019t we? But, gentlemen, that woman is the queen of my heart. Oh, let me tell you that. That one thing I\u2019ll tell you now.... I see I\u2019m with honorable men. She is my light, she is my holy one, and if only you knew! Did you hear her cry, \u2018I\u2019ll go to death with you\u2019? And what have I, a penniless beggar, done for her? Why such love for me? How can a clumsy, ugly brute like me, with my ugly face, deserve such love, that she is ready to go to exile with me? And how she fell down at your feet for my sake, just now!... and yet she\u2019s proud and has done nothing! How can I help adoring her, how can I help crying out and rushing to her as I did just now?", " \u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning of it?\u201d I thought. \u201cI feel in my heart as it were something vile and shameful. Is it because I am going to shed blood? No,\u201d I thought, \u201cI feel it\u2019s not that. Can it be that I am afraid of death, afraid of being killed? No, that\u2019s not it, that\u2019s not it at all.\u201d... And all at once I knew what it was: it was because I had beaten Afanasy the evening before! It all rose before my mind, it all was as it were repeated over again; he stood before me and I was beating him straight on the face and he was holding his arms stiffly down, his head erect, his eyes fixed upon me as though on parade. He staggered at every blow and did not even dare to raise his hands to protect himself. That is what a man has been brought to, and that was a man beating a fellow creature! What a crime! It was as though a sharp dagger had pierced me right through. I stood as if I were struck dumb, while the sun was shining, the leaves were rejoicing and the birds were trilling the praise of God....", " That phrase had, of course, escaped Ivan unawares yesterday, but that only made it more important. If he felt like that, what chance was there of peace? Were there not, on the contrary, new grounds for hatred and hostility in their family? And with which of them was Alyosha to sympathize? And what was he to wish for each of them? He loved them both, but what could he desire for each in the midst of these conflicting interests? He might go quite astray in this maze, and Alyosha\u2019s heart could not endure uncertainty, because his love was always of an active character. He was incapable of passive love. If he loved any one, he set to work at once to help him. And to do so he must know what he was aiming at; he must know for certain what was best for each, and having ascertained this it was natural for him to help them both. But instead of a definite aim, he found nothing but uncertainty and perplexity on all sides."], "Which characteris the son of Stinking Lizaveta?": [" \u201cBrother, I cannot stay long,\u201d Alyosha said, after a pause. \u201cTo\u2010morrow will be a great and awful day for you, the judgment of God will be accomplished ... I am amazed at you, you walk about here, talking of I don\u2019t know what ...\u201d \u201cNo, don\u2019t be amazed at me,\u201d Mitya broke in warmly. \u201cAm I to talk of that stinking dog? Of the murderer? We\u2019ve talked enough of him. I don\u2019t want to say more of the stinking son of Stinking Lizaveta! God will kill him, you will see. Hush!\u201d He went up to Alyosha excitedly and kissed him. His eyes glowed. \u201cRakitin wouldn\u2019t understand it,\u201d he began in a sort of exaltation; \u201cbut you, you\u2019ll understand it all. That\u2019s why I was thirsting for you. You see, there\u2019s so much I\u2019ve been wanting to tell you for ever so long, here, within these peeling walls, but I haven\u2019t said a word about what matters most; the moment never seems to have come. Now I can wait no longer. I must pour out my heart to you.", " The prosecutor was too simple in taking him for weak\u2010minded. He made a very definite impression on me: I left him with the conviction that he was a distinctly spiteful creature, excessively ambitious, vindictive, and intensely envious. I made some inquiries: he resented his parentage, was ashamed of it, and would clench his teeth when he remembered that he was the son of \u2018stinking Lizaveta.\u2019 He was disrespectful to the servant Grigory and his wife, who had cared for him in his childhood. He cursed and jeered at Russia. He dreamed of going to France and becoming a Frenchman. He used often to say that he hadn\u2019t the means to do so. I fancy he loved no one but himself and had a strangely high opinion of himself. His conception of culture was limited to good clothes, clean shirt\u2010fronts and polished boots. Believing himself to be the illegitimate son of Fyodor Pavlovitch (there is evidence of this), he might well have resented his position, compared with that of his master\u2019s legitimate sons.", " But the gate from the yard into the garden was locked at night, and there was no other way of entering it, for it was enclosed all round by a strong, high fence. Going back into the house, Grigory lighted a lantern, took the garden key, and taking no notice of the hysterical fears of his wife, who was still persuaded that she heard a child crying, and that it was her own baby crying and calling for her, went into the garden in silence. There he heard at once that the groans came from the bath\u2010house that stood near the garden gate, and that they were the groans of a woman. Opening the door of the bath\u2010house, he saw a sight which petrified him. An idiot girl, who wandered about the streets and was known to the whole town by the nickname of Lizaveta Smerdyastchaya (Stinking Lizaveta), had got into the bath\u2010 house and had just given birth to a child. She lay dying with the baby beside her. She said nothing, for she had never been able to speak.", " Grigory rushed to Marfa and sent her to Lizaveta, while he ran to fetch an old midwife who lived close by. They saved the baby, but Lizaveta died at dawn. Grigory took the baby, brought it home, and making his wife sit down, put it on her lap. \u201cA child of God\u2014an orphan is akin to all,\u201d he said, \u201cand to us above others. Our little lost one has sent us this, who has come from the devil\u2019s son and a holy innocent. Nurse him and weep no more.\u201d So Marfa brought up the child. He was christened Pavel, to which people were not slow in adding Fyodorovitch (son of Fyodor). Fyodor Pavlovitch did not object to any of this, and thought it amusing, though he persisted vigorously in denying his responsibility. The townspeople were pleased at his adopting the foundling. Later on, Fyodor Pavlovitch invented a surname for the child, calling him Smerdyakov, after his mother\u2019s nickname. So this Smerdyakov became Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s second servant, and was living in the lodge with Grigory and Marfa at the time our story begins."], "Why does Dmitrileave Katerina?": [" \u201cSet my mind at rest that I may know the worst that\u2019s in store for me. That\u2019s why I sent for you.\u201d \u201cYou think it\u2019s something to do with you? If it were, he wouldn\u2019t have told you there was a secret.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. Perhaps he wants to tell me, but doesn\u2019t dare to. He warns me. There is a secret, he tells me, but he won\u2019t tell me what it is.\u201d \u201cWhat do you think yourself?\u201d \u201cWhat do I think? It\u2019s the end for me, that\u2019s what I think. They all three have been plotting my end, for Katerina\u2019s in it. It\u2019s all Katerina, it all comes from her. She is this and that, and that means that I am not. He tells me that beforehand\u2014warns me. He is planning to throw me over, that\u2019s the whole secret. They\u2019ve planned it together, the three of them\u2014Mitya, Katerina, and Ivan Fyodorovitch. Alyosha, I\u2019ve been wanting to ask you a long time. A week ago he suddenly told me that Ivan was in love with Katerina, because he often goes to see her.", " Without it, all would be lost and nothing could be done, \u201cand only because I hadn\u2019t the money. Oh, the shame of it!\u201d To anticipate things: he did, perhaps, know where to get the money, knew, perhaps, where it lay at that moment. I will say no more of this here, as it will all be clear later. But his chief trouble, I must explain however obscurely, lay in the fact that to have that sum he knew of, to _have the right_ to take it, he must first restore Katerina Ivanovna\u2019s three thousand\u2014if not, \u201cI\u2019m a common pickpocket, I\u2019m a scoundrel, and I don\u2019t want to begin a new life as a scoundrel,\u201d Mitya decided. And so he made up his mind to move heaven and earth to return Katerina Ivanovna that three thousand, and that _first of all_. The final stage of this decision, so to say, had been reached only during the last hours, that is, after his last interview with Alyosha, two days before, on the high\u2010road, on the evening when Grushenka had insulted Katerina Ivanovna, and Mitya, after hearing Alyosha\u2019s account of it, had admitted that he was a scoundrel, and told him to tell Katerina Ivanovna so, if it could be any comfort to her.", " He went to consult the Moscow doctor who had been sent for by Katerina Ivanovna just before the trial. And just at that time his relations with Katerina Ivanovna became acutely strained. They were like two enemies in love with one another. Katerina Ivanovna\u2019s \u201creturns\u201d to Mitya, that is, her brief but violent revulsions of feeling in his favor, drove Ivan to perfect frenzy. Strange to say, until that last scene described above, when Alyosha came from Mitya to Katerina Ivanovna, Ivan had never once, during that month, heard her express a doubt of Mitya\u2019s guilt, in spite of those \u201creturns\u201d that were so hateful to him. It is remarkable, too, that while he felt that he hated Mitya more and more every day, he realized that it was not on account of Katya\u2019s \u201creturns\u201d that he hated him, but just _because he was the murderer of his father_. He was conscious of this and fully recognized it to himself.", " There was something positively mysterious in it, too. Ivan had made a step towards him, which was what Alyosha had been long desiring. Yet now he felt for some reason that he was frightened at it. And these women? Strange to say, that morning he had set out for Katerina Ivanovna\u2019s in the greatest embarrassment; now he felt nothing of the kind. On the contrary, he was hastening there as though expecting to find guidance from her. Yet to give her this message was obviously more difficult than before. The matter of the three thousand was decided irrevocably, and Dmitri, feeling himself dishonored and losing his last hope, might sink to any depth. He had, moreover, told him to describe to Katerina Ivanovna the scene which had just taken place with his father. It was by now seven o\u2019clock, and it was getting dark as Alyosha entered the very spacious and convenient house in the High Street occupied by Katerina Ivanovna."], "To whom does Alyoshabecome engaged?": [" No, now he\u2019s saving his soul! Why have you put that long gown on him? If he runs he\u2019ll fall.\u201d And suddenly she hid her face in her hand and went off into irresistible, prolonged, nervous, inaudible laughter. The elder listened to her with a smile, and blessed her tenderly. As she kissed his hand she suddenly pressed it to her eyes and began crying. \u201cDon\u2019t be angry with me. I\u2019m silly and good for nothing ... and perhaps Alyosha\u2019s right, quite right, in not wanting to come and see such a ridiculous girl.\u201d \u201cI will certainly send him,\u201d said the elder. Chapter V. So Be It! So Be It! The elder\u2019s absence from his cell had lasted for about twenty\u2010five minutes. It was more than half\u2010past twelve, but Dmitri, on whose account they had all met there, had still not appeared. But he seemed almost to be forgotten, and when the elder entered the cell again, he found his guests engaged in eager conversation.", " He had received from Smerdyakov that morning an assurance \u201cthat she had promised to come without fail.\u201d The incorrigible old man\u2019s heart throbbed with excitement; he paced up and down his empty rooms listening. He had to be on the alert. Dmitri might be on the watch for her somewhere, and when she knocked on the window (Smerdyakov had informed him two days before that he had told her where and how to knock) the door must be opened at once. She must not be a second in the passage, for fear\u2014which God forbid!\u2014that she should be frightened and run away. Fyodor Pavlovitch had much to think of, but never had his heart been steeped in such voluptuous hopes. This time he could say almost certainly that she would come! Book VI. The Russian Monk Chapter I. Father Zossima And His Visitors When with an anxious and aching heart Alyosha went into his elder\u2019s cell, he stood still almost astonished. Instead of a sick man at his last gasp, perhaps unconscious, as he had feared to find him, he saw him sitting up in his chair and, though weak and exhausted, his face was bright and cheerful, he was surrounded by visitors and engaged in a quiet and joyful conversation.", " The charming young man was a great adept at such teasing; the ladies had christened him \u201cthe naughty man,\u201d and he seemed to be delighted at the name. He was extremely well\u2010bred, however, of good family, education and feelings, and, though leading a life of pleasure, his sallies were always innocent and in good taste. He was short, and delicate\u2010looking. On his white, slender, little fingers he always wore a number of big, glittering rings. When he was engaged in his official duties, he always became extraordinarily grave, as though realizing his position and the sanctity of the obligations laid upon him. He had a special gift for mystifying murderers and other criminals of the peasant class during interrogation, and if he did not win their respect, he certainly succeeded in arousing their wonder. Pyotr Ilyitch was simply dumbfounded when he went into the police captain\u2019s. He saw instantly that every one knew.", " I\u2019ll inquire whether Grushenka\u2019s there and instantly be back here again, stay till eleven, and then to Samsonov\u2019s again to bring her home.\u201d This was what he decided. He flew home, washed, combed his hair, brushed his clothes, dressed, and went to Madame Hohlakov\u2019s. Alas! he had built his hopes on her. He had resolved to borrow three thousand from that lady. And what was more, he felt suddenly convinced that she would not refuse to lend it to him. It may be wondered why, if he felt so certain, he had not gone to her at first, one of his own sort, so to speak, instead of to Samsonov, a man he did not know, who was not of his own class, and to whom he hardly knew how to speak. But the fact was that he had never known Madame Hohlakov well, and had seen nothing of her for the last month, and that he knew she could not endure him. She had detested him from the first because he was engaged to Katerina Ivanovna, while she had, for some reason, suddenly conceived the desire that Katerina Ivanovna should throw him over, and marry the \u201ccharming, chivalrously refined Ivan, who had such excellent manners.\u201d Mitya\u2019s manners she detested."], "What does FyodorPavlovich offer Grushenka if she chooses him over Dmitri?": [" He rushed up to him. \u201cExcuse me, you see ... I ... you\u2019ve most likely heard from the forester here in the hut. I\u2019m Lieutenant Dmitri Karamazov, the son of the old Karamazov whose copse you are buying.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a lie!\u201d said the peasant, calmly and confidently. \u201cA lie? You know Fyodor Pavlovitch?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know any of your Fyodor Pavlovitches,\u201d said the peasant, speaking thickly. \u201cYou\u2019re bargaining with him for the copse, for the copse. Do wake up, and collect yourself. Father Pavel of Ilyinskoe brought me here. You wrote to Samsonov, and he has sent me to you,\u201d Mitya gasped breathlessly. \u201cYou\u2019re l\u2010lying!\u201d Lyagavy blurted out again. Mitya\u2019s legs went cold. \u201cFor mercy\u2019s sake! It isn\u2019t a joke! You\u2019re drunk, perhaps. Yet you can speak and understand ... or else ... I understand nothing!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re a painter!\u201d \u201cFor mercy\u2019s sake! I\u2019m Karamazov, Dmitri Karamazov. I have an offer to make you, an advantageous offer ... very advantageous offer, concerning the copse!\u201d The peasant stroked his beard importantly.", " From some rumor, or perhaps from some stray word of Grushenka\u2019s, he had gathered further that the old man would perhaps prefer him to Fyodor Pavlovitch for Grushenka. Possibly many of the readers of my novel will feel that in reckoning on such assistance, and being ready to take his bride, so to speak, from the hands of her protector, Dmitri showed great coarseness and want of delicacy. I will only observe that Mitya looked upon Grushenka\u2019s past as something completely over. He looked on that past with infinite pity and resolved with all the fervor of his passion that when once Grushenka told him she loved him and would marry him, it would mean the beginning of a new Grushenka and a new Dmitri, free from every vice. They would forgive one another and would begin their lives afresh. As for Kuzma Samsonov, Dmitri looked upon him as a man who had exercised a fateful influence in that remote past of Grushenka\u2019s, though she had never loved him, and who was now himself a thing of the past, completely done with, and, so to say, non\u2010existent.", " \u201cDid he say it to you alone once, or several times?\u201d inquired the prosecutor, and learned that he had told Grushenka so several times. Ippolit Kirillovitch was very well satisfied with this piece of evidence. Further examination elicited that Grushenka knew, too, where that money had come from, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had got it from Katerina Ivanovna. \u201cAnd did you never, once, hear that the money spent a month ago was not three thousand, but less, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had saved half that sum for his own use?\u201d \u201cNo, I never heard that,\u201d answered Grushenka. It was explained further that Mitya had, on the contrary, often told her that he hadn\u2019t a farthing. \u201cHe was always expecting to get some from his father,\u201d said Grushenka in conclusion. \u201cDid he never say before you ... casually, or in a moment of irritation,\u201d Nikolay Parfenovitch put in suddenly, \u201cthat he intended to make an attempt on his father\u2019s life?\u201d \u201cAch, he did say so,\u201d sighed Grushenka.", " He suspected, quite correctly, that she, too, was passing through an inward struggle, and was in a state of extraordinary indecision, that she was making up her mind to something, and unable to determine upon it. And so, not without good reason, he divined, with a sinking heart, that at moments she must simply hate him and his passion. And so, perhaps, it was, but what was distressing Grushenka he did not understand. For him the whole tormenting question lay between him and Fyodor Pavlovitch. Here, we must note, by the way, one certain fact: he was firmly persuaded that Fyodor Pavlovitch would offer, or perhaps had offered, Grushenka lawful wedlock, and did not for a moment believe that the old voluptuary hoped to gain his object for three thousand roubles. Mitya had reached this conclusion from his knowledge of Grushenka and her character. That was how it was that he could believe at times that all Grushenka\u2019s uneasiness rose from not knowing which of them to choose, which was most to her advantage."], "Who tells Dmitriabout Grushenka\u2019s secret knock?": [" \u201cSet my mind at rest that I may know the worst that\u2019s in store for me.

Horses were being taken out of the shafts, men were running to and fro with a lantern. Three fresh horses were being led in at the open gate. But when Alyosha and Rakitin reached the bottom of the steps, Grushenka\u2019s bedroom window was suddenly opened and she called in a ringing voice after Alyosha: \u201cAlyosha, give my greetings to your brother Mitya and tell him not to remember evil against me, though I have brought him misery. And tell him, too, in my words: \u2018Grushenka has fallen to a scoundrel, and not to you, noble heart.\u2019 And add, too, that Grushenka loved him only one hour, only one short hour she loved him\u2014so let him remember that hour all his life\u2014say, \u2018Grushenka tells you to!\u2019 \u201d She ended in a voice full of sobs. The window was shut with a slam. \u201cH\u2019m, h\u2019m!\u201d growled Rakitin, laughing, \u201cshe murders your brother Mitya and then tells him to remember it all his life!", " Going up to the gate he knocked. The sound of the knock in the silence of the night sobered him and made him feel annoyed. And no one answered him; every one in the house was asleep. \u201cAnd I shall be making a fuss!\u201d he thought, with a feeling of positive discomfort. But instead of going away altogether, he fell to knocking again with all his might, filling the street with clamor. \u201cNot coming? Well, I will knock them up, I will!\u201d he muttered at each knock, fuming at himself, but at the same time he redoubled his knocks on the gate. Chapter VI. \u201cI Am Coming, Too!\u201d But Dmitri Fyodorovitch was speeding along the road. It was a little more than twenty versts to Mokroe, but Andrey\u2019s three horses galloped at such a pace that the distance might be covered in an hour and a quarter. The swift motion revived Mitya. The air was fresh and cool, there were big stars shining in the sky. It was the very night, and perhaps the very hour, in which Alyosha fell on the earth, and rapturously swore to love it for ever and ever.", " \u201cStay, Alyosha, hush! Since I\u2019ve said so much I\u2019ll tell the whole truth\u2014he\u2019s been to see him twice, the first directly he arrived. He galloped here from Moscow at once, of course, before I was taken ill; and the second time was a week ago. He told Mitya not to tell you about it, under any circumstances; and not to tell any one, in fact. He came secretly.\u201d Alyosha sat plunged in thought, considering something. The news evidently impressed him. \u201cIvan doesn\u2019t talk to me of Mitya\u2019s case,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cHe\u2019s said very little to me these last two months. And whenever I go to see him, he seems vexed at my coming, so I\u2019ve not been to him for the last three weeks. H\u2019m!... if he was there a week ago ... there certainly has been a change in Mitya this week.\u201d \u201cThere has been a change,\u201d Grushenka assented quickly. \u201cThey have a secret, they have a secret! Mitya told me himself there was a secret, and such a secret that Mitya can\u2019t rest."], "What does Kolyaclaim as his political affiliation?": [" But he\u2019s always besought me not to tell any one here of it, he is so dreadfully ashamed of me.\u201d This fact was a complete surprise to every one; no one in the town nor in the monastery, not even Mitya, knew of it. I was told that Rakitin turned purple with shame where he sat. Grushenka had somehow heard before she came into the court that he had given evidence against Mitya, and so she was angry. The whole effect on the public, of Rakitin\u2019s speech, of his noble sentiments, of his attacks upon serfdom and the political disorder of Russia, was this time finally ruined. Fetyukovitch was satisfied: it was another godsend. Grushenka\u2019s cross\u2010examination did not last long and, of course, there could be nothing particularly new in her evidence. She left a very disagreeable impression on the public; hundreds of contemptuous eyes were fixed upon her, as she finished giving her evidence and sat down again in the court, at a good distance from Katerina Ivanovna.", " \u201cLeave everything, especially women. Gold\u2010mines are your goal, and there\u2019s no place for women there. Afterwards, when you come back rich and famous, you will find the girl of your heart in the highest society. That will be a modern girl, a girl of education and advanced ideas. By that time the dawning woman question will have gained ground, and the new woman will have appeared.\u201d \u201cMadam, that\u2019s not the point, not at all....\u201d Mitya clasped his hands in entreaty. \u201cYes, it is, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, just what you need; the very thing you\u2019re yearning for, though you don\u2019t realize it yourself. I am not at all opposed to the present woman movement, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. The development of woman, and even the political emancipation of woman in the near future\u2014that\u2019s my ideal. I\u2019ve a daughter myself, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, people don\u2019t know that side of me. I wrote a letter to the author, Shtchedrin, on that subject.", " There were two of us, my elder brother Markel and I. He was eight years older than I was, of hasty irritable temperament, but kind\u2010hearted and never ironical. He was remarkably silent, especially at home with me, his mother, and the servants. He did well at school, but did not get on with his schoolfellows, though he never quarreled, at least so my mother has told me. Six months before his death, when he was seventeen, he made friends with a political exile who had been banished from Moscow to our town for freethinking, and led a solitary existence there. He was a good scholar who had gained distinction in philosophy in the university. Something made him take a fancy to Markel, and he used to ask him to see him. The young man would spend whole evenings with him during that winter, till the exile was summoned to Petersburg to take up his post again at his own request, as he had powerful friends.", " \u201cAllow me to tell you one little anecdote, gentlemen,\u201d Mi\u00fcsov said impressively, with a peculiarly majestic air. \u201cSome years ago, soon after the _coup d\u2019\u00e9tat_ of December, I happened to be calling in Paris on an extremely influential personage in the Government, and I met a very interesting man in his house. This individual was not precisely a detective but was a sort of superintendent of a whole regiment of political detectives\u2014a rather powerful position in its own way. I was prompted by curiosity to seize the opportunity of conversation with him. And as he had not come as a visitor but as a subordinate official bringing a special report, and as he saw the reception given me by his chief, he deigned to speak with some openness, to a certain extent only, of course. He was rather courteous than open, as Frenchmen know how to be courteous, especially to a foreigner. But I thoroughly understood him."], "Who brings Zuchkato Ilyusha\u2019s bedside?": [" But he evidently did not want to break up the party. He seemed to have some special object of his own in keeping them. What object? Alyosha watched him intently. \u201cWe are discussing this gentleman\u2019s most interesting article,\u201d said Father Iosif, the librarian, addressing the elder, and indicating Ivan. \u201cHe brings forward much that is new, but I think the argument cuts both ways. It is an article written in answer to a book by an ecclesiastical authority on the question of the ecclesiastical court, and the scope of its jurisdiction.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry I have not read your article, but I\u2019ve heard of it,\u201d said the elder, looking keenly and intently at Ivan. \u201cHe takes up a most interesting position,\u201d continued the Father Librarian. \u201cAs far as Church jurisdiction is concerned he is apparently quite opposed to the separation of Church from State.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s interesting. But in what sense?\u201d Father Zossima asked Ivan.", " \u201cOne reptile will devour the other. And serve them both right, too.\u201d Alyosha shuddered. \u201cOf course I won\u2019t let him be murdered as I didn\u2019t just now. Stay here, Alyosha, I\u2019ll go for a turn in the yard. My head\u2019s begun to ache.\u201d Alyosha went to his father\u2019s bedroom and sat by his bedside behind the screen for about an hour. The old man suddenly opened his eyes and gazed for a long while at Alyosha, evidently remembering and meditating. All at once his face betrayed extraordinary excitement. \u201cAlyosha,\u201d he whispered apprehensively, \u201cwhere\u2019s Ivan?\u201d \u201cIn the yard. He\u2019s got a headache. He\u2019s on the watch.\u201d \u201cGive me that looking\u2010glass. It stands over there. Give it me.\u201d Alyosha gave him a little round folding looking\u2010glass which stood on the chest of drawers.

I\u2019ll go in first and explore, then I\u2019ll whistle to him when I think fit, and you\u2019ll see, he\u2019ll dash in like mad. Only Smurov must not forget to open the door at the moment.

Several boys were sitting with Ilusha, and though all of them, like Smurov, were prepared to deny that it was Alyosha who had brought them and reconciled them with Ilusha, it was really the fact.", " We know all about them. A kiss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller\u2019s _Robbers_. I don\u2019t like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the truth is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclaim aloud! Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will come and fast too! No, saintly monk, you try being virtuous in the world, do good to society, without shutting yourself up in a monastery at other people\u2019s expense, and without expecting a reward up aloft for it\u2014you\u2019ll find that a bit harder. I can talk sense, too, Father Superior. What have they got here?\u201d He went up to the table. \u201cOld port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers. Fie, fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have brought out, he he he! And who has provided it all?

In fact, there was something strikingly birdlike about his face. He was in evening dress and white tie. I remember the President\u2019s first questions to Mitya, about his name, his calling, and so on. Mitya answered sharply, and his voice was so unexpectedly loud that it made the President start and look at the prisoner with surprise. Then followed a list of persons who were to take part in the proceedings\u2014that is, of the witnesses and experts. It was a long list. Four of the witnesses were not present\u2014Mi\u00fcsov, who had given evidence at the preliminary inquiry, but was now in Paris; Madame Hohlakov and Maximov, who were absent through illness; and Smerdyakov, through his sudden death, of which an official statement from the police was presented.", " \u201cShall I tell it to you?\u201d \u201cI am all attention,\u201d said Alyosha. \u201cMy poem is called \u2018The Grand Inquisitor\u2019; it\u2019s a ridiculous thing, but I want to tell it to you.\u201d Chapter V. The Grand Inquisitor \u201cEven this must have a preface\u2014that is, a literary preface,\u201d laughed Ivan, \u201cand I am a poor hand at making one. You see, my action takes place in the sixteenth century, and at that time, as you probably learnt at school, it was customary in poetry to bring down heavenly powers on earth. Not to speak of Dante, in France, clerks, as well as the monks in the monasteries, used to give regular performances in which the Madonna, the saints, the angels, Christ, and God himself were brought on the stage. In those days it was done in all simplicity. In Victor Hugo\u2019s _Notre Dame de Paris_ an edifying and gratuitous spectacle was provided for the people in the H\u00f4tel de Ville of Paris in the reign of Louis XI.", " He sees everything; he sees them set the coffin down at His feet, sees the child rise up, and his face darkens. He knits his thick gray brows and his eyes gleam with a sinister fire. He holds out his finger and bids the guards take Him. And such is his power, so completely are the people cowed into submission and trembling obedience to him, that the crowd immediately makes way for the guards, and in the midst of deathlike silence they lay hands on Him and lead Him away. The crowd instantly bows down to the earth, like one man, before the old Inquisitor. He blesses the people in silence and passes on. The guards lead their prisoner to the close, gloomy vaulted prison in the ancient palace of the Holy Inquisition and shut Him in it. The day passes and is followed by the dark, burning, \u2018breathless\u2019 night of Seville.

Andrey, coughing from the brandy he had just swallowed, jumped up on the box. But Mitya was only just taking his seat when suddenly to his surprise he saw Fenya before him.

It was about that plan of escape. He had told me the main idea three days before, and we began quarreling about it at once and quarreled for three days. We quarreled because, when he told me that if Dmitri Fyodorovitch were convicted he would escape abroad with that creature, I felt furious at once\u2014I can\u2019t tell you why, I don\u2019t know myself why.... Oh, of course, I was furious then about that creature, and that she, too, should go abroad with Dmitri!\u201d Katerina Ivanovna exclaimed suddenly, her lips quivering with anger. \u201cAs soon as Ivan Fyodorovitch saw that I was furious about that woman, he instantly imagined I was jealous of Dmitri and that I still loved Dmitri. That is how our first quarrel began. I would not give an explanation, I could not ask forgiveness.

Alyosha had unquestioning faith in the miraculous power of the elder, just as he had unquestioning faith in the story of the coffin that flew out of the church. He saw many who came with sick children or relatives and besought the elder to lay hands on them and to pray over them, return shortly after\u2014some the next day\u2014and, falling in tears at the elder\u2019s feet, thank him for healing their sick. Whether they had really been healed or were simply better in the natural course of the disease was a question which did not exist for Alyosha, for he fully believed in the spiritual power of his teacher and rejoiced in his fame, in his glory, as though it were his own triumph.", " He educated them both at his own expense, and certainly spent far more than a thousand roubles upon each of them. I won\u2019t enter into a detailed account of their boyhood and youth, but will only mention a few of the most important events. Of the elder, Ivan, I will only say that he grew into a somewhat morose and reserved, though far from timid boy. At ten years old he had realized that they were living not in their own home but on other people\u2019s charity, and that their father was a man of whom it was disgraceful to speak. This boy began very early, almost in his infancy (so they say at least), to show a brilliant and unusual aptitude for learning. I don\u2019t know precisely why, but he left the family of Yefim Petrovitch when he was hardly thirteen, entering a Moscow gymnasium, and boarding with an experienced and celebrated teacher, an old friend of Yefim Petrovitch. Ivan used to declare afterwards that this was all due to the \u201cardor for good works\u201d of Yefim Petrovitch, who was captivated by the idea that the boy\u2019s genius should be trained by a teacher of genius.", " No, now he\u2019s saving his soul! Why have you put that long gown on him? If he runs he\u2019ll fall.\u201d And suddenly she hid her face in her hand and went off into irresistible, prolonged, nervous, inaudible laughter. The elder listened to her with a smile, and blessed her tenderly. As she kissed his hand she suddenly pressed it to her eyes and began crying. \u201cDon\u2019t be angry with me. I\u2019m silly and good for nothing ... and perhaps Alyosha\u2019s right, quite right, in not wanting to come and see such a ridiculous girl.\u201d \u201cI will certainly send him,\u201d said the elder. Chapter V. So Be It! So Be It! The elder\u2019s absence from his cell had lasted for about twenty\u2010five minutes. It was more than half\u2010past twelve, but Dmitri, on whose account they had all met there, had still not appeared. But he seemed almost to be forgotten, and when the elder entered the cell again, he found his guests engaged in eager conversation.", " \u201cAmong us there is sin, injustice, and temptation, but yet, somewhere on earth there is some one holy and exalted. He has the truth; he knows the truth; so it is not dead upon the earth; so it will come one day to us, too, and rule over all the earth according to the promise.\u201d Alyosha knew that this was just how the people felt and even reasoned. He understood it, but that the elder Zossima was this saint and custodian of God\u2019s truth\u2014of that he had no more doubt than the weeping peasants and the sick women who held out their children to the elder. The conviction that after his death the elder would bring extraordinary glory to the monastery was even stronger in Alyosha than in any one there, and, of late, a kind of deep flame of inner ecstasy burnt more and more strongly in his heart. He was not at all troubled at this elder\u2019s standing as a solitary example before him. \u201cNo matter. He is holy."], "What single injusticetroubles Ivan most?": [" \u201cYou\u2019ll be too much ashamed, if you confess it all.

And who will believe you, and what single proof have you got?\u201d \u201cListen, you showed me those notes just now to convince me.\u201d Smerdyakov lifted the book off the notes and laid it on one side. \u201cTake that money away with you,\u201d Smerdyakov sighed. \u201cOf course, I shall take it. But why do you give it to me, if you committed the murder for the sake of it?\u201d Ivan looked at him with great surprise. \u201cI don\u2019t want it,\u201d Smerdyakov articulated in a shaking voice, with a gesture of refusal. \u201cI did have an idea of beginning a new life with that money in Moscow or, better still, abroad.", " Intense, infinite compassion overwhelmed him instantly. There was a poignant ache in his torn heart. \u201cLove Ivan!\u201d\u2014he suddenly recalled Mitya\u2019s words. And he was going to Ivan. He badly wanted to see Ivan all day. He was as much worried about Ivan as about Mitya, and more than ever now. Chapter V. Not You, Not You! On the way to Ivan he had to pass the house where Katerina Ivanovna was living. There was light in the windows. He suddenly stopped and resolved to go in. He had not seen Katerina Ivanovna for more than a week. But now it struck him that Ivan might be with her, especially on the eve of the terrible day. Ringing, and mounting the staircase, which was dimly lighted by a Chinese lantern, he saw a man coming down, and as they met, he recognized him as his brother. So he was just coming from Katerina Ivanovna. \u201cAh, it\u2019s only you,\u201d said Ivan dryly. \u201cWell, good\u2010by! You are going to her?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t advise you to; she\u2019s upset and you\u2019ll upset her more.\u201d A door was instantly flung open above, and a voice cried suddenly: \u201cNo, no!", " And Katerina Ivanovna will not in the end refuse such a fascinating man as Ivan. She\u2019s hesitating between the two of them already. And how has that Ivan won you all, so that you all worship him? He is laughing at you, and enjoying himself at your expense.\u201d \u201cHow do you know? How can you speak so confidently?\u201d Alyosha asked sharply, frowning. \u201cWhy do you ask, and are frightened at my answer? It shows that you know I\u2019m speaking the truth.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t like Ivan. Ivan wouldn\u2019t be tempted by money.\u201d \u201cReally? And the beauty of Katerina Ivanovna? It\u2019s not only the money, though a fortune of sixty thousand is an attraction.\u201d \u201cIvan is above that. He wouldn\u2019t make up to any one for thousands. It is not money, it\u2019s not comfort Ivan is seeking. Perhaps it\u2019s suffering he is seeking.\u201d \u201cWhat wild dream now? Oh, you\u2014aristocrats!\u201d \u201cAh, Misha, he has a stormy spirit. His mind is in bondage.

Kill me now,\u201d Smerdyakov said, all at once looking strangely at Ivan. \u201cYou won\u2019t dare do that even!\u201d he added, with a bitter smile. \u201cYou won\u2019t dare to do anything, you, who used to be so bold!\u201d \u201cTill to\u2010morrow,\u201d cried Ivan, and moved to go out. \u201cStay a moment.... Show me those notes again.\u201d Ivan took out the notes and showed them to him. Smerdyakov looked at them for ten seconds. \u201cWell, you can go,\u201d he said, with a wave of his hand. \u201cIvan Fyodorovitch!\u201d he called after him again. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Ivan turned without stopping. \u201cGood\u2010by!\u201d \u201cTill to\u2010morrow!\u201d Ivan cried again, and he walked out of the cottage. The snowstorm was still raging. He walked the first few steps boldly, but suddenly began staggering. \u201cIt\u2019s something physical,\u201d he thought with a grin."], "Who raises Smerdyakov?": [" \u201cAnd you don\u2019t even suspect him?\u201d \u201cWhy, do you suspect him?\u201d \u201cHe is suspected, too.\u201d Mitya fixed his eyes on the floor. \u201cJoking apart,\u201d he brought out gloomily. \u201cListen. From the very beginning, almost from the moment when I ran out to you from behind the curtain, I\u2019ve had the thought of Smerdyakov in my mind. I\u2019ve been sitting here, shouting that I\u2019m innocent and thinking all the time \u2018Smerdyakov!\u2019 I can\u2019t get Smerdyakov out of my head. In fact, I, too, thought of Smerdyakov just now; but only for a second. Almost at once I thought, \u2018No, it\u2019s not Smerdyakov.\u2019 It\u2019s not his doing, gentlemen.\u201d \u201cIn that case is there anybody else you suspect?\u201d Nikolay Parfenovitch inquired cautiously. \u201cI don\u2019t know any one it could be, whether it\u2019s the hand of Heaven or Satan, but ... not Smerdyakov,\u201d Mitya jerked out with decision. \u201cBut what makes you affirm so confidently and emphatically that it\u2019s not he?\u201d \u201cFrom my conviction\u2014my impression.", " But in the left eye, which was screwed up and seemed to be insinuating something, Smerdyakov showed himself unchanged. \u201cIt\u2019s always worth while speaking to a clever man.\u201d Ivan was reminded of that at once. He sat down on the stool at his feet. Smerdyakov, with painful effort, shifted his position in bed, but he was not the first to speak. He remained dumb, and did not even look much interested. \u201cCan you talk to me?\u201d asked Ivan. \u201cI won\u2019t tire you much.\u201d \u201cCertainly I can,\u201d mumbled Smerdyakov, in a faint voice. \u201cHas your honor been back long?\u201d he added patronizingly, as though encouraging a nervous visitor. \u201cI only arrived to\u2010day.... To see the mess you are in here.\u201d Smerdyakov sighed. \u201cWhy do you sigh? You knew of it all along,\u201d Ivan blurted out. Smerdyakov was stolidly silent for a while. \u201cHow could I help knowing? It was clear beforehand. But how could I tell it would turn out like that?\u201d \u201cWhat would turn out?", " God raises Job again, gives him wealth again. Many years pass by, and he has other children and loves them. But how could he love those new ones when those first children are no more, when he has lost them? Remembering them, how could he be fully happy with those new ones, however dear the new ones might be? But he could, he could. It\u2019s the great mystery of human life that old grief passes gradually into quiet, tender joy. The mild serenity of age takes the place of the riotous blood of youth. I bless the rising sun each day, and, as before, my hearts sings to meet it, but now I love even more its setting, its long slanting rays and the soft, tender, gentle memories that come with them, the dear images from the whole of my long, happy life\u2014and over all the Divine Truth, softening, reconciling, forgiving! My life is ending, I know that well, but every day that is left me I feel how my earthly life is in touch with a new infinite, unknown, that approaching life, the nearness of which sets my soul quivering with rapture, my mind glowing and my heart weeping with joy.", " But of that later.... When, after his conversation with Alyosha, Ivan suddenly decided with his hand on the bell of his lodging to go to Smerdyakov, he obeyed a sudden and peculiar impulse of indignation. He suddenly remembered how Katerina Ivanovna had only just cried out to him in Alyosha\u2019s presence: \u201cIt was you, you, persuaded me of his\u201d (that is, Mitya\u2019s) \u201cguilt!\u201d Ivan was thunderstruck when he recalled it. He had never once tried to persuade her that Mitya was the murderer; on the contrary, he had suspected himself in her presence, that time when he came back from Smerdyakov. It was _she_, she, who had produced that \u201cdocument\u201d and proved his brother\u2019s guilt. And now she suddenly exclaimed: \u201cI\u2019ve been at Smerdyakov\u2019s myself!\u201d When had she been there? Ivan had known nothing of it. So she was not at all so sure of Mitya\u2019s guilt! And what could Smerdyakov have told her? What, what, had he said to her?"], "Who introducesAlyosha to Grushenka?": [" \u201cDid he say it to you alone once, or several times?\u201d inquired the prosecutor, and learned that he had told Grushenka so several times. Ippolit Kirillovitch was very well satisfied with this piece of evidence. Further examination elicited that Grushenka knew, too, where that money had come from, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had got it from Katerina Ivanovna. \u201cAnd did you never, once, hear that the money spent a month ago was not three thousand, but less, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had saved half that sum for his own use?\u201d \u201cNo, I never heard that,\u201d answered Grushenka. It was explained further that Mitya had, on the contrary, often told her that he hadn\u2019t a farthing. \u201cHe was always expecting to get some from his father,\u201d said Grushenka in conclusion. \u201cDid he never say before you ... casually, or in a moment of irritation,\u201d Nikolay Parfenovitch put in suddenly, \u201cthat he intended to make an attempt on his father\u2019s life?\u201d \u201cAch, he did say so,\u201d sighed Grushenka.", " From some rumor, or perhaps from some stray word of Grushenka\u2019s, he had gathered further that the old man would perhaps prefer him to Fyodor Pavlovitch for Grushenka. Possibly many of the readers of my novel will feel that in reckoning on such assistance, and being ready to take his bride, so to speak, from the hands of her protector, Dmitri showed great coarseness and want of delicacy. I will only observe that Mitya looked upon Grushenka\u2019s past as something completely over. He looked on that past with infinite pity and resolved with all the fervor of his passion that when once Grushenka told him she loved him and would marry him, it would mean the beginning of a new Grushenka and a new Dmitri, free from every vice. They would forgive one another and would begin their lives afresh. As for Kuzma Samsonov, Dmitri looked upon him as a man who had exercised a fateful influence in that remote past of Grushenka\u2019s, though she had never loved him, and who was now himself a thing of the past, completely done with, and, so to say, non\u2010existent.", " Grushenka was not even mentioned in his will. All this became known afterwards. He helped Grushenka with his advice to increase her capital and put business in her way. When Fyodor Pavlovitch, who first came into contact with Grushenka over a piece of speculation, ended to his own surprise by falling madly in love with her, old Samsonov, gravely ill as he was, was immensely amused. It is remarkable that throughout their whole acquaintance Grushenka was absolutely and spontaneously open with the old man, and he seems to have been the only person in the world with whom she was so. Of late, when Dmitri too had come on the scene with his love, the old man left off laughing. On the contrary, he once gave Grushenka a stern and earnest piece of advice. \u201cIf you have to choose between the two, father or son, you\u2019d better choose the old man, if only you make sure the old scoundrel will marry you and settle some fortune on you beforehand.", " He lost everything, his estate and all, and the proud wife had to lower her colors, and hasn\u2019t raised them since. So she tried to prevent Katya, but she wouldn\u2019t listen to her! She thinks she can overcome everything, that everything will give way to her. She thought she could bewitch Grushenka if she liked, and she believed it herself: she plays a part to herself, and whose fault is it? Do you think she kissed Grushenka\u2019s hand first, on purpose, with a motive? No, she really was fascinated by Grushenka, that\u2019s to say, not by Grushenka, but by her own dream, her own delusion\u2014because it was _her_ dream, _her_ delusion! Alyosha, darling, how did you escape from them, those women? Did you pick up your cassock and run? Ha ha ha!\u201d \u201cBrother, you don\u2019t seem to have noticed how you\u2019ve insulted Katerina Ivanovna by telling Grushenka about that day. And she flung it in her face just now that she had gone to gentlemen in secret to sell her beauty!"], "Who exhibitsthe letter at Dmitri\u2019s trial?": [" \u201cYes, the trial\u2019s to\u2010morrow. Are you so hopeless, brother?\u201d Alyosha said, with an apprehensive feeling. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d said Mitya, looking at him rather uncertainly. \u201cOh, you mean the trial! Damn it all! Till now we\u2019ve been talking of things that don\u2019t matter, about this trial, but I haven\u2019t said a word to you about the chief thing. Yes, the trial is to\u2010morrow; but it wasn\u2019t the trial I meant, when I said it was all over with me. Why do you look at me so critically?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean, Mitya?\u201d \u201cIdeas, ideas, that\u2019s all! Ethics! What is ethics?\u201d \u201cEthics?\u201d asked Alyosha, wondering. \u201cYes; is it a science?\u201d \u201cYes, there is such a science ... but ... I confess I can\u2019t explain to you what sort of science it is.\u201d \u201cRakitin knows. Rakitin knows a lot, damn him! He\u2019s not going to be a monk. He means to go to Petersburg. There he\u2019ll go in for criticism of an elevating tendency. Who knows, he may be of use and make his own career, too.", " Worse and better than all! Alyosha, I am awfully fond of you. Just before you came this morning, I tried my fortune. I decided I would ask you for my letter, and if you brought it out calmly and gave it to me (as might have been expected from you) it would mean that you did not love me at all, that you felt nothing, and were simply a stupid boy, good for nothing, and that I am ruined. But you left the letter at home and that cheered me. You left it behind on purpose, so as not to give it back, because you knew I would ask for it? That was it, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cAh, Lise, it was not so a bit. The letter is with me now, and it was this morning, in this pocket. Here it is.\u201d Alyosha pulled the letter out laughing, and showed it her at a distance. \u201cBut I am not going to give it to you. Look at it from here.\u201d \u201cWhy, then you told a lie? You, a monk, told a lie!\u201d \u201cI told a lie if you like,\u201d Alyosha laughed, too.", " I paved the way to that hideous scene at the trial. He wanted to show me that he was an honorable man, and that, even if I loved his brother, he would not ruin him for revenge or jealousy. So he came to the court ... I am the cause of it all, I alone am to blame!\u201d Katya never had made such confessions to Alyosha before, and he felt that she was now at that stage of unbearable suffering when even the proudest heart painfully crushes its pride and falls vanquished by grief. Oh, Alyosha knew another terrible reason of her present misery, though she had carefully concealed it from him during those days since the trial; but it would have been for some reason too painful to him if she had been brought so low as to speak to him now about that. She was suffering for her \u201ctreachery\u201d at the trial, and Alyosha felt that her conscience was impelling her to confess it to him, to him, Alyosha, with tears and cries and hysterical writhings on the floor.", " He afterwards forgave her on account of her ignorance, and added, \u201cas though reading the book of the future\u201d (this was Madame Hohlakov\u2019s expression), words of comfort: \u201cthat her son Vassya was certainly alive and he would either come himself very shortly or send a letter, and that she was to go home and expect him.\u201d And \u201cWould you believe it?\u201d exclaimed Madame Hohlakov enthusiastically, \u201cthe prophecy has been fulfilled literally indeed, and more than that.\u201d Scarcely had the old woman reached home when they gave her a letter from Siberia which had been awaiting her. But that was not all; in the letter written on the road from Ekaterinenburg, Vassya informed his mother that he was returning to Russia with an official, and that three weeks after her receiving the letter he hoped \u201cto embrace his mother.\u201d Madame Hohlakov warmly entreated Alyosha to report this new \u201cmiracle of prediction\u201d to the Superior and all the brotherhood."], "Who slams herown hand in the door?": [" A romance! Poetry! As though one could believe a fellow on his word. Ha ha! You are scoffers, gentlemen!\u201d And he swung round on his chair so that it creaked. \u201cAnd did you notice,\u201d asked the prosecutor suddenly, as though not observing Mitya\u2019s excitement, \u201cdid you notice when you ran away from the window, whether the door into the garden was open?\u201d \u201cNo, it was not open.\u201d \u201cIt was not?\u201d \u201cIt was shut. And who could open it? Bah! the door. Wait a bit!\u201d he seemed suddenly to bethink himself, and almost with a start: \u201cWhy, did you find the door open?\u201d \u201cYes, it was open.\u201d \u201cWhy, who could have opened it if you did not open it yourselves?\u201d cried Mitya, greatly astonished. \u201cThe door stood open, and your father\u2019s murderer undoubtedly went in at that door, and, having accomplished the crime, went out again by the same door,\u201d the prosecutor pronounced deliberately, as though chiseling out each word separately.", " \u201cThey are fond of him, they are doing their best for him,\u201d thought Alyosha. \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d At last he found the house in Lake Street. It was a decrepit little house, sunk on one side, with three windows looking into the street, and with a muddy yard, in the middle of which stood a solitary cow. He crossed the yard and found the door opening into the passage. On the left of the passage lived the old woman of the house with her old daughter. Both seemed to be deaf. In answer to his repeated inquiry for the captain, one of them at last understood that he was asking for their lodgers, and pointed to a door across the passage. The captain\u2019s lodging turned out to be a simple cottage room. Alyosha had his hand on the iron latch to open the door, when he was struck by the strange hush within. Yet he knew from Katerina Ivanovna\u2019s words that the man had a family. \u201cEither they are all asleep or perhaps they have heard me coming and are waiting for me to open the door.", " Alyosha went, opened the door, and reported that no one was listening. \u201cCome here, Alexey Fyodorovitch,\u201d Lise went on, flushing redder and redder. \u201cGive me your hand\u2014that\u2019s right. I have to make a great confession, I didn\u2019t write to you yesterday in joke, but in earnest,\u201d and she hid her eyes with her hand. It was evident that she was greatly ashamed of the confession. Suddenly she snatched his hand and impulsively kissed it three times. \u201cAh, Lise, what a good thing!\u201d cried Alyosha joyfully. \u201cYou know, I was perfectly sure you were in earnest.\u201d \u201cSure? Upon my word!\u201d She put aside his hand, but did not leave go of it, blushing hotly, and laughing a little happy laugh. \u201cI kiss his hand and he says, \u2018What a good thing!\u2019 \u201d But her reproach was undeserved. Alyosha, too, was greatly overcome. \u201cI should like to please you always, Lise, but I don\u2019t know how to do it,\u201d he muttered, blushing too. \u201cAlyosha, dear, you are cold and rude.", " But it\u2019s his doing, his doing; there\u2019s no doubt about it, he murdered him, that\u2019s as clear as daylight now,\u201d Mitya exclaimed more and more frantically, repeating himself incoherently, and growing more and more exasperated and excited. \u201cYou must understand that, and arrest him at once.... He must have killed him while I was running away and while Grigory was unconscious, that\u2019s clear now.... He gave the signal and father opened to him ... for no one but he knew the signal, and without the signal father would never have opened the door....\u201d \u201cBut you\u2019re again forgetting the circumstance,\u201d the prosecutor observed, still speaking with the same restraint, though with a note of triumph, \u201cthat there was no need to give the signal if the door already stood open when you were there, while you were in the garden....\u201d \u201cThe door, the door,\u201d muttered Mitya, and he stared speechless at the prosecutor.

She would not forgive me....

He had died two days after Mitya was sentenced.", " But I will not detail the evidence of the other witnesses, who only repeated and confirmed what had been said before, though all with their characteristic peculiarities. I repeat, all was brought together in the prosecutor\u2019s speech, which I shall quote immediately. Every one was excited, every one was electrified by the late catastrophe, and all were awaiting the speeches for the prosecution and the defense with intense impatience. Fetyukovitch was obviously shaken by Katerina Ivanovna\u2019s evidence. But the prosecutor was triumphant. When all the evidence had been taken, the court was adjourned for almost an hour. I believe it was just eight o\u2019clock when the President returned to his seat and our prosecutor, Ippolit Kirillovitch, began his speech. Chapter VI. The Prosecutor\u2019s Speech. Sketches Of Character Ippolit Kirillovitch began his speech, trembling with nervousness, with cold sweat on his forehead, feeling hot and cold all over by turns.", " During the mass Snegiryov became somewhat calmer, though at times he had outbursts of the same unconscious and, as it were, incoherent anxiety. At one moment he went up to the coffin to set straight the cover or the wreath, when a candle fell out of the candlestick he rushed to replace it and was a fearful time fumbling over it, then he subsided and stood quietly by the coffin with a look of blank uneasiness and perplexity. After the Epistle he suddenly whispered to Alyosha, who was standing beside him, that the Epistle had not been read properly but did not explain what he meant. During the prayer, \u201cLike the Cherubim,\u201d he joined in the singing but did not go on to the end. Falling on his knees, he pressed his forehead to the stone floor and lay so for a long while. At last came the funeral service itself and candles were distributed. The distracted father began fussing about again, but the touching and impressive funeral prayers moved and roused his soul.", " At one point he seemed about to jump up and cry out, but controlled himself and only shrugged his shoulders disdainfully. People talked afterwards of the end of the speech, of the prosecutor\u2019s feat in examining the prisoner at Mokroe, and jeered at Ippolit Kirillovitch. \u201cThe man could not resist boasting of his cleverness,\u201d they said. The court was adjourned, but only for a short interval, a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes at most. There was a hum of conversation and exclamations in the audience. I remember some of them. \u201cA weighty speech,\u201d a gentleman in one group observed gravely. \u201cHe brought in too much psychology,\u201d said another voice. \u201cBut it was all true, the absolute truth!\u201d \u201cYes, he is first rate at it.\u201d \u201cHe summed it all up.\u201d \u201cYes, he summed us up, too,\u201d chimed in another voice. \u201cDo you remember, at the beginning of his speech, making out we were all like Fyodor Pavlovitch?\u201d \u201cAnd at the end, too."], "When and wheredoes the Grand Inquisitor story take place?": [" \u201cShall I tell it to you?\u201d \u201cI am all attention,\u201d said Alyosha. \u201cMy poem is called \u2018The Grand Inquisitor\u2019; it\u2019s a ridiculous thing, but I want to tell it to you.\u201d Chapter V.

You see, my action takes place in the sixteenth century, and at that time, as you probably learnt at school, it was customary in poetry to bring down heavenly powers on earth. Not to speak of Dante, in France, clerks, as well as the monks in the monasteries, used to give regular performances in which the Madonna, the saints, the angels, Christ, and God himself were brought on the stage. In those days it was done in all simplicity.

The crowd instantly bows down to the earth, like one man, before the old Inquisitor. He blesses the people in silence and passes on. The guards lead their prisoner to the close, gloomy vaulted prison in the ancient palace of the Holy Inquisition and shut Him in it.

The worst of such stories is that the triumphant romancers can always be put to confusion and crushed by the very details in which real life is so rich and which these unhappy and involuntary story\u2010tellers neglect as insignificant trifles. Oh, they have no thought to spare for such details, their minds are concentrated on their grand invention as a whole, and fancy any one daring to pull them up for a trifle!

Can you tell me?\u201d asked Lise with timid entreaty. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you later, Lise\u2014afterwards,\u201d said Alyosha, confused. \u201cNow you wouldn\u2019t understand it perhaps\u2014and perhaps I couldn\u2019t explain it.\u201d \u201cI know your brothers and your father are worrying you, too.\u201d \u201cYes, my brothers too,\u201d murmured Alyosha, pondering. \u201cI don\u2019t like your brother Ivan, Alyosha,\u201d said Lise suddenly.

And they are destroying others with them.", " Let him read, especially to the children, how the brothers sold Joseph, the tender boy, the dreamer and prophet, into bondage, and told their father that a wild beast had devoured him, and showed him his blood\u2010 stained clothes. Let him read them how the brothers afterwards journeyed into Egypt for corn, and Joseph, already a great ruler, unrecognized by them, tormented them, accused them, kept his brother Benjamin, and all through love: \u201cI love you, and loving you I torment you.\u201d For he remembered all his life how they had sold him to the merchants in the burning desert by the well, and how, wringing his hands, he had wept and besought his brothers not to sell him as a slave in a strange land. And how, seeing them again after many years, he loved them beyond measure, but he harassed and tormented them in love. He left them at last not able to bear the suffering of his heart, flung himself on his bed and wept.", " I am going of myself because I choose to, but you\u2019ve all been hauled there by Alexey Karamazov\u2014there\u2019s a difference, you know.

His father was awfully pleased to see us. You know he will simply go out of his mind if Ilusha dies. He sees that Ilusha\u2019s dying. And he seems so glad we\u2019ve made it up with Ilusha. Ilusha asked after you, that was all. He just asks and says no more. His father will go out of his mind or hang himself. He behaved like a madman before. You know he is a very decent man.

Alyosha watched him intently. \u201cWe are discussing this gentleman\u2019s most interesting article,\u201d said Father Iosif, the librarian, addressing the elder, and indicating Ivan. \u201cHe brings forward much that is new, but I think the argument cuts both ways. It is an article written in answer to a book by an ecclesiastical authority on the question of the ecclesiastical court, and the scope of its jurisdiction.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry I have not read your article, but I\u2019ve heard of it,\u201d said the elder, looking keenly and intently at Ivan. \u201cHe takes up a most interesting position,\u201d continued the Father Librarian. \u201cAs far as Church jurisdiction is concerned he is apparently quite opposed to the separation of Church from State.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s interesting.

But before we proceed to listen to your communication, will you allow me to inquire as to another little fact of great interest to us? I mean the ten roubles you borrowed yesterday at about five o\u2019clock on the security of your pistols, from your friend, Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin.\u201d \u201cI pledged them, gentlemen. I pledged them for ten roubles. What more? That\u2019s all about it. As soon as I got back to town I pledged them.\u201d \u201cYou got back to town? Then you had been out of town?\u201d \u201cYes, I went a journey of forty versts into the country.

All rose from their seats and hastened to him. But though suffering, he still looked at them with a smile, sank slowly from his chair on to his knees, then bowed his face to the ground, stretched out his arms and as though in joyful ecstasy, praying and kissing the ground, quietly and joyfully gave up his soul to God. The news of his death spread at once through the hermitage and reached the monastery. The nearest friends of the deceased and those whose duty it was from their position began to lay out the corpse according to the ancient ritual, and all the monks gathered together in the church. And before dawn the news of the death reached the town. By the morning all the town was talking of the event, and crowds were flocking from the town to the monastery. But this subject will be treated in the next book; I will only add here that before a day had passed something happened so unexpected, so strange, upsetting, and bewildering in its effect on the monks and the townspeople, that after all these years, that day of general suspense is still vividly remembered in the town."], "Who asks Alyoshato leave the monastery?": [" I asked her forgiveness because I wanted to punish myself to the bitter end. She would not forgive me....

As he hastened out of the hermitage precincts to reach the monastery in time to serve at the Father Superior\u2019s dinner, he felt a sudden pang at his heart, and stopped short. He seemed to hear again Father Zossima\u2019s words, foretelling his approaching end. What he had foretold so exactly must infallibly come to pass. Alyosha believed that implicitly. But how could he be left without him? How could he live without seeing and hearing him? Where should he go? He had told him not to weep, and to leave the monastery. Good God! It was long since Alyosha had known such anguish. He hurried through the copse that divided the monastery from the hermitage, and unable to bear the burden of his thoughts, he gazed at the ancient pines beside the path. He had not far to go\u2014about five hundred paces. He expected to meet no one at that hour, but at the first turn of the path he noticed Rakitin.", " I knew you would say that.

Alyosha recalled what he had just said. \u201cI seem to be sleeping awake.... I walk, I speak, I see, but I am asleep.\u201d It seemed to be just like that now. Alyosha did not leave him. The thought passed through his mind to run for a doctor, but he was afraid to leave his brother alone: there was no one to whom he could leave him. By degrees Ivan lost consciousness completely at last. He still went on talking, talking incessantly, but quite incoherently, and even articulated his words with difficulty. Suddenly he staggered violently; but Alyosha was in time to support him. Ivan let him lead him to his bed."], "What does MadameKhokhlakov suggest when Dmitri asks her for a loan?": [" But, as soon as Grushenka had gone, Mitya began to suspect her of all the low cunning of faithlessness, and he felt no sting of conscience at it. And so jealousy surged up in him again. He had, in any case, to make haste. The first thing to be done was to get hold of at least a small, temporary loan of money. The nine roubles had almost all gone on his expedition. And, as we all know, one can\u2019t take a step without money. But he had thought over in the cart where he could get a loan. He had a brace of fine dueling pistols in a case, which he had not pawned till then because he prized them above all his possessions. In the \u201cMetropolis\u201d tavern he had some time since made acquaintance with a young official and had learnt that this very opulent bachelor was passionately fond of weapons. He used to buy pistols, revolvers, daggers, hang them on his wall and show them to acquaintances. He prided himself on them, and was quite a specialist on the mechanism of the revolver.", " She could not attend to letters then. The first letter was followed next day by another in which Pan Mussyalovitch begged her for a loan of two thousand roubles for a very short period. Grushenka left that letter, too, unanswered. A whole series of letters had followed\u2014one every day\u2014all as pompous and rhetorical, but the loan asked for, gradually diminishing, dropped to a hundred roubles, then to twenty\u2010five, to ten, and finally Grushenka received a letter in which both the Poles begged her for only one rouble and included a receipt signed by both. Then Grushenka suddenly felt sorry for them, and at dusk she went round herself to their lodging. She found the two Poles in great poverty, almost destitution, without food or fuel, without cigarettes, in debt to their landlady. The two hundred roubles they had carried off from Mitya at Mokroe had soon disappeared. But Grushenka was surprised at their meeting her with arrogant dignity and self\u2010assertion, with the greatest punctilio and pompous speeches.", " What\u2019s more, it struck me at the time. I fancied that there was an artificial simplicity about him; that he was in a hurry to suggest this idea to me that I might fancy it was my own. He insinuated it, as it were. Did he not insinuate the same idea at the inquiry and suggest it to the talented prosecutor? \u201cI shall be asked, \u2018What about the old woman, Grigory\u2019s wife? She heard the sick man moaning close by, all night.\u2019 Yes, she heard it, but that evidence is extremely unreliable. I knew a lady who complained bitterly that she had been kept awake all night by a dog in the yard. Yet the poor beast, it appeared, had only yelped once or twice in the night. And that\u2019s natural. If any one is asleep and hears a groan he wakes up, annoyed at being waked, but instantly falls asleep again. Two hours later, again a groan, he wakes up and falls asleep again; and the same thing again two hours later\u2014three times altogether in the night.", " From him Alyosha learnt all the details of the important affair which had of late formed such a close and remarkable bond between the two elder brothers. Dmitri\u2019s enthusiastic references to Ivan were the more striking in Alyosha\u2019s eyes since Dmitri was, compared with Ivan, almost uneducated, and the two brothers were such a contrast in personality and character that it would be difficult to find two men more unlike. It was at this time that the meeting, or, rather gathering of the members of this inharmonious family took place in the cell of the elder who had such an extraordinary influence on Alyosha. The pretext for this gathering was a false one. It was at this time that the discord between Dmitri and his father seemed at its acutest stage and their relations had become insufferably strained. Fyodor Pavlovitch seems to have been the first to suggest, apparently in joke, that they should all meet in Father Zossima\u2019s cell, and that, without appealing to his direct intervention, they might more decently come to an understanding under the conciliating influence of the elder\u2019s presence."], "What is the subjectof Ivan\u2019s controversial essay?": [" Intense, infinite compassion overwhelmed him instantly. There was a poignant ache in his torn heart. \u201cLove Ivan!\u201d\u2014he suddenly recalled Mitya\u2019s words. And he was going to Ivan. He badly wanted to see Ivan all day. He was as much worried about Ivan as about Mitya, and more than ever now. Chapter V. Not You, Not You! On the way to Ivan he had to pass the house where Katerina Ivanovna was living. There was light in the windows. He suddenly stopped and resolved to go in. He had not seen Katerina Ivanovna for more than a week. But now it struck him that Ivan might be with her, especially on the eve of the terrible day. Ringing, and mounting the staircase, which was dimly lighted by a Chinese lantern, he saw a man coming down, and as they met, he recognized him as his brother. So he was just coming from Katerina Ivanovna. \u201cAh, it\u2019s only you,\u201d said Ivan dryly. \u201cWell, good\u2010by!

It\u2019s not only the money, though a fortune of sixty thousand is an attraction.\u201d \u201cIvan is above that. He wouldn\u2019t make up to any one for thousands.

Alyosha felt instinctively that a character like Katerina Ivanovna\u2019s must dominate, and she could only dominate some one like Dmitri, and never a man like Ivan. For Dmitri might at last submit to her domination \u201cto his own happiness\u201d (which was what Alyosha would have desired), but Ivan\u2014no, Ivan could not submit to her, and such submission would not give him happiness.

Another man will not commit the murder, but will feel and think like him, and is as dishonorable in soul.

And, indeed, this circumstance led to the catastrophe, the account of which forms the subject of my first introductory story, or rather the external side of it. But before I pass to that story I must say a little of Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s other two sons, and of their origin. Chapter III. The Second Marriage And The Second Family Very shortly after getting his four\u2010year\u2010old Mitya off his hands Fyodor Pavlovitch married a second time. His second marriage lasted eight years. He took this second wife, Sofya Ivanovna, also a very young girl, from another province, where he had gone upon some small piece of business in company with a Jew. Though Fyodor Pavlovitch was a drunkard and a vicious debauchee he never neglected investing his capital, and managed his business affairs very successfully, though, no doubt, not over\u2010 scrupulously.", " I mean an afflicted idiot, formerly the servant, and possibly the illegitimate son, of Fyodor Pavlovitch, Smerdyakov. At the preliminary inquiry, he told me with hysterical tears how the young Ivan Karamazov had horrified him by his spiritual audacity. \u2018Everything in the world is lawful according to him, and nothing must be forbidden in the future\u2014that is what he always taught me.\u2019 I believe that idiot was driven out of his mind by this theory, though, of course, the epileptic attacks from which he suffered, and this terrible catastrophe, have helped to unhinge his faculties. But he dropped one very interesting observation, which would have done credit to a more intelligent observer, and that is, indeed, why I\u2019ve mentioned it: \u2018If there is one of the sons that is like Fyodor Pavlovitch in character, it is Ivan Fyodorovitch.\u2019 \u201cWith that remark I conclude my sketch of his character, feeling it indelicate to continue further."], "At the beginning of the novel, what causes conflict between Fyodor and Dmitri?": [" From some rumor, or perhaps from some stray word of Grushenka\u2019s, he had gathered further that the old man would perhaps prefer him to Fyodor Pavlovitch for Grushenka. Possibly many of the readers of my novel will feel that in reckoning on such assistance, and being ready to take his bride, so to speak, from the hands of her protector, Dmitri showed great coarseness and want of delicacy. I will only observe that Mitya looked upon Grushenka\u2019s past as something completely over. He looked on that past with infinite pity and resolved with all the fervor of his passion that when once Grushenka told him she loved him and would marry him, it would mean the beginning of a new Grushenka and a new Dmitri, free from every vice. They would forgive one another and would begin their lives afresh. As for Kuzma Samsonov, Dmitri looked upon him as a man who had exercised a fateful influence in that remote past of Grushenka\u2019s, though she had never loved him, and who was now himself a thing of the past, completely done with, and, so to say, non\u2010existent.", " He has an exercise\u2010book under his pillow with the French words written out in Russian letters for him by some one, he he he!\u201d Ivan ended by dismissing all doubts. He could not think of Dmitri without repulsion. Only one thing was strange, however. Alyosha persisted that Dmitri was not the murderer, and that \u201cin all probability\u201d Smerdyakov was. Ivan always felt that Alyosha\u2019s opinion meant a great deal to him, and so he was astonished at it now. Another thing that was strange was that Alyosha did not make any attempt to talk about Mitya with Ivan, that he never began on the subject and only answered his questions. This, too, struck Ivan particularly. But he was very much preoccupied at that time with something quite apart from that. On his return from Moscow, he abandoned himself hopelessly to his mad and consuming passion for Katerina Ivanovna. This is not the time to begin to speak of this new passion of Ivan\u2019s, which left its mark on all the rest of his life: this would furnish the subject for another novel, which I may perhaps never write.", " She jumped up and ran away. I was wearing my sword. I drew it and nearly stabbed myself with it on the spot; why, I don\u2019t know. It would have been frightfully stupid, of course. I suppose it was from delight. Can you understand that one might kill oneself from delight? But I didn\u2019t stab myself. I only kissed my sword and put it back in the scabbard\u2014which there was no need to have told you, by the way. And I fancy that in telling you about my inner conflict I have laid it on rather thick to glorify myself. But let it pass, and to hell with all who pry into the human heart! Well, so much for that \u2018adventure\u2019 with Katerina Ivanovna. So now Ivan knows of it, and you\u2014no one else.\u201d Dmitri got up, took a step or two in his excitement, pulled out his handkerchief and mopped his forehead, then sat down again, not in the same place as before, but on the opposite side, so that Alyosha had to turn quite round to face him.", " He turned out a first\u2010rate cook. Fyodor Pavlovitch paid him a salary, almost the whole of which Smerdyakov spent on clothes, pomade, perfumes, and such things. But he seemed to have as much contempt for the female sex as for men; he was discreet, almost unapproachable, with them. Fyodor Pavlovitch began to regard him rather differently. His fits were becoming more frequent, and on the days he was ill Marfa cooked, which did not suit Fyodor Pavlovitch at all. \u201cWhy are your fits getting worse?\u201d asked Fyodor Pavlovitch, looking askance at his new cook. \u201cWould you like to get married? Shall I find you a wife?\u201d But Smerdyakov turned pale with anger, and made no reply. Fyodor Pavlovitch left him with an impatient gesture. The great thing was that he had absolute confidence in his honesty. It happened once, when Fyodor Pavlovitch was drunk, that he dropped in the muddy courtyard three hundred\u2010rouble notes which he had only just received."], "At the monastery, what causes Fyodor and Dmitri to begin shouting at each other?": [" Why did you do that?\u201d Fyodor Pavlovitch protested. But the carriage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply. \u201cWell, you are a fellow,\u201d Fyodor Pavlovitch said again. After a pause of two minutes, looking askance at his son, \u201cWhy, it was you got up all this monastery business. You urged it, you approved of it. Why are you angry now?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,\u201d Ivan snapped sullenly. Fyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes. \u201cA drop of brandy would be nice now,\u201d he observed sententiously, but Ivan made no response. \u201cYou shall have some, too, when we get home.\u201d Ivan was still silent. Fyodor Pavlovitch waited another two minutes. \u201cBut I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will dislike it so much, most honored Karl von Moor.\u201d Ivan shrugged his shoulders contemptuously, and turning away stared at the road. And they did not speak again all the way home.", " He was silent and rather awkward, but sometimes, when he was alone with any one, he became talkative and effusive, and would laugh at anything or nothing. But his animation vanished as quickly as it appeared. He was always well and even elaborately dressed; he had already some independent fortune and expectations of much more. He was a friend of Alyosha\u2019s. In an ancient, jolting, but roomy, hired carriage, with a pair of old pinkish\u2010gray horses, a long way behind Mi\u00fcsov\u2019s carriage, came Fyodor Pavlovitch, with his son Ivan. Dmitri was late, though he had been informed of the time the evening before. The visitors left their carriage at the hotel, outside the precincts, and went to the gates of the monastery on foot. Except Fyodor Pavlovitch, none of the party had ever seen the monastery, and Mi\u00fcsov had probably not even been to church for thirty years. He looked about him with curiosity, together with assumed ease.", " I never dreamed that you of all people had such contempt for her! Does she really deserve it?\u201d \u201cI may have reasons of my own for visiting her. That\u2019s not your business. But as for relationship, your brother, or even your father, is more likely to make her yours than mine. Well, here we are. You\u2019d better go to the kitchen. Hullo! what\u2019s wrong, what is it? Are we late? They can\u2019t have finished dinner so soon! Have the Karamazovs been making trouble again? No doubt they have. Here\u2019s your father and your brother Ivan after him. They\u2019ve broken out from the Father Superior\u2019s. And look, Father Isidor\u2019s shouting out something after them from the steps. And your father\u2019s shouting and waving his arms. I expect he\u2019s swearing. Bah, and there goes Mi\u00fcsov driving away in his carriage. You see, he\u2019s going. And there\u2019s old Maximov running!\u2014there must have been a row. There can\u2019t have been any dinner. Surely they\u2019ve not been beating the Father Superior!", " He was reverenced during his lifetime as a crazy saint by all the pilgrims to the monastery. There was a tradition that both of these had lain in their coffins as though alive, that they had shown no signs of decomposition when they were buried and that there had been a holy light in their faces. And some people even insisted that a sweet fragrance came from their bodies. Yet, in spite of these edifying memories, it would be difficult to explain the frivolity, absurdity and malice that were manifested beside the coffin of Father Zossima. It is my private opinion that several different causes were simultaneously at work, one of which was the deeply\u2010rooted hostility to the institution of elders as a pernicious innovation, an antipathy hidden deep in the hearts of many of the monks. Even more powerful was jealousy of the dead man\u2019s saintliness, so firmly established during his lifetime that it was almost a forbidden thing to question it."], "Alyosha\u2019s faith is strengthened by his new friendship with whom?": [" \u201cYour words are worth a gold piece, O ass, and I\u2019ll give it to you to\u2010day. But as to the rest you talk nonsense, nonsense, nonsense. Let me tell you, stupid, that we here are all of little faith, only from carelessness, because we haven\u2019t time; things are too much for us, and, in the second place, the Lord God has given us so little time, only twenty\u2010four hours in the day, so that one hasn\u2019t even time to get sleep enough, much less to repent of one\u2019s sins. While you have denied your faith to your enemies when you\u2019d nothing else to think about but to show your faith! So I consider, brother, that it constitutes a sin.\u201d \u201cConstitute a sin it may, but consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch, that it only extenuates it, if it does constitute. If I had believed then in very truth, as I ought to have believed, then it really would have been sinful if I had not faced tortures for my faith, and had gone over to the pagan Mohammedan faith.", " that is, the population of the whole earth, except about two hermits in the desert, and in His well\u2010known mercy will He not forgive one of them? And so I\u2019m persuaded that though I may once have doubted I shall be forgiven if I shed tears of repentance.\u201d \u201cStay!\u201d cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, in a transport of delight. \u201cSo you do suppose there are two who can move mountains? Ivan, make a note of it, write it down. There you have the Russian all over!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re quite right in saying it\u2019s characteristic of the people\u2019s faith,\u201d Ivan assented, with an approving smile. \u201cYou agree. Then it must be so, if you agree. It\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it, Alyosha? That\u2019s the Russian faith all over, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cNo, Smerdyakov has not the Russian faith at all,\u201d said Alyosha firmly and gravely. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about his faith. I mean those two in the desert, only that idea. Surely that\u2019s Russian, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cYes, that\u2019s purely Russian,\u201d said Alyosha smiling.", " But humanity awaits him with the same faith and with the same love. Oh, with greater faith, for it is fifteen centuries since man has ceased to see signs from heaven. No signs from heaven come to\u2010day To add to what the heart doth say. There was nothing left but faith in what the heart doth say. It is true there were many miracles in those days. There were saints who performed miraculous cures; some holy people, according to their biographies, were visited by the Queen of Heaven herself. But the devil did not slumber, and doubts were already arising among men of the truth of these miracles. And just then there appeared in the north of Germany a terrible new heresy. \u201cA huge star like to a torch\u201d (that is, to a church) \u201cfell on the sources of the waters and they became bitter.\u201d These heretics began blasphemously denying miracles. But those who remained faithful were all the more ardent in their faith.", " Well, Grigory Vassilyevitch, if I\u2019m without faith and you have so great a faith that you are continually swearing at me, you try yourself telling this mountain, not to move into the sea for that\u2019s a long way off, but even to our stinking little river which runs at the bottom of the garden. You\u2019ll see for yourself that it won\u2019t budge, but will remain just where it is however much you shout at it, and that shows, Grigory Vassilyevitch, that you haven\u2019t faith in the proper manner, and only abuse others about it. Again, taking into consideration that no one in our day, not only you, but actually no one, from the highest person to the lowest peasant, can shove mountains into the sea\u2014except perhaps some one man in the world, or, at most, two, and they most likely are saving their souls in secret somewhere in the Egyptian desert, so you wouldn\u2019t find them\u2014if so it be, if all the rest have no faith, will God curse all the rest?"], "Dmitri is imprisoned for the murder of whom?": [" Such a murder is not a murder. Such a murder is not a parricide. No, the murder of such a father cannot be called parricide. Such a murder can only be reckoned parricide by prejudice. \u201cBut I appeal to you again and again from the depths of my soul; did this murder actually take place? Gentlemen of the jury, if we convict and punish him, he will say to himself: \u2018These people have done nothing for my bringing up, for my education, nothing to improve my lot, nothing to make me better, nothing to make me a man. These people have not given me to eat and to drink, have not visited me in prison and nakedness, and here they have sent me to penal servitude. I am quits, I owe them nothing now, and owe no one anything for ever. They are wicked and I will be wicked. They are cruel and I will be cruel.\u2019 That is what he will say, gentlemen of the jury.

Andrey, coughing from the brandy he had just swallowed, jumped up on the box. But Mitya was only just taking his seat when suddenly to his surprise he saw Fenya before him. She ran up panting, clasped her hands before him with a cry, and plumped down at his feet. \u201cDmitri Fyodorovitch, dear good Dmitri Fyodorovitch, don\u2019t harm my mistress. And it was I told you all about it.... And don\u2019t murder him, he came first, he\u2019s hers! He\u2019ll marry Agrafena Alexandrovna now. That\u2019s why he\u2019s come back from Siberia.

Dmitri Fyodorovitch, give me your pistols at once if you mean to behave like a man,\u201d he shouted aloud to Mitya. \u201cDo you hear, Dmitri?\u201d \u201cThe pistols?", " \u201cBut he begged me not to tell Dmitri that he had told me about him,\u201d added Alyosha. Ivan frowned and pondered. \u201cAre you frowning on Smerdyakov\u2019s account?\u201d asked Alyosha. \u201cYes, on his account. Damn him, I certainly did want to see Dmitri, but now there\u2019s no need,\u201d said Ivan reluctantly. \u201cBut are you really going so soon, brother?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWhat of Dmitri and father? how will it end?\u201d asked Alyosha anxiously. \u201cYou are always harping upon it!

Am I my brother Dmitri\u2019s keeper?\u201d Ivan snapped irritably, but then he suddenly smiled bitterly. \u201cCain\u2019s answer about his murdered brother, wasn\u2019t it? Perhaps that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking at this moment? Well, damn it all, I can\u2019t stay here to be their keeper, can I? I\u2019ve finished what I had to do, and I am going. Do you imagine I am jealous of Dmitri, that I\u2019ve been trying to steal his beautiful Katerina Ivanovna for the last three months?", " He felt more and more sick with anxiety and impatience. \u201cYes, I know it was that old man Grigory murdered him.\u201d \u201cGrigory?\u201d cried Alyosha. \u201cYes, yes; it was Grigory. He lay as Dmitri Fyodorovitch struck him down, and then got up, saw the door open, went in and killed Fyodor Pavlovitch.\u201d \u201cBut why, why?\u201d \u201cSuffering from aberration. When he recovered from the blow Dmitri Fyodorovitch gave him on the head, he was suffering from aberration; he went and committed the murder. As for his saying he didn\u2019t, he very likely doesn\u2019t remember. Only, you know, it\u2019ll be better, ever so much better, if Dmitri Fyodorovitch murdered him. And that\u2019s how it must have been, though I say it was Grigory. It certainly was Dmitri Fyodorovitch, and that\u2019s better, ever so much better! Oh! not better that a son should have killed his father, I don\u2019t defend that. Children ought to honor their parents, and yet it would be better if it were he, as you\u2019d have nothing to cry over then, for he did it when he was unconscious or rather when he was conscious, but did not know what he was doing."], "In the introduction, the author claims that the novel is a biography of whom?": [" There\u2019s no harm in that, is there? You know, I sometimes like him. He\u2019s awfully low, but it\u2019s natural to him, eh? Don\u2019t you think so? Some people are low from self\u2010 interest, but he\u2019s simply so, from nature. Only fancy, he claims (he was arguing about it all the way yesterday) that Gogol wrote _Dead Souls_ about him. Do you remember, there\u2019s a landowner called Maximov in it, whom Nozdryov thrashed. He was charged, do you remember, \u2018for inflicting bodily injury with rods on the landowner Maximov in a drunken condition.\u2019 Would you believe it, he claims that he was that Maximov and that he was beaten! Now can it be so? Tchitchikov made his journey, at the very latest, at the beginning of the twenties, so that the dates don\u2019t fit. He couldn\u2019t have been thrashed then, he couldn\u2019t, could he?\u201d It was difficult to imagine what Kalganov was excited about, but his excitement was genuine. Mitya followed his lead without protest.", " The article dealt with a subject which was being debated everywhere at the time\u2014the position of the ecclesiastical courts. After discussing several opinions on the subject he went on to explain his own view. What was most striking about the article was its tone, and its unexpected conclusion. Many of the Church party regarded him unquestioningly as on their side. And yet not only the secularists but even atheists joined them in their applause. Finally some sagacious persons opined that the article was nothing but an impudent satirical burlesque. I mention this incident particularly because this article penetrated into the famous monastery in our neighborhood, where the inmates, being particularly interested in the question of the ecclesiastical courts, were completely bewildered by it. Learning the author\u2019s name, they were interested in his being a native of the town and the son of \u201cthat Fyodor Pavlovitch.\u201d And just then it was that the author himself made his appearance among us.", " What that business was the reader will learn fully in due time. Yet even when I did know of this special circumstance I still felt Ivan Fyodorovitch to be an enigmatic figure, and thought his visit rather mysterious. I may add that Ivan appeared at the time in the light of a mediator between his father and his elder brother Dmitri, who was in open quarrel with his father and even planning to bring an action against him. The family, I repeat, was now united for the first time, and some of its members met for the first time in their lives. The younger brother, Alexey, had been a year already among us, having been the first of the three to arrive. It is of that brother Alexey I find it most difficult to speak in this introduction. Yet I must give some preliminary account of him, if only to explain one queer fact, which is that I have to introduce my hero to the reader wearing the cassock of a novice.", " \u201cI am not a poodle,\u201d Grigory muttered. \u201cAll right, it\u2019s I am a poodle myself,\u201d cried Mitya. \u201cIf it\u2019s an insult, I take it to myself and I beg his pardon. I was a beast and cruel to him. I was cruel to \u00c6sop too.\u201d \u201cWhat \u00c6sop?\u201d the President asked sternly again. \u201cOh, Pierrot ... my father, Fyodor Pavlovitch.\u201d The President again and again warned Mitya impressively and very sternly to be more careful in his language. \u201cYou are injuring yourself in the opinion of your judges.\u201d The counsel for the defense was equally clever in dealing with the evidence of Rakitin. I may remark that Rakitin was one of the leading witnesses and one to whom the prosecutor attached great significance. It appeared that he knew everything; his knowledge was amazing, he had been everywhere, seen everything, talked to everybody, knew every detail of the biography of Fyodor Pavlovitch and all the Karamazovs. Of the envelope, it is true, he had only heard from Mitya himself."], "What does the narrator say about the two different versions of the story about Fyodor\u2019s reaction to news that Adelaida had died?": [" Fyodor Pavlovitch at once began bustling about, making preparations to go to Petersburg, with what object he could not himself have said. He would perhaps have really gone; but having determined to do so he felt at once entitled to fortify himself for the journey by another bout of reckless drinking. And just at that time his wife\u2019s family received the news of her death in Petersburg. She had died quite suddenly in a garret, according to one story, of typhus, or as another version had it, of starvation. Fyodor Pavlovitch was drunk when he heard of his wife\u2019s death, and the story is that he ran out into the street and began shouting with joy, raising his hands to Heaven: \u201cLord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace,\u201d but others say he wept without restraint like a little child, so much so that people were sorry for him, in spite of the repulsion he inspired. It is quite possible that both versions were true, that he rejoiced at his release, and at the same time wept for her who released him.", " The young man was overwhelmed, suspected deceit and cheating, and was almost beside himself. And, indeed, this circumstance led to the catastrophe, the account of which forms the subject of my first introductory story, or rather the external side of it. But before I pass to that story I must say a little of Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s other two sons, and of their origin. Chapter III. The Second Marriage And The Second Family Very shortly after getting his four\u2010year\u2010old Mitya off his hands Fyodor Pavlovitch married a second time. His second marriage lasted eight years. He took this second wife, Sofya Ivanovna, also a very young girl, from another province, where he had gone upon some small piece of business in company with a Jew. Though Fyodor Pavlovitch was a drunkard and a vicious debauchee he never neglected investing his capital, and managed his business affairs very successfully, though, no doubt, not over\u2010 scrupulously.", " Grigory rushed to Marfa and sent her to Lizaveta, while he ran to fetch an old midwife who lived close by. They saved the baby, but Lizaveta died at dawn. Grigory took the baby, brought it home, and making his wife sit down, put it on her lap. \u201cA child of God\u2014an orphan is akin to all,\u201d he said, \u201cand to us above others. Our little lost one has sent us this, who has come from the devil\u2019s son and a holy innocent. Nurse him and weep no more.\u201d So Marfa brought up the child. He was christened Pavel, to which people were not slow in adding Fyodorovitch (son of Fyodor). Fyodor Pavlovitch did not object to any of this, and thought it amusing, though he persisted vigorously in denying his responsibility. The townspeople were pleased at his adopting the foundling. Later on, Fyodor Pavlovitch invented a surname for the child, calling him Smerdyakov, after his mother\u2019s nickname. So this Smerdyakov became Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s second servant, and was living in the lodge with Grigory and Marfa at the time our story begins.", " Can you?\u201d \u201cOf course I can. I\u2019ve known Fyodor Pavlovitch a long time.\u201d \u201cAnd here\u2019s something for you, for I dare say he won\u2019t give you anything,\u201d said Ivan, laughing gayly. \u201cYou may depend on it he won\u2019t.\u201d Mitya laughed too. \u201cThank you, sir. I\u2019ll be sure to do it.\u201d At seven o\u2019clock Ivan got into the train and set off to Moscow \u201cAway with the past. I\u2019ve done with the old world for ever, and may I have no news, no echo, from it. To a new life, new places and no looking back!\u201d But instead of delight his soul was filled with such gloom, and his heart ached with such anguish, as he had never known in his life before. He was thinking all the night. The train flew on, and only at daybreak, when he was approaching Moscow, he suddenly roused himself from his meditation. \u201cI am a scoundrel,\u201d he whispered to himself. Fyodor Pavlovitch remained well satisfied at having seen his son off. For two hours afterwards he felt almost happy, and sat drinking brandy."], "After the death of his mother, who raises Dmitri to adulthood?": [" \u201cBut she was my mother, too, I believe, his mother. Was she not?\u201d said Ivan, with uncontrolled anger and contempt. The old man shrank before his flashing eyes. But something very strange had happened, though only for a second; it seemed really to have escaped the old man\u2019s mind that Alyosha\u2019s mother actually was the mother of Ivan too. \u201cYour mother?\u201d he muttered, not understanding. \u201cWhat do you mean? What mother are you talking about? Was she?... Why, damn it! of course she was yours too! Damn it! My mind has never been so darkened before. Excuse me, why, I was thinking, Ivan.... He he he!\u201d He stopped. A broad, drunken, half\u2010senseless grin overspread his face. At that moment a fearful noise and clamor was heard in the hall, there were violent shouts, the door was flung open, and Dmitri burst into the room. The old man rushed to Ivan in terror. \u201cHe\u2019ll kill me! He\u2019ll kill me! Don\u2019t let him get at me!\u201d he screamed, clinging to the skirt of Ivan\u2019s coat.", " Alyosha, Alyosha, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d The old man jumped up in alarm. From the time he had begun speaking about his mother, a change had gradually come over Alyosha\u2019s face. He flushed crimson, his eyes glowed, his lips quivered. The old sot had gone spluttering on, noticing nothing, till the moment when something very strange happened to Alyosha. Precisely what he was describing in the crazy woman was suddenly repeated with Alyosha. He jumped up from his seat exactly as his mother was said to have done, wrung his hands, hid his face in them, and fell back in his chair, shaking all over in an hysterical paroxysm of sudden violent, silent weeping. His extraordinary resemblance to his mother particularly impressed the old man. \u201cIvan, Ivan! Water, quickly! It\u2019s like her, exactly as she used to be then, his mother. Spurt some water on him from your mouth, that\u2019s what I used to do to her. He\u2019s upset about his mother, his mother,\u201d he muttered to Ivan.", " All I\u2019ve said is that she won\u2019t come, but maybe she\u2019s looking for more than that\u2014I mean to be mistress here. I know myself that Samsonov, her merchant, was laughing with her about it, telling her quite openly that it would not be at all a stupid thing to do. And she\u2019s got plenty of sense. She wouldn\u2019t marry a beggar like Dmitri Fyodorovitch. So, taking that into consideration, Ivan Fyodorovitch, reflect that then neither Dmitri Fyodorovitch nor yourself and your brother, Alexey Fyodorovitch, would have anything after the master\u2019s death, not a rouble, for Agrafena Alexandrovna would marry him simply to get hold of the whole, all the money there is. But if your father were to die now, there\u2019d be some forty thousand for sure, even for Dmitri Fyodorovitch whom he hates so, for he\u2019s made no will.... Dmitri Fyodorovitch knows all that very well.\u201d A sort of shudder passed over Ivan\u2019s face. He suddenly flushed.", " Friends came to see us. \u201cDear ones,\u201d he would say to them, \u201cwhat have I done that you should love me so, how can you love any one like me, and how was it I did not know, I did not appreciate it before?\u201d When the servants came in to him he would say continually, \u201cDear, kind people, why are you doing so much for me, do I deserve to be waited on? If it were God\u2019s will for me to live, I would wait on you, for all men should wait on one another.\u201d Mother shook her head as she listened. \u201cMy darling, it\u2019s your illness makes you talk like that.\u201d \u201cMother, darling,\u201d he would say, \u201cthere must be servants and masters, but if so I will be the servant of my servants, the same as they are to me.

Why are you angry now?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,\u201d Ivan snapped sullenly. Fyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes. \u201cA drop of brandy would be nice now,\u201d he observed sententiously, but Ivan made no response. \u201cYou shall have some, too, when we get home.\u201d Ivan was still silent. Fyodor Pavlovitch waited another two minutes. \u201cBut I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will dislike it so much, most honored Karl von Moor.\u201d Ivan shrugged his shoulders contemptuously, and turning away stared at the road. And they did not speak again all the way home.", " Yet she bore Fyodor Pavlovitch two sons, Ivan and Alexey, the eldest in the first year of marriage and the second three years later. When she died, little Alexey was in his fourth year, and, strange as it seems, I know that he remembered his mother all his life, like a dream, of course. At her death almost exactly the same thing happened to the two little boys as to their elder brother, Mitya. They were completely forgotten and abandoned by their father. They were looked after by the same Grigory and lived in his cottage, where they were found by the tyrannical old lady who had brought up their mother. She was still alive, and had not, all those eight years, forgotten the insult done her. All that time she was obtaining exact information as to her Sofya\u2019s manner of life, and hearing of her illness and hideous surroundings she declared aloud two or three times to her retainers: \u201cIt serves her right.", " Though, who knows, perhaps then a fearful thing would happen, perhaps the despairing heart of the criminal would lose its faith and then what would become of him? But the Church, like a tender, loving mother, holds aloof from active punishment herself, as the sinner is too severely punished already by the civil law, and there must be at least some one to have pity on him. The Church holds aloof, above all, because its judgment is the only one that contains the truth, and therefore cannot practically and morally be united to any other judgment even as a temporary compromise. She can enter into no compact about that. The foreign criminal, they say, rarely repents, for the very doctrines of to\u2010day confirm him in the idea that his crime is not a crime, but only a reaction against an unjustly oppressive force. Society cuts him off completely by a force that triumphs over him mechanically and (so at least they say of themselves in Europe) accompanies this exclusion with hatred, forgetfulness, and the most profound indifference as to the ultimate fate of the erring brother.", " Perhaps a tumbler and a half?\u201d Grigory did not answer. He seemed to see what was meant. \u201cA glass and a half of neat spirit\u2014is not at all bad, don\u2019t you think? You might see the gates of heaven open, not only the door into the garden?\u201d Grigory remained silent. There was another laugh in the court. The President made a movement. \u201cDo you know for a fact,\u201d Fetyukovitch persisted, \u201cwhether you were awake or not when you saw the open door?\u201d \u201cI was on my legs.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not a proof that you were awake.\u201d (There was again laughter in the court.) \u201cCould you have answered at that moment, if any one had asked you a question\u2014for instance, what year it is?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cAnd what year is it, Anno Domini, do you know?\u201d Grigory stood with a perplexed face, looking straight at his tormentor. Strange to say, it appeared he really did not know what year it was. \u201cBut perhaps you can tell me how many fingers you have on your hands?\u201d \u201cI am a servant,\u201d Grigory said suddenly, in a loud and distinct voice."], "After Alyosha moves to his father\u2019s town, what kind of a relationship does he have with Fyodor?": [" I never dreamed that you of all people had such contempt for her! Does she really deserve it?\u201d \u201cI may have reasons of my own for visiting her. That\u2019s not your business. But as for relationship, your brother, or even your father, is more likely to make her yours than mine. Well, here we are. You\u2019d better go to the kitchen. Hullo! what\u2019s wrong, what is it? Are we late? They can\u2019t have finished dinner so soon! Have the Karamazovs been making trouble again? No doubt they have. Here\u2019s your father and your brother Ivan after him. They\u2019ve broken out from the Father Superior\u2019s. And look, Father Isidor\u2019s shouting out something after them from the steps. And your father\u2019s shouting and waving his arms. I expect he\u2019s swearing. Bah, and there goes Mi\u00fcsov driving away in his carriage. You see, he\u2019s going. And there\u2019s old Maximov running!\u2014there must have been a row. There can\u2019t have been any dinner. Surely they\u2019ve not been beating the Father Superior!", " This anticipation showed itself in some by anxiety, in others by devout solemnity. All were expecting that some marvel would happen immediately after the elder\u2019s death. Their suspense was, from one point of view, almost frivolous, but even the most austere of the monks were affected by it. Father Pa\u00efssy\u2019s face looked the gravest of all. Alyosha was mysteriously summoned by a monk to see Rakitin, who had arrived from town with a singular letter for him from Madame Hohlakov. In it she informed Alyosha of a strange and very opportune incident. It appeared that among the women who had come on the previous day to receive Father Zossima\u2019s blessing, there had been an old woman from the town, a sergeant\u2019s widow, called Prohorovna. She had inquired whether she might pray for the rest of the soul of her son, Vassenka, who had gone to Irkutsk, and had sent her no news for over a year. To which Father Zossima had answered sternly, forbidding her to do so, and saying that to pray for the living as though they were dead was a kind of sorcery.", " God has punished her for her ingratitude.\u201d Exactly three months after Sofya Ivanovna\u2019s death the general\u2019s widow suddenly appeared in our town, and went straight to Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s house. She spent only half an hour in the town but she did a great deal. It was evening. Fyodor Pavlovitch, whom she had not seen for those eight years, came in to her drunk. The story is that instantly upon seeing him, without any sort of explanation, she gave him two good, resounding slaps on the face, seized him by a tuft of hair, and shook him three times up and down. Then, without a word, she went straight to the cottage to the two boys. Seeing, at the first glance, that they were unwashed and in dirty linen, she promptly gave Grigory, too, a box on the ear, and announcing that she would carry off both the children she wrapped them just as they were in a rug, put them in the carriage, and drove off to her own town.", " How can such a prisoner be acquitted? What if he committed the murder and gets off unpunished? That is what every one, almost involuntarily, instinctively, feels at heart. \u201cYes, it\u2019s a fearful thing to shed a father\u2019s blood\u2014the father who has begotten me, loved me, not spared his life for me, grieved over my illnesses from childhood up, troubled all his life for my happiness, and has lived in my joys, in my successes. To murder such a father\u2014that\u2019s inconceivable. Gentlemen of the jury, what is a father\u2014a real father? What is the meaning of that great word? What is the great idea in that name? We have just indicated in part what a true father is and what he ought to be. In the case in which we are now so deeply occupied and over which our hearts are aching\u2014in the present case, the father, Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov, did not correspond to that conception of a father to which we have just referred."], "What irritates the atheist Miusov at the monastery?": [" Alyosha noticed it with some embarrassment. He ascribed his brother\u2019s indifference at first to the disparity of their age and education. But he also wondered whether the absence of curiosity and sympathy in Ivan might be due to some other cause entirely unknown to him. He kept fancying that Ivan was absorbed in something\u2014something inward and important\u2014that he was striving towards some goal, perhaps very hard to attain, and that that was why he had no thought for him. Alyosha wondered, too, whether there was not some contempt on the part of the learned atheist for him\u2014a foolish novice. He knew for certain that his brother was an atheist. He could not take offense at this contempt, if it existed; yet, with an uneasy embarrassment which he did not himself understand, he waited for his brother to come nearer to him. Dmitri used to speak of Ivan with the deepest respect and with a peculiar earnestness.", " Dmitri, who had never seen the elder, naturally supposed that his father was trying to intimidate him, but, as he secretly blamed himself for his outbursts of temper with his father on several recent occasions, he accepted the challenge. It must be noted that he was not, like Ivan, staying with his father, but living apart at the other end of the town. It happened that Pyotr Alexandrovitch Mi\u00fcsov, who was staying in the district at the time, caught eagerly at the idea. A Liberal of the forties and fifties, a freethinker and atheist, he may have been led on by boredom or the hope of frivolous diversion. He was suddenly seized with the desire to see the monastery and the holy man. As his lawsuit with the monastery still dragged on, he made it the pretext for seeing the Superior, in order to attempt to settle it amicably. A visitor coming with such laudable intentions might be received with more attention and consideration than if he came from simple curiosity.", " No doubt that came in, that vexation, it must have done indeed; but yet that was not it, that was not it either. \u201cI feel sick with depression and yet I can\u2019t tell what I want. Better not think, perhaps.\u201d Ivan tried \u201cnot to think,\u201d but that, too, was no use. What made his depression so vexatious and irritating was that it had a kind of casual, external character\u2014he felt that. Some person or thing seemed to be standing out somewhere, just as something will sometimes obtrude itself upon the eye, and though one may be so busy with work or conversation that for a long time one does not notice it, yet it irritates and almost torments one till at last one realizes, and removes the offending object, often quite a trifling and ridiculous one\u2014some article left about in the wrong place, a handkerchief on the floor, a book not replaced on the shelf, and so on. At last, feeling very cross and ill\u2010humored, Ivan arrived home, and suddenly, about fifteen paces from the garden gate, he guessed what was fretting and worrying him.", " Mysterious, and perhaps awful. As he hastened out of the hermitage precincts to reach the monastery in time to serve at the Father Superior\u2019s dinner, he felt a sudden pang at his heart, and stopped short. He seemed to hear again Father Zossima\u2019s words, foretelling his approaching end. What he had foretold so exactly must infallibly come to pass. Alyosha believed that implicitly. But how could he be left without him? How could he live without seeing and hearing him? Where should he go? He had told him not to weep, and to leave the monastery. Good God! It was long since Alyosha had known such anguish. He hurried through the copse that divided the monastery from the hermitage, and unable to bear the burden of his thoughts, he gazed at the ancient pines beside the path. He had not far to go\u2014about five hundred paces. He expected to meet no one at that hour, but at the first turn of the path he noticed Rakitin."], "How do the monks show their respect for Zosima?": [" People said that some of the monks agreed beforehand, saying, \u201cI\u2019ll confess I lost my temper with you this morning, and you confirm it,\u201d simply in order to have something to say. Alyosha knew that this actually happened sometimes. He knew, too, that there were among the monks some who deeply resented the fact that letters from relations were habitually taken to the elder, to be opened and read by him before those to whom they were addressed. It was assumed, of course, that all this was done freely, and in good faith, by way of voluntary submission and salutary guidance. But, in fact, there was sometimes no little insincerity, and much that was false and strained in this practice. Yet the older and more experienced of the monks adhered to their opinion, arguing that \u201cfor those who have come within these walls sincerely seeking salvation, such obedience and sacrifice will certainly be salutary and of great benefit; those, on the other hand, who find it irksome, and repine, are no true monks, and have made a mistake in entering the monastery\u2014their proper place is in the world.", " That\u2019s a dowry for you. And I\u2019ll never desert you, my angel. And I\u2019ll pay what\u2019s wanted for you there, if they ask for it. But, of course, if they don\u2019t ask, why should we worry them? What do you say? You know, you spend money like a canary, two grains a week. H\u2019m!... Do you know that near one monastery there\u2019s a place outside the town where every baby knows there are none but \u2018the monks\u2019 wives\u2019 living, as they are called. Thirty women, I believe. I have been there myself. You know, it\u2019s interesting in its own way, of course, as a variety. The worst of it is it\u2019s awfully Russian. There are no French women there. Of course they could get them fast enough, they have plenty of money. If they get to hear of it they\u2019ll come along. Well, there\u2019s nothing of that sort here, no \u2018monks\u2019 wives,\u2019 and two hundred monks. They\u2019re honest. They keep the fasts. I admit it.... H\u2019m.... So you want to be a monk?", " He sometimes astounded and almost alarmed his visitors by his knowledge of their secrets before they had spoken a word. Alyosha noticed that many, almost all, went in to the elder for the first time with apprehension and uneasiness, but came out with bright and happy faces. Alyosha was particularly struck by the fact that Father Zossima was not at all stern. On the contrary, he was always almost gay. The monks used to say that he was more drawn to those who were more sinful, and the greater the sinner the more he loved him. There were, no doubt, up to the end of his life, among the monks some who hated and envied him, but they were few in number and they were silent, though among them were some of great dignity in the monastery, one, for instance, of the older monks distinguished for his strict keeping of fasts and vows of silence. But the majority were on Father Zossima\u2019s side and very many of them loved him with all their hearts, warmly and sincerely.", " In his hands was put an ikon of the Saviour. Towards morning he was put in the coffin which had been made ready long before. It was decided to leave the coffin all day in the cell, in the larger room in which the elder used to receive his visitors and fellow monks. As the deceased was a priest and monk of the strictest rule, the Gospel, not the Psalter, had to be read over his body by monks in holy orders. The reading was begun by Father Iosif immediately after the requiem service. Father Pa\u00efssy desired later on to read the Gospel all day and night over his dead friend, but for the present he, as well as the Father Superintendent of the Hermitage, was very busy and occupied, for something extraordinary, an unheard\u2010of, even \u201cunseemly\u201d excitement and impatient expectation began to be apparent in the monks, and the visitors from the monastery hostels, and the crowds of people flocking from the town."], "While waiting for Dmitri to arrive at Zosima\u2019s room, Fyodor spends time doing what?": [" Chapter IX. The Sensualists Grigory and Smerdyakov ran into the room after Dmitri. They had been struggling with him in the passage, refusing to admit him, acting on instructions given them by Fyodor Pavlovitch some days before. Taking advantage of the fact that Dmitri stopped a moment on entering the room to look about him, Grigory ran round the table, closed the double doors on the opposite side of the room leading to the inner apartments, and stood before the closed doors, stretching wide his arms, prepared to defend the entrance, so to speak, with the last drop of his blood. Seeing this, Dmitri uttered a scream rather than a shout and rushed at Grigory. \u201cThen she\u2019s there! She\u2019s hidden there! Out of the way, scoundrel!\u201d He tried to pull Grigory away, but the old servant pushed him back. Beside himself with fury, Dmitri struck out, and hit Grigory with all his might. The old man fell like a log, and Dmitri, leaping over him, broke in the door.", " What that business was the reader will learn fully in due time. Yet even when I did know of this special circumstance I still felt Ivan Fyodorovitch to be an enigmatic figure, and thought his visit rather mysterious. I may add that Ivan appeared at the time in the light of a mediator between his father and his elder brother Dmitri, who was in open quarrel with his father and even planning to bring an action against him. The family, I repeat, was now united for the first time, and some of its members met for the first time in their lives. The younger brother, Alexey, had been a year already among us, having been the first of the three to arrive. It is of that brother Alexey I find it most difficult to speak in this introduction. Yet I must give some preliminary account of him, if only to explain one queer fact, which is that I have to introduce my hero to the reader wearing the cassock of a novice.", " Smerdyakov remained pale and trembling at the other end of the room, huddling close to Fyodor Pavlovitch. \u201cShe\u2019s here!\u201d shouted Dmitri. \u201cI saw her turn towards the house just now, but I couldn\u2019t catch her. Where is she? Where is she?\u201d That shout, \u201cShe\u2019s here!\u201d produced an indescribable effect on Fyodor Pavlovitch. All his terror left him. \u201cHold him! Hold him!\u201d he cried, and dashed after Dmitri. Meanwhile Grigory had got up from the floor, but still seemed stunned. Ivan and Alyosha ran after their father. In the third room something was heard to fall on the floor with a ringing crash: it was a large glass vase\u2014not an expensive one\u2014on a marble pedestal which Dmitri had upset as he ran past it. \u201cAt him!\u201d shouted the old man. \u201cHelp!\u201d Ivan and Alyosha caught the old man and were forcibly bringing him back. \u201cWhy do you run after him? He\u2019ll murder you outright,\u201d Ivan cried wrathfully at his father.", " There was evidence of people of no importance, Fenya and her mother, for instance, but the effect of it was almost overpowering. As to Perhotin, the people at the tavern, and at Plotnikov\u2019s shop, as well as the witnesses at Mokroe, their evidence seemed conclusive. It was the details that were so damning. The secret of the knocks impressed the lawyers almost as much as Grigory\u2019s evidence as to the open door. Grigory\u2019s wife, Marfa, in answer to Ivan\u2019s questions, declared that Smerdyakov had been lying all night the other side of the partition wall. \u201cHe was not three paces from our bed,\u201d and that although she was a sound sleeper she waked several times and heard him moaning, \u201cHe was moaning the whole time, moaning continually.\u201d Talking to Herzenstube, and giving it as his opinion that Smerdyakov was not mad, but only rather weak, Ivan only evoked from the old man a subtle smile. \u201cDo you know how he spends his time now?\u201d he asked; \u201clearning lists of French words by heart."], "Why does a crowd of women come to see Zosima?": [" I do not know how it may be now, but in my childhood I often happened to see and hear these \u201cpossessed\u201d women in the villages and monasteries. They used to be brought to mass; they would squeal and bark like a dog so that they were heard all over the church. But when the sacrament was carried in and they were led up to it, at once the \u201cpossession\u201d ceased, and the sick women were always soothed for a time. I was greatly impressed and amazed at this as a child; but then I heard from country neighbors and from my town teachers that the whole illness was simulated to avoid work, and that it could always be cured by suitable severity; various anecdotes were told to confirm this. But later on I learnt with astonishment from medical specialists that there is no pretense about it, that it is a terrible illness to which women are subject, specially prevalent among us in Russia, and that it is due to the hard lot of the peasant women.", " He holds out His hands to them, blesses them, and a healing virtue comes from contact with Him, even with His garments. An old man in the crowd, blind from childhood, cries out, \u2018O Lord, heal me and I shall see Thee!\u2019 and, as it were, scales fall from his eyes and the blind man sees Him. The crowd weeps and kisses the earth under His feet. Children throw flowers before Him, sing, and cry hosannah. \u2018It is He\u2014it is He!\u2019 all repeat. \u2018It must be He, it can be no one but Him!\u2019 He stops at the steps of the Seville cathedral at the moment when the weeping mourners are bringing in a little open white coffin. In it lies a child of seven, the only daughter of a prominent citizen. The dead child lies hidden in flowers. \u2018He will raise your child,\u2019 the crowd shouts to the weeping mother. The priest, coming to meet the coffin, looks perplexed, and frowns, but the mother of the dead child throws herself at His feet with a wail.", " But Fyodor Pavlovitch persisted in stopping him at the door of the cell. \u201cBlessed man!\u201d he cried, with feeling. \u201cAllow me to kiss your hand once more. Yes, with you I could still talk, I could still get on. Do you think I always lie and play the fool like this? Believe me, I have been acting like this all the time on purpose to try you. I have been testing you all the time to see whether I could get on with you. Is there room for my humility beside your pride? I am ready to give you a testimonial that one can get on with you! But now, I\u2019ll be quiet; I will keep quiet all the time. I\u2019ll sit in a chair and hold my tongue. Now it is for you to speak, Pyotr Alexandrovitch.

He gathered loose women into his house, and carried on orgies of debauchery in his wife\u2019s presence. To show what a pass things had come to, I may mention that Grigory, the gloomy, stupid, obstinate, argumentative servant, who had always hated his first mistress, Adela\u00efda Ivanovna, took the side of his new mistress. He championed her cause, abusing Fyodor Pavlovitch in a manner little befitting a servant, and on one occasion broke up the revels and drove all the disorderly women out of the house. In the end this unhappy young woman, kept in terror from her childhood, fell into that kind of nervous disease which is most frequently found in peasant women who are said to be \u201cpossessed by devils.\u201d At times after terrible fits of hysterics she even lost her reason."], "What advice does Zosima give to Madame Khokhlakov?": [" Listen, kiss me, I allow you.\u201d Alyosha kissed her. \u201cCome, now go.

When Fyodor Pavlovitch, who first came into contact with Grushenka over a piece of speculation, ended to his own surprise by falling madly in love with her, old Samsonov, gravely ill as he was, was immensely amused. It is remarkable that throughout their whole acquaintance Grushenka was absolutely and spontaneously open with the old man, and he seems to have been the only person in the world with whom she was so. Of late, when Dmitri too had come on the scene with his love, the old man left off laughing. On the contrary, he once gave Grushenka a stern and earnest piece of advice. \u201cIf you have to choose between the two, father or son, you\u2019d better choose the old man, if only you make sure the old scoundrel will marry you and settle some fortune on you beforehand."], "In a discussion with the monks, Ivan argues in support of which of the following?": [" People said that some of the monks agreed beforehand, saying, \u201cI\u2019ll confess I lost my temper with you this morning, and you confirm it,\u201d simply in order to have something to say.

Thirty women, I believe. I have been there myself. You know, it\u2019s interesting in its own way, of course, as a variety. The worst of it is it\u2019s awfully Russian. There are no French women there. Of course they could get them fast enough, they have plenty of money. If they get to hear of it they\u2019ll come along. Well, there\u2019s nothing of that sort here, no \u2018monks\u2019 wives,\u2019 and two hundred monks. They\u2019re honest. They keep the fasts. I admit it.... H\u2019m.... So you want to be a monk?", " He sometimes astounded and almost alarmed his visitors by his knowledge of their secrets before they had spoken a word. Alyosha noticed that many, almost all, went in to the elder for the first time with apprehension and uneasiness, but came out with bright and happy faces. Alyosha was particularly struck by the fact that Father Zossima was not at all stern. On the contrary, he was always almost gay. The monks used to say that he was more drawn to those who were more sinful, and the greater the sinner the more he loved him. There were, no doubt, up to the end of his life, among the monks some who hated and envied him, but they were few in number and they were silent, though among them were some of great dignity in the monastery, one, for instance, of the older monks distinguished for his strict keeping of fasts and vows of silence. But the majority were on Father Zossima\u2019s side and very many of them loved him with all their hearts, warmly and sincerely.", " And I hate the monster, too! I hate the monster! I don\u2019t want to save the monster. Let him rot in Siberia! He\u2019s begun singing a hymn! Oh, to\u2010morrow I\u2019ll go, stand before them, and spit in their faces!\u201d He jumped up in a frenzy, flung off the towel, and fell to pacing up and down the room again. Alyosha recalled what he had just said. \u201cI seem to be sleeping awake.... I walk, I speak, I see, but I am asleep.\u201d It seemed to be just like that now. Alyosha did not leave him. The thought passed through his mind to run for a doctor, but he was afraid to leave his brother alone: there was no one to whom he could leave him. By degrees Ivan lost consciousness completely at last. He still went on talking, talking incessantly, but quite incoherently, and even articulated his words with difficulty. Suddenly he staggered violently; but Alyosha was in time to support him. Ivan let him lead him to his bed."], "In front of the monks, Dmitri accuses Fyodor of conspiring with Grushenka to do what?": [" From some rumor, or perhaps from some stray word of Grushenka\u2019s, he had gathered further that the old man would perhaps prefer him to Fyodor Pavlovitch for Grushenka. Possibly many of the readers of my novel will feel that in reckoning on such assistance, and being ready to take his bride, so to speak, from the hands of her protector, Dmitri showed great coarseness and want of delicacy. I will only observe that Mitya looked upon Grushenka\u2019s past as something completely over. He looked on that past with infinite pity and resolved with all the fervor of his passion that when once Grushenka told him she loved him and would marry him, it would mean the beginning of a new Grushenka and a new Dmitri, free from every vice. They would forgive one another and would begin their lives afresh. As for Kuzma Samsonov, Dmitri looked upon him as a man who had exercised a fateful influence in that remote past of Grushenka\u2019s, though she had never loved him, and who was now himself a thing of the past, completely done with, and, so to say, non\u2010existent.", " It was just foolishness. I liked you so much then, and was open\u2010hearted with you.\u201d \u201cMy brother directly accuses you of the murder and theft.\u201d \u201cWhat else is left for him to do?\u201d said Smerdyakov, with a bitter grin. \u201cAnd who will believe him with all the proofs against him? Grigory Vassilyevitch saw the door open. What can he say after that? But never mind him! He is trembling to save himself.\u201d He slowly ceased speaking; then suddenly, as though on reflection, added: \u201cAnd look here again. He wants to throw it on me and make out that it is the work of my hands\u2014I\u2019ve heard that already. But as to my being clever at shamming a fit: should I have told you beforehand that I could sham one, if I really had had such a design against your father? If I had been planning such a murder could I have been such a fool as to give such evidence against myself beforehand? And to his son, too! Upon my word! Is that likely?", " \u201cDid he say it to you alone once, or several times?\u201d inquired the prosecutor, and learned that he had told Grushenka so several times. Ippolit Kirillovitch was very well satisfied with this piece of evidence. Further examination elicited that Grushenka knew, too, where that money had come from, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had got it from Katerina Ivanovna. \u201cAnd did you never, once, hear that the money spent a month ago was not three thousand, but less, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had saved half that sum for his own use?\u201d \u201cNo, I never heard that,\u201d answered Grushenka. It was explained further that Mitya had, on the contrary, often told her that he hadn\u2019t a farthing. \u201cHe was always expecting to get some from his father,\u201d said Grushenka in conclusion. \u201cDid he never say before you ... casually, or in a moment of irritation,\u201d Nikolay Parfenovitch put in suddenly, \u201cthat he intended to make an attempt on his father\u2019s life?\u201d \u201cAch, he did say so,\u201d sighed Grushenka.", " Father Zossima was accompanied by a novice, and by Alyosha. The two monks rose and greeted him with a very deep bow, touching the ground with their fingers; then kissed his hand. Blessing them, the elder replied with as deep a reverence to them, and asked their blessing. The whole ceremony was performed very seriously and with an appearance of feeling, not like an everyday rite. But Mi\u00fcsov fancied that it was all done with intentional impressiveness. He stood in front of the other visitors. He ought\u2014he had reflected upon it the evening before\u2014from simple politeness, since it was the custom here, to have gone up to receive the elder\u2019s blessing, even if he did not kiss his hand. But when he saw all this bowing and kissing on the part of the monks he instantly changed his mind. With dignified gravity he made a rather deep, conventional bow, and moved away to a chair. Fyodor Pavlovitch did the same, mimicking Mi\u00fcsov like an ape."], "What does Zosima do before leaving the room?": [" That\u2019s what I mean. Write that down, if you like.\u201d Saying this Mitya became very mournful. He had grown more and more gloomy as the inquiry continued. At that moment another unexpected scene followed. Though Grushenka had been removed, she had not been taken far away, only into the room next but one from the blue room, in which the examination was proceeding. It was a little room with one window, next beyond the large room in which they had danced and feasted so lavishly. She was sitting there with no one by her but Maximov, who was terribly depressed, terribly scared, and clung to her side, as though for security. At their door stood one of the peasants with a metal plate on his breast. Grushenka was crying, and suddenly her grief was too much for her, she jumped up, flung up her arms and, with a loud wail of sorrow, rushed out of the room to him, to her Mitya, and so unexpectedly that they had not time to stop her.", " It was a long time before he could wake up fully and understand what had happened to him. At last he realized that the room was full of charcoal fumes from the stove, and that he might die of suffocation. And the drunken peasant still lay snoring. The candle guttered and was about to go out. Mitya cried out, and ran staggering across the passage into the forester\u2019s room. The forester waked up at once, but hearing that the other room was full of fumes, to Mitya\u2019s surprise and annoyance, accepted the fact with strange unconcern, though he did go to see to it. \u201cBut he\u2019s dead, he\u2019s dead! and ... what am I to do then?\u201d cried Mitya frantically. They threw open the doors, opened a window and the chimney. Mitya brought a pail of water from the passage. First he wetted his own head, then, finding a rag of some sort, dipped it into the water, and put it on Lyagavy\u2019s head. The forester still treated the matter contemptuously, and when he opened the window said grumpily: \u201cIt\u2019ll be all right, now.\u201d He went back to sleep, leaving Mitya a lighted lantern.", " Madame Hohlakov made up her mind to see him. She was in her dressing\u2010gown and slippers, but she flung a black shawl over her shoulders. \u201cThe official\u201d was asked to walk into the drawing\u2010room, the very room in which Mitya had been received shortly before. The lady came to meet her visitor, with a sternly inquiring countenance, and, without asking him to sit down, began at once with the question: \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d \u201cI have ventured to disturb you, madam, on a matter concerning our common acquaintance, Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov,\u201d Perhotin began. But he had hardly uttered the name, when the lady\u2019s face showed signs of acute irritation. She almost shrieked, and interrupted him in a fury: \u201cHow much longer am I to be worried by that awful man?\u201d she cried hysterically. \u201cHow dare you, sir, how could you venture to disturb a lady who is a stranger to you, in her own house at such an hour!... And to force yourself upon her to talk of a man who came here, to this very drawing\u2010room, only three hours ago, to murder me, and went stamping out of the room, as no one would go out of a decent house.", " And so it was resolved to go in the evening, half a mile from the station, so that the train might have time to get up full speed after leaving the station. The boys assembled. It was a pitch\u2010dark night without a moon. At the time fixed, Kolya lay down between the rails. The five others who had taken the bet waited among the bushes below the embankment, their hearts beating with suspense, which was followed by alarm and remorse. At last they heard in the distance the rumble of the train leaving the station. Two red lights gleamed out of the darkness; the monster roared as it approached. \u201cRun, run away from the rails,\u201d the boys cried to Kolya from the bushes, breathless with terror. But it was too late: the train darted up and flew past. The boys rushed to Kolya. He lay without moving. They began pulling at him, lifting him up. He suddenly got up and walked away without a word. Then he explained that he had lain there as though he were insensible to frighten them, but the fact was that he really had lost consciousness, as he confessed long after to his mother."], "Zosima advises Alyosha to do what with his life?": [" I made it myself ... not while I was pulling the captain\u2019s beard, though....\u201d \u201cWhy do you bring him in all of a sudden?\u201d \u201cWhy do I bring him in?

I\u2019m ready to bless God and His creation directly, but ... I must kill one noxious insect for fear it should crawl and spoil life for others.... Let us drink to life, dear brother.

Chapter X. \u201cIt Was He Who Said That\u201d Alyosha coming in told Ivan that a little over an hour ago Marya Kondratyevna had run to his rooms and informed him Smerdyakov had taken his own life. \u201cI went in to clear away the samovar and he was hanging on a nail in the wall.\u201d On Alyosha\u2019s inquiring whether she had informed the police, she answered that she had told no one, \u201cbut I flew straight to you, I\u2019ve run all the way.\u201d She seemed perfectly crazy, Alyosha reported, and was shaking like a leaf. When Alyosha ran with her to the cottage, he found Smerdyakov still hanging. On the table lay a note: \u201cI destroy my life of my own will and desire, so as to throw no blame on any one.\u201d Alyosha left the note on the table and went straight to the police captain and told him all about it.", " One loves the first strength of one\u2019s youth. Do you understand anything of my tirade, Alyosha?\u201d Ivan laughed suddenly. \u201cI understand too well, Ivan. One longs to love with one\u2019s inside, with one\u2019s stomach. You said that so well and I am awfully glad that you have such a longing for life,\u201d cried Alyosha. \u201cI think every one should love life above everything in the world.\u201d \u201cLove life more than the meaning of it?\u201d \u201cCertainly, love it, regardless of logic as you say, it must be regardless of logic, and it\u2019s only then one will understand the meaning of it.

Chapter IV. The Third Son, Alyosha He was only twenty, his brother Ivan was in his twenty\u2010fourth year at the time, while their elder brother Dmitri was twenty\u2010seven. First of all, I must explain that this young man, Alyosha, was not a fanatic, and, in my opinion at least, was not even a mystic. I may as well give my full opinion from the beginning. He was simply an early lover of humanity, and that he adopted the monastic life was simply because at that time it struck him, so to say, as the ideal escape for his soul struggling from the darkness of worldly wickedness to the light of love. And the reason this life struck him in this way was that he found in it at that time, as he thought, an extraordinary being, our celebrated elder, Zossima, to whom he became attached with all the warm first love of his ardent heart."], "In a conversation with Alyosha, Ratikin accuses the Karamazovs of being what?": [" It was just foolishness.

Is that likely?", " In his account, Father Zossima\u2019s talk goes on without interruption, as though he told his life to his friends in the form of a story, though there is no doubt, from other accounts of it, that the conversation that evening was general. Though the guests did not interrupt Father Zossima much, yet they too talked, perhaps even told something themselves. Besides, Father Zossima could not have carried on an uninterrupted narrative, for he was sometimes gasping for breath, his voice failed him, and he even lay down to rest on his bed, though he did not fall asleep and his visitors did not leave their seats. Once or twice the conversation was interrupted by Father Pa\u00efssy\u2019s reading the Gospel. It is worthy of note, too, that no one of them supposed that he would die that night, for on that evening of his life after his deep sleep in the day he seemed suddenly to have found new strength, which kept him up through this long conversation.", " And then, on the spot, at her feet, I shall dash out my brains before her and punish myself! She will remember Mitya Karamazov sometimes, she will see how Mitya loved her, she will feel for Mitya!\u2019 \u201cHere we see in excess a love of effect, a romantic despair and sentimentality, and the wild recklessness of the Karamazovs. Yes, but there is something else, gentlemen of the jury, something that cries out in the soul, throbs incessantly in the mind, and poisons the heart unto death\u2014that _something_ is conscience, gentlemen of the jury, its judgment, its terrible torments!

He even succeeded in insulting Ivan during their first interview, telling him sharply that it was not for people who declared that \u201ceverything was lawful,\u201d to suspect and question him. Altogether he was anything but friendly with Ivan on that occasion. Immediately after that interview with Mitya, Ivan went for the first time to see Smerdyakov. In the railway train on his way from Moscow, he kept thinking of Smerdyakov and of his last conversation with him on the evening before he went away. Many things seemed to him puzzling and suspicious. But when he gave his evidence to the investigating lawyer Ivan said nothing, for the time, of that conversation. He put that off till he had seen Smerdyakov, who was at that time in the hospital."], "What causes the townspeople to conclude that Fyodor is the man who seduced Lizaveta, the slow-witted girl who died in childbirth?": [" Grigory rushed to Marfa and sent her to Lizaveta, while he ran to fetch an old midwife who lived close by.

Grigory took the baby, brought it home, and making his wife sit down, put it on her lap. \u201cA child of God\u2014an orphan is akin to all,\u201d he said, \u201cand to us above others. Our little lost one has sent us this, who has come from the devil\u2019s son and a holy innocent. Nurse him and weep no more.\u201d So Marfa brought up the child. He was christened Pavel, to which people were not slow in adding Fyodorovitch (son of Fyodor). Fyodor Pavlovitch did not object to any of this, and thought it amusing, though he persisted vigorously in denying his responsibility. The townspeople were pleased at his adopting the foundling. Later on, Fyodor Pavlovitch invented a surname for the child, calling him Smerdyakov, after his mother\u2019s nickname. So this Smerdyakov became Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s second servant, and was living in the lodge with Grigory and Marfa at the time our story begins.", " You\u2019ll live another twenty years.

But he dropped one very interesting observation, which would have done credit to a more intelligent observer, and that is, indeed, why I\u2019ve mentioned it: \u2018If there is one of the sons that is like Fyodor Pavlovitch in character, it is Ivan Fyodorovitch.\u2019 \u201cWith that remark I conclude my sketch of his character, feeling it indelicate to continue further.", " But I cannot omit to mention here that when Ivan, on leaving Katerina Ivanovna with Alyosha, as I\u2019ve related already, told him, \u201cI am not keen on her,\u201d it was an absolute lie: he loved her madly, though at times he hated her so that he might have murdered her. Many causes helped to bring about this feeling. Shattered by what had happened with Mitya, she rushed on Ivan\u2019s return to meet him as her one salvation. She was hurt, insulted and humiliated in her feelings. And here the man had come back to her, who had loved her so ardently before (oh! she knew that very well), and whose heart and intellect she considered so superior to her own. But the sternly virtuous girl did not abandon herself altogether to the man she loved, in spite of the Karamazov violence of his passions and the great fascination he had for her.

He is stupid, he can\u2019t disguise what he is doing; he is so open, you know.... But I\u2019ll give it to him, I\u2019ll give it to him! \u2018You believe I did it,\u2019 he said. He said that to me, to me. He reproached me with that! God forgive him! You wait, I\u2019ll make it hot for Katerina at the trial! I\u2019ll just say a word then ... I\u2019ll tell everything then!\u201d And again she cried bitterly. \u201cThis I can tell you for certain, Grushenka,\u201d Alyosha said, getting up. \u201cFirst, that he loves you, loves you more than any one in the world, and you only, believe me. I know. I do know. The second thing is that I don\u2019t want to worm his secret out of him, but if he\u2019ll tell me of himself to\u2010 day, I shall tell him straight out that I have promised to tell you.", " \u201cSet my mind at rest that I may know the worst that\u2019s in store for me.

I will say no more of this here, as it will all be clear later. But his chief trouble, I must explain however obscurely, lay in the fact that to have that sum he knew of, to _have the right_ to take it, he must first restore Katerina Ivanovna\u2019s three thousand\u2014if not, \u201cI\u2019m a common pickpocket, I\u2019m a scoundrel, and I don\u2019t want to begin a new life as a scoundrel,\u201d Mitya decided. And so he made up his mind to move heaven and earth to return Katerina Ivanovna that three thousand, and that _first of all_. The final stage of this decision, so to say, had been reached only during the last hours, that is, after his last interview with Alyosha, two days before, on the high\u2010road, on the evening when Grushenka had insulted Katerina Ivanovna, and Mitya, after hearing Alyosha\u2019s account of it, had admitted that he was a scoundrel, and told him to tell Katerina Ivanovna so, if it could be any comfort to her.", " I was joking this morning, don\u2019t be angry with me.

But as to the rest you talk nonsense, nonsense, nonsense. Let me tell you, stupid, that we here are all of little faith, only from carelessness, because we haven\u2019t time; things are too much for us, and, in the second place, the Lord God has given us so little time, only twenty\u2010four hours in the day, so that one hasn\u2019t even time to get sleep enough, much less to repent of one\u2019s sins. While you have denied your faith to your enemies when you\u2019d nothing else to think about but to show your faith! So I consider, brother, that it constitutes a sin.\u201d \u201cConstitute a sin it may, but consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch, that it only extenuates it, if it does constitute.

You\u2019ll see for yourself that it won\u2019t budge, but will remain just where it is however much you shout at it, and that shows, Grigory Vassilyevitch, that you haven\u2019t faith in the proper manner, and only abuse others about it. Again, taking into consideration that no one in our day, not only you, but actually no one, from the highest person to the lowest peasant, can shove mountains into the sea\u2014except perhaps some one man in the world, or, at most, two, and they most likely are saving their souls in secret somewhere in the Egyptian desert, so you wouldn\u2019t find them\u2014if so it be, if all the rest have no faith, will God curse all the rest?", " that is, the population of the whole earth, except about two hermits in the desert, and in His well\u2010known mercy will He not forgive one of them?

Then it must be so, if you agree. It\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it, Alyosha? That\u2019s the Russian faith all over, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cNo, Smerdyakov has not the Russian faith at all,\u201d said Alyosha firmly and gravely. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about his faith.

But you left the letter at home and that cheered me. You left it behind on purpose, so as not to give it back, because you knew I would ask for it? That was it, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cAh, Lise, it was not so a bit. The letter is with me now, and it was this morning, in this pocket.

In the letter was enclosed a receipt for the sum, with a promise to repay it within three months, signed by Pan Vrublevsky as well. Grushenka had received many such letters, accompanied by such receipts, from her former lover during the fortnight of her convalescence. But she knew that the two Poles had been to ask after her health during her illness. The first letter Grushenka got from them was a long one, written on large notepaper and with a big family crest on the seal. It was so obscure and rhetorical that Grushenka put it down before she had read half, unable to make head or tail of it.", " I heard it all; I almost dropped.

We know what we know!\u201d \u201cWhat do you know?\u201d \u201cI understand nothing,\u201d Ivan went on, as though in delirium. \u201cI don\u2019t want to understand anything now. I want to stick to the fact. I made up my mind long ago not to understand. If I try to understand anything, I shall be false to the fact, and I have determined to stick to the fact.\u201d \u201cWhy are you trying me?\u201d Alyosha cried, with sudden distress. \u201cWill you say what you mean at last?\u201d \u201cOf course, I will; that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been leading up to."], "Alyosha tries to convince Katerina to recognize her love for whom?": [" How can I prove it? How can I convince myself? Oh, how unhappy I am! I stand and look about me and see that scarcely any one else cares; no one troubles his head about it, and I\u2019m the only one who can\u2019t stand it. It\u2019s deadly\u2014deadly!\u201d \u201cNo doubt. But there\u2019s no proving it, though you can be convinced of it.\u201d \u201cHow?\u201d \u201cBy the experience of active love. Strive to love your neighbor actively and indefatigably. In as far as you advance in love you will grow surer of the reality of God and of the immortality of your soul. If you attain to perfect self\u2010forgetfulness in the love of your neighbor, then you will believe without doubt, and no doubt can possibly enter your soul. This has been tried. This is certain.\u201d \u201cIn active love? There\u2019s another question\u2014and such a question! You see, I so love humanity that\u2014would you believe it?\u2014I often dream of forsaking all that I have, leaving Lise, and becoming a sister of mercy.", " How touching it must be to a soul standing in dread before the Lord to feel at that instant that, for him too, there is one to pray, that there is a fellow creature left on earth to love him too! And God will look on you both more graciously, for if you have had so much pity on him, how much will He have pity Who is infinitely more loving and merciful than you! And He will forgive him for your sake. Brothers, have no fear of men\u2019s sin. Love a man even in his sin, for that is the semblance of Divine Love and is the highest love on earth. Love all God\u2019s creation, the whole and every grain of sand in it. Love every leaf, every ray of God\u2019s light. Love the animals, love the plants, love everything. If you love everything, you will perceive the divine mystery in things. Once you perceive it, you will begin to comprehend it better every day. And you will come at last to love the whole world with an all\u2010 embracing love.", " \u201cI\u2019ll tell you,\u201d Alyosha went on with desperate haste, as though he were jumping from the top of a house. \u201cCall Dmitri; I will fetch him\u2014and let him come here and take your hand and take Ivan\u2019s and join your hands. For you\u2019re torturing Ivan, simply because you love him\u2014and torturing him, because you love Dmitri through \u2018self\u2010laceration\u2019\u2014with an unreal love\u2014because you\u2019ve persuaded yourself.\u201d Alyosha broke off and was silent. \u201cYou ... you ... you are a little religious idiot\u2014that\u2019s what you are!\u201d Katerina Ivanovna snapped. Her face was white and her lips were moving with anger. Ivan suddenly laughed and got up. His hat was in his hand. \u201cYou are mistaken, my good Alyosha,\u201d he said, with an expression Alyosha had never seen in his face before\u2014an expression of youthful sincerity and strong, irresistibly frank feeling. \u201cKaterina Ivanovna has never cared for me! She has known all the time that I cared for her\u2014though I never said a word of my love to her\u2014she knew, but she didn\u2019t care for me.", " It described how a gentleman came and tried his luck with the girls, to see whether they would love him: The master came to try the girls: Would they love him, would they not? But the girls could not love the master: He would beat me cruelly And such love won\u2019t do for me. Then a gypsy comes along and he, too, tries: The gypsy came to try the girls: Would they love him, would they not? But they couldn\u2019t love the gypsy either: He would be a thief, I fear, And would cause me many a tear. And many more men come to try their luck, among them a soldier: The soldier came to try the girls: Would they love him, would they not? But the soldier is rejected with contempt, in two indecent lines, sung with absolute frankness and producing a furore in the audience. The song ends with a merchant: The merchant came to try the girls: Would they love him, would they not? And it appears that he wins their love because: The merchant will make gold for me And his queen I\u2019ll gladly be."], "Katerina tries to send money to whom?": [" Hungering and thirsting for you in every cranny of my soul and even in my ribs? Why, to send you to father and to her, Katerina Ivanovna, so as to have done with her and with father. To send an angel. I might have sent any one, but I wanted to send an angel. And here you are on your way to see father and her.\u201d \u201cDid you really mean to send me?\u201d cried Alyosha with a distressed expression. \u201cStay! You knew it! And I see you understand it all at once. But be quiet, be quiet for a time. Don\u2019t be sorry, and don\u2019t cry.\u201d Dmitri stood up, thought a moment, and put his finger to his forehead. \u201cShe\u2019s asked you, written to you a letter or something, that\u2019s why you\u2019re going to her? You wouldn\u2019t be going except for that?\u201d \u201cHere is her note.\u201d Alyosha took it out of his pocket. Mitya looked through it quickly. \u201cAnd you were going the back\u2010way! Oh, gods, I thank you for sending him by the back\u2010way, and he came to me like the golden fish to the silly old fishermen in the fable!", " When they asked her about the three thousand she had entrusted to Mitya to post to her relations, she said firmly, \u201cI didn\u2019t give him the money simply to send it off. I felt at the time that he was in great need of money.... I gave him the three thousand on the understanding that he should post it within the month if he cared to. There was no need for him to worry himself about that debt afterwards.\u201d I will not repeat all the questions asked her and all her answers in detail. I will only give the substance of her evidence. \u201cI was firmly convinced that he would send off that sum as soon as he got money from his father,\u201d she went on. \u201cI have never doubted his disinterestedness and his honesty ... his scrupulous honesty ... in money matters. He felt quite certain that he would receive the money from his father, and spoke to me several times about it. I knew he had a feud with his father and have always believed that he had been unfairly treated by his father.", " Afterwards I pretended I had been to the town, but did not show her the post office receipt. I said I had sent the money and would bring the receipt, and so far I haven\u2019t brought it. I\u2019ve forgotten it. Now what do you think you\u2019re going to her to\u2010day to say? \u2018He sends his compliments,\u2019 and she\u2019ll ask you, \u2018What about the money?\u2019 You might still have said to her, \u2018He\u2019s a degraded sensualist, and a low creature, with uncontrolled passions. He didn\u2019t send your money then, but wasted it, because, like a low brute, he couldn\u2019t control himself.\u2019 But still you might have added, \u2018He isn\u2019t a thief though. Here is your three thousand; he sends it back. Send it yourself to Agafya Ivanovna. But he told me to say \u201che sends his compliments.\u201d \u2019 But, as it is, she will ask, \u2018But where is the money?\u2019 \u201d \u201cMitya, you are unhappy, yes! But not as unhappy as you think. Don\u2019t worry yourself to death with despair.\u201d \u201cWhat, do you suppose I\u2019d shoot myself because I can\u2019t get three thousand to pay back?", " As to the money spent the previous day, she declared that she did not know what sum it was, but had heard him tell several people that he had three thousand with him. And to the question where he got the money, she said that he had told her that he had \u201cstolen\u201d it from Katerina Ivanovna, and that she had replied to that that he hadn\u2019t stolen it, and that he must pay the money back next day. On the prosecutor\u2019s asking her emphatically whether the money he said he had stolen from Katerina Ivanovna was what he had spent yesterday, or what he had squandered here a month ago, she declared that he meant the money spent a month ago, and that that was how she understood him. Grushenka was at last released, and Nikolay Parfenovitch informed her impulsively that she might at once return to the town and that if he could be of any assistance to her, with horses for example, or if she would care for an escort, he ... would be\u2014 \u201cI thank you sincerely,\u201d said Grushenka, bowing to him, \u201cI\u2019m going with this old gentleman, I am driving him back to town with me, and meanwhile, if you\u2019ll allow me, I\u2019ll wait below to hear what you decide about Dmitri Fyodorovitch.\u201d She went out."], "Alyosha begins to plan a marriage with whom?": [" Sometimes he began praying ardently, he longed to pour out his thankfulness and love.... But when he had begun to pray, he passed suddenly to something else, and sank into thought, forgetting both the prayer and what had interrupted it. He began listening to what Father Pa\u00efssy was reading, but worn out with exhaustion he gradually began to doze. \u201c_And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee;_\u201d read Father Pa\u00efssy. \u201c_And the mother of Jesus was there; And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage._\u201d \u201cMarriage? What\u2019s that?... A marriage!\u201d floated whirling through Alyosha\u2019s mind. \u201cThere is happiness for her, too.... She has gone to the feast.... No, she has not taken the knife.... That was only a tragic phrase.... Well ... tragic phrases should be forgiven, they must be. Tragic phrases comfort the heart.... Without them, sorrow would be too heavy for men to bear.", " Then he went into his bedroom, lay down on the bed, exhausted, and in one minute he was asleep. Chapter III. A Meeting With The Schoolboys \u201cThank goodness he did not ask me about Grushenka,\u201d thought Alyosha, as he left his father\u2019s house and turned towards Madame Hohlakov\u2019s, \u201cor I might have to tell him of my meeting with Grushenka yesterday.\u201d Alyosha felt painfully that since yesterday both combatants had renewed their energies, and that their hearts had grown hard again. \u201cFather is spiteful and angry, he\u2019s made some plan and will stick to it. And what of Dmitri? He too will be harder than yesterday, he too must be spiteful and angry, and he too, no doubt, has made some plan. Oh, I must succeed in finding him to\u2010day, whatever happens.\u201d But Alyosha had not long to meditate. An incident occurred on the road, which, though apparently of little consequence, made a great impression on him. Just after he had crossed the square and turned the corner coming out into Mihailovsky Street, which is divided by a small ditch from the High Street (our whole town is intersected by ditches), he saw a group of schoolboys between the ages of nine and twelve, at the bridge.", " I suppose you still regard that security as of value?\u201d Mitya suddenly crimsoned. \u201cSurely you don\u2019t think me such an out and out scoundrel as that? You can\u2019t be speaking in earnest?\u201d he said, with indignation, looking the prosecutor straight in the face, and seeming unable to believe his ears. \u201cI assure you I\u2019m in earnest.... Why do you imagine I\u2019m not serious?\u201d It was the prosecutor\u2019s turn to be surprised. \u201cOh, how base that would have been! Gentlemen, do you know, you are torturing me! Let me tell you everything, so be it. I\u2019ll confess all my infernal wickedness, but to put you to shame, and you\u2019ll be surprised yourselves at the depth of ignominy to which a medley of human passions can sink. You must know that I already had that plan myself, that plan you spoke of, just now, prosecutor! Yes, gentlemen, I, too, have had that thought in my mind all this current month, so that I was on the point of deciding to go to Katya\u2014I was mean enough for that.", " \u201cEven if my benefactor must die without me, anyway I won\u2019t have to reproach myself all my life with the thought that I might have saved something and did not, but passed by and hastened home. If I do as I intend, I shall be following his great precept.\u201d His plan was to catch his brother Dmitri unawares, to climb over the fence, as he had the day before, get into the garden and sit in the summer\u2010house. If Dmitri were not there, thought Alyosha, he would not announce himself to Foma or the women of the house, but would remain hidden in the summer\u2010house, even if he had to wait there till evening. If, as before, Dmitri were lying in wait for Grushenka to come, he would be very likely to come to the summer\u2010house. Alyosha did not, however, give much thought to the details of his plan, but resolved to act upon it, even if it meant not getting back to the monastery that day. Everything happened without hindrance, he climbed over the hurdle almost in the same spot as the day before, and stole into the summer\u2010house unseen."], "Alyosha decides to help Dmitri, but he would much rather visit whom?": [" It was just after fancying this, that he met Alyosha in the street. He stopped him at once, and put a question to him: \u201cDo you remember when Dmitri burst in after dinner and beat father, and afterwards I told you in the yard that I reserved \u2018the right to desire\u2019?... Tell me, did you think then that I desired father\u2019s death or not?\u201d \u201cI did think so,\u201d answered Alyosha, softly. \u201cIt was so, too; it was not a matter of guessing. But didn\u2019t you fancy then that what I wished was just that \u2018one reptile should devour another\u2019; that is, just that Dmitri should kill father, and as soon as possible ... and that I myself was even prepared to help to bring that about?\u201d Alyosha turned rather pale, and looked silently into his brother\u2019s face. \u201cSpeak!\u201d cried Ivan, \u201cI want above everything to know what you thought then. I want the truth, the truth!\u201d He drew a deep breath, looking angrily at Alyosha before his answer came.", " Why Ivan Fyodorovitch had come amongst us I remember asking myself at the time with a certain uneasiness. This fateful visit, which was the first step leading to so many consequences, I never fully explained to myself. It seemed strange on the face of it that a young man so learned, so proud, and apparently so cautious, should suddenly visit such an infamous house and a father who had ignored him all his life, hardly knew him, never thought of him, and would not under any circumstances have given him money, though he was always afraid that his sons Ivan and Alexey would also come to ask him for it. And here the young man was staying in the house of such a father, had been living with him for two months, and they were on the best possible terms. This last fact was a special cause of wonder to many others as well as to me. Pyotr Alexandrovitch Mi\u00fcsov, of whom we have spoken already, the cousin of Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s first wife, happened to be in the neighborhood again on a visit to his estate.", " He felt more and more sick with anxiety and impatience. \u201cYes, I know it was that old man Grigory murdered him.\u201d \u201cGrigory?\u201d cried Alyosha. \u201cYes, yes; it was Grigory. He lay as Dmitri Fyodorovitch struck him down, and then got up, saw the door open, went in and killed Fyodor Pavlovitch.\u201d \u201cBut why, why?\u201d \u201cSuffering from aberration. When he recovered from the blow Dmitri Fyodorovitch gave him on the head, he was suffering from aberration; he went and committed the murder. As for his saying he didn\u2019t, he very likely doesn\u2019t remember. Only, you know, it\u2019ll be better, ever so much better, if Dmitri Fyodorovitch murdered him. And that\u2019s how it must have been, though I say it was Grigory. It certainly was Dmitri Fyodorovitch, and that\u2019s better, ever so much better! Oh! not better that a son should have killed his father, I don\u2019t defend that. Children ought to honor their parents, and yet it would be better if it were he, as you\u2019d have nothing to cry over then, for he did it when he was unconscious or rather when he was conscious, but did not know what he was doing.", " No, sir, I won\u2019t thrash my boy for your satisfaction.\u201d He had gone back to his original tone of resentful buffoonery. Alyosha felt though that he trusted him, and that if there had been some one else in his, Alyosha\u2019s place, the man would not have spoken so openly and would not have told what he had just told. This encouraged Alyosha, whose heart was trembling on the verge of tears. \u201cAh, how I would like to make friends with your boy!\u201d he cried. \u201cIf you could arrange it\u2014\u201d \u201cCertainly, sir,\u201d muttered the captain. \u201cBut now listen to something quite different!\u201d Alyosha went on. \u201cI have a message for you. That same brother of mine, Dmitri, has insulted his betrothed, too, a noble\u2010hearted girl of whom you have probably heard. I have a right to tell you of her wrong; I ought to do so, in fact, for hearing of the insult done to you and learning all about your unfortunate position, she commissioned me at once\u2014just now\u2014to bring you this help from her\u2014but only from her alone, not from Dmitri, who has abandoned her."], "At the restaurant, what does Ivan say about his responsibility to Fyodor and Dmitri?": [" I went, but didn\u2019t find Dmitri Fyodorovitch at home, though it was eight o\u2019clock. \u2018He\u2019s been here, but he is quite gone,\u2019 those were the very words of his landlady. It\u2019s as though there was an understanding between them. Perhaps at this moment he is in the restaurant with Ivan Fyodorovitch, for Ivan Fyodorovitch has not been home to dinner and Fyodor Pavlovitch dined alone an hour ago, and is gone to lie down. But I beg you most particularly not to speak of me and of what I have told you, for he\u2019d kill me for nothing at all.\u201d \u201cBrother Ivan invited Dmitri to the restaurant to\u2010day?\u201d repeated Alyosha quickly. \u201cThat\u2019s so.\u201d \u201cThe Metropolis tavern in the market\u2010place?\u201d \u201cThe very same.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s quite likely,\u201d cried Alyosha, much excited. \u201cThank you, Smerdyakov; that\u2019s important. I\u2019ll go there at once.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t betray me,\u201d Smerdyakov called after him. \u201cOh, no, I\u2019ll go to the tavern as though by chance.", " \u201cYes, if you like, \u2018everything is lawful\u2019 since the word has been said. I won\u2019t deny it. And Mitya\u2019s version isn\u2019t bad.\u201d Alyosha looked at him in silence. \u201cI thought that going away from here I have you at least,\u201d Ivan said suddenly, with unexpected feeling; \u201cbut now I see that there is no place for me even in your heart, my dear hermit. The formula, \u2018all is lawful,\u2019 I won\u2019t renounce\u2014will you renounce me for that, yes?\u201d Alyosha got up, went to him and softly kissed him on the lips. \u201cThat\u2019s plagiarism,\u201d cried Ivan, highly delighted. \u201cYou stole that from my poem. Thank you though. Get up, Alyosha, it\u2019s time we were going, both of us.\u201d They went out, but stopped when they reached the entrance of the restaurant. \u201cListen, Alyosha,\u201d Ivan began in a resolute voice, \u201cif I am really able to care for the sticky little leaves I shall only love them, remembering you. It\u2019s enough for me that you are somewhere here, and I shan\u2019t lose my desire for life yet.", " He says if I let Agrafena Alexandrovna in and she passes the night there, I\u2019ll be the first to suffer for it. I am terribly afraid of him, and if I were not even more afraid of doing so, I ought to let the police know. God only knows what he might not do!\u201d \u201cHis honor said to him the other day, \u2018I\u2019ll pound you in a mortar!\u2019 \u201d added Marya Kondratyevna. \u201cOh, if it\u2019s pounding in a mortar, it may be only talk,\u201d observed Alyosha. \u201cIf I could meet him, I might speak to him about that too.\u201d \u201cWell, the only thing I can tell you is this,\u201d said Smerdyakov, as though thinking better of it; \u201cI am here as an old friend and neighbor, and it would be odd if I didn\u2019t come. On the other hand, Ivan Fyodorovitch sent me first thing this morning to your brother\u2019s lodging in Lake Street, without a letter, but with a message to Dmitri Fyodorovitch to go to dine with him at the restaurant here, in the market\u2010place.", " Grigory rushed to Marfa and sent her to Lizaveta, while he ran to fetch an old midwife who lived close by. They saved the baby, but Lizaveta died at dawn. Grigory took the baby, brought it home, and making his wife sit down, put it on her lap. \u201cA child of God\u2014an orphan is akin to all,\u201d he said, \u201cand to us above others. Our little lost one has sent us this, who has come from the devil\u2019s son and a holy innocent. Nurse him and weep no more.\u201d So Marfa brought up the child. He was christened Pavel, to which people were not slow in adding Fyodorovitch (son of Fyodor). Fyodor Pavlovitch did not object to any of this, and thought it amusing, though he persisted vigorously in denying his responsibility. The townspeople were pleased at his adopting the foundling. Later on, Fyodor Pavlovitch invented a surname for the child, calling him Smerdyakov, after his mother\u2019s nickname. So this Smerdyakov became Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s second servant, and was living in the lodge with Grigory and Marfa at the time our story begins."], "In a conversation with Alyosha, Ivan explains that he has trouble doing what?": [" And the doctor here, Mr. Varvinsky, maintained to all of them that it was just the thought of it brought it on, the apprehension that I might fall. It was just then that the fit seized me. And so they\u2019ve written it down, that it\u2019s just how it must have happened, simply from my fear.\u201d As he finished, Smerdyakov drew a deep breath, as though exhausted. \u201cThen you have said all that in your evidence?\u201d said Ivan, somewhat taken aback. He had meant to frighten him with the threat of repeating their conversation, and it appeared that Smerdyakov had already reported it all himself. \u201cWhat have I to be afraid of? Let them write down the whole truth,\u201d Smerdyakov pronounced firmly. \u201cAnd have you told them every word of our conversation at the gate?\u201d \u201cNo, not to say every word.\u201d \u201cAnd did you tell them that you can sham fits, as you boasted then?\u201d \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t tell them that either.\u201d \u201cTell me now, why did you send me then to Tchermashnya?\u201d \u201cI was afraid you\u2019d go away to Moscow; Tchermashnya is nearer, anyway.\u201d \u201cYou are lying; you suggested my going away yourself; you told me to get out of the way of trouble.\u201d \u201cThat was simply out of affection and my sincere devotion to you, foreseeing trouble in the house, to spare you.", " He only laughed contemptuously at Grigory\u2019s evidence about the open door, and declared that it was \u201cthe devil that opened it.\u201d But he could not bring forward any coherent explanation of the fact. He even succeeded in insulting Ivan during their first interview, telling him sharply that it was not for people who declared that \u201ceverything was lawful,\u201d to suspect and question him. Altogether he was anything but friendly with Ivan on that occasion. Immediately after that interview with Mitya, Ivan went for the first time to see Smerdyakov. In the railway train on his way from Moscow, he kept thinking of Smerdyakov and of his last conversation with him on the evening before he went away. Many things seemed to him puzzling and suspicious. But when he gave his evidence to the investigating lawyer Ivan said nothing, for the time, of that conversation. He put that off till he had seen Smerdyakov, who was at that time in the hospital.", " Alyosha saw at once that she had asked Ivan that question before, perhaps only a moment before he came in, and not for the first time, but for the hundredth, and that they had ended by quarreling. \u201cI\u2019ve been to see Smerdyakov.... It was you, you who persuaded me that he murdered his father. It\u2019s only you I believed!\u201d she continued, still addressing Ivan. He gave her a sort of strained smile. Alyosha started at her tone. He had not suspected such familiar intimacy between them. \u201cWell, that\u2019s enough, anyway,\u201d Ivan cut short the conversation. \u201cI am going. I\u2019ll come to\u2010morrow.\u201d And turning at once, he walked out of the room and went straight downstairs. With an imperious gesture, Katerina Ivanovna seized Alyosha by both hands. \u201cFollow him! Overtake him! Don\u2019t leave him alone for a minute!\u201d she said, in a hurried whisper. \u201cHe\u2019s mad! Don\u2019t you know that he\u2019s mad? He is in a fever, nervous fever.", " In his account, Father Zossima\u2019s talk goes on without interruption, as though he told his life to his friends in the form of a story, though there is no doubt, from other accounts of it, that the conversation that evening was general. Though the guests did not interrupt Father Zossima much, yet they too talked, perhaps even told something themselves. Besides, Father Zossima could not have carried on an uninterrupted narrative, for he was sometimes gasping for breath, his voice failed him, and he even lay down to rest on his bed, though he did not fall asleep and his visitors did not leave their seats. Once or twice the conversation was interrupted by Father Pa\u00efssy\u2019s reading the Gospel.

In his old age he reached the clear conviction that nothing but the advice of the great dread spirit could build up any tolerable sort of life for the feeble, unruly, \u2018incomplete, empirical creatures created in jest.\u2019 And so, convinced of this, he sees that he must follow the counsel of the wise spirit, the dread spirit of death and destruction, and therefore accept lying and deception, and lead men consciously to death and destruction, and yet deceive them all the way so that they may not notice where they are being led, that the poor blind creatures may at least on the way think themselves happy.", " The doctor told me so.

Alyosha followed him. \u201cAnd do you know, Alexey Fyodorovitch, how people do go out of their mind?\u201d Ivan asked in a voice suddenly quiet, without a trace of irritation, with a note of the simplest curiosity. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I suppose there are all kinds of insanity.\u201d \u201cAnd can one observe that one\u2019s going mad oneself?\u201d \u201cI imagine one can\u2019t see oneself clearly in such circumstances,\u201d Alyosha answered with surprise. Ivan paused for half a minute.", " Intense, infinite compassion overwhelmed him instantly. There was a poignant ache in his torn heart. \u201cLove Ivan!\u201d\u2014he suddenly recalled Mitya\u2019s words. And he was going to Ivan. He badly wanted to see Ivan all day. He was as much worried about Ivan as about Mitya, and more than ever now. Chapter V. Not You, Not You! On the way to Ivan he had to pass the house where Katerina Ivanovna was living. There was light in the windows. He suddenly stopped and resolved to go in. He had not seen Katerina Ivanovna for more than a week. But now it struck him that Ivan might be with her, especially on the eve of the terrible day. Ringing, and mounting the staircase, which was dimly lighted by a Chinese lantern, he saw a man coming down, and as they met, he recognized him as his brother. So he was just coming from Katerina Ivanovna. \u201cAh, it\u2019s only you,\u201d said Ivan dryly. \u201cWell, good\u2010by! You are going to her?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t advise you to; she\u2019s upset and you\u2019ll upset her more.\u201d A door was instantly flung open above, and a voice cried suddenly: \u201cNo, no!", " And Katerina Ivanovna will not in the end refuse such a fascinating man as Ivan. She\u2019s hesitating between the two of them already. And how has that Ivan won you all, so that you all worship him? He is laughing at you, and enjoying himself at your expense.\u201d \u201cHow do you know? How can you speak so confidently?\u201d Alyosha asked sharply, frowning. \u201cWhy do you ask, and are frightened at my answer? It shows that you know I\u2019m speaking the truth.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t like Ivan. Ivan wouldn\u2019t be tempted by money.\u201d \u201cReally? And the beauty of Katerina Ivanovna? It\u2019s not only the money, though a fortune of sixty thousand is an attraction.\u201d \u201cIvan is above that. He wouldn\u2019t make up to any one for thousands. It is not money, it\u2019s not comfort Ivan is seeking. Perhaps it\u2019s suffering he is seeking.\u201d \u201cWhat wild dream now? Oh, you\u2014aristocrats!\u201d \u201cAh, Misha, he has a stormy spirit. His mind is in bondage. He is haunted by a great, unsolved doubt."], "Smerdyakov tells Ivan about the secret signs Grushenka might send to whom?": [" \u201cSet my mind at rest that I may know the worst that\u2019s in store for me.

Perhaps he wants to tell me, but doesn\u2019t dare to. He warns me. There is a secret, he tells me, but he won\u2019t tell me what it is.\u201d \u201cWhat do you think yourself?\u201d \u201cWhat do I think? It\u2019s the end for me, that\u2019s what I think.

A week ago he suddenly told me that Ivan was in love with Katerina, because he often goes to see her.", " In the yard stood a covered cart. Horses were being taken out of the shafts, men were running to and fro with a lantern. Three fresh horses were being led in at the open gate. But when Alyosha and Rakitin reached the bottom of the steps, Grushenka\u2019s bedroom window was suddenly opened and she called in a ringing voice after Alyosha: \u201cAlyosha, give my greetings to your brother Mitya and tell him not to remember evil against me, though I have brought him misery.

He galloped here from Moscow at once, of course, before I was taken ill; and the second time was a week ago. He told Mitya not to tell you about it, under any circumstances; and not to tell any one, in fact. He came secretly.\u201d Alyosha sat plunged in thought, considering something. The news evidently impressed him. \u201cIvan doesn\u2019t talk to me of Mitya\u2019s case,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cHe\u2019s said very little to me these last two months.

H\u2019m!... if he was there a week ago ... there certainly has been a change in Mitya this week.\u201d \u201cThere has been a change,\u201d Grushenka assented quickly. \u201cThey have a secret, they have a secret!

Next day, of course, when he was sober, he regretted the broken cups and saucers. Alyosha knew that his father would let him go back to the monastery next day, possibly even that evening. Moreover, he was fully persuaded that his father might hurt any one else, but would not hurt him. Alyosha was certain that no one in the whole world ever would want to hurt him, and, what is more, he knew that no one could hurt him. This was for him an axiom, assumed once for all without question, and he went his way without hesitation, relying on it. But at that moment an anxiety of a different sort disturbed him, and worried him the more because he could not formulate it.", " Wait a bit, brother, I\u2019ll throw them into the pool on the road,\u201d answered Mitya. \u201cFenya, get up, don\u2019t kneel to me.

My last tear is for you!...\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s not drunk, but he keeps babbling like a lunatic,\u201d Pyotr Ilyitch thought as he watched him go.

Good\u2010by!\u201d and passed by, trying not even to look at his father. Very possibly the old man was too hateful to him at that moment; but such an unceremonious display of hostility was a surprise even to Fyodor Pavlovitch. And the old man evidently wanted to tell him something at once and had come to meet him in the drawing\u2010room on purpose. Receiving this amiable greeting, he stood still in silence and with an ironical air watched his son going upstairs, till he passed out of sight. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with him?\u201d he promptly asked Smerdyakov, who had followed Ivan. \u201cAngry about something.", " But in the left eye, which was screwed up and seemed to be insinuating something, Smerdyakov showed himself unchanged. \u201cIt\u2019s always worth while speaking to a clever man.\u201d Ivan was reminded of that at once. He sat down on the stool at his feet. Smerdyakov, with painful effort, shifted his position in bed, but he was not the first to speak. He remained dumb, and did not even look much interested. \u201cCan you talk to me?\u201d asked Ivan. \u201cI won\u2019t tire you much.\u201d \u201cCertainly I can,\u201d mumbled Smerdyakov, in a faint voice. \u201cHas your honor been back long?\u201d he added patronizingly, as though encouraging a nervous visitor. \u201cI only arrived to\u2010day.... To see the mess you are in here.\u201d Smerdyakov sighed. \u201cWhy do you sigh? You knew of it all along,\u201d Ivan blurted out.

A nightmare of ideas and sensations filled his soul. \u201cShall I go at once and give information against Smerdyakov? But what information can I give? He is not guilty, anyway. On the contrary, he\u2019ll accuse me. And in fact, why did I set off for Tchermashnya then? What for? What for?\u201d Ivan asked himself. \u201cYes, of course, I was expecting something and he is right....\u201d And he remembered for the hundredth time how, on the last night in his father\u2019s house, he had listened on the stairs. But he remembered it now with such anguish that he stood still on the spot as though he had been stabbed. \u201cYes, I expected it then, that\u2019s true! I wanted the murder, I did want the murder! Did I want the murder? Did I want it? I must kill Smerdyakov! If I don\u2019t dare kill Smerdyakov now, life is not worth living!\u201d Ivan did not go home, but went straight to Katerina Ivanovna and alarmed her by his appearance.", " But these rumors were not quite just. Our prosecutor was not one of those men who lose heart in face of danger. On the contrary, his self\u2010confidence increased with the increase of danger. It must be noted that our prosecutor was in general too hasty and morbidly impressionable. He would put his whole soul into some case and work at it as though his whole fate and his whole fortune depended on its result. This was the subject of some ridicule in the legal world, for just by this characteristic our prosecutor had gained a wider notoriety than could have been expected from his modest position. People laughed particularly at his passion for psychology. In my opinion, they were wrong, and our prosecutor was, I believe, a character of greater depth than was generally supposed. But with his delicate health he had failed to make his mark at the outset of his career and had never made up for it later.", " Speak out what you want!\u201d Ivan cried angrily at last, passing from meekness to violence. Smerdyakov drew his right foot up to his left, pulled himself up, but still looked at him with the same serenity and the same little smile. \u201cSubstantially nothing\u2014but just by way of conversation.\u201d Another silence followed. They did not speak for nearly a minute. Ivan knew that he ought to get up and show anger, and Smerdyakov stood before him and seemed to be waiting as though to see whether he would be angry or not. So at least it seemed to Ivan. At last he moved to get up. Smerdyakov seemed to seize the moment. \u201cI\u2019m in an awful position, Ivan Fyodorovitch. I don\u2019t know how to help myself,\u201d he said resolutely and distinctly, and at his last word he sighed.

What did you mean by that? If I go away, you see what will happen here.\u201d Ivan drew his breath with difficulty. \u201cPrecisely so,\u201d said Smerdyakov, softly and reasonably, watching Ivan intently, however. \u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018precisely so\u2019?\u201d Ivan questioned him, with a menacing light in his eyes, restraining himself with difficulty. \u201cI spoke because I felt sorry for you. If I were in your place I should simply throw it all up ... rather than stay on in such a position,\u201d answered Smerdyakov, with the most candid air looking at Ivan\u2019s flashing eyes. They were both silent. \u201cYou seem to be a perfect idiot, and what\u2019s more ... an awful scoundrel, too.\u201d Ivan rose suddenly from the bench. He was about to pass straight through the gate, but he stopped short and turned to Smerdyakov. Something strange followed."], "What happens to Smerdyakov, about which he had earlier expressed fear?": [" Ivan, in a sudden paroxysm, bit his lip, clenched his fists, and, in another minute, would have flung himself on Smerdyakov. The latter, anyway, noticed it at the same moment, started, and shrank back. But the moment passed without mischief to Smerdyakov, and Ivan turned in silence, as it seemed in perplexity, to the gate. \u201cI am going away to Moscow to\u2010morrow, if you care to know\u2014early to\u2010morrow morning. That\u2019s all!\u201d he suddenly said aloud angrily, and wondered himself afterwards what need there was to say this then to Smerdyakov. \u201cThat\u2019s the best thing you can do,\u201d he responded, as though he had expected to hear it; \u201cexcept that you can always be telegraphed for from Moscow, if anything should happen here.\u201d Ivan stopped again, and again turned quickly to Smerdyakov. But a change had passed over him, too. All his familiarity and carelessness had completely disappeared. His face expressed attention and expectation, intent but timid and cringing.", " Leave off,\u201d Ivan said peremptorily, sitting down again. \u201cDon\u2019t put me out of all patience.\u201d Smerdyakov took the rag from his eyes.

Smerdyakov smiled contemptuously. \u201cYou know of yourself, for a fact, that it wasn\u2019t I murdered him. And I should have thought that there was no need for a sensible man to speak of it again.\u201d \u201cBut why, why had you such a suspicion about me at the time?\u201d \u201cAs you know already, it was simply from fear.", " \u201cAnd you don\u2019t even suspect him?\u201d \u201cWhy, do you suspect him?\u201d \u201cHe is suspected, too.\u201d Mitya fixed his eyes on the floor. \u201cJoking apart,\u201d he brought out gloomily. \u201cListen.

The charge is confirmed by three persons only\u2014the two brothers of the prisoner and Madame Svyetlov. The elder of these brothers expressed his suspicions only to\u2010day, when he was undoubtedly suffering from brain fever. But we know that for the last two months he has completely shared our conviction of his brother\u2019s guilt and did not attempt to combat that idea. But of that later.

Alyosha knew that this actually happened sometimes. He knew, too, that there were among the monks some who deeply resented the fact that letters from relations were habitually taken to the elder, to be opened and read by him before those to whom they were addressed. It was assumed, of course, that all this was done freely, and in good faith, by way of voluntary submission and salutary guidance. But, in fact, there was sometimes no little insincerity, and much that was false and strained in this practice. Yet the older and more experienced of the monks adhered to their opinion, arguing that \u201cfor those who have come within these walls sincerely seeking salvation, such obedience and sacrifice will certainly be salutary and of great benefit; those, on the other hand, who find it irksome, and repine, are no true monks, and have made a mistake in entering the monastery\u2014their proper place is in the world.", " He sometimes astounded and almost alarmed his visitors by his knowledge of their secrets before they had spoken a word. Alyosha noticed that many, almost all, went in to the elder for the first time with apprehension and uneasiness, but came out with bright and happy faces. Alyosha was particularly struck by the fact that Father Zossima was not at all stern. On the contrary, he was always almost gay. The monks used to say that he was more drawn to those who were more sinful, and the greater the sinner the more he loved him. There were, no doubt, up to the end of his life, among the monks some who hated and envied him, but they were few in number and they were silent, though among them were some of great dignity in the monastery, one, for instance, of the older monks distinguished for his strict keeping of fasts and vows of silence. But the majority were on Father Zossima\u2019s side and very many of them loved him with all their hearts, warmly and sincerely."], "Before dying, Zosima does what?": [" Your boy might have been bitten by a mad dog and he would become mad and bite any one near him.

So this is the explanation of her dreadful night and her hysterics of late! It means love to the daughter but death to the mother. I might as well be in my grave at once.

Smerdyakov With A Guitar He had no time to lose indeed. Even while he was saying good\u2010by to Lise, the thought had struck him that he must attempt some stratagem to find his brother Dmitri, who was evidently keeping out of his way. It was getting late, nearly three o\u2019clock. Alyosha\u2019s whole soul turned to the monastery, to his dying saint, but the necessity of seeing Dmitri outweighed everything. The conviction that a great inevitable catastrophe was about to happen grew stronger in Alyosha\u2019s mind with every hour. What that catastrophe was, and what he would say at that moment to his brother, he could perhaps not have said definitely.", " At the gate of the house Alyosha was met by the shouts of the boys, Ilusha\u2019s schoolfellows. They had all been impatiently expecting him and were glad that he had come at last. There were about twelve of them, they all had their school\u2010bags or satchels on their shoulders. \u201cFather will cry, be with father,\u201d Ilusha had told them as he lay dying, and the boys remembered it. Kolya Krassotkin was the foremost of them. \u201cHow glad I am you\u2019ve come, Karamazov!\u201d he cried, holding out his hand to Alyosha. \u201cIt\u2019s awful here. It\u2019s really horrible to see it. Snegiryov is not drunk, we know for a fact he\u2019s had nothing to drink to\u2010day, but he seems as if he were drunk ... I am always manly, but this is awful. Karamazov, if I am not keeping you, one question before you go in?\u201d \u201cWhat is it, Kolya?\u201d said Alyosha. \u201cIs your brother innocent or guilty? Was it he killed your father or was it the valet? As you say, so it will be."], "After Zosima\u2019s death, what do some people in the monastery expect?": [" He seemed suddenly to feel an acute pain in his chest, he turned pale and pressed his hands to his heart. All rose from their seats and hastened to him. But though suffering, he still looked at them with a smile, sank slowly from his chair on to his knees, then bowed his face to the ground, stretched out his arms and as though in joyful ecstasy, praying and kissing the ground, quietly and joyfully gave up his soul to God. The news of his death spread at once through the hermitage and reached the monastery. The nearest friends of the deceased and those whose duty it was from their position began to lay out the corpse according to the ancient ritual, and all the monks gathered together in the church. And before dawn the news of the death reached the town. By the morning all the town was talking of the event, and crowds were flocking from the town to the monastery. But this subject will be treated in the next book; I will only add here that before a day had passed something happened so unexpected, so strange, upsetting, and bewildering in its effect on the monks and the townspeople, that after all these years, that day of general suspense is still vividly remembered in the town.", " I repeat, it is incomplete and fragmentary. Biographical details, for instance, cover only Father Zossima\u2019s earliest youth. Of his teaching and opinions we find brought together sayings evidently uttered on very different occasions. His utterances during the last few hours have not been kept separate from the rest, but their general character can be gathered from what we have in Alexey Fyodorovitch\u2019s manuscript. The elder\u2019s death came in the end quite unexpectedly. For although those who were gathered about him that last evening realized that his death was approaching, yet it was difficult to imagine that it would come so suddenly. On the contrary, his friends, as I observed already, seeing him that night apparently so cheerful and talkative, were convinced that there was at least a temporary change for the better in his condition. Even five minutes before his death, they said afterwards wonderingly, it was impossible to foresee it.", " The thing is so simple that sometimes one is even afraid to put it into words, for fear of being laughed at, and yet how true it is! One who does not believe in God will not believe in God\u2019s people. He who believes in God\u2019s people will see His Holiness too, even though he had not believed in it till then. Only the people and their future spiritual power will convert our atheists, who have torn themselves away from their native soil. And what is the use of Christ\u2019s words, unless we set an example? The people is lost without the Word of God, for its soul is athirst for the Word and for all that is good. In my youth, long ago, nearly forty years ago, I traveled all over Russia with Father Anfim, collecting funds for our monastery, and we stayed one night on the bank of a great navigable river with some fishermen. A good\u2010 looking peasant lad, about eighteen, joined us; he had to hurry back next morning to pull a merchant\u2019s barge along the bank.", " I think I have a right to conjecture why. His health had been giving way for a week past: he had admitted to a doctor and to his most intimate friends that he was suffering from hallucinations and seeing phantoms of the dead: he was on the eve of the attack of brain fever by which he has been stricken down to\u2010day. In this condition he suddenly heard of Smerdyakov\u2019s death, and at once reflected, \u2018The man is dead, I can throw the blame on him and save my brother. I have money. I will take a roll of notes and say that Smerdyakov gave them me before his death.\u2019 You will say that was dishonorable: it\u2019s dishonorable to slander even the dead, and even to save a brother. True, but what if he slandered him unconsciously? What if, finally unhinged by the sudden news of the valet\u2019s death, he imagined it really was so? You saw the recent scene: you have seen the witness\u2019s condition. He was standing up and was speaking, but where was his mind?"], "What omen causes people within the monastery to disagree about Zosima?": [" He was reverenced during his lifetime as a crazy saint by all the pilgrims to the monastery. There was a tradition that both of these had lain in their coffins as though alive, that they had shown no signs of decomposition when they were buried and that there had been a holy light in their faces. And some people even insisted that a sweet fragrance came from their bodies. Yet, in spite of these edifying memories, it would be difficult to explain the frivolity, absurdity and malice that were manifested beside the coffin of Father Zossima. It is my private opinion that several different causes were simultaneously at work, one of which was the deeply\u2010rooted hostility to the institution of elders as a pernicious innovation, an antipathy hidden deep in the hearts of many of the monks. Even more powerful was jealousy of the dead man\u2019s saintliness, so firmly established during his lifetime that it was almost a forbidden thing to question it.", " I cut off my superfluous and unnecessary desires, I subdue my proud and wanton will and chastise it with obedience, and with God\u2019s help I attain freedom of spirit and with it spiritual joy. Which is most capable of conceiving a great idea and serving it\u2014the rich man in his isolation or the man who has freed himself from the tyranny of material things and habits? The monk is reproached for his solitude, \u201cYou have secluded yourself within the walls of the monastery for your own salvation, and have forgotten the brotherly service of humanity!\u201d But we shall see which will be most zealous in the cause of brotherly love. For it is not we, but they, who are in isolation, though they don\u2019t see that. Of old, leaders of the people came from among us, and why should they not again? The same meek and humble ascetics will rise up and go out to work for the great cause. The salvation of Russia comes from the people.", " And never, never, all his life long, could Alyosha forget that minute. \u201cSome one visited my soul in that hour,\u201d he used to say afterwards, with implicit faith in his words. Within three days he left the monastery in accordance with the words of his elder, who had bidden him \u201csojourn in the world.\u201d Book VIII. Mitya Chapter I. Kuzma Samsonov But Dmitri, to whom Grushenka, flying away to a new life, had left her last greetings, bidding him remember the hour of her love for ever, knew nothing of what had happened to her, and was at that moment in a condition of feverish agitation and activity. For the last two days he had been in such an inconceivable state of mind that he might easily have fallen ill with brain fever, as he said himself afterwards. Alyosha had not been able to find him the morning before, and Ivan had not succeeded in meeting him at the tavern on the same day. The people at his lodgings, by his orders, concealed his movements.", " Besides he had, before visiting the monastery, a strong prejudice against the institution of \u201celders,\u201d which he only knew of by hearsay and believed to be a pernicious innovation. Before he had been long at the monastery, he had detected the secret murmurings of some shallow brothers who disliked the institution. He was, besides, a meddlesome, inquisitive man, who poked his nose into everything. This was why the news of the fresh \u201cmiracle\u201d performed by Father Zossima reduced him to extreme perplexity. Alyosha remembered afterwards how their inquisitive guest from Obdorsk had been continually flitting to and fro from one group to another, listening and asking questions among the monks that were crowding within and without the elder\u2019s cell. But he did not pay much attention to him at the time, and only recollected it afterwards. He had no thought to spare for it indeed, for when Father Zossima, feeling tired again, had gone back to bed, he thought of Alyosha as he was closing his eyes, and sent for him."], "Who teases Alyosha about his unhappiness and convinces him to visit Grushenka?": [" Why Ivan Fyodorovitch had come amongst us I remember asking myself at the time with a certain uneasiness. This fateful visit, which was the first step leading to so many consequences, I never fully explained to myself. It seemed strange on the face of it that a young man so learned, so proud, and apparently so cautious, should suddenly visit such an infamous house and a father who had ignored him all his life, hardly knew him, never thought of him, and would not under any circumstances have given him money, though he was always afraid that his sons Ivan and Alexey would also come to ask him for it. And here the young man was staying in the house of such a father, had been living with him for two months, and they were on the best possible terms. This last fact was a special cause of wonder to many others as well as to me. Pyotr Alexandrovitch Mi\u00fcsov, of whom we have spoken already, the cousin of Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s first wife, happened to be in the neighborhood again on a visit to his estate.", " He flew towards the town, urged on the driver, and suddenly made a new and \u201cunalterable\u201d plan to procure that \u201caccursed money\u201d before evening. \u201cAnd to think, only to think that a man\u2019s life should be ruined for the sake of that paltry three thousand!\u201d he cried, contemptuously. \u201cI\u2019ll settle it to\u2010 day.\u201d And if it had not been for the thought of Grushenka and of what might have happened to her, which never left him, he would perhaps have become quite cheerful again.... But the thought of her was stabbing him to the heart every moment, like a sharp knife. At last they arrived, and Mitya at once ran to Grushenka. Chapter III. Gold\u2010Mines This was the visit of Mitya of which Grushenka had spoken to Rakitin with such horror. She was just then expecting the \u201cmessage,\u201d and was much relieved that Mitya had not been to see her that day or the day before. She hoped that \u201cplease God he won\u2019t come till I\u2019m gone away,\u201d and he suddenly burst in on her.", " Moreover, in the \u201cofficer\u2019s\u201d first letter which had been shown to Mitya, the possibility of his new rival\u2019s visit was very vaguely suggested. The letter was very indefinite, high\u2010flown, and full of sentimentality. It must be noted that Grushenka had concealed from him the last lines of the letter, in which his return was alluded to more definitely. He had, besides, noticed at that moment, he remembered afterwards, a certain involuntary proud contempt for this missive from Siberia on Grushenka\u2019s face. Grushenka told him nothing of what had passed later between her and this rival; so that by degrees he had completely forgotten the officer\u2019s existence. He felt that whatever might come later, whatever turn things might take, his final conflict with Fyodor Pavlovitch was close upon him, and must be decided before anything else. With a sinking heart he was expecting every moment Grushenka\u2019s decision, always believing that it would come suddenly, on the impulse of the moment.", " When it got dark and the shutters were closed, Fenya asked her mistress: \u201cIs the gentleman going to stay the night, mistress?\u201d \u201cYes; make him a bed on the sofa,\u201d answered Grushenka. Questioning him more in detail, Grushenka learned from him that he had literally nowhere to go, and that \u201cMr. Kalganov, my benefactor, told me straight that he wouldn\u2019t receive me again and gave me five roubles.\u201d \u201cWell, God bless you, you\u2019d better stay, then,\u201d Grushenka decided in her grief, smiling compassionately at him. Her smile wrung the old man\u2019s heart and his lips twitched with grateful tears. And so the destitute wanderer had stayed with her ever since. He did not leave the house even when she was ill. Fenya and her grandmother, the cook, did not turn him out, but went on serving him meals and making up his bed on the sofa. Grushenka had grown used to him, and coming back from seeing Mitya (whom she had begun to visit in prison before she was really well) she would sit down and begin talking to \u201cMaximushka\u201d about trifling matters, to keep her from thinking of her sorrow."], "When Alyosha and Rakitin arrive, Grushenka tells them that she is awaiting a message from whom?": [" In the yard stood a covered cart. Horses were being taken out of the shafts, men were running to and fro with a lantern. Three fresh horses were being led in at the open gate. But when Alyosha and Rakitin reached the bottom of the steps, Grushenka\u2019s bedroom window was suddenly opened and she called in a ringing voice after Alyosha: \u201cAlyosha, give my greetings to your brother Mitya and tell him not to remember evil against me, though I have brought him misery. And tell him, too, in my words: \u2018Grushenka has fallen to a scoundrel, and not to you, noble heart.\u2019 And add, too, that Grushenka loved him only one hour, only one short hour she loved him\u2014so let him remember that hour all his life\u2014say, \u2018Grushenka tells you to!\u2019 \u201d She ended in a voice full of sobs. The window was shut with a slam. \u201cH\u2019m, h\u2019m!\u201d growled Rakitin, laughing, \u201cshe murders your brother Mitya and then tells him to remember it all his life!", " She had pity on me just now.... Agrafena Alexandrovna, I am speaking of you. You\u2019ve raised my soul from the depths.\u201d Alyosha\u2019s lips were quivering and he caught his breath. \u201cShe has saved you, it seems,\u201d laughed Rakitin spitefully. \u201cAnd she meant to get you in her clutches, do you realize that?\u201d \u201cStay, Rakitin.\u201d Grushenka jumped up. \u201cHush, both of you. Now I\u2019ll tell you all about it. Hush, Alyosha, your words make me ashamed, for I am bad and not good\u2014that\u2019s what I am. And you hush, Rakitin, because you are telling lies. I had the low idea of trying to get him in my clutches, but now you are lying, now it\u2019s all different. And don\u2019t let me hear anything more from you, Rakitin.\u201d All this Grushenka said with extreme emotion. \u201cThey are both crazy,\u201d said Rakitin, looking at them with amazement. \u201cI feel as though I were in a madhouse. They\u2019re both getting so feeble they\u2019ll begin crying in a minute.\u201d \u201cI shall begin to cry, I shall,\u201d repeated Grushenka.", " \u201cMitya told me that she screamed out that I \u2018ought to be flogged.\u2019 I did insult her dreadfully. She sent for me, she wanted to make a conquest of me, to win me over with her chocolate.... No, it\u2019s a good thing it did end like that.\u201d She smiled again. \u201cBut I am still afraid of your being angry.\u201d \u201cYes, that\u2019s really true,\u201d Rakitin put in suddenly with genuine surprise. \u201cAlyosha, she is really afraid of a chicken like you.\u201d \u201cHe is a chicken to you, Rakitin ... because you\u2019ve no conscience, that\u2019s what it is! You see, I love him with all my soul, that\u2019s how it is! Alyosha, do you believe I love you with all my soul?\u201d \u201cAh, you shameless woman! She is making you a declaration, Alexey!\u201d \u201cWell, what of it, I love him!\u201d \u201cAnd what about your officer? And the priceless message from Mokroe?\u201d \u201cThat is quite different.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a woman\u2019s way of looking at it!\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you make me angry, Rakitin.\u201d Grushenka caught him up hotly.", " You owe it me, you know you do!\u201d \u201cYes, I really do. Do you know, Alyosha, I promised him champagne on the top of everything, if he\u2019d bring you? I\u2019ll have some too! Fenya, Fenya, bring us the bottle Mitya left! Look sharp! Though I am so stingy, I\u2019ll stand a bottle, not for you, Rakitin, you\u2019re a toadstool, but he is a falcon! And though my heart is full of something very different, so be it, I\u2019ll drink with you. I long for some dissipation.\u201d \u201cBut what is the matter with you? And what is this message, may I ask, or is it a secret?\u201d Rakitin put in inquisitively, doing his best to pretend not to notice the snubs that were being continually aimed at him. \u201cEch, it\u2019s not a secret, and you know it, too,\u201d Grushenka said, in a voice suddenly anxious, turning her head towards Rakitin, and drawing a little away from Alyosha, though she still sat on his knee with her arm round his neck. \u201cMy officer is coming, Rakitin, my officer is coming.\u201d \u201cI heard he was coming, but is he so near?\u201d \u201cHe is at Mokroe now; he\u2019ll send a messenger from there, so he wrote; I got a letter from him to\u2010day."], "In a dream, Zosima tells Alyosha that he has redeemed whom?": [" \u201cReally?\u201d cried Lise, surprised. \u201cI say, Alyosha, don\u2019t laugh, that\u2019s awfully important. Could two different people have the same dream?\u201d \u201cIt seems they can.\u201d \u201cAlyosha, I tell you, it\u2019s awfully important,\u201d Lise went on, with really excessive amazement. \u201cIt\u2019s not the dream that\u2019s important, but your having the same dream as me. You never lie to me, don\u2019t lie now: is it true? You are not laughing?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d Lise seemed extraordinarily impressed and for half a minute she was silent. \u201cAlyosha, come and see me, come and see me more often,\u201d she said suddenly, in a supplicating voice. \u201cI\u2019ll always come to see you, all my life,\u201d answered Alyosha firmly. \u201cYou are the only person I can talk to, you know,\u201d Lise began again. \u201cI talk to no one but myself and you. Only you in the whole world. And to you more readily than to myself. And I am not a bit ashamed with you, not a bit. Alyosha, why am I not ashamed with you, not a bit?", " There was no other.\u201d \u201cYou put that towel on your head?\u201d asked Alyosha. \u201cYes, and walked up and down the room an hour ago ... Why have the candles burnt down so? What\u2019s the time?\u201d \u201cNearly twelve.\u201d \u201cNo, no, no!\u201d Ivan cried suddenly. \u201cIt was not a dream. He was here; he was sitting here, on that sofa. When you knocked at the window, I threw a glass at him ... this one. Wait a minute. I was asleep last time, but this dream was not a dream. It has happened before. I have dreams now, Alyosha ... yet they are not dreams, but reality. I walk about, talk and see ... though I am asleep. But he was sitting here, on that sofa there.... He is frightfully stupid, Alyosha, frightfully stupid.\u201d Ivan laughed suddenly and began pacing about the room. \u201cWho is stupid? Of whom are you talking, brother?\u201d Alyosha asked anxiously again. \u201cThe devil! He\u2019s taken to visiting me. He\u2019s been here twice, almost three times.", " \u201cSet my mind at rest that I may know the worst that\u2019s in store for me.

Perhaps he wants to tell me, but doesn\u2019t dare to. He warns me. There is a secret, he tells me, but he won\u2019t tell me what it is.\u201d \u201cWhat do you think yourself?\u201d \u201cWhat do I think? It\u2019s the end for me, that\u2019s what I think. They all three have been plotting my end, for Katerina\u2019s in it. It\u2019s all Katerina, it all comes from her. She is this and that, and that means that I am not. He tells me that beforehand\u2014warns me. He is planning to throw me over, that\u2019s the whole secret. They\u2019ve planned it together, the three of them\u2014Mitya, Katerina, and Ivan Fyodorovitch. Alyosha, I\u2019ve been wanting to ask you a long time. A week ago he suddenly told me that Ivan was in love with Katerina, because he often goes to see her.", " In the yard stood a covered cart. Horses were being taken out of the shafts, men were running to and fro with a lantern. Three fresh horses were being led in at the open gate. But when Alyosha and Rakitin reached the bottom of the steps, Grushenka\u2019s bedroom window was suddenly opened and she called in a ringing voice after Alyosha: \u201cAlyosha, give my greetings to your brother Mitya and tell him not to remember evil against me, though I have brought him misery.

Let him read them how the brothers afterwards journeyed into Egypt for corn, and Joseph, already a great ruler, unrecognized by them, tormented them, accused them, kept his brother Benjamin, and all through love: \u201cI love you, and loving you I torment you.\u201d For he remembered all his life how they had sold him to the merchants in the burning desert by the well, and how, wringing his hands, he had wept and besought his brothers not to sell him as a slave in a strange land. And how, seeing them again after many years, he loved them beyond measure, but he harassed and tormented them in love. He left them at last not able to bear the suffering of his heart, flung himself on his bed and wept.", " Hold it in your hand, if you like, and I will read it so.\u201d \u201cNo, I won\u2019t show it to you.

Chapter II. Smerdyakov With A Guitar He had no time to lose indeed. Even while he was saying good\u2010by to Lise, the thought had struck him that he must attempt some stratagem to find his brother Dmitri, who was evidently keeping out of his way. It was getting late, nearly three o\u2019clock. Alyosha\u2019s whole soul turned to the monastery, to his dying saint, but the necessity of seeing Dmitri outweighed everything. The conviction that a great inevitable catastrophe was about to happen grew stronger in Alyosha\u2019s mind with every hour. What that catastrophe was, and what he would say at that moment to his brother, he could perhaps not have said definitely.", " \u201cDid he say it to you alone once, or several times?\u201d inquired the prosecutor, and learned that he had told Grushenka so several times. Ippolit Kirillovitch was very well satisfied with this piece of evidence. Further examination elicited that Grushenka knew, too, where that money had come from, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had got it from Katerina Ivanovna. \u201cAnd did you never, once, hear that the money spent a month ago was not three thousand, but less, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had saved half that sum for his own use?\u201d \u201cNo, I never heard that,\u201d answered Grushenka. It was explained further that Mitya had, on the contrary, often told her that he hadn\u2019t a farthing. \u201cHe was always expecting to get some from his father,\u201d said Grushenka in conclusion. \u201cDid he never say before you ... casually, or in a moment of irritation,\u201d Nikolay Parfenovitch put in suddenly, \u201cthat he intended to make an attempt on his father\u2019s life?\u201d \u201cAch, he did say so,\u201d sighed Grushenka.", " He has an exercise\u2010book under his pillow with the French words written out in Russian letters for him by some one, he he he!\u201d Ivan ended by dismissing all doubts. He could not think of Dmitri without repulsion. Only one thing was strange, however. Alyosha persisted that Dmitri was not the murderer, and that \u201cin all probability\u201d Smerdyakov was. Ivan always felt that Alyosha\u2019s opinion meant a great deal to him, and so he was astonished at it now. Another thing that was strange was that Alyosha did not make any attempt to talk about Mitya with Ivan, that he never began on the subject and only answered his questions. This, too, struck Ivan particularly. But he was very much preoccupied at that time with something quite apart from that. On his return from Moscow, he abandoned himself hopelessly to his mad and consuming passion for Katerina Ivanovna. This is not the time to begin to speak of this new passion of Ivan\u2019s, which left its mark on all the rest of his life: this would furnish the subject for another novel, which I may perhaps never write."], "After refusing Dmitri money, Madame Khokhlakov suggests that Dmitri find work where?": [" It certainly was sitting by a \u2018laceration.\u2019 Ah, she knew how I loved her! She loved me and not Dmitri,\u201d Ivan insisted gayly. \u201cHer feeling for Dmitri was simply a self\u2010 laceration. All I told her just now was perfectly true, but the worst of it is, it may take her fifteen or twenty years to find out that she doesn\u2019t care for Dmitri, and loves me whom she torments, and perhaps she may never find it out at all, in spite of her lesson to\u2010day. Well, it\u2019s better so; I can simply go away for good. By the way, how is she now? What happened after I departed?\u201d Alyosha told him she had been hysterical, and that she was now, he heard, unconscious and delirious. \u201cIsn\u2019t Madame Hohlakov laying it on?\u201d \u201cI think not.\u201d \u201cI must find out. Nobody dies of hysterics, though. They don\u2019t matter. God gave woman hysterics as a relief. I won\u2019t go to her at all.

The Sensualists Grigory and Smerdyakov ran into the room after Dmitri. They had been struggling with him in the passage, refusing to admit him, acting on instructions given them by Fyodor Pavlovitch some days before. Taking advantage of the fact that Dmitri stopped a moment on entering the room to look about him, Grigory ran round the table, closed the double doors on the opposite side of the room leading to the inner apartments, and stood before the closed doors, stretching wide his arms, prepared to defend the entrance, so to speak, with the last drop of his blood. Seeing this, Dmitri uttered a scream rather than a shout and rushed at Grigory. \u201cThen she\u2019s there! She\u2019s hidden there! Out of the way, scoundrel!\u201d He tried to pull Grigory away, but the old servant pushed him back. Beside himself with fury, Dmitri struck out, and hit Grigory with all his might. The old man fell like a log, and Dmitri, leaping over him, broke in the door.", " It was not her beauty which troubled him, but something else. And the vagueness of his apprehension increased the apprehension itself. The girl\u2019s aims were of the noblest, he knew that. She was trying to save his brother Dmitri simply through generosity, though he had already behaved badly to her. Yet, although Alyosha recognized and did justice to all these fine and generous sentiments, a shiver began to run down his back as soon as he drew near her house. He reflected that he would not find Ivan, who was so intimate a friend, with her, for Ivan was certainly now with his father. Dmitri he was even more certain not to find there, and he had a foreboding of the reason. And so his conversation would be with her alone. He had a great longing to run and see his brother Dmitri before that fateful interview. Without showing him the letter, he could talk to him about it. But Dmitri lived a long way off, and he was sure to be away from home too.", " \u201cThe money is as good as in your pocket, not three thousand, but three million, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, in less than no time. I\u2019ll make you a present of the idea: you shall find gold\u2010mines, make millions, return and become a leading man, and wake us up and lead us to better things. Are we to leave it all to the Jews? You will found institutions and enterprises of all sorts. You will help the poor, and they will bless you. This is the age of railways, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You\u2019ll become famous and indispensable to the Department of Finance, which is so badly off at present. The depreciation of the rouble keeps me awake at night, Dmitri Fyodorovitch; people don\u2019t know that side of me\u2014\u201d \u201cMadam, madam!\u201d Dmitri interrupted with an uneasy presentiment. \u201cI shall indeed, perhaps, follow your advice, your wise advice, madam.... I shall perhaps set off ... to the gold\u2010mines.... I\u2019ll come and see you again about it ... many times, indeed ... but now, that three thousand you so generously ... oh, that would set me free, and if you could to\u2010day ... you see, I haven\u2019t a minute, a minute to lose to\u2010day\u2014\u201d \u201cEnough, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, enough!\u201d Madame Hohlakov interrupted emphatically."], "At Fyodor\u2019s house, Dmitri does what to determine that Grushenka is not there?": [" He suspected, quite correctly, that she, too, was passing through an inward struggle, and was in a state of extraordinary indecision, that she was making up her mind to something, and unable to determine upon it. And so, not without good reason, he divined, with a sinking heart, that at moments she must simply hate him and his passion. And so, perhaps, it was, but what was distressing Grushenka he did not understand. For him the whole tormenting question lay between him and Fyodor Pavlovitch. Here, we must note, by the way, one certain fact: he was firmly persuaded that Fyodor Pavlovitch would offer, or perhaps had offered, Grushenka lawful wedlock, and did not for a moment believe that the old voluptuary hoped to gain his object for three thousand roubles. Mitya had reached this conclusion from his knowledge of Grushenka and her character. That was how it was that he could believe at times that all Grushenka\u2019s uneasiness rose from not knowing which of them to choose, which was most to her advantage.", " \u201cEven if my benefactor must die without me, anyway I won\u2019t have to reproach myself all my life with the thought that I might have saved something and did not, but passed by and hastened home. If I do as I intend, I shall be following his great precept.\u201d His plan was to catch his brother Dmitri unawares, to climb over the fence, as he had the day before, get into the garden and sit in the summer\u2010house. If Dmitri were not there, thought Alyosha, he would not announce himself to Foma or the women of the house, but would remain hidden in the summer\u2010house, even if he had to wait there till evening. If, as before, Dmitri were lying in wait for Grushenka to come, he would be very likely to come to the summer\u2010house. Alyosha did not, however, give much thought to the details of his plan, but resolved to act upon it, even if it meant not getting back to the monastery that day. Everything happened without hindrance, he climbed over the hurdle almost in the same spot as the day before, and stole into the summer\u2010house unseen.", " From some rumor, or perhaps from some stray word of Grushenka\u2019s, he had gathered further that the old man would perhaps prefer him to Fyodor Pavlovitch for Grushenka. Possibly many of the readers of my novel will feel that in reckoning on such assistance, and being ready to take his bride, so to speak, from the hands of her protector, Dmitri showed great coarseness and want of delicacy. I will only observe that Mitya looked upon Grushenka\u2019s past as something completely over. He looked on that past with infinite pity and resolved with all the fervor of his passion that when once Grushenka told him she loved him and would marry him, it would mean the beginning of a new Grushenka and a new Dmitri, free from every vice. They would forgive one another and would begin their lives afresh. As for Kuzma Samsonov, Dmitri looked upon him as a man who had exercised a fateful influence in that remote past of Grushenka\u2019s, though she had never loved him, and who was now himself a thing of the past, completely done with, and, so to say, non\u2010existent.", " \u201cDid he say it to you alone once, or several times?\u201d inquired the prosecutor, and learned that he had told Grushenka so several times.

A very commonplace idea occurs to me at this point: What if that pestle had not been in sight, had not been lying on the shelf from which it was snatched by the prisoner, but had been put away in a cupboard? It would not have caught the prisoner\u2019s eye, and he would have run away without a weapon, with empty hands, and then he would certainly not have killed any one. How then can I look upon the pestle as a proof of premeditation? \u201cYes, but he talked in the taverns of murdering his father, and two days before, on the evening when he wrote his drunken letter, he was quiet and only quarreled with a shopman in the tavern, because a Karamazov could not help quarreling, forsooth!", " Yes, his foreboding had not deceived him. He recognized him, it was he, the \u201cmonster,\u201d the \u201cparricide.\u201d \u201cParricide!\u201d the old man shouted so that the whole neighborhood could hear, but he had not time to shout more, he fell at once, as though struck by lightning. Mitya jumped back into the garden and bent over the fallen man. In Mitya\u2019s hands was a brass pestle, and he flung it mechanically in the grass. The pestle fell two paces from Grigory, not in the grass but on the path, in a most conspicuous place. For some seconds he examined the prostrate figure before him. The old man\u2019s head was covered with blood. Mitya put out his hand and began feeling it. He remembered afterwards clearly, that he had been awfully anxious to make sure whether he had broken the old man\u2019s skull, or simply stunned him with the pestle. But the blood was flowing horribly; and in a moment Mitya\u2019s fingers were drenched with the hot stream.", " But as he ran, he surprised both Fenya and old Matryona by an unexpected action. On the table stood a brass mortar, with a pestle in it, a small brass pestle, not much more than six inches long. Mitya already had opened the door with one hand when, with the other, he snatched up the pestle, and thrust it in his side\u2010pocket. \u201cOh, Lord! He\u2019s going to murder some one!\u201d cried Fenya, flinging up her hands. Chapter IV. In The Dark Where was he running? \u201cWhere could she be except at Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s? She must have run straight to him from Samsonov\u2019s, that was clear now. The whole intrigue, the whole deceit was evident.\u201d ... It all rushed whirling through his mind. He did not run to Marya Kondratyevna\u2019s. \u201cThere was no need to go there ... not the slightest need ... he must raise no alarm ... they would run and tell directly.... Marya Kondratyevna was clearly in the plot, Smerdyakov too, he too, all had been bought over!\u201d He formed another plan of action: he ran a long way round Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s house, crossing the lane, running down Dmitrovsky Street, then over the little bridge, and so came straight to the deserted alley at the back, which was empty and uninhabited, with, on one side the hurdle fence of a neighbor\u2019s kitchen\u2010garden, on the other the strong high fence, that ran all round Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s garden.", " He had not gone three steps before the biggest stone the boy had in his pocket hit him a painful blow in the back. \u201cSo you\u2019ll hit a man from behind! They tell the truth, then, when they say that you attack on the sly,\u201d said Alyosha, turning round again. This time the boy threw a stone savagely right into Alyosha\u2019s face; but Alyosha just had time to guard himself, and the stone struck him on the elbow. \u201cAren\u2019t you ashamed? What have I done to you?\u201d he cried. The boy waited in silent defiance, certain that now Alyosha would attack him. Seeing that even now he would not, his rage was like a little wild beast\u2019s; he flew at Alyosha himself, and before Alyosha had time to move, the spiteful child had seized his left hand with both of his and bit his middle finger. He fixed his teeth in it and it was ten seconds before he let go.

He was miserable a long time, but not for that reason; only from regret that he had killed the woman he loved, that she was no more, that in killing her he had killed his love, while the fire of passion was still in his veins. But of the innocent blood he had shed, of the murder of a fellow creature, he scarcely thought. The thought that his victim might have become the wife of another man was insupportable to him, and so, for a long time, he was convinced in his conscience that he could not have acted otherwise. At first he was worried at the arrest of the servant, but his illness and death soon set his mind at rest, for the man\u2019s death was apparently (so he reflected at the time) not owing to his arrest or his fright, but a chill he had taken on the day he ran away, when he had lain all night dead drunk on the damp ground.", " \u201cDid he say it to you alone once, or several times?\u201d inquired the prosecutor, and learned that he had told Grushenka so several times. Ippolit Kirillovitch was very well satisfied with this piece of evidence.

It was explained further that Mitya had, on the contrary, often told her that he hadn\u2019t a farthing. \u201cHe was always expecting to get some from his father,\u201d said Grushenka in conclusion. \u201cDid he never say before you ... casually, or in a moment of irritation,\u201d Nikolay Parfenovitch put in suddenly, \u201cthat he intended to make an attempt on his father\u2019s life?\u201d \u201cAch, he did say so,\u201d sighed Grushenka.", " Such a murder is not a murder. Such a murder is not a parricide. No, the murder of such a father cannot be called parricide. Such a murder can only be reckoned parricide by prejudice. \u201cBut I appeal to you again and again from the depths of my soul; did this murder actually take place? Gentlemen of the jury, if we convict and punish him, he will say to himself: \u2018These people have done nothing for my bringing up, for my education, nothing to improve my lot, nothing to make me better, nothing to make me a man. These people have not given me to eat and to drink, have not visited me in prison and nakedness, and here they have sent me to penal servitude. I am quits, I owe them nothing now, and owe no one anything for ever. They are wicked and I will be wicked. They are cruel and I will be cruel.\u2019 That is what he will say, gentlemen of the jury. And I swear, by finding him guilty you will only make it easier for him: you will ease his conscience, he will curse the blood he has shed and will not regret it."], "Who becomes suspicious of Dmitri and follows Dmitri\u2019s trail of theft?": [" The theft of the money and other things troubled him little, for he argued that the theft had not been committed for gain but to avert suspicion. The sum stolen was small, and he shortly afterwards subscribed the whole of it, and much more, towards the funds for maintaining an almshouse in the town. He did this on purpose to set his conscience at rest about the theft, and it\u2019s a remarkable fact that for a long time he really was at peace\u2014he told me this himself. He entered then upon a career of great activity in the service, volunteered for a difficult and laborious duty, which occupied him two years, and being a man of strong will almost forgot the past. Whenever he recalled it, he tried not to think of it at all. He became active in philanthropy too, founded and helped to maintain many institutions in the town, did a good deal in the two capitals, and in both Moscow and Petersburg was elected a member of philanthropic societies.", " \u201cBut he begged me not to tell Dmitri that he had told me about him,\u201d added Alyosha. Ivan frowned and pondered. \u201cAre you frowning on Smerdyakov\u2019s account?\u201d asked Alyosha. \u201cYes, on his account. Damn him, I certainly did want to see Dmitri, but now there\u2019s no need,\u201d said Ivan reluctantly. \u201cBut are you really going so soon, brother?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWhat of Dmitri and father? how will it end?\u201d asked Alyosha anxiously. \u201cYou are always harping upon it! What have I to do with it? Am I my brother Dmitri\u2019s keeper?\u201d Ivan snapped irritably, but then he suddenly smiled bitterly. \u201cCain\u2019s answer about his murdered brother, wasn\u2019t it? Perhaps that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking at this moment? Well, damn it all, I can\u2019t stay here to be their keeper, can I? I\u2019ve finished what I had to do, and I am going. Do you imagine I am jealous of Dmitri, that I\u2019ve been trying to steal his beautiful Katerina Ivanovna for the last three months?", " \u201cHow could I?... And why should I, when it all depends on Dmitri Fyodorovitch and his plans?...

Andrey, coughing from the brandy he had just swallowed, jumped up on the box. But Mitya was only just taking his seat when suddenly to his surprise he saw Fenya before him.

Possibly many of the readers of my novel will feel that in reckoning on such assistance, and being ready to take his bride, so to speak, from the hands of her protector, Dmitri showed great coarseness and want of delicacy. I will only observe that Mitya looked upon Grushenka\u2019s past as something completely over. He looked on that past with infinite pity and resolved with all the fervor of his passion that when once Grushenka told him she loved him and would marry him, it would mean the beginning of a new Grushenka and a new Dmitri, free from every vice. They would forgive one another and would begin their lives afresh. As for Kuzma Samsonov, Dmitri looked upon him as a man who had exercised a fateful influence in that remote past of Grushenka\u2019s, though she had never loved him, and who was now himself a thing of the past, completely done with, and, so to say, non\u2010existent.", " He never found out who this kind man was; perhaps one of the peasant witnesses, or Nikolay Parfenovitch\u2019s little secretary, had compassionately thought to put a pillow under his head; but his whole soul was quivering with tears.

He had, of course, found the other entrance locked, and the key actually was in Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s pocket. The windows of all the rooms were also closed, so Grushenka could not have come in anywhere nor have run out anywhere. \u201cHold him!\u201d shrieked Fyodor Pavlovitch, as soon as he saw him again. \u201cHe\u2019s been stealing money in my bedroom.\u201d And tearing himself from Ivan he rushed again at Dmitri.

Only give me two minutes of free speech that I may just explain to you everything, the whole plan with which I have come. Besides, I am short of time.

Who\u2019ll keep watch for me? Who\u2019ll bring me word?\u201d he thought. He began greedily questioning the women whether they had seen anything the evening before. They quite understood what he was trying to find out, and completely reassured him. No one had been there. Ivan Fyodorovitch had been there the night; everything had been perfectly as usual. Mitya grew thoughtful. He would certainly have to keep watch to\u2010day, but where? Here or at Samsonov\u2019s gate? He decided that he must be on the look out both here and there, and meanwhile ... meanwhile.... The difficulty was that he had to carry out the new plan that he had made on the journey back. He was sure of its success, but he must not delay acting upon it.

He came of a family of landowners, had been in the army in early youth, and served in the Caucasus as an officer. He had, no doubt, impressed Alyosha by some peculiar quality of his soul. Alyosha lived in the cell of the elder, who was very fond of him and let him wait upon him. It must be noted that Alyosha was bound by no obligation and could go where he pleased and be absent for whole days. Though he wore the monastic dress it was voluntarily, not to be different from others. No doubt he liked to do so. Possibly his youthful imagination was deeply stirred by the power and fame of his elder. It was said that so many people had for years past come to confess their sins to Father Zossima and to entreat him for words of advice and healing, that he had acquired the keenest intuition and could tell from an unknown face what a new\u2010comer wanted, and what was the suffering on his conscience."], "What is the reasoning behind the officers taking Dmitri\u2019s clothes?": [" \u201cThat rotten prosecutor has gone, too, contemptuous no doubt, it disgusts him to see me naked!\u201d Mitya imagined, however, that his clothes would be examined and returned to him.

Damn Kalganov and his clothes, too!\u201d It was a long time before they could persuade him. But they succeeded somehow in quieting him down.

Step aside, Mitya, and make way! What am I now? Now everything is over apart from the officer\u2014even if he had not appeared, everything would be over ...\u201d These words would roughly have expressed his feelings, if he had been capable of reasoning. But he could not reason at that moment. His present plan of action had arisen without reasoning. At Fenya\u2019s first words, it had sprung from feeling, and been adopted in a flash, with all its consequences. And yet, in spite of his resolution, there was confusion in his soul, an agonizing confusion: his resolution did not give him peace. There was so much behind that tortured him. And it seemed strange to him, at moments, to think that he had written his own sentence of death with pen and paper: \u201cI punish myself,\u201d and the paper was lying there in his pocket, ready; the pistol was loaded; he had already resolved how, next morning, he would meet the first warm ray of \u201cgolden\u2010haired Ph\u0153bus.\u201d And yet he could not be quit of the past, of all that he had left behind and that tortured him.", " He subsided into gloomy silence and hurriedly dressed himself.

Am I to be dressed up like a fool ... for your amusement?\u201d They urged upon him again that he was exaggerating, that Kalganov was only a little taller, so that only the trousers might be a little too long. But the coat turned out to be really tight in the shoulders. \u201cDamn it all! I can hardly button it,\u201d Mitya grumbled. \u201cBe so good as to tell Mr. Kalganov from me that I didn\u2019t ask for his clothes, and it\u2019s not my doing that they\u2019ve dressed me up like a clown.\u201d \u201cHe understands that, and is sorry ...

The letter was very indefinite, high\u2010flown, and full of sentimentality. It must be noted that Grushenka had concealed from him the last lines of the letter, in which his return was alluded to more definitely. He had, besides, noticed at that moment, he remembered afterwards, a certain involuntary proud contempt for this missive from Siberia on Grushenka\u2019s face. Grushenka told him nothing of what had passed later between her and this rival; so that by degrees he had completely forgotten the officer\u2019s existence. He felt that whatever might come later, whatever turn things might take, his final conflict with Fyodor Pavlovitch was close upon him, and must be decided before anything else. With a sinking heart he was expecting every moment Grushenka\u2019s decision, always believing that it would come suddenly, on the impulse of the moment.", " From some rumor, or perhaps from some stray word of Grushenka\u2019s, he had gathered further that the old man would perhaps prefer him to Fyodor Pavlovitch for Grushenka.

This fateful visit, which was the first step leading to so many consequences, I never fully explained to myself. It seemed strange on the face of it that a young man so learned, so proud, and apparently so cautious, should suddenly visit such an infamous house and a father who had ignored him all his life, hardly knew him, never thought of him, and would not under any circumstances have given him money, though he was always afraid that his sons Ivan and Alexey would also come to ask him for it. And here the young man was staying in the house of such a father, had been living with him for two months, and they were on the best possible terms. This last fact was a special cause of wonder to many others as well as to me.

He was fond of the boy, though he would have felt it beneath him to try and win him over, and was severe and strict with him in class. Kolya, too, kept him at a respectful distance. He learned his lessons perfectly; he was second in his class, was reserved with Dardanelov, and the whole class firmly believed that Kolya was so good at universal history that he could \u201cbeat\u201d even Dardanelov.

Nastya, the elder, a girl of eight, could read, and Kostya, the boy, aged seven, was very fond of being read to by her.

Alyosha, why am I not ashamed with you, not a bit?", " I don\u2019t know about you, Lise, but I consider that I have a sordid soul in many ways, and his soul is not sordid; on the contrary, full of fine feeling.... No, Lise, I have no contempt for him. Do you know, Lise, my elder told me once to care for most people exactly as one would for children, and for some of them as one would for the sick in hospitals.\u201d \u201cAh, Alexey Fyodorovitch, dear, let us care for people as we would for the sick!\u201d \u201cLet us, Lise; I am ready. Though I am not altogether ready in myself. I am sometimes very impatient and at other times I don\u2019t see things. It\u2019s different with you.\u201d \u201cAh, I don\u2019t believe it! Alexey Fyodorovitch, how happy I am!\u201d \u201cI am so glad you say so, Lise.\u201d \u201cAlexey Fyodorovitch, you are wonderfully good, but you are sometimes sort of formal.... And yet you are not a bit formal really. Go to the door, open it gently, and see whether mamma is listening,\u201d said Lise, in a nervous, hurried whisper.", " You are my conscience now.... Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch, why have you been so sad lately\u2014both yesterday and to\u2010day? I know you have a lot of anxiety and trouble, but I see you have some special grief besides, some secret one, perhaps?\u201d \u201cYes, Lise, I have a secret one, too,\u201d answered Alyosha mournfully. \u201cI see you love me, since you guessed that.\u201d \u201cWhat grief? What about? Can you tell me?\u201d asked Lise with timid entreaty. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you later, Lise\u2014afterwards,\u201d said Alyosha, confused. \u201cNow you wouldn\u2019t understand it perhaps\u2014and perhaps I couldn\u2019t explain it.\u201d \u201cI know your brothers and your father are worrying you, too.\u201d \u201cYes, my brothers too,\u201d murmured Alyosha, pondering. \u201cI don\u2019t like your brother Ivan, Alyosha,\u201d said Lise suddenly. He noticed this remark with some surprise, but did not answer it. \u201cMy brothers are destroying themselves,\u201d he went on, \u201cmy father, too. And they are destroying others with them."], "At the prision, Dmitri tells Alyosha about whose visit?": [" \u201cSet my mind at rest that I may know the worst that\u2019s in store for me. That\u2019s why I sent for you.\u201d \u201cYou think it\u2019s something to do with you? If it were, he wouldn\u2019t have told you there was a secret.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. Perhaps he wants to tell me, but doesn\u2019t dare to. He warns me. There is a secret, he tells me, but he won\u2019t tell me what it is.\u201d \u201cWhat do you think yourself?\u201d \u201cWhat do I think? It\u2019s the end for me, that\u2019s what I think. They all three have been plotting my end, for Katerina\u2019s in it. It\u2019s all Katerina, it all comes from her. She is this and that, and that means that I am not. He tells me that beforehand\u2014warns me. He is planning to throw me over, that\u2019s the whole secret. They\u2019ve planned it together, the three of them\u2014Mitya, Katerina, and Ivan Fyodorovitch. Alyosha, I\u2019ve been wanting to ask you a long time. A week ago he suddenly told me that Ivan was in love with Katerina, because he often goes to see her.", " In the yard stood a covered cart. Horses were being taken out of the shafts, men were running to and fro with a lantern. Three fresh horses were being led in at the open gate. But when Alyosha and Rakitin reached the bottom of the steps, Grushenka\u2019s bedroom window was suddenly opened and she called in a ringing voice after Alyosha: \u201cAlyosha, give my greetings to your brother Mitya and tell him not to remember evil against me, though I have brought him misery. And tell him, too, in my words: \u2018Grushenka has fallen to a scoundrel, and not to you, noble heart.\u2019 And add, too, that Grushenka loved him only one hour, only one short hour she loved him\u2014so let him remember that hour all his life\u2014say, \u2018Grushenka tells you to!\u2019 \u201d She ended in a voice full of sobs. The window was shut with a slam. \u201cH\u2019m, h\u2019m!\u201d growled Rakitin, laughing, \u201cshe murders your brother Mitya and then tells him to remember it all his life!", " Why Ivan Fyodorovitch had come amongst us I remember asking myself at the time with a certain uneasiness. This fateful visit, which was the first step leading to so many consequences, I never fully explained to myself. It seemed strange on the face of it that a young man so learned, so proud, and apparently so cautious, should suddenly visit such an infamous house and a father who had ignored him all his life, hardly knew him, never thought of him, and would not under any circumstances have given him money, though he was always afraid that his sons Ivan and Alexey would also come to ask him for it. And here the young man was staying in the house of such a father, had been living with him for two months, and they were on the best possible terms. This last fact was a special cause of wonder to many others as well as to me. Pyotr Alexandrovitch Mi\u00fcsov, of whom we have spoken already, the cousin of Fyodor Pavlovitch\u2019s first wife, happened to be in the neighborhood again on a visit to his estate.", " If he had killed him it must have been with some object, for some advantage to himself. But not having a shadow of the motive that the prisoner had for the murder\u2014hatred, jealousy, and so on\u2014Smerdyakov could only have murdered him for the sake of gain, in order to appropriate the three thousand roubles he had seen his master put in the envelope. And yet he tells another person\u2014and a person most closely interested, that is, the prisoner\u2014everything about the money and the signals, where the envelope lay, what was written on it, what it was tied up with, and, above all, told him of those signals by which he could enter the house. Did he do this simply to betray himself, or to invite to the same enterprise one who would be anxious to get that envelope for himself? \u2018Yes,\u2019 I shall be told, \u2018but he betrayed it from fear.\u2019 But how do you explain this? A man who could conceive such an audacious, savage act, and carry it out, tells facts which are known to no one else in the world, and which, if he held his tongue, no one would ever have guessed!"], "Based on what Dmitri tells Alyosha, who offered Dmitri a plan for escape?": [" Do you know what we were quarreling about then?\u201d \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d said Alyosha. \u201cOf course he did not tell you. It was about that plan of escape. He had told me the main idea three days before, and we began quarreling about it at once and quarreled for three days. We quarreled because, when he told me that if Dmitri Fyodorovitch were convicted he would escape abroad with that creature, I felt furious at once\u2014I can\u2019t tell you why, I don\u2019t know myself why.... Oh, of course, I was furious then about that creature, and that she, too, should go abroad with Dmitri!\u201d Katerina Ivanovna exclaimed suddenly, her lips quivering with anger. \u201cAs soon as Ivan Fyodorovitch saw that I was furious about that woman, he instantly imagined I was jealous of Dmitri and that I still loved Dmitri. That is how our first quarrel began. I would not give an explanation, I could not ask forgiveness. I could not bear to think that such a man could suspect me of still loving that ... and when I myself had told him long before that I did not love Dmitri, that I loved no one but him!", " Nevertheless, he went to see Mitya ten days before the trial and proposed to him a plan of escape\u2014a plan he had obviously thought over a long time. He was partly impelled to do this by a sore place still left in his heart from a phrase of Smerdyakov\u2019s, that it was to his, Ivan\u2019s, advantage that his brother should be convicted, as that would increase his inheritance and Alyosha\u2019s from forty to sixty thousand roubles. He determined to sacrifice thirty thousand on arranging Mitya\u2019s escape. On his return from seeing him, he was very mournful and dispirited; he suddenly began to feel that he was anxious for Mitya\u2019s escape, not only to heal that sore place by sacrificing thirty thousand, but for another reason. \u201cIs it because I am as much a murderer at heart?\u201d he asked himself. Something very deep down seemed burning and rankling in his soul. His pride above all suffered cruelly all that month.", " \u201cBut he begged me not to tell Dmitri that he had told me about him,\u201d added Alyosha. Ivan frowned and pondered. \u201cAre you frowning on Smerdyakov\u2019s account?\u201d asked Alyosha. \u201cYes, on his account. Damn him, I certainly did want to see Dmitri, but now there\u2019s no need,\u201d said Ivan reluctantly. \u201cBut are you really going so soon, brother?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWhat of Dmitri and father? how will it end?\u201d asked Alyosha anxiously. \u201cYou are always harping upon it! What have I to do with it? Am I my brother Dmitri\u2019s keeper?\u201d Ivan snapped irritably, but then he suddenly smiled bitterly. \u201cCain\u2019s answer about his murdered brother, wasn\u2019t it? Perhaps that\u2019s what you\u2019re thinking at this moment? Well, damn it all, I can\u2019t stay here to be their keeper, can I? I\u2019ve finished what I had to do, and I am going. Do you imagine I am jealous of Dmitri, that I\u2019ve been trying to steal his beautiful Katerina Ivanovna for the last three months?", " \u201cEven if my benefactor must die without me, anyway I won\u2019t have to reproach myself all my life with the thought that I might have saved something and did not, but passed by and hastened home. If I do as I intend, I shall be following his great precept.\u201d His plan was to catch his brother Dmitri unawares, to climb over the fence, as he had the day before, get into the garden and sit in the summer\u2010house. If Dmitri were not there, thought Alyosha, he would not announce himself to Foma or the women of the house, but would remain hidden in the summer\u2010house, even if he had to wait there till evening. If, as before, Dmitri were lying in wait for Grushenka to come, he would be very likely to come to the summer\u2010house. Alyosha did not, however, give much thought to the details of his plan, but resolved to act upon it, even if it meant not getting back to the monastery that day. Everything happened without hindrance, he climbed over the hurdle almost in the same spot as the day before, and stole into the summer\u2010house unseen."], "Seeing an apparition of ___ causes Ivan to go mad.": [" The doctor told me so. Go, run after him....\u201d Alyosha jumped up and ran after Ivan, who was not fifty paces ahead of him. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d He turned quickly on Alyosha, seeing that he was running after him. \u201cShe told you to catch me up, because I\u2019m mad. I know it all by heart,\u201d he added irritably. \u201cShe is mistaken, of course; but she is right that you are ill,\u201d said Alyosha. \u201cI was looking at your face just now. You look very ill, Ivan.\u201d Ivan walked on without stopping. Alyosha followed him. \u201cAnd do you know, Alexey Fyodorovitch, how people do go out of their mind?\u201d Ivan asked in a voice suddenly quiet, without a trace of irritation, with a note of the simplest curiosity. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I suppose there are all kinds of insanity.\u201d \u201cAnd can one observe that one\u2019s going mad oneself?\u201d \u201cI imagine one can\u2019t see oneself clearly in such circumstances,\u201d Alyosha answered with surprise. Ivan paused for half a minute.", " Fetyukovitch agreed to come more for the glory of the thing, because the case has become so notorious. I saw him yesterday.\u201d \u201cWell? Did you talk to him?\u201d Grushenka put in eagerly. \u201cHe listened and said nothing. He told me that he had already formed his opinion. But he promised to give my words consideration.\u201d \u201cConsideration! Ah, they are swindlers! They\u2019ll ruin him. And why did she send for the doctor?\u201d \u201cAs an expert. They want to prove that Mitya\u2019s mad and committed the murder when he didn\u2019t know what he was doing\u201d; Alyosha smiled gently; \u201cbut Mitya won\u2019t agree to that.\u201d \u201cYes; but that would be the truth if he had killed him!\u201d cried Grushenka. \u201cHe was mad then, perfectly mad, and that was my fault, wretch that I am! But, of course, he didn\u2019t do it, he didn\u2019t do it! And they are all against him, the whole town. Even Fenya\u2019s evidence went to prove he had done it. And the people at the shop, and that official, and at the tavern, too, before, people had heard him say so!", " Alyosha saw at once that she had asked Ivan that question before, perhaps only a moment before he came in, and not for the first time, but for the hundredth, and that they had ended by quarreling. \u201cI\u2019ve been to see Smerdyakov.... It was you, you who persuaded me that he murdered his father. It\u2019s only you I believed!\u201d she continued, still addressing Ivan. He gave her a sort of strained smile. Alyosha started at her tone. He had not suspected such familiar intimacy between them. \u201cWell, that\u2019s enough, anyway,\u201d Ivan cut short the conversation. \u201cI am going. I\u2019ll come to\u2010morrow.\u201d And turning at once, he walked out of the room and went straight downstairs. With an imperious gesture, Katerina Ivanovna seized Alyosha by both hands. \u201cFollow him! Overtake him! Don\u2019t leave him alone for a minute!\u201d she said, in a hurried whisper. \u201cHe\u2019s mad! Don\u2019t you know that he\u2019s mad?

Damn it all! Till now we\u2019ve been talking of things that don\u2019t matter, about this trial, but I haven\u2019t said a word to you about the chief thing.

There he\u2019ll go in for criticism of an elevating tendency. Who knows, he may be of use and make his own career, too.", " I paved the way to that hideous scene at the trial. He wanted to show me that he was an honorable man, and that, even if I loved his brother, he would not ruin him for revenge or jealousy. So he came to the court ... I am the cause of it all, I alone am to blame!\u201d Katya never had made such confessions to Alyosha before, and he felt that she was now at that stage of unbearable suffering when even the proudest heart painfully crushes its pride and falls vanquished by grief. Oh, Alyosha knew another terrible reason of her present misery, though she had carefully concealed it from him during those days since the trial; but it would have been for some reason too painful to him if she had been brought so low as to speak to him now about that. She was suffering for her \u201ctreachery\u201d at the trial, and Alyosha felt that her conscience was impelling her to confess it to him, to him, Alyosha, with tears and cries and hysterical writhings on the floor.", " But I will not describe the details. At last the jury rose to retire for consultation. The President was very tired, and so his last charge to the jury was rather feeble. \u201cBe impartial, don\u2019t be influenced by the eloquence of the defense, but yet weigh the arguments. Remember that there is a great responsibility laid upon you,\u201d and so on and so on. The jury withdrew and the court adjourned. People could get up, move about, exchange their accumulated impressions, refresh themselves at the buffet. It was very late, almost one o\u2019clock in the night, but nobody went away: the strain was so great that no one could think of repose. All waited with sinking hearts; though that is, perhaps, too much to say, for the ladies were only in a state of hysterical impatience and their hearts were untroubled. An acquittal, they thought, was inevitable. They all prepared themselves for a dramatic moment of general enthusiasm.", " And then, on the spot, at her feet, I shall dash out my brains before her and punish myself! She will remember Mitya Karamazov sometimes, she will see how Mitya loved her, she will feel for Mitya!\u2019 \u201cHere we see in excess a love of effect, a romantic despair and sentimentality, and the wild recklessness of the Karamazovs. Yes, but there is something else, gentlemen of the jury, something that cries out in the soul, throbs incessantly in the mind, and poisons the heart unto death\u2014that _something_ is conscience, gentlemen of the jury, its judgment, its terrible torments!

Then he ordered the case to proceed. All the witnesses were led up to take the oath. Then I saw them all together. The brothers of the prisoner were, however, allowed to give evidence without taking the oath. After an exhortation from the priest and the President, the witnesses were led away and were made to sit as far as possible apart from one another. Then they began calling them up one by one. Chapter II. Dangerous Witnesses I do not know whether the witnesses for the defense and for the prosecution were separated into groups by the President, and whether it was arranged to call them in a certain order. But no doubt it was so. I only know that the witnesses for the prosecution were called first.

No, the murder of such a father cannot be called parricide. Such a murder can only be reckoned parricide by prejudice. \u201cBut I appeal to you again and again from the depths of my soul; did this murder actually take place? Gentlemen of the jury, if we convict and punish him, he will say to himself: \u2018These people have done nothing for my bringing up, for my education, nothing to improve my lot, nothing to make me better, nothing to make me a man. These people have not given me to eat and to drink, have not visited me in prison and nakedness, and here they have sent me to penal servitude. I am quits, I owe them nothing now, and owe no one anything for ever. They are wicked and I will be wicked. They are cruel and I will be cruel.\u2019 That is what he will say, gentlemen of the jury.

Let me alone!\u201d \u201cVery well, this matter is bound to be explained, and there\u2019s plenty of time for it, but meantime, consider; we have perhaps a dozen witnesses that you yourself spread it abroad, and even shouted almost everywhere about the three thousand you\u2019d spent here; three thousand, not fifteen hundred. And now, too, when you got hold of the money you had yesterday, you gave many people to understand that you had brought three thousand with you.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve got not dozens, but hundreds of witnesses, two hundred witnesses, two hundred have heard it, thousands have heard it!\u201d cried Mitya. \u201cWell, you see, all bear witness to it.

All this, you will remember, was put forward in a tone that brooked no contradiction. But what if the thing happened quite differently? What if you\u2019ve been weaving a romance, and about quite a different kind of man? That\u2019s just it, you have invented quite a different man! \u201cI shall be told, perhaps, there are witnesses that he spent on one day all that three thousand given him by his betrothed a month before the catastrophe, so he could not have divided the sum in half. But who are these witnesses? The value of their evidence has been shown in court already. Besides, in another man\u2019s hand a crust always seems larger, and no one of these witnesses counted that money; they all judged simply at sight."], "What evidence does the prosecutor use to prove Dmitri\u2019s guilt?": [" But of that later.... When, after his conversation with Alyosha, Ivan suddenly decided with his hand on the bell of his lodging to go to Smerdyakov, he obeyed a sudden and peculiar impulse of indignation. He suddenly remembered how Katerina Ivanovna had only just cried out to him in Alyosha\u2019s presence: \u201cIt was you, you, persuaded me of his\u201d (that is, Mitya\u2019s) \u201cguilt!\u201d Ivan was thunderstruck when he recalled it. He had never once tried to persuade her that Mitya was the murderer; on the contrary, he had suspected himself in her presence, that time when he came back from Smerdyakov. It was _she_, she, who had produced that \u201cdocument\u201d and proved his brother\u2019s guilt. And now she suddenly exclaimed: \u201cI\u2019ve been at Smerdyakov\u2019s myself!\u201d When had she been there? Ivan had known nothing of it. So she was not at all so sure of Mitya\u2019s guilt! And what could Smerdyakov have told her? What, what, had he said to her?", " And you have no one else only because you have determined to exclude Smerdyakov from all suspicion. \u201cIt\u2019s true, indeed, Smerdyakov is accused only by the prisoner, his two brothers, and Madame Svyetlov. But there are others who accuse him: there are vague rumors of a question, of a suspicion, an obscure report, a feeling of expectation. Finally, we have the evidence of a combination of facts very suggestive, though, I admit, inconclusive. In the first place we have precisely on the day of the catastrophe that fit, for the genuineness of which the prosecutor, for some reason, has felt obliged to make a careful defense. Then Smerdyakov\u2019s sudden suicide on the eve of the trial. Then the equally startling evidence given in court to\u2010day by the elder of the prisoner\u2019s brothers, who had believed in his guilt, but has to\u2010day produced a bundle of notes and proclaimed Smerdyakov as the murderer. Oh, I fully share the court\u2019s and the prosecutor\u2019s conviction that Ivan Karamazov is suffering from brain fever, that his statement may really be a desperate effort, planned in delirium, to save his brother by throwing the guilt on the dead man.", " I believe absolutely that my brother is innocent, and if he didn\u2019t commit the murder, then\u2014\u201d \u201cThen Smerdyakov? Why Smerdyakov? And why are you so completely persuaded of your brother\u2019s innocence?\u201d \u201cI cannot help believing my brother. I know he wouldn\u2019t lie to me. I saw from his face he wasn\u2019t lying.\u201d \u201cOnly from his face? Is that all the proof you have?\u201d \u201cI have no other proof.\u201d \u201cAnd of Smerdyakov\u2019s guilt you have no proof whatever but your brother\u2019s word and the expression of his face?\u201d \u201cNo, I have no other proof.\u201d The prosecutor dropped the examination at this point. The impression left by Alyosha\u2019s evidence on the public was most disappointing. There had been talk about Smerdyakov before the trial; some one had heard something, some one had pointed out something else, it was said that Alyosha had gathered together some extraordinary proofs of his brother\u2019s innocence and Smerdyakov\u2019s guilt, and after all there was nothing, no evidence except certain moral convictions so natural in a brother.", " But I will not detail the evidence of the other witnesses, who only repeated and confirmed what had been said before, though all with their characteristic peculiarities. I repeat, all was brought together in the prosecutor\u2019s speech, which I shall quote immediately. Every one was excited, every one was electrified by the late catastrophe, and all were awaiting the speeches for the prosecution and the defense with intense impatience. Fetyukovitch was obviously shaken by Katerina Ivanovna\u2019s evidence. But the prosecutor was triumphant. When all the evidence had been taken, the court was adjourned for almost an hour. I believe it was just eight o\u2019clock when the President returned to his seat and our prosecutor, Ippolit Kirillovitch, began his speech. Chapter VI. The Prosecutor\u2019s Speech. Sketches Of Character Ippolit Kirillovitch began his speech, trembling with nervousness, with cold sweat on his forehead, feeling hot and cold all over by turns."], "What happens after the jury spends time deliberating?": [" There was evidence of people of no importance, Fenya and her mother, for instance, but the effect of it was almost overpowering. As to Perhotin, the people at the tavern, and at Plotnikov\u2019s shop, as well as the witnesses at Mokroe, their evidence seemed conclusive. It was the details that were so damning. The secret of the knocks impressed the lawyers almost as much as Grigory\u2019s evidence as to the open door. Grigory\u2019s wife, Marfa, in answer to Ivan\u2019s questions, declared that Smerdyakov had been lying all night the other side of the partition wall. \u201cHe was not three paces from our bed,\u201d and that although she was a sound sleeper she waked several times and heard him moaning, \u201cHe was moaning the whole time, moaning continually.\u201d Talking to Herzenstube, and giving it as his opinion that Smerdyakov was not mad, but only rather weak, Ivan only evoked from the old man a subtle smile. \u201cDo you know how he spends his time now?\u201d he asked; \u201clearning lists of French words by heart.", " But I will not describe the details. At last the jury rose to retire for consultation. The President was very tired, and so his last charge to the jury was rather feeble. \u201cBe impartial, don\u2019t be influenced by the eloquence of the defense, but yet weigh the arguments. Remember that there is a great responsibility laid upon you,\u201d and so on and so on. The jury withdrew and the court adjourned. People could get up, move about, exchange their accumulated impressions, refresh themselves at the buffet. It was very late, almost one o\u2019clock in the night, but nobody went away: the strain was so great that no one could think of repose. All waited with sinking hearts; though that is, perhaps, too much to say, for the ladies were only in a state of hysterical impatience and their hearts were untroubled. An acquittal, they thought, was inevitable. They all prepared themselves for a dramatic moment of general enthusiasm.", " Because you don\u2019t know yourself why you go! Oh, you\u2019d give a great deal to know yourself why you go! And can you have made up your mind? You\u2019ve not made up your mind. You\u2019ll sit all night deliberating whether to go or not. But you will go; you know you\u2019ll go. You know that whichever way you decide, the decision does not depend on you. You\u2019ll go because you won\u2019t dare not to go. Why won\u2019t you dare? You must guess that for yourself. That\u2019s a riddle for you!\u2019 He got up and went away. You came and he went. He called me a coward, Alyosha! _Le mot de l\u2019\u00e9nigme_ is that I am a coward. \u2018It is not for such eagles to soar above the earth.\u2019 It was he added that\u2014he! And Smerdyakov said the same. He must be killed! Katya despises me. I\u2019ve seen that for a month past. Even Lise will begin to despise me! \u2018You are going in order to be praised.\u2019 That\u2019s a brutal lie! And you despise me too, Alyosha.

The pistol will settle everything, the pistol is the only way out! But _beyond_\u2014I don\u2019t know whether Karamazov wondered at that moment \u2018What lies beyond,\u2019 and whether Karamazov could, like Hamlet, wonder \u2018What lies beyond.\u2019 No, gentlemen of the jury, they have their Hamlets, but we still have our Karamazovs!\u201d Here Ippolit Kirillovitch drew a minute picture of Mitya\u2019s preparations, the scene at Perhotin\u2019s, at the shop, with the drivers."], "After the verdict, Dmitri says he forgives whom?": [" But Rakitin looked at him ironically and Alyosha stopped short. \u201cYou were so primed up with your elder\u2019s teaching last night that now you have to let it off on me, Alexey, man of God!\u201d said Rakitin, with a smile of hatred. \u201cDon\u2019t laugh, Rakitin, don\u2019t smile, don\u2019t talk of the dead\u2014he was better than any one in the world!\u201d cried Alyosha, with tears in his voice. \u201cI didn\u2019t speak to you as a judge but as the lowest of the judged. What am I beside her? I came here seeking my ruin, and said to myself, \u2018What does it matter?\u2019 in my cowardliness, but she, after five years in torment, as soon as any one says a word from the heart to her\u2014it makes her forget everything, forgive everything, in her tears! The man who has wronged her has come back, he sends for her and she forgives him everything, and hastens joyfully to meet him and she won\u2019t take a knife with her. She won\u2019t! No, I am not like that. I don\u2019t know whether you are, Misha, but I am not like that.", " Alyosha, darling, well, here goes! I\u2019ll tell you our secret!\u201d He looked round, went close up quickly to Alyosha, who was standing before him, and whispered to him with an air of mystery, though in reality no one could hear them: the old warder was dozing in the corner, and not a word could reach the ears of the soldiers on guard. \u201cI will tell you all our secret,\u201d Mitya whispered hurriedly. \u201cI meant to tell you later, for how could I decide on anything without you? You are everything to me. Though I say that Ivan is superior to us, you are my angel. It\u2019s your decision will decide it. Perhaps it\u2019s you that is superior and not Ivan. You see, it\u2019s a question of conscience, question of the higher conscience\u2014the secret is so important that I can\u2019t settle it myself, and I\u2019ve put it off till I could speak to you. But anyway it\u2019s too early to decide now, for we must wait for the verdict. As soon as the verdict is given, you shall decide my fate.", " We shall rejoice at the new fact, we shall be the first to repudiate our charge, we shall hasten to repudiate it. But now justice cries out and we persist, we cannot repudiate anything.\u201d Ippolit Kirillovitch passed to his final peroration. He looked as though he was in a fever, he spoke of the blood that cried for vengeance, the blood of the father murdered by his son, with the base motive of robbery! He pointed to the tragic and glaring consistency of the facts. \u201cAnd whatever you may hear from the talented and celebrated counsel for the defense,\u201d Ippolit Kirillovitch could not resist adding, \u201cwhatever eloquent and touching appeals may be made to your sensibilities, remember that at this moment you are in a temple of justice. Remember that you are the champions of our justice, the champions of our holy Russia, of her principles, her family, everything that she holds sacred!

She begged him to sit with Lise and wait for her there. \u201cLise,\u201d she whispered almost in his ear, \u201cLise has greatly surprised me just now, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch. She touched me, too, and so my heart forgives her everything. Only fancy, as soon as you had gone, she began to be truly remorseful for having laughed at you to\u2010day and yesterday, though she was not laughing at you, but only joking. But she was seriously sorry for it, almost ready to cry, so that I was quite surprised. She has never been really sorry for laughing at me, but has only made a joke of it. And you know she is laughing at me every minute. But this time she was in earnest. She thinks a great deal of your opinion, Alexey Fyodorovitch, and don\u2019t take offense or be wounded by her if you can help it. I am never hard upon her, for she\u2019s such a clever little thing. Would you believe it? She said just now that you were a friend of her childhood, \u2018the greatest friend of her childhood\u2019\u2014just think of that\u2014\u2018greatest friend\u2019\u2014and what about me?"], "After the trial, Katerina tells Alyosha about a plan to do what?": [" \u201cSet my mind at rest that I may know the worst that\u2019s in store for me.

He tells me that beforehand\u2014warns me. He is planning to throw me over, that\u2019s the whole secret. They\u2019ve planned it together, the three of them\u2014Mitya, Katerina, and Ivan Fyodorovitch. Alyosha, I\u2019ve been wanting to ask you a long time. A week ago he suddenly told me that Ivan was in love with Katerina, because he often goes to see her.", " \u201cYes, the trial\u2019s to\u2010morrow. Are you so hopeless, brother?\u201d Alyosha said, with an apprehensive feeling. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d said Mitya, looking at him rather uncertainly. \u201cOh, you mean the trial! Damn it all! Till now we\u2019ve been talking of things that don\u2019t matter, about this trial, but I haven\u2019t said a word to you about the chief thing. Yes, the trial is to\u2010morrow; but it wasn\u2019t the trial I meant, when I said it was all over with me. Why do you look at me so critically?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean, Mitya?\u201d \u201cIdeas, ideas, that\u2019s all! Ethics! What is ethics?\u201d \u201cEthics?\u201d asked Alyosha, wondering. \u201cYes; is it a science?\u201d \u201cYes, there is such a science ... but ... I confess I can\u2019t explain to you what sort of science it is.\u201d \u201cRakitin knows. Rakitin knows a lot, damn him! He\u2019s not going to be a monk. He means to go to Petersburg. There he\u2019ll go in for criticism of an elevating tendency. Who knows, he may be of use and make his own career, too.", " I paved the way to that hideous scene at the trial. He wanted to show me that he was an honorable man, and that, even if I loved his brother, he would not ruin him for revenge or jealousy. So he came to the court ... I am the cause of it all, I alone am to blame!\u201d Katya never had made such confessions to Alyosha before, and he felt that she was now at that stage of unbearable suffering when even the proudest heart painfully crushes its pride and falls vanquished by grief. Oh, Alyosha knew another terrible reason of her present misery, though she had carefully concealed it from him during those days since the trial; but it would have been for some reason too painful to him if she had been brought so low as to speak to him now about that. She was suffering for her \u201ctreachery\u201d at the trial, and Alyosha felt that her conscience was impelling her to confess it to him, to him, Alyosha, with tears and cries and hysterical writhings on the floor.", " Plans For Mitya\u2019s Escape Very early, at nine o\u2019clock in the morning, five days after the trial, Alyosha went to Katerina Ivanovna\u2019s to talk over a matter of great importance to both of them, and to give her a message. She sat and talked to him in the very room in which she had once received Grushenka. In the next room Ivan Fyodorovitch lay unconscious in a high fever. Katerina Ivanovna had immediately after the scene at the trial ordered the sick and unconscious man to be carried to her house, disregarding the inevitable gossip and general disapproval of the public. One of the two relations who lived with her had departed to Moscow immediately after the scene in court, the other remained. But if both had gone away, Katerina Ivanovna would have adhered to her resolution, and would have gone on nursing the sick man and sitting by him day and night. Varvinsky and Herzenstube were attending him."], "The escape plan will involve Dmitri moving where?": [" Nevertheless, he went to see Mitya ten days before the trial and proposed to him a plan of escape\u2014a plan he had obviously thought over a long time. He was partly impelled to do this by a sore place still left in his heart from a phrase of Smerdyakov\u2019s, that it was to his, Ivan\u2019s, advantage that his brother should be convicted, as that would increase his inheritance and Alyosha\u2019s from forty to sixty thousand roubles. He determined to sacrifice thirty thousand on arranging Mitya\u2019s escape. On his return from seeing him, he was very mournful and dispirited; he suddenly began to feel that he was anxious for Mitya\u2019s escape, not only to heal that sore place by sacrificing thirty thousand, but for another reason. \u201cIs it because I am as much a murderer at heart?\u201d he asked himself. Something very deep down seemed burning and rankling in his soul. His pride above all suffered cruelly all that month.", " Do you know what we were quarreling about then?\u201d \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d said Alyosha. \u201cOf course he did not tell you. It was about that plan of escape. He had told me the main idea three days before, and we began quarreling about it at once and quarreled for three days. We quarreled because, when he told me that if Dmitri Fyodorovitch were convicted he would escape abroad with that creature, I felt furious at once\u2014I can\u2019t tell you why, I don\u2019t know myself why.... Oh, of course, I was furious then about that creature, and that she, too, should go abroad with Dmitri!\u201d Katerina Ivanovna exclaimed suddenly, her lips quivering with anger. \u201cAs soon as Ivan Fyodorovitch saw that I was furious about that woman, he instantly imagined I was jealous of Dmitri and that I still loved Dmitri. That is how our first quarrel began. I would not give an explanation, I could not ask forgiveness. I could not bear to think that such a man could suspect me of still loving that ... and when I myself had told him long before that I did not love Dmitri, that I loved no one but him!", " But he dreaded that moment and longed to spare her. It made the commission on which he had come even more difficult. He spoke of Mitya again. \u201cIt\u2019s all right, it\u2019s all right, don\u2019t be anxious about him!\u201d she began again, sharply and stubbornly. \u201cAll that is only momentary, I know him, I know his heart only too well. You may be sure he will consent to escape. It\u2019s not as though it would be immediately; he will have time to make up his mind to it. Ivan Fyodorovitch will be well by that time and will manage it all himself, so that I shall have nothing to do with it. Don\u2019t be anxious; he will consent to run away. He has agreed already: do you suppose he would give up that creature? And they won\u2019t let her go to him, so he is bound to escape. It\u2019s you he\u2019s most afraid of, he is afraid you won\u2019t approve of his escape on moral grounds. But you must generously _allow_ it, if your sanction is so necessary,\u201d Katya added viciously.", " How will you live, how will you love them?\u201d Alyosha cried sorrowfully. \u201cWith such a hell in your heart and your head, how can you? No, that\u2019s just what you are going away for, to join them ... if not, you will kill yourself, you can\u2019t endure it!\u201d \u201cThere is a strength to endure everything,\u201d Ivan said with a cold smile. \u201cWhat strength?\u201d \u201cThe strength of the Karamazovs\u2014the strength of the Karamazov baseness.\u201d \u201cTo sink into debauchery, to stifle your soul with corruption, yes?\u201d \u201cPossibly even that ... only perhaps till I am thirty I shall escape it, and then\u2014\u201d \u201cHow will you escape it? By what will you escape it? That\u2019s impossible with your ideas.\u201d \u201cIn the Karamazov way, again.\u201d \u201c \u2018Everything is lawful,\u2019 you mean? Everything is lawful, is that it?\u201d Ivan scowled, and all at once turned strangely pale. \u201cAh, you\u2019ve caught up yesterday\u2019s phrase, which so offended Mi\u00fcsov\u2014and which Dmitri pounced upon so na\u00efvely, and paraphrased!\u201d he smiled queerly."], "Who refuses to forgive Katerina?": [" Let her forgive him for herself, if she will, let her forgive the torturer for the immeasurable suffering of her mother\u2019s heart. But the sufferings of her tortured child she has no right to forgive; she dare not forgive the torturer, even if the child were to forgive him! And if that is so, if they dare not forgive, what becomes of harmony? Is there in the whole world a being who would have the right to forgive and could forgive? I don\u2019t want harmony. From love for humanity I don\u2019t want it. I would rather be left with the unavenged suffering. I would rather remain with my unavenged suffering and unsatisfied indignation, _even if I were wrong_. Besides, too high a price is asked for harmony; it\u2019s beyond our means to pay so much to enter on it. And so I hasten to give back my entrance ticket, and if I am an honest man I am bound to give it back as soon as possible. And that I am doing. It\u2019s not God that I don\u2019t accept, Alyosha, only I most respectfully return Him the ticket.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s rebellion,\u201d murmured Alyosha, looking down.", " That\u2019s just it. I shan\u2019t shoot myself. I haven\u2019t the strength now. Afterwards, perhaps. But now I\u2019m going to Grushenka. I don\u2019t care what happens.\u201d \u201cAnd what then?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be her husband if she deigns to have me, and when lovers come, I\u2019ll go into the next room. I\u2019ll clean her friends\u2019 goloshes, blow up their samovar, run their errands.\u201d \u201cKaterina Ivanovna will understand it all,\u201d Alyosha said solemnly. \u201cShe\u2019ll understand how great this trouble is and will forgive. She has a lofty mind, and no one could be more unhappy than you. She\u2019ll see that for herself.\u201d \u201cShe won\u2019t forgive everything,\u201d said Dmitri, with a grin. \u201cThere\u2019s something in it, brother, that no woman could forgive. Do you know what would be the best thing to do?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cPay back the three thousand.\u201d \u201cWhere can we get it from? I say, I have two thousand. Ivan will give you another thousand\u2014that makes three. Take it and pay it back.\u201d \u201cAnd when would you get it, your three thousand?", " But profound as psychology is, it\u2019s a knife that cuts both ways.\u201d (Laughter among the public.) \u201cYou will, of course, forgive me my comparison; I can\u2019t boast of eloquence. But I will take as an example any point in the prosecutor\u2019s speech. \u201cThe prisoner, running away in the garden in the dark, climbed over the fence, was seized by the servant, and knocked him down with a brass pestle. Then he jumped back into the garden and spent five minutes over the man, trying to discover whether he had killed him or not. And the prosecutor refuses to believe the prisoner\u2019s statement that he ran to old Grigory out of pity. \u2018No,\u2019 he says, \u2018such sensibility is impossible at such a moment, that\u2019s unnatural; he ran to find out whether the only witness of his crime was dead or alive, and so showed that he had committed the murder, since he would not have run back for any other reason.\u2019 \u201cHere you have psychology; but let us take the same method and apply it to the case the other way round, and our result will be no less probable.", " He does not ask your forgiveness\u2014\u2018It\u2019s impossible to forgive me,\u2019 he says himself\u2014but only that you would show yourself in his doorway.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s so sudden....\u201d faltered Katya. \u201cI\u2019ve had a presentiment all these days that you would come with that message.

Only think, he realizes for the first time how he has wounded you, the first time in his life; he had never grasped it before so fully.

Think\u2014you must visit him; though he is ruined, he is innocent,\u201d broke like a challenge from Alyosha. \u201cHis hands are clean, there is no blood on them! For the sake of his infinite sufferings in the future visit him now. Go, greet him on his way into the darkness\u2014stand at his door, that is all....

It was the coffin of poor little Ilusha. He had died two days after Mitya was sentenced.", " During the mass Snegiryov became somewhat calmer, though at times he had outbursts of the same unconscious and, as it were, incoherent anxiety. At one moment he went up to the coffin to set straight the cover or the wreath, when a candle fell out of the candlestick he rushed to replace it and was a fearful time fumbling over it, then he subsided and stood quietly by the coffin with a look of blank uneasiness and perplexity. After the Epistle he suddenly whispered to Alyosha, who was standing beside him, that the Epistle had not been read properly but did not explain what he meant. During the prayer, \u201cLike the Cherubim,\u201d he joined in the singing but did not go on to the end. Falling on his knees, he pressed his forehead to the stone floor and lay so for a long while. At last came the funeral service itself and candles were distributed. The distracted father began fussing about again, but the touching and impressive funeral prayers moved and roused his soul.", " Kolya ran out of the room, the boys followed him. At last Alyosha too went out. \u201cLet them weep,\u201d he said to Kolya, \u201cit\u2019s no use trying to comfort them just now. Let us wait a minute and then go back.\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s no use, it\u2019s awful,\u201d Kolya assented. \u201cDo you know, Karamazov,\u201d he dropped his voice so that no one could hear them, \u201cI feel dreadfully sad, and if it were only possible to bring him back, I\u2019d give anything in the world to do it.\u201d \u201cAh, so would I,\u201d said Alyosha. \u201cWhat do you think, Karamazov? Had we better come back here to\u2010night? He\u2019ll be drunk, you know.\u201d \u201cPerhaps he will. Let us come together, you and I, that will be enough, to spend an hour with them, with the mother and Nina. If we all come together we shall remind them of everything again,\u201d Alyosha suggested. \u201cThe landlady is laying the table for them now\u2014there\u2019ll be a funeral dinner or something, the priest is coming; shall we go back to it, Karamazov?\u201d \u201cOf course,\u201d said Alyosha.", " Of course there had been, in former times, saints in the monastery whose memory was carefully preserved and whose relics, according to tradition, showed no signs of corruption. This fact was regarded by the monks as touching and mysterious, and the tradition of it was cherished as something blessed and miraculous, and as a promise, by God\u2019s grace, of still greater glory from their tombs in the future. One such, whose memory was particularly cherished, was an old monk, Job, who had died seventy years before at the age of a hundred and five. He had been a celebrated ascetic, rigid in fasting and silence, and his tomb was pointed out to all visitors on their arrival with peculiar respect and mysterious hints of great hopes connected with it. (That was the very tomb on which Father Pa\u00efssy had found Alyosha sitting in the morning.) Another memory cherished in the monastery was that of the famous Father Varsonofy, who was only recently dead and had preceded Father Zossima in the eldership."], "At the funeral, Alyosha encourages the schoolboys to hang on to what?": [" I asked her forgiveness because I wanted to punish myself to the bitter end. She would not forgive me.... I like her for that!\u201d she added, in an unnatural voice, and her eyes flashed with fierce resentment. \u201cMy brother did not expect this in the least,\u201d muttered Alyosha. \u201cHe was sure she would not come\u2014\u201d \u201cNo doubt. Let us leave that,\u201d she snapped. \u201cListen: I can\u2019t go with you to the funeral now. I\u2019ve sent them flowers. I think they still have money.

He had died two days after Mitya was sentenced.", " Well?\u201d Instinctively feeling that the time of her mother\u2019s absence was precious for her, Alyosha hastened to tell her of his enigmatic meeting with the schoolboys in the fewest words possible. Lise clasped her hands at his story. \u201cHow can you, and in that dress too, associate with schoolboys?\u201d she cried angrily, as though she had a right to control him. \u201cYou are nothing but a boy yourself if you can do that, a perfect boy! But you must find out for me about that horrid boy and tell me all about it, for there\u2019s some mystery in it. Now for the second thing, but first a question: does the pain prevent you talking about utterly unimportant things, but talking sensibly?\u201d \u201cOf course not, and I don\u2019t feel much pain now.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s because your finger is in the water.

Chapter III. A Meeting With The Schoolboys \u201cThank goodness he did not ask me about Grushenka,\u201d thought Alyosha, as he left his father\u2019s house and turned towards Madame Hohlakov\u2019s, \u201cor I might have to tell him of my meeting with Grushenka yesterday.\u201d Alyosha felt painfully that since yesterday both combatants had renewed their energies, and that their hearts had grown hard again. \u201cFather is spiteful and angry, he\u2019s made some plan and will stick to it. And what of Dmitri? He too will be harder than yesterday, he too must be spiteful and angry, and he too, no doubt, has made some plan. Oh, I must succeed in finding him to\u2010day, whatever happens.\u201d But Alyosha had not long to meditate. An incident occurred on the road, which, though apparently of little consequence, made a great impression on him. Just after he had crossed the square and turned the corner coming out into Mihailovsky Street, which is divided by a small ditch from the High Street (our whole town is intersected by ditches), he saw a group of schoolboys between the ages of nine and twelve, at the bridge.", " During the mass Snegiryov became somewhat calmer, though at times he had outbursts of the same unconscious and, as it were, incoherent anxiety. At one moment he went up to the coffin to set straight the cover or the wreath, when a candle fell out of the candlestick he rushed to replace it and was a fearful time fumbling over it, then he subsided and stood quietly by the coffin with a look of blank uneasiness and perplexity. After the Epistle he suddenly whispered to Alyosha, who was standing beside him, that the Epistle had not been read properly but did not explain what he meant. During the prayer, \u201cLike the Cherubim,\u201d he joined in the singing but did not go on to the end. Falling on his knees, he pressed his forehead to the stone floor and lay so for a long while. At last came the funeral service itself and candles were distributed. The distracted father began fussing about again, but the touching and impressive funeral prayers moved and roused his soul."], "Which brother possesses a genuine love for mankind?": [" For any one to love a man, he must be hidden, for as soon as he shows his face, love is gone.\u201d \u201cFather Zossima has talked of that more than once,\u201d observed Alyosha; \u201che, too, said that the face of a man often hinders many people not practiced in love, from loving him.

Kolya was particularly struck by Alyosha\u2019s apparent diffidence about his opinion of Voltaire. He seemed to be leaving the question for him, little Kolya, to settle. \u201cHave you read Voltaire?\u201d Alyosha finished. \u201cNo, not to say read....

Another idea, too, forced itself upon him: \u201cWhat if she loved neither of them\u2014neither Ivan nor Dmitri?\u201d It must be noted that Alyosha felt as it were ashamed of his own thoughts and blamed himself when they kept recurring to him during the last month. \u201cWhat do I know about love and women and how can I decide such questions?\u201d he thought reproachfully, after such doubts and surmises. And yet it was impossible not to think about it. He felt instinctively that this rivalry was of immense importance in his brothers\u2019 lives and that a great deal depended upon it. \u201cOne reptile will devour the other,\u201d Ivan had pronounced the day before, speaking in anger of his father and Dmitri. So Ivan looked upon Dmitri as a reptile, and perhaps had long done so. Was it perhaps since he had known Katerina Ivanovna?", " And if not Smerdyakov, then not he, Ivan. This letter at once assumed in his eyes the aspect of a logical proof. There could be no longer the slightest doubt of Mitya\u2019s guilt. The suspicion never occurred to Ivan, by the way, that Mitya might have committed the murder in conjunction with Smerdyakov, and, indeed, such a theory did not fit in with the facts. Ivan was completely reassured. The next morning he only thought of Smerdyakov and his gibes with contempt. A few days later he positively wondered how he could have been so horribly distressed at his suspicions. He resolved to dismiss him with contempt and forget him. So passed a month. He made no further inquiry about Smerdyakov, but twice he happened to hear that he was very ill and out of his mind. \u201cHe\u2019ll end in madness,\u201d the young doctor Varvinsky observed about him, and Ivan remembered this.

The story may have been exaggerated, yet it must have been something like the truth. Fyodor Pavlovitch was all his life fond of acting, of suddenly playing an unexpected part, sometimes without any motive for doing so, and even to his own direct disadvantage, as, for instance, in the present case. This habit, however, is characteristic of a very great number of people, some of them very clever ones, not like Fyodor Pavlovitch.

His fits were becoming more frequent, and on the days he was ill Marfa cooked, which did not suit Fyodor Pavlovitch at all. \u201cWhy are your fits getting worse?\u201d asked Fyodor Pavlovitch, looking askance at his new cook. \u201cWould you like to get married? Shall I find you a wife?\u201d But Smerdyakov turned pale with anger, and made no reply. Fyodor Pavlovitch left him with an impatient gesture.

All mankind in our age have split up into units, they all keep apart, each in his own groove; each one holds aloof, hides himself and hides what he has, from the rest, and he ends by being repelled by others and repelling them. He heaps up riches by himself and thinks, \u2018How strong I am now and how secure,\u2019 and in his madness he does not understand that the more he heaps up, the more he sinks into self\u2010destructive impotence.

He was weak in health, it is true; but in character, in spirit, he was by no means the weak man the prosecutor has made him out to be. I found in him no trace of the timidity on which the prosecutor so insisted. There was no simplicity about him, either.

Another thing that was strange was that Alyosha did not make any attempt to talk about Mitya with Ivan, that he never began on the subject and only answered his questions. This, too, struck Ivan particularly. But he was very much preoccupied at that time with something quite apart from that. On his return from Moscow, he abandoned himself hopelessly to his mad and consuming passion for Katerina Ivanovna.

When she died, little Alexey was in his fourth year, and, strange as it seems, I know that he remembered his mother all his life, like a dream, of course. At her death almost exactly the same thing happened to the two little boys as to their elder brother, Mitya. They were completely forgotten and abandoned by their father. They were looked after by the same Grigory and lived in his cottage, where they were found by the tyrannical old lady who had brought up their mother. She was still alive, and had not, all those eight years, forgotten the insult done her.

But the boy grows up and becomes an officer; for a duel and other reckless conduct he is exiled to one of the remote frontier towns of Russia. There he led a wild life as an officer. And, of course, he needed money, money before all things, and so after prolonged disputes he came to a settlement with his father, and the last six thousand was sent him. A letter is in existence in which he practically gives up his claim to the rest and settles his conflict with his father over the inheritance on the payment of this six thousand. \u201cThen came his meeting with a young girl of lofty character and brilliant education. Oh, I do not venture to repeat the details; you have only just heard them. Honor, self\u2010sacrifice were shown there, and I will be silent. The figure of the young officer, frivolous and profligate, doing homage to true nobility and a lofty ideal, was shown in a very sympathetic light before us.", " Chapter X. Both Together Alyosha left his father\u2019s house feeling even more exhausted and dejected in spirit than when he had entered it. His mind too seemed shattered and unhinged, while he felt that he was afraid to put together the disjointed fragments and form a general idea from all the agonizing and conflicting experiences of the day. He felt something bordering upon despair, which he had never known till then. Towering like a mountain above all the rest stood the fatal, insoluble question: How would things end between his father and his brother Dmitri with this terrible woman? Now he had himself been a witness of it, he had been present and seen them face to face. Yet only his brother Dmitri could be made unhappy, terribly, completely unhappy: there was trouble awaiting him. It appeared too that there were other people concerned, far more so than Alyosha could have supposed before.", " \u201cDear, dear!\u201d kept exclaiming the captain.

Well, here, I\u2019ve brought it to you.\u201d And Kolya hurriedly pulled out of his satchel the little bronze cannon. He hurried, because he was happy himself. Another time he would have waited till the sensation made by Perezvon had passed off, now he hurried on regardless of all consideration. \u201cYou are all happy now,\u201d he felt, \u201cso here\u2019s something to make you happier!\u201d He was perfectly enchanted himself. \u201cI\u2019ve been coveting this thing for a long while; it\u2019s for you, old man, it\u2019s for you.

But all this could only be on condition of the first, the _happy_ solution of the question. There was another possibility, a different and awful ending. Suddenly she might say to him: \u201cGo away. I have just come to terms with Fyodor Pavlovitch. I am going to marry him and don\u2019t want you\u201d\u2014and then ... but then.... But Mitya did not know what would happen then. Up to the last hour he didn\u2019t know. That must be said to his credit. He had no definite intentions, had planned no crime. He was simply watching and spying in agony, while he prepared himself for the first, happy solution of his destiny. He drove away any other idea, in fact. But for that ending a quite different anxiety arose, a new, incidental, but yet fatal and insoluble difficulty presented itself.

That\u2019s right!\u201d And again he seized Alyosha, putting both hands on his shoulders. His face became suddenly quite pale, so that it was dreadfully apparent, even through the gathering darkness.

When Ivan Fyodorovitch was leaving for Moscow, just before the catastrophe, Smerdyakov besought him to remain, though he was too timid to tell him plainly what he feared. He confined himself to hints, but his hints were not understood. \u201cIt must be observed that he looked on Ivan Fyodorovitch as a protector, whose presence in the house was a guarantee that no harm would come to pass. Remember the phrase in Dmitri Karamazov\u2019s drunken letter, \u2018I shall kill the old man, if only Ivan goes away.\u2019 So Ivan Fyodorovitch\u2019s presence seemed to every one a guarantee of peace and order in the house."], "Where does Dmitri experience spiritual conversion?": [" And there\u2019s no need of much teaching or explanation, he will understand it all simply.

I don\u2019t go into that mystery and I shun it. But I think if there were fire in material sense, they would be glad of it, for I imagine that in material agony, their still greater spiritual agony would be forgotten for a moment. Moreover, that spiritual agony cannot be taken from them, for that suffering is not external but within them. And if it could be taken from them, I think it would be bitterer still for the unhappy creatures. For even if the righteous in Paradise forgave them, beholding their torments, and called them up to heaven in their infinite love, they would only multiply their torments, for they would arouse in them still more keenly a flaming thirst for responsive, active and grateful love which is now impossible.", " And Ippolit Kirillovitch was, in the opinion of our ladies, \u201ccrushed for good.\u201d Then the prisoner was allowed to speak.

He seemed as though he had passed through an experience that day, which had taught him for the rest of his life something very important he had not understood till then. His voice was weak, he did not shout as before. In his words there was a new note of humility, defeat and submission. \u201cWhat am I to say, gentlemen of the jury?

Blessing them, the elder replied with as deep a reverence to them, and asked their blessing. The whole ceremony was performed very seriously and with an appearance of feeling, not like an everyday rite. But Mi\u00fcsov fancied that it was all done with intentional impressiveness.

He ought\u2014he had reflected upon it the evening before\u2014from simple politeness, since it was the custom here, to have gone up to receive the elder\u2019s blessing, even if he did not kiss his hand. But when he saw all this bowing and kissing on the part of the monks he instantly changed his mind. With dignified gravity he made a rather deep, conventional bow, and moved away to a chair.

He was brought up by Grigory and Marfa, but the boy grew up \u201cwith no sense of gratitude,\u201d as Grigory expressed it; he was an unfriendly boy, and seemed to look at the world mistrustfully.

And if that is so, if they dare not forgive, what becomes of harmony? Is there in the whole world a being who would have the right to forgive and could forgive? I don\u2019t want harmony. From love for humanity I don\u2019t want it. I would rather be left with the unavenged suffering. I would rather remain with my unavenged suffering and unsatisfied indignation, _even if I were wrong_. Besides, too high a price is asked for harmony; it\u2019s beyond our means to pay so much to enter on it. And so I hasten to give back my entrance ticket, and if I am an honest man I am bound to give it back as soon as possible. And that I am doing. It\u2019s not God that I don\u2019t accept, Alyosha, only I most respectfully return Him the ticket.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s rebellion,\u201d murmured Alyosha, looking down.", " Otherwise we are not fathers, but enemies of our children, and they are not our children, but our enemies, and we have made them our enemies ourselves. \u2018What measure ye mete it shall be measured unto you again\u2019\u2014it\u2019s not I who say that, it\u2019s the Gospel precept, measure to others according as they measure to you. How can we blame children if they measure us according to our measure? \u201cNot long ago a servant girl in Finland was suspected of having secretly given birth to a child. She was watched, and a box of which no one knew anything was found in the corner of the loft, behind some bricks. It was opened and inside was found the body of a new\u2010born child which she had killed. In the same box were found the skeletons of two other babies which, according to her own confession, she had killed at the moment of their birth. \u201cGentlemen of the jury, was she a mother to her children? She gave birth to them, indeed; but was she a mother to them?", " That was the picture! And Alyosha remembered his mother\u2019s face at that minute. He used to say that it was frenzied but beautiful as he remembered. But he rarely cared to speak of this memory to any one. In his childhood and youth he was by no means expansive, and talked little indeed, but not from shyness or a sullen unsociability; quite the contrary, from something different, from a sort of inner preoccupation entirely personal and unconcerned with other people, but so important to him that he seemed, as it were, to forget others on account of it. But he was fond of people: he seemed throughout his life to put implicit trust in people: yet no one ever looked on him as a simpleton or na\u00efve person. There was something about him which made one feel at once (and it was so all his life afterwards) that he did not care to be a judge of others\u2014that he would never take it upon himself to criticize and would never condemn any one for anything.", " From some rumor, or perhaps from some stray word of Grushenka\u2019s, he had gathered further that the old man would perhaps prefer him to Fyodor Pavlovitch for Grushenka. Possibly many of the readers of my novel will feel that in reckoning on such assistance, and being ready to take his bride, so to speak, from the hands of her protector, Dmitri showed great coarseness and want of delicacy. I will only observe that Mitya looked upon Grushenka\u2019s past as something completely over. He looked on that past with infinite pity and resolved with all the fervor of his passion that when once Grushenka told him she loved him and would marry him, it would mean the beginning of a new Grushenka and a new Dmitri, free from every vice. They would forgive one another and would begin their lives afresh. As for Kuzma Samsonov, Dmitri looked upon him as a man who had exercised a fateful influence in that remote past of Grushenka\u2019s, though she had never loved him, and who was now himself a thing of the past, completely done with, and, so to say, non\u2010existent."], "According to Zosima, what is the path to self-knowledge?": [" But he was almost dying of weakness and disease, and they had no one to take his place. The question for our monastery was an important one, for it had not been distinguished by anything in particular till then: they had neither relics of saints, nor wonder\u2010working ikons, nor glorious traditions, nor historical exploits. It had flourished and been glorious all over Russia through its elders, to see and hear whom pilgrims had flocked for thousands of miles from all parts. What was such an elder? An elder was one who took your soul, your will, into his soul and his will. When you choose an elder, you renounce your own will and yield it to him in complete submission, complete self\u2010 abnegation. This novitiate, this terrible school of abnegation, is undertaken voluntarily, in the hope of self\u2010conquest, of self\u2010mastery, in order, after a life of obedience, to attain perfect freedom, that is, from self; to escape the lot of those who have lived their whole life without finding their true selves in themselves.", " Otherwise we are not fathers, but enemies of our children, and they are not our children, but our enemies, and we have made them our enemies ourselves. \u2018What measure ye mete it shall be measured unto you again\u2019\u2014it\u2019s not I who say that, it\u2019s the Gospel precept, measure to others according as they measure to you.

She gave birth to them, indeed; but was she a mother to them?", " Mysterious, and perhaps awful. As he hastened out of the hermitage precincts to reach the monastery in time to serve at the Father Superior\u2019s dinner, he felt a sudden pang at his heart, and stopped short. He seemed to hear again Father Zossima\u2019s words, foretelling his approaching end. What he had foretold so exactly must infallibly come to pass. Alyosha believed that implicitly. But how could he be left without him? How could he live without seeing and hearing him? Where should he go? He had told him not to weep, and to leave the monastery. Good God! It was long since Alyosha had known such anguish. He hurried through the copse that divided the monastery from the hermitage, and unable to bear the burden of his thoughts, he gazed at the ancient pines beside the path. He had not far to go\u2014about five hundred paces. He expected to meet no one at that hour, but at the first turn of the path he noticed Rakitin.", " All this will not degrade it in any way or take from its honor and glory as a great State, nor from the glory of its rulers, but only turns it from a false, still pagan, and mistaken path to the true and rightful path, which alone leads to the eternal goal. This is why the author of the book _On the Foundations of Church Jurisdiction_ would have judged correctly if, in seeking and laying down those foundations, he had looked upon them as a temporary compromise inevitable in our sinful and imperfect days. But as soon as the author ventures to declare that the foundations which he predicates now, part of which Father Iosif just enumerated, are the permanent, essential, and eternal foundations, he is going directly against the Church and its sacred and eternal vocation. That is the gist of my article.\u201d \u201cThat is, in brief,\u201d Father Pa\u00efssy began again, laying stress on each word, \u201caccording to certain theories only too clearly formulated in the nineteenth century, the Church ought to be transformed into the State, as though this would be an advance from a lower to a higher form, so as to disappear into it, making way for science, for the spirit of the age, and civilization."], "Which of the following serves as a symbol of the necessity for faith to triumph over doubt?": [" \u201cYour words are worth a gold piece, O ass, and I\u2019ll give it to you to\u2010day. But as to the rest you talk nonsense, nonsense, nonsense. Let me tell you, stupid, that we here are all of little faith, only from carelessness, because we haven\u2019t time; things are too much for us, and, in the second place, the Lord God has given us so little time, only twenty\u2010four hours in the day, so that one hasn\u2019t even time to get sleep enough, much less to repent of one\u2019s sins. While you have denied your faith to your enemies when you\u2019d nothing else to think about but to show your faith! So I consider, brother, that it constitutes a sin.\u201d \u201cConstitute a sin it may, but consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch, that it only extenuates it, if it does constitute. If I had believed then in very truth, as I ought to have believed, then it really would have been sinful if I had not faced tortures for my faith, and had gone over to the pagan Mohammedan faith.", " Some were almost fanatically devoted to him, and declared, though not quite aloud, that he was a saint, that there could be no doubt of it, and, seeing that his end was near, they anticipated miracles and great glory to the monastery in the immediate future from his relics. Alyosha had unquestioning faith in the miraculous power of the elder, just as he had unquestioning faith in the story of the coffin that flew out of the church. He saw many who came with sick children or relatives and besought the elder to lay hands on them and to pray over them, return shortly after\u2014some the next day\u2014and, falling in tears at the elder\u2019s feet, thank him for healing their sick. Whether they had really been healed or were simply better in the natural course of the disease was a question which did not exist for Alyosha, for he fully believed in the spiritual power of his teacher and rejoiced in his fame, in his glory, as though it were his own triumph.", " Well, Grigory Vassilyevitch, if I\u2019m without faith and you have so great a faith that you are continually swearing at me, you try yourself telling this mountain, not to move into the sea for that\u2019s a long way off, but even to our stinking little river which runs at the bottom of the garden. You\u2019ll see for yourself that it won\u2019t budge, but will remain just where it is however much you shout at it, and that shows, Grigory Vassilyevitch, that you haven\u2019t faith in the proper manner, and only abuse others about it. Again, taking into consideration that no one in our day, not only you, but actually no one, from the highest person to the lowest peasant, can shove mountains into the sea\u2014except perhaps some one man in the world, or, at most, two, and they most likely are saving their souls in secret somewhere in the Egyptian desert, so you wouldn\u2019t find them\u2014if so it be, if all the rest have no faith, will God curse all the rest?", " that is, the population of the whole earth, except about two hermits in the desert, and in His well\u2010known mercy will He not forgive one of them? And so I\u2019m persuaded that though I may once have doubted I shall be forgiven if I shed tears of repentance.\u201d \u201cStay!\u201d cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, in a transport of delight. \u201cSo you do suppose there are two who can move mountains? Ivan, make a note of it, write it down. There you have the Russian all over!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re quite right in saying it\u2019s characteristic of the people\u2019s faith,\u201d Ivan assented, with an approving smile. \u201cYou agree. Then it must be so, if you agree. It\u2019s true, isn\u2019t it, Alyosha? That\u2019s the Russian faith all over, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cNo, Smerdyakov has not the Russian faith at all,\u201d said Alyosha firmly and gravely. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about his faith. I mean those two in the desert, only that idea. Surely that\u2019s Russian, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cYes, that\u2019s purely Russian,\u201d said Alyosha smiling."]}
