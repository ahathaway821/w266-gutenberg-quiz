{"To whom does Shelbysell Tom and Harry?": [" That crop of little, short curls, is quite becoming. Put on your cap. So--a little to one side. I never saw you look quite so pretty. But, it\u2019s almost time for the carriage;--I wonder if Mrs. Smyth has got Harry rigged?\u201d The door opened, and a respectable, middle-aged woman entered, leading little Harry, dressed in girl\u2019s clothes. \u201cWhat a pretty girl he makes,\u201d said Eliza, turning him round. \u201cWe call him Harriet, you see;--don\u2019t the name come nicely?\u201d The child stood gravely regarding his mother in her new and strange attire, observing a profound silence, and occasionally drawing deep sighs, and peeping at her from under his dark curls. \u201cDoes Harry know mamma?\u201d said Eliza, stretching her hands toward him. The child clung shyly to the woman. \u201cCome Eliza, why do you try to coax him, when you know that he has got to be kept away from you?\u201d \u201cI know it\u2019s foolish,\u201d said Eliza; \u201cyet, I can\u2019t bear to have him turn away from me.", " I shall have to sell some of my hands.\u201d \u201cTo that creature? Impossible!

O, Mr. Shelby!--and you have promised him his freedom, too,--you and I have spoken to him a hundred times of it. Well, I can believe anything now,--I can believe _now_ that you could sell little Harry, poor Eliza\u2019s only child!\u201d said Mrs. Shelby, in a tone between grief and indignation. \u201cWell, since you must know all, it is so. I have agreed to sell Tom and Harry both; and I don\u2019t know why I am to be rated, as if I were a monster, for doing what every one does every day.\u201d \u201cBut why, of all others, choose these?\u201d said Mrs. Shelby. \u201cWhy sell them, of all on the place, if you must sell at all?\u201d \u201cBecause they will bring the highest sum of any,--that\u2019s why.", " \u201cWouldn\u2019t it shake your faith some, Tom?\u201d \u201cNot a grain,\u201d said Tom. \u201cWhy, Tom, you must know I know the most.\u201d \u201cO, Mas\u2019r, haven\u2019t you jest read how he hides from the wise and prudent, and reveals unto babes? But Mas\u2019r wasn\u2019t in earnest, for sartin, now?\u201d said Tom, anxiously. \u201cNo, Tom, I was not. I don\u2019t disbelieve, and I think there is reason to believe; and still I don\u2019t. It\u2019s a troublesome bad habit I\u2019ve got, Tom.\u201d \u201cIf Mas\u2019r would only pray!\u201d \u201cHow do you know I don\u2019t, Tom?\u201d \u201cDoes Mas\u2019r?\u201d \u201cI would, Tom, if there was anybody there when I pray; but it\u2019s all speaking unto nothing, when I do. But come, Tom, you pray now, and show me how.\u201d Tom\u2019s heart was full; he poured it out in prayer, like waters that have been long suppressed. One thing was plain enough; Tom thought there was somebody to hear, whether there were or not. In fact, St. Clare felt himself borne, on the tide of his faith and feeling, almost to the gates of that heaven he seemed so vividly to conceive.", " It was some trouble to arouse the little sleeper; but, after some effort, he sat up, and was playing with his bird, while his mother was putting on her bonnet and shawl. \u201cWhere are you going, mother?\u201d said he, as she drew near the bed, with his little coat and cap. His mother drew near, and looked so earnestly into his eyes, that he at once divined that something unusual was the matter. \u201cHush, Harry,\u201d she said; \u201cmustn\u2019t speak loud, or they will hear us. A wicked man was coming to take little Harry away from his mother, and carry him \u2019way off in the dark; but mother won\u2019t let him--she\u2019s going to put on her little boy\u2019s cap and coat, and run off with him, so the ugly man can\u2019t catch him.\u201d Saying these words, she had tied and buttoned on the child\u2019s simple outfit, and, taking him in her arms, she whispered to him to be very still; and, opening a door in her room which led into the outer verandah, she glided noiselessly out."], "In what year wasthe Fugitive Slave Act passed?": [" How sublimely he had sat with his hands in his pockets, and scouted all sentimental weakness of those who would put the welfare of a few miserable fugitives before great state interests! He was as bold as a lion about it, and \u201cmightily convinced\u201d not only himself, but everybody that heard him;--but then his idea of a fugitive was only an idea of the letters that spell the word,--or at the most, the image of a little newspaper picture of a man with a stick and bundle with \u201cRan away from the subscriber\u201d under it. The magic of the real presence of distress,--the imploring human eye, the frail, trembling human hand, the despairing appeal of helpless agony,--these he had never tried. He had never thought that a fugitive might be a hapless mother, a defenceless child,--like that one which was now wearing his lost boy\u2019s little well-known cap; and so, as our poor senator was not stone or steel,--as he was a man, and a downright noble-hearted one, too,--he was, as everybody must see, in a sad case for his patriotism.", " Tell me where you were born, and who your father and mother were.\u201d \u201cNever was born,\u201d reiterated the creature, more emphatically; \u201cnever had no father nor mother, nor nothin\u2019.

O, that child!--how I loved it! How just like my poor Henry the little thing looked! But I had made up my mind,--yes, I had. I would never again let a child live to grow up! I took the little fellow in my arms, when he was two weeks old, and kissed him, and cried over him; and then I gave him laudanum, and held him close to my bosom, while he slept to death. How I mourned and cried over it! and who ever dreamed that it was anything but a mistake, that had made me give it the laudanum? but it\u2019s one of the few things that I\u2019m glad of, now. I am not sorry, to this day; he, at least, is out of pain. What better than death could I give him, poor child! After a while, the cholera came, and Captain Stuart died; everybody died that wanted to live,--and I,--I, though I went down to death\u2019s door,--_I lived!_ Then I was sold, and passed from hand to hand, till I grew faded and wrinkled, and I had a fever; and then this wretch bought me, and brought me here,--and here I am!\u201d The woman stopped.", " He had seen Death many times,--met him in the way of trade, and got acquainted with him,--and he only thought of him as a hard customer, that embarrassed his property operations very unfairly; and so he only swore that the gal was a baggage, and that he was devilish unlucky, and that, if things went on in this way, he should not make a cent on the trip. In short, he seemed to consider himself an ill-used man, decidedly; but there was no help for it, as the woman had escaped into a state which _never will_ give up a fugitive,--not even at the demand of the whole glorious Union. The trader, therefore, sat discontentedly down, with his little account-book, and put down the missing body and soul under the head of _losses!_ \u201cHe\u2019s a shocking creature, isn\u2019t he,--this trader? so unfeeling! It\u2019s dreadful, really!\u201d \u201cO, but nobody thinks anything of these traders! They are universally despised,--never received into any decent society.\u201d But who, sir, makes the trader?"], "In what city dothe St. Clares live?": [" The higher circle in the family--to wit, Adolph, Jane and Rosa--agreed that she was no lady; ladies never keep working about as she did,--that she had no _air_ at all; and they were surprised that she should be any relation of the St. Clares. Even Marie declared that it was absolutely fatiguing to see Cousin Ophelia always so busy. And, in fact, Miss Ophelia\u2019s industry was so incessant as to lay some foundation for the complaint. She sewed and stitched away, from daylight till dark, with the energy of one who is pressed on by some immediate urgency; and then, when the light faded, and the work was folded away, with one turn out came the ever-ready knitting-work, and there she was again, going on as briskly as ever. It really was a labor to see her. CHAPTER XX Topsy One morning, while Miss Ophelia was busy in some of her domestic cares, St. Clare\u2019s voice was heard, calling her at the foot of the stairs.", " He had been taken in so by \u201cniggers\u201d whom he had favored; but still he was astonished to consider how good-natured he yet remained! As to Tom, he was thinking over some words of an unfashionable old book, which kept running through his head, again and again, as follows: \u201cWe have here no continuing city, but we seek one to come; wherefore God himself is not ashamed to be called our God; for he hath prepared for us a city.\u201d These words of an ancient volume, got up principally by \u201cignorant and unlearned men,\u201d have, through all time, kept up, somehow, a strange sort of power over the minds of poor, simple fellows, like Tom. They stir up the soul from its depths, and rouse, as with trumpet call, courage, energy, and enthusiasm, where before was only the blackness of despair. Mr. Haley pulled out of his pocket sundry newspapers, and began looking over their advertisements, with absorbed interest.", " It was George Shelby; and, to show how he came to be there, we must go back in our story. The letter of Miss Ophelia to Mrs. Shelby had, by some unfortunate accident, been detained, for a month or two, at some remote post-office, before it reached its destination; and, of course, before it was received, Tom was already lost to view among the distant swamps of the Red River. Mrs. Shelby read the intelligence with the deepest concern; but any immediate action upon it was an impossibility. She was then in attendance on the sick-bed of her husband, who lay delirious in the crisis of a fever. Master George Shelby, who, in the interval, had changed from a boy to a tall young man, was her constant and faithful assistant, and her only reliance in superintending his father\u2019s affairs. Miss Ophelia had taken the precaution to send them the name of the lawyer who did business for the St. Clares; and the most that, in the emergency, could be done, was to address a letter of inquiry to him.", " In a few days the St. Clare family were back again in the city; Augustine, with the restlessness of grief, longing for another scene, to change the current of his thoughts. So they left the house and garden, with its little grave, and came back to New Orleans; and St. Clare walked the streets busily, and strove to fill up the chasm in his heart with hurry and bustle, and change of place; and people who saw him in the street, or met him at the cafe, knew of his loss only by the weed on his hat; for there he was, smiling and talking, and reading the newspaper, and speculating on politics, and attending to business matters; and who could see that all this smiling outside was but a hollowed shell over a heart that was a dark and silent sepulchre? \u201cMr. St. Clare is a singular man,\u201d said Marie to Miss Ophelia, in a complaining tone. \u201cI used to think, if there was anything in the world he did love, it was our dear little Eva; but he seems to be forgetting her very easily."], "How old is Emmeline?": [" we are _all_ sinners; but what have _we_ done, more than all the rest of the world, that we should be treated so?\u201d There was a terrible earnestness in her face and voice, as she spoke. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for _you_, child,\u201d she said, looking at Emmeline, \u201cI\u2019d _go_ out to them; and I\u2019d thank any one of them that _would_ shoot me down; for what use will freedom be to me? Can it give me back my children, or make me what I used to be?\u201d Emmeline, in her child-like simplicity, was half afraid of the dark moods of Cassy. She looked perplexed, but made no answer. She only took her hand, with a gentle, caressing movement. \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d said Cassy, trying to draw it away; \u201cyou\u2019ll get me to loving you; and I never mean to love anything, again!\u201d \u201cPoor Cassy!\u201d said Emmeline, \u201cdon\u2019t feel so! If the Lord gives us liberty, perhaps he\u2019ll give you back your daughter; at any rate, I\u2019ll be like a daughter to you. I know I\u2019ll never see my poor old mother again!", " \u201cI meant to stop your fainting,\u201d said Cassy, \u201cand I did do it. And now I tell you, Emmeline, you must make up your mind _not_ to faint, let what will come; there\u2019s no sort of need of it. If I had not stopped you, that wretch might have had his hands on you now.\u201d Emmeline shuddered. The two remained some time in silence. Cassy busied herself with a French book; Emmeline, overcome with the exhaustion, fell into a doze, and slept some time. She was awakened by loud shouts and outcries, the tramp of horses\u2019 feet, and the baying of dogs. She started up, with a faint shriek. \u201cOnly the hunt coming back,\u201d said Cassy, coolly; \u201cnever fear. Look out of this knot-hole. Don\u2019t you see \u2019em all down there? Simon has to give up, for this night. Look, how muddy his horse is, flouncing about in the swamp; the dogs, too, look rather crestfallen. Ah, my good sir, you\u2019ll have to try the race again and again,--the game isn\u2019t there.\u201d \u201cO, don\u2019t speak a word!\u201d said Emmeline; \u201cwhat if they should hear you?\u201d \u201cIf they do hear anything, it will make them very particular to keep away,\u201d said Cassy.", " \u201cHere, you Sambo,\u201d said Legree, \u201ctake these yer boys down to the quarters; and here\u2019s a gal I\u2019ve got for _you_,\u201d said he, as he separated the mulatto woman from Emmeline, and pushed her towards him;--\u201cI promised to bring you one, you know.\u201d The woman gave a start, and drawing back, said, suddenly, \u201cO, Mas\u2019r! I left my old man in New Orleans.\u201d \u201cWhat of that, you--; won\u2019t you want one here? None o\u2019 your words,--go long!\u201d said Legree, raising his whip. \u201cCome, mistress,\u201d he said to Emmeline, \u201cyou go in here with me.\u201d A dark, wild face was seen, for a moment, to glance at the window of the house; and, as Legree opened the door, a female voice said something, in a quick, imperative tone. Tom, who was looking, with anxious interest, after Emmeline, as she went in, noticed this, and heard Legree answer, angrily, \u201cYou may hold your tongue! I\u2019ll do as I please, for all you!\u201d Tom heard no more; for he was soon following Sambo to the quarters.", " As if the poor, dumb heart, threatened,--prisoned,--took refuge in that inarticulate sanctuary of music, and found there a language in which to breathe its prayer to God! There was a prayer in it, which Simon could not hear. He only heard the boys singing noisily, and was well pleased; he was making them \u201ckeep up their spirits.\u201d \u201cWell, my little dear,\u201d said he, turning to Emmeline, and laying his hand on her shoulder, \u201cwe\u2019re almost home!\u201d When Legree scolded and stormed, Emmeline was terrified; but when he laid his hand on her, and spoke as he now did, she felt as if she had rather he would strike her. The expression of his eyes made her soul sick, and her flesh creep. Involuntarily she clung closer to the mulatto woman by her side, as if she were her mother. \u201cYou didn\u2019t ever wear ear-rings,\u201d he said, taking hold of her small ear with his coarse fingers. \u201cNo, Mas\u2019r!\u201d said Emmeline, trembling and looking down."], "Who is Eliza\u2019smother?": [" Now my fate is all narrowing down to a point. To come so near, to be almost in sight, and then lose all. I should never live under it, Eliza.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t fear,\u201d said his wife, hopefully. \u201cThe good Lord would not have brought us so far, if he didn\u2019t mean to carry us through.

Will these years and years of misery come to an end?--shall we be free? \u201cI am sure of it, George,\u201d said Eliza, looking upward, while tears of hope and enthusiasm shone on her long, dark lashes. \u201cI feel it in me, that God is going to bring us out of bondage, this very day.\u201d \u201cI will believe you, Eliza,\u201d said George, rising suddenly up, \u201cI will believe,--come let\u2019s be off.

Does thee know it? Thy father is coming,\u201d she said, over and over again, as the boy looked wonderingly at her. Meanwhile, within the door, another scene was going on. Rachel Halliday drew Eliza toward her, and said, \u201cThe Lord hath had mercy on thee, daughter; thy husband hath escaped from the house of bondage.\u201d The blood flushed to Eliza\u2019s cheek in a sudden glow, and went back to her heart with as sudden a rush.", " That crop of little, short curls, is quite becoming. Put on your cap. So--a little to one side. I never saw you look quite so pretty. But, it\u2019s almost time for the carriage;--I wonder if Mrs. Smyth has got Harry rigged?\u201d The door opened, and a respectable, middle-aged woman entered, leading little Harry, dressed in girl\u2019s clothes. \u201cWhat a pretty girl he makes,\u201d said Eliza, turning him round. \u201cWe call him Harriet, you see;--don\u2019t the name come nicely?\u201d The child stood gravely regarding his mother in her new and strange attire, observing a profound silence, and occasionally drawing deep sighs, and peeping at her from under his dark curls. \u201cDoes Harry know mamma?\u201d said Eliza, stretching her hands toward him.

As they were sitting down, a light tap sounded at the door, and Ruth entered. \u201cI just ran in,\u201d she said, \u201cwith these little stockings for the boy,--three pair, nice, warm woollen ones. It will be so cold, thee knows, in Canada.

The boat here stopped at a small landing to take in wood, and Eva, hearing her father\u2019s voice, bounded nimbly away. Tom rose up, and went forward to offer his service in wooding, and soon was busy among the hands.", " The prayer-meeting at Uncle Tom\u2019s had, in the order of hymn-singing, been protracted to a very late hour; and, as Uncle Tom had indulged himself in a few lengthy solos afterwards, the consequence was, that, although it was now between twelve and one o\u2019clock, he and his worthy helpmeet were not yet asleep. \u201cGood Lord! what\u2019s that?\u201d said Aunt Chloe, starting up and hastily drawing the curtain. \u201cMy sakes alive, if it an\u2019t Lizy!

Mrs. Shelby sat in the door, busy about some fine sewing; she seemed like one who had something on her mind, which she was seeking an opportunity to introduce. \u201cDo you know,\u201d she said, \u201cthat Chloe has had a letter from Tom?\u201d \u201cAh! has she? Tom \u2019s got some friend there, it seems. How is the old boy?\u201d \u201cHe has been bought by a very fine family, I should think,\u201d said Mrs. Shelby,--\u201cis kindly treated, and has not much to do.\u201d \u201cAh! well, I\u2019m glad of it,--very glad,\u201d said Mr. Shelby, heartily. \u201cTom, I suppose, will get reconciled to a Southern residence;--hardly want to come up here again.\u201d \u201cOn the contrary he inquires very anxiously,\u201d said Mrs. Shelby, \u201cwhen the money for his redemption is to be raised.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure _I_ don\u2019t know,\u201d said Mr. Shelby.", " CHAPTER XLIII Results The rest of our story is soon told. George Shelby, interested, as any other young man might be, by the romance of the incident, no less than by feelings of humanity, was at the pains to send to Cassy the bill of sale of Eliza; whose date and name all corresponded with her own knowledge of facts, and felt no doubt upon her mind as to the identity of her child. It remained now only for her to trace out the path of the fugitives. Madame de Thoux and she, thus drawn together by the singular coincidence of their fortunes, proceeded immediately to Canada, and began a tour of inquiry among the stations, where the numerous fugitives from slavery are located. At Amherstberg they found the missionary with whom George and Eliza had taken shelter, on their first arrival in Canada; and through him were enabled to trace the family to Montreal. George and Eliza had now been five years free.", " As we before stated, the two were in the midst of an earnest conversation. \u201cThat is the way I should arrange the matter,\u201d said Mr. Shelby. \u201cI can\u2019t make trade that way--I positively can\u2019t, Mr. Shelby,\u201d said the other, holding up a glass of wine between his eye and the light. \u201cWhy, the fact is, Haley, Tom is an uncommon fellow; he is certainly worth that sum anywhere,--steady, honest, capable, manages my whole farm like a clock.\u201d \u201cYou mean honest, as niggers go,\u201d said Haley, helping himself to a glass of brandy. \u201cNo; I mean, really, Tom is a good, steady, sensible, pious fellow. He got religion at a camp-meeting, four years ago; and I believe he really _did_ get it. I\u2019ve trusted him, since then, with everything I have,--money, house, horses,--and let him come and go round the country; and I always found him true and square in everything.\u201d \u201cSome folks don\u2019t believe there is pious niggers Shelby,\u201d said Haley, with a candid flourish of his hand, \u201cbut _I do_.", " I could choose another, if you say so. The fellow made me a high bid on Eliza, if that would suit you any better,\u201d said Mr. Shelby. \u201cThe wretch!\u201d said Mrs. Shelby, vehemently. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t listen to it, a moment,--out of regard to your feelings, I wouldn\u2019t;--so give me some credit.\u201d \u201cMy dear,\u201d said Mrs. Shelby, recollecting herself, \u201cforgive me. I have been hasty. I was surprised, and entirely unprepared for this;--but surely you will allow me to intercede for these poor creatures. Tom is a noble-hearted, faithful fellow, if he is black. I do believe, Mr. Shelby, that if he were put to it, he would lay down his life for you.\u201d \u201cI know it,--I dare say;--but what\u2019s the use of all this?--I can\u2019t help myself.\u201d \u201cWhy not make a pecuniary sacrifice?

Not but that is very proper; I\u2019ve done it myself, when I had health. But when you come to be dressing and going into company, you won\u2019t have time. See here!\u201d she added, \u201cthese jewels I\u2019m going to give you when you come out. I wore them to my first ball.

You\u2019ve been picking the flowers, hey?\u201d and Eva heard the sound of a smart slap. \u201cLaw, Missis! they \u2019s for Miss Eva,\u201d she heard a voice say, which she knew belonged to Topsy. \u201cMiss Eva! A pretty excuse!--you suppose she wants _your_ flowers, you good-for-nothing nigger! Get along off with you!\u201d In a moment, Eva was off from her lounge, and in the verandah. \u201cO, don\u2019t, mother!

She did it with a look of hesitation and bashfulness, quite unlike the eldrich boldness and brightness which was usual with her. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful bouquet!\u201d said Eva, looking at it. It was rather a singular one,--a brilliant scarlet geranium, and one single white japonica, with its glossy leaves.", " I will be resigned; I was wicked to speak as I did.\u201d Eva soon lay like a wearied dove in her father\u2019s arms; and he, bending over her, soothed her by every tender word he could think of.

I only gave them to our poor people myself, because you know, papa, they might be forgotten when I am gone, and because I hoped it might help them remember. . . .

There were no servants present, and the gentlemen, with chairs closely approaching, seemed to be discussing some subject with great earnestness. For convenience sake, we have said, hitherto, two _gentlemen_. One of the parties, however, when critically examined, did not seem, strictly speaking, to come under the species. He was a short, thick-set man, with coarse, commonplace features, and that swaggering air of pretension which marks a low man who is trying to elbow his way upward in the world.", " They stood silent; then there were last words, and sobs, and bitter weeping,--such parting as those may make whose hope to meet again is as the spider\u2019s web,--and the husband and wife were parted. CHAPTER IV An Evening in Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin The cabin of Uncle Tom was a small log building, close adjoining to \u201cthe house,\u201d as the negro _par excellence_ designates his master\u2019s dwelling. In front it had a neat garden-patch, where, every summer, strawberries, raspberries, and a variety of fruits and vegetables, flourished under careful tending. The whole front of it was covered by a large scarlet bignonia and a native multiflora rose, which, entwisting and interlacing, left scarce a vestige of the rough logs to be seen. Here, also, in summer, various brilliant annuals, such as marigolds, petunias, four-o\u2019clocks, found an indulgent corner in which to unfold their splendors, and were the delight and pride of Aunt Chloe\u2019s heart.", " But at last they got on quite confidential terms. \u201cWhat\u2019s little missy\u2019s name?\u201d said Tom, at last, when he thought matters were ripe to push such an inquiry. \u201cEvangeline St. Clare,\u201d said the little one, \u201cthough papa and everybody else call me Eva. Now, what\u2019s your name?\u201d \u201cMy name\u2019s Tom; the little chil\u2019en used to call me Uncle Tom, way back thar in Kentuck.\u201d \u201cThen I mean to call you Uncle Tom, because, you see, I like you,\u201d said Eva. \u201cSo, Uncle Tom, where are you going?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, Miss Eva.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t know?\u201d said Eva. \u201cNo, I am going to be sold to somebody. I don\u2019t know who.\u201d \u201cMy papa can buy you,\u201d said Eva, quickly; \u201cand if he buys you, you will have good times. I mean to ask him, this very day.\u201d \u201cThank you, my little lady,\u201d said Tom. The boat here stopped at a small landing to take in wood, and Eva, hearing her father\u2019s voice, bounded nimbly away. Tom rose up, and went forward to offer his service in wooding, and soon was busy among the hands.", " The prayer-meeting at Uncle Tom\u2019s had, in the order of hymn-singing, been protracted to a very late hour; and, as Uncle Tom had indulged himself in a few lengthy solos afterwards, the consequence was, that, although it was now between twelve and one o\u2019clock, he and his worthy helpmeet were not yet asleep. \u201cGood Lord! what\u2019s that?\u201d said Aunt Chloe, starting up and hastily drawing the curtain. \u201cMy sakes alive, if it an\u2019t Lizy! Get on your clothes, old man, quick!--there\u2019s old Bruno, too, a pawin round; what on airth! I\u2019m gwine to open the door.\u201d And suiting the action to the word, the door flew open, and the light of the tallow candle, which Tom had hastily lighted, fell on the haggard face and dark, wild eyes of the fugitive. \u201cLord bless you!--I\u2019m skeered to look at ye, Lizy! Are ye tuck sick, or what\u2019s come over ye?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m running away--Uncle Tom and Aunt Chloe--carrying off my child--Master sold him!\u201d \u201cSold him?\u201d echoed both, lifting up their hands in dismay."], "Over what riverdoes Eliza make her miraculous crossing?": [" Now my fate is all narrowing down to a point. To come so near, to be almost in sight, and then lose all.

Will these years and years of misery come to an end?--shall we be free? \u201cI am sure of it, George,\u201d said Eliza, looking upward, while tears of hope and enthusiasm shone on her long, dark lashes. \u201cI feel it in me, that God is going to bring us out of bondage, this very day.\u201d \u201cI will believe you, Eliza,\u201d said George, rising suddenly up, \u201cI will believe,--come let\u2019s be off.

The hostess, who was busy in various fizzing and stewing operations over the fire, preparatory to the evening meal, stopped, with a fork in her hand, as Eliza\u2019s sweet and plaintive voice arrested her. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d she said. \u201cIsn\u2019t there any ferry or boat, that takes people over to B----, now?\u201d she said. \u201cNo, indeed!\u201d said the woman; \u201cthe boats has stopped running.\u201d Eliza\u2019s look of dismay and disappointment struck the woman, and she said, inquiringly, \u201cMay be you\u2019re wanting to get over?--anybody sick?

Eliza turned to the glass, and the scissors glittered as one long lock after another was detached from her head. \u201cThere, now, that\u2019ll do,\u201d she said, taking up a hair-brush; \u201cnow for a few fancy touches.\u201d \u201cThere, an\u2019t I a pretty young fellow?\u201d she said, turning around to her husband, laughing and blushing at the same time. \u201cYou always will be pretty, do what you will,\u201d said George. \u201cWhat does make you so sober?\u201d said Eliza, kneeling on one knee, and laying her hand on his. \u201cWe are only within twenty-four hours of Canada, they say. Only a day and a night on the lake, and then--oh, then!--\u201d \u201cO, Eliza!\u201d said George, drawing her towards him; \u201cthat is it!", " \u201cTake her into thy bed-room, there, and let me fry the chicken while thee does it.\u201d Rachel came out into the kitchen, where Eliza was sewing, and opening the door of a small bed-room, said, gently, \u201cCome in here with me, my daughter; I have news to tell thee.\u201d The blood flushed in Eliza\u2019s pale face; she rose, trembling with nervous anxiety, and looked towards her boy. \u201cNo, no,\u201d said little Ruth, darting up, and seizing her hands. \u201cNever thee fear; it\u2019s good news, Eliza,--go in, go in!\u201d And she gently pushed her to the door which closed after her; and then, turning round, she caught little Harry in her arms, and began kissing him. \u201cThee\u2019ll see thy father, little one. Does thee know it? Thy father is coming,\u201d she said, over and over again, as the boy looked wonderingly at her. Meanwhile, within the door, another scene was going on. Rachel Halliday drew Eliza toward her, and said, \u201cThe Lord hath had mercy on thee, daughter; thy husband hath escaped from the house of bondage.\u201d The blood flushed to Eliza\u2019s cheek in a sudden glow, and went back to her heart with as sudden a rush."], "Who inheritsownership of Tom when St. Clare dies?": [" . . . \u201cAnd when will _my_ trouble be over?\u201d \u201cWhen Mas\u2019r St. Clare\u2019s a Christian,\u201d said Tom. \u201cAnd you really mean to stay by till that day comes?\u201d said St. Clare, half smiling, as he turned from the window, and laid his hand on Tom\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAh, Tom, you soft, silly boy!

St. Clare had just been entrusting Tom with some money, and various commissions. \u201cIsn\u2019t all right there, Tom?\u201d he added, as Tom still stood waiting. \u201cI\u2019m \u2019fraid not, Mas\u2019r,\u201d said Tom, with a grave face.

The whole object of the training to which the negro is put, from the time he is sold in the northern market till he arrives south, is systematically directed towards making him callous, unthinking, and brutal. The slave-dealer collects his gang in Virginia or Kentucky, and drives them to some convenient, healthy place,--often a watering place,--to be fattened. Here they are fed full daily; and, because some incline to pine, a fiddle is kept commonly going among them, and they are made to dance daily; and he who refuses to be merry--in whose soul thoughts of wife, or child, or home, are too strong for him to be gay--is marked as sullen and dangerous, and subjected to all the evils which the ill will of an utterly irresponsible and hardened man can inflict upon him."], "In what stateis Legree\u2019s plantation located?": [" \u201cHow have things been going?\u201d \u201cFust rate, Mas\u2019r.\u201d \u201cQuimbo,\u201d said Legree to another, who was making zealous demonstrations to attract his attention, \u201cye minded what I telled ye?\u201d \u201cGuess I did, didn\u2019t I?\u201d These two colored men were the two principal hands on the plantation.

It is a common remark, and one that is thought to militate strongly against the character of the race, that the negro overseer is always more tyrannical and cruel than the white one. This is simply saying that the negro mind has been more crushed and debased than the white. It is no more true of this race than of every oppressed race, the world over. The slave is always a tyrant, if he can get a chance to be one. Legree, like some potentates we read of in history, governed his plantation by a sort of resolution of forces.", " The under-servants, who were called on to effect this movement, were running and bustling about with great zeal and confusion, when Legree returned from a ride. \u201cHallo! you Cass!\u201d said Legree, \u201cwhat\u2019s in the wind now?\u201d \u201cNothing; only I choose to have another room,\u201d said Cassy, doggedly. \u201cAnd what for, pray?\u201d said Legree. \u201cI choose to,\u201d said Cassy. \u201cThe devil you do! and what for?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to get some sleep, now and then.\u201d \u201cSleep! well, what hinders your sleeping?\u201d \u201cI could tell, I suppose, if you want to hear,\u201d said Cassy, dryly. \u201cSpeak out, you minx!\u201d said Legree. \u201cO! nothing.

If we are not mistaken, the world will yet hear from him there. Of our other characters we have nothing very particular to write, except a word relating to Miss Ophelia and Topsy, and a farewell chapter, which we shall dedicate to George Shelby. Miss Ophelia took Topsy home to Vermont with her, much to the surprise of the grave deliberative body whom a New Englander recognizes under the term \u201c_Our folks_.\u201d \u201cOur folks,\u201d at first, thought it an odd and unnecessary addition to their well-trained domestic establishment; but, so thoroughly efficient was Miss Ophelia in her conscientious endeavor to do her duty by her _\u00e9l\u00e8ve_, that the child rapidly grew in grace and in favor with the family and neighborhood.", " I\u2019m helping him to write it,\u201d said Eva; \u201cisn\u2019t it nice?\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t discourage either of you,\u201d said St. Clare, \u201cbut I rather think, Tom, you\u2019d better get me to write your letter for you.

But he did not make any audible comment upon it,--only ordered Tom to get the horses out for a ride. Tom\u2019s letter was written in due form for him that evening, and safely lodged in the post-office. Miss Ophelia still persevered in her labors in the housekeeping line.

There were no servants present, and the gentlemen, with chairs closely approaching, seemed to be discussing some subject with great earnestness. For convenience sake, we have said, hitherto, two _gentlemen_. One of the parties, however, when critically examined, did not seem, strictly speaking, to come under the species.

In front it had a neat garden-patch, where, every summer, strawberries, raspberries, and a variety of fruits and vegetables, flourished under careful tending. The whole front of it was covered by a large scarlet bignonia and a native multiflora rose, which, entwisting and interlacing, left scarce a vestige of the rough logs to be seen. Here, also, in summer, various brilliant annuals, such as marigolds, petunias, four-o\u2019clocks, found an indulgent corner in which to unfold their splendors, and were the delight and pride of Aunt Chloe\u2019s heart.", " \u201cYes, Uncle Tom, it really begins to look beautiful,\u201d said Eva, gazing delightedly on it. \u201cHow pleased your wife\u2019ll be, and the poor little children!

George Shelby, interested, as any other young man might be, by the romance of the incident, no less than by feelings of humanity, was at the pains to send to Cassy the bill of sale of Eliza; whose date and name all corresponded with her own knowledge of facts, and felt no doubt upon her mind as to the identity of her child. It remained now only for her to trace out the path of the fugitives. Madame de Thoux and she, thus drawn together by the singular coincidence of their fortunes, proceeded immediately to Canada, and began a tour of inquiry among the stations, where the numerous fugitives from slavery are located. At Amherstberg they found the missionary with whom George and Eliza had taken shelter, on their first arrival in Canada; and through him were enabled to trace the family to Montreal.

Miss Ophelia, who seldom sat much in Marie\u2019s company, followed him into the parlor, having first carefully laid away the paper. \u201cAugustine,\u201d she said, suddenly, as she sat knitting, \u201chave you ever made any provision for your servants, in case of your death?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said St. Clare, as he read on. \u201cThen all your indulgence to them may prove a great cruelty, by and by.\u201d St. Clare had often thought the same thing himself; but he answered, negligently. \u201cWell, I mean to make a provision, by and by.\u201d \u201cWhen?\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cO, one of these days.\u201d \u201cWhat if you should die first?\u201d \u201cCousin, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d said St. Clare, laying down his paper and looking at her.", " \u201cWhat good do you expect it is going to do her?\u201d said St. Clare. \u201cWhy, it always has done children good.

I heard they were talking of some such law, but I didn\u2019t think any Christian legislature would pass it!\u201d \u201cWhy, Mary, you are getting to be a politician, all at once.\u201d \u201cNo, nonsense! I wouldn\u2019t give a fig for all your politics, generally, but I think this is something downright cruel and unchristian. I hope, my dear, no such law has been passed.\u201d \u201cThere has been a law passed forbidding people to help off the slaves that come over from Kentucky, my dear; so much of that thing has been done by these reckless Abolitionists, that our brethren in Kentucky are very strongly excited, and it seems necessary, and no more than Christian and kind, that something should be done by our state to quiet the excitement.\u201d \u201cAnd what is the law?", " So he lay for a few moments. They saw that the mighty hand was on him. Just before the spirit parted, he opened his eyes, with a sudden light, as of joy and recognition, and said _\u201cMother!\u201d_ and then he was gone! CHAPTER XXIX The Unprotected We hear often of the distress of the negro servants, on the loss of a kind master; and with good reason, for no creature on God\u2019s earth is left more utterly unprotected and desolate than the slave in these circumstances. The child who has lost a father has still the protection of friends, and of the law; he is something, and can do something,--has acknowledged rights and position; the slave has none. The law regards him, in every respect, as devoid of rights as a bale of merchandise. The only possible acknowledgment of any of the longings and wants of a human and immortal creature, which are given to him, comes to him through the sovereign and irresponsible will of his master; and when that master is stricken down, nothing remains.", " How sublimely he had sat with his hands in his pockets, and scouted all sentimental weakness of those who would put the welfare of a few miserable fugitives before great state interests! He was as bold as a lion about it, and \u201cmightily convinced\u201d not only himself, but everybody that heard him;--but then his idea of a fugitive was only an idea of the letters that spell the word,--or at the most, the image of a little newspaper picture of a man with a stick and bundle with \u201cRan away from the subscriber\u201d under it. The magic of the real presence of distress,--the imploring human eye, the frail, trembling human hand, the despairing appeal of helpless agony,--these he had never tried. He had never thought that a fugitive might be a hapless mother, a defenceless child,--like that one which was now wearing his lost boy\u2019s little well-known cap; and so, as our poor senator was not stone or steel,--as he was a man, and a downright noble-hearted one, too,--he was, as everybody must see, in a sad case for his patriotism.", " If there is, as we admit, a public sentiment among you, men of honor, justice and humanity, is there not also another kind of public sentiment among the ruffian, the brutal and debased? And cannot the ruffian, the brutal, the debased, by slave law, own just as many slaves as the best and purest? Are the honorable, the just, the high-minded and compassionate, the majority anywhere in this world? The slave-trade is now, by American law, considered as piracy. But a slave-trade, as systematic as ever was carried on on the coast of Africa, is an inevitable attendant and result of American slavery. And its heart-break and its horrors, can they be told? The writer has given only a faint shadow, a dim picture, of the anguish and despair that are, at this very moment, riving thousands of hearts, shattering thousands of families, and driving a helpless and sensitive race to frenzy and despair. There are those living who know the mothers whom this accursed traffic has driven to the murder of their children; and themselves seeking in death a shelter from woes more dreaded than death."], "Who beats UncleTom to death?": [" In the course of a year, I had a son born. O, that child!--how I loved it! How just like my poor Henry the little thing looked! But I had made up my mind,--yes, I had. I would never again let a child live to grow up! I took the little fellow in my arms, when he was two weeks old, and kissed him, and cried over him; and then I gave him laudanum, and held him close to my bosom, while he slept to death. How I mourned and cried over it! and who ever dreamed that it was anything but a mistake, that had made me give it the laudanum? but it\u2019s one of the few things that I\u2019m glad of, now. I am not sorry, to this day; he, at least, is out of pain. What better than death could I give him, poor child! After a while, the cholera came, and Captain Stuart died; everybody died that wanted to live,--and I,--I, though I went down to death\u2019s door,--_I lived!_ Then I was sold, and passed from hand to hand, till I grew faded and wrinkled, and I had a fever; and then this wretch bought me, and brought me here,--and here I am!\u201d The woman stopped.", " \u201cDo you think I show symptoms of yellow fever or cholera, that you are making post mortem arrangements with such zeal?\u201d \u201c\u2018In the midst of life we are in death,\u2019\u201d said Miss Ophelia. St. Clare rose up, and laying the paper down, carelessly, walked to the door that stood open on the verandah, to put an end to a conversation that was not agreeable to him. Mechanically, he repeated the last word again,--_\u201cDeath!\u201d_--and, as he leaned against the railings, and watched the sparkling water as it rose and fell in the fountain; and, as in a dim and dizzy haze, saw flowers and trees and vases of the courts, he repeated, again the mystic word so common in every mouth, yet of such fearful power,--\u201cDEATH!\u201d \u201cStrange that there should be such a word,\u201d he said, \u201cand such a thing, and we ever forget it; that one should be living, warm and beautiful, full of hopes, desires and wants, one day, and the next be gone, utterly gone, and forever!\u201d It was a warm, golden evening; and, as he walked to the other end of the verandah, he saw Tom busily intent on his Bible, pointing, as he did so, with his finger to each successive word, and whispering them to himself with an earnest air.", " So he reasons, because, as I said, he is born an aristocrat;--so I don\u2019t believe, because I was born a democrat.\u201d \u201cHow in the world can the two things be compared?\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cThe English laborer is not sold, traded, parted from his family, whipped.\u201d \u201cHe is as much at the will of his employer as if he were sold to him. The slave-owner can whip his refractory slave to death,--the capitalist can starve him to death. As to family security, it is hard to say which is the worst,--to have one\u2019s children sold, or see them starve to death at home.\u201d \u201cBut it\u2019s no kind of apology for slavery, to prove that it isn\u2019t worse than some other bad thing.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t give it for one,--nay, I\u2019ll say, besides, that ours is the more bold and palpable infringement of human rights; actually buying a man up, like a horse,--looking at his teeth, cracking his joints, and trying his paces and then paying down for him,--having speculators, breeders, traders, and brokers in human bodies and souls,--sets the thing before the eyes of the civilized world in a more tangible form, though the thing done be, after all, in its nature, the same; that is, appropriating one set of human beings to the use and improvement of another without any regard to their own.\u201d \u201cI never thought of the matter in this light,\u201d said Miss Ophelia.", " neither darkness nor shadow of death; only such a bright fading as when the morning star fades in the golden dawn. Thine is the victory without the battle,--the crown without the conflict. So did St. Clare think, as, with folded arms, he stood there gazing. Ah! who shall say what he did think? for, from the hour that voices had said, in the dying chamber, \u201cshe is gone,\u201d it had been all a dreary mist, a heavy \u201cdimness of anguish.\u201d He had heard voices around him; he had had questions asked, and answered them; they had asked him when he would have the funeral, and where they should lay her; and he had answered, impatiently, that he cared not. Adolph and Rosa had arranged the chamber; volatile, fickle and childish, as they generally were, they were soft-hearted and full of feeling; and, while Miss Ophelia presided over the general details of order and neatness, it was their hands that added those soft, poetic touches to the arrangements, that took from the death-room the grim and ghastly air which too often marks a New England funeral."], "What is Mrs.Shelby\u2019s first name?": [" Mr. Shelby sat in a large hall opening into the room, and running through the whole length of the house, to a balcony on either end. Leisurely tipped back on one chair, with his heels in another, he was enjoying his after-dinner cigar. Mrs. Shelby sat in the door, busy about some fine sewing; she seemed like one who had something on her mind, which she was seeking an opportunity to introduce. \u201cDo you know,\u201d she said, \u201cthat Chloe has had a letter from Tom?\u201d \u201cAh! has she? Tom \u2019s got some friend there, it seems.

Mr. Shelby was standing before his dressing-glass, sharpening his razor; and just then the door opened, and a colored boy entered, with his shaving-water. \u201cAndy,\u201d said his mistress, \u201cstep to Eliza\u2019s door, and tell her I have rung for her three times. Poor thing!\u201d she added, to herself, with a sigh. Andy soon returned, with eyes very wide in astonishment. \u201cLor, Missis! Lizy\u2019s drawers is all open, and her things all lying every which way; and I believe she\u2019s just done clared out!\u201d The truth flashed upon Mr. Shelby and his wife at the same moment. He exclaimed, \u201cThen she suspected it, and she\u2019s off!\u201d \u201cThe Lord be thanked!\u201d said Mrs. Shelby.", " It was George Shelby; and, to show how he came to be there, we must go back in our story. The letter of Miss Ophelia to Mrs. Shelby had, by some unfortunate accident, been detained, for a month or two, at some remote post-office, before it reached its destination; and, of course, before it was received, Tom was already lost to view among the distant swamps of the Red River. Mrs. Shelby read the intelligence with the deepest concern; but any immediate action upon it was an impossibility. She was then in attendance on the sick-bed of her husband, who lay delirious in the crisis of a fever. Master George Shelby, who, in the interval, had changed from a boy to a tall young man, was her constant and faithful assistant, and her only reliance in superintending his father\u2019s affairs. Miss Ophelia had taken the precaution to send them the name of the lawyer who did business for the St. Clares; and the most that, in the emergency, could be done, was to address a letter of inquiry to him.", " I could choose another, if you say so. The fellow made me a high bid on Eliza, if that would suit you any better,\u201d said Mr. Shelby. \u201cThe wretch!\u201d said Mrs. Shelby, vehemently. \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t listen to it, a moment,--out of regard to your feelings, I wouldn\u2019t;--so give me some credit.\u201d \u201cMy dear,\u201d said Mrs. Shelby, recollecting herself, \u201cforgive me. I have been hasty. I was surprised, and entirely unprepared for this;--but surely you will allow me to intercede for these poor creatures. Tom is a noble-hearted, faithful fellow, if he is black. I do believe, Mr. Shelby, that if he were put to it, he would lay down his life for you.\u201d \u201cI know it,--I dare say;--but what\u2019s the use of all this?--I can\u2019t help myself.\u201d \u201cWhy not make a pecuniary sacrifice?

A cold soft hand fell on Legree\u2019s at this moment. He turned,--it was Cassy\u2019s; but the cold soft touch recalled his dream of the night before, and, flashing through the chambers of his brain, came all the fearful images of the night-watches, with a portion of the horror that accompanied them.", " \u201cWouldn\u2019t it shake your faith some, Tom?\u201d \u201cNot a grain,\u201d said Tom. \u201cWhy, Tom, you must know I know the most.\u201d \u201cO, Mas\u2019r, haven\u2019t you jest read how he hides from the wise and prudent, and reveals unto babes?

If I wanted to put Jane and Rosa to a school, how many schools are there in the northern states that would take them in? how many families that would board them? and yet they are as white as many a woman, north or south.

Stung to madness and despair by the crushing agonies of a life, Cassy had often resolved in her soul an hour of retribution, when her hand should avenge on her oppressor all the injustice and cruelty to which she had been witness, or which _she_ had in her own person suffered.

He is a bright, likely fellow, too.\u201d \u201cShall we tell her now?\u201d said Simeon. \u201cLet\u2019s tell Ruth,\u201d said Rachel.", " The death of her husband had left her an ample fortune, which she generously offered to share with the family. When she asked George what way she could best apply it for him, he answered, \u201cGive me an education, Emily; that has always been my heart\u2019s desire. Then, I can do all the rest.\u201d On mature deliberation, it was decided that the whole family should go, for some years, to France; whither they sailed, carrying Emmeline with them. The good looks of the latter won the affection of the first mate of the vessel; and, shortly after entering the port, she became his wife. George remained four years at a French university, and, applying himself with an unintermitted zeal, obtained a very thorough education. Political troubles in France, at last, led the family again to seek an asylum in this country. George\u2019s feelings and views, as an educated man, may be best expressed in a letter to one of his friends."], "Who does Simon Legree buy at the slave market to replace Cassy as his mistress?": [" The under-servants, who were called on to effect this movement, were running and bustling about with great zeal and confusion, when Legree returned from a ride. \u201cHallo! you Cass!\u201d said Legree, \u201cwhat\u2019s in the wind now?\u201d \u201cNothing; only I choose to have another room,\u201d said Cassy, doggedly. \u201cAnd what for, pray?\u201d said Legree. \u201cI choose to,\u201d said Cassy. \u201cThe devil you do! and what for?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to get some sleep, now and then.\u201d \u201cSleep! well, what hinders your sleeping?\u201d \u201cI could tell, I suppose, if you want to hear,\u201d said Cassy, dryly. \u201cSpeak out, you minx!\u201d said Legree. \u201cO! nothing.

Well,\u201d said Cassy, \u201cat any rate, I\u2019m glad _I_ don\u2019t sleep under it.\u201d Anticipating the rising of the wind, that very evening, Cassy had been up and opened the garret window. Of course, the moment the doors were opened, the wind had drafted down, and extinguished the light. This may serve as a specimen of the game that Cassy played with Legree, until he would sooner have put his head into a lion\u2019s mouth than to have explored that garret. Meanwhile, in the night, when everybody else was asleep, Cassy slowly and carefully accumulated there a stock of provisions sufficient to afford subsistence for some time; she transferred, article by article, a greater part of her own and Emmeline\u2019s wardrobe.", " What business have you meddling in my matters?\u201d \u201cNone, to be sure.

Tompkins won\u2019t lord it over you, I suppose,--and you\u2019ll pay down your money like a lady, won\u2019t you? I think I see you doing it!\u201d Legree, like many other planters, had but one form of ambition,--to have in the heaviest crop of the season,--and he had several bets on this very present season pending in the next town. Cassy, therefore, with woman\u2019s tact, touched the only string that could be made to vibrate. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll let him off at what he\u2019s got,\u201d said Legree; \u201cbut he shall beg my pardon, and promise better fashions.\u201d \u201cThat he won\u2019t do,\u201d said Cassy. \u201cWon\u2019t,--eh?\u201d \u201cNo, he won\u2019t,\u201d said Cassy. \u201cI\u2019d like to know _why_, Mistress,\u201d said Legree, in the extreme of scorn.", " \u201cSimon Legree, take care!\u201d said the woman, with a sharp flash of her eye, a glance so wild and insane in its light as to be almost appalling. \u201cYou\u2019re afraid of me, Simon,\u201d she said, deliberately; \u201cand you\u2019ve reason to be! But be careful, for I\u2019ve got the devil in me!\u201d The last words she whispered in a hissing tone, close to his ear. \u201cGet out!

She stopped short,--a word of choking feelings, rising in her heart, kept her silent. Cassy had always kept over Legree the kind of influence that a strong, impassioned woman can ever keep over the most brutal man; but, of late, she had grown more and more irritable and restless, under the hideous yoke of her servitude, and her irritability, at times, broke out into raving insanity; and this liability made her a sort of object of dread to Legree, who had that superstitious horror of insane persons which is common to coarse and uninstructed minds."], "What experience prompts Tom Loker to abandon slave hunting and live a pious life?": [" I know there\u2019s differences in religion.

Northern men, northern mothers, northern Christians, have something more to do than denounce their brethren at the South; they have to look to the evil among themselves. But, what can any individual do? Of that, every individual can judge. There is one thing that every individual can do,--they can see to it that _they feel right_. An atmosphere of sympathetic influence encircles every human being; and the man or woman who _feels_ strongly, healthily and justly, on the great interests of humanity, is a constant benefactor to the human race. See, then, to your sympathies in this matter! Are they in harmony with the sympathies of Christ? or are they swayed and perverted by the sophistries of worldly policy? Christian men and women of the North!", " \u201cI feel somewhat at a loss, as to my future course. True, as you have said to me, I might mingle in the circles of the whites, in this country, my shade of color is so slight, and that of my wife and family scarce perceptible. Well, perhaps, on sufferance, I might. But, to tell you the truth, I have no wish to. \u201cMy sympathies are not for my father\u2019s race, but for my mother\u2019s. To him I was no more than a fine dog or horse: to my poor heart-broken mother I was a _child_; and, though I never saw her, after the cruel sale that separated us, till she died, yet I _know_ she always loved me dearly. I know it by my own heart. When I think of all she suffered, of my own early sufferings, of the distresses and struggles of my heroic wife, of my sister, sold in the New Orleans slave-market,--though I hope to have no unchristian sentiments, yet I may be excused for saying, I have no wish to pass for an American, or to identify myself with them.", " His very soul bled within him for what seemed to him the _wrongs_ of the poor suffering thing that lay like a crushed reed on the boxes; the feeling, living, bleeding, yet immortal _thing_, which American state law coolly classes with the bundles, and bales, and boxes, among which she is lying. * Dr. Joel Parker of Philadelphia.

Time, however, overgrew this softness with the rough bark of manhood, and but few knew how living and fresh it still lay at the core. His talents were of the very first order, although his mind showed a preference always for the ideal and the aesthetic, and there was about him that repugnance to the actual business of life which is the common result of this balance of the faculties. Soon after the completion of his college course, his whole nature was kindled into one intense and passionate effervescence of romantic passion. His hour came,--the hour that comes only once; his star rose in the horizon,--that star that rises so often in vain, to be remembered only as a thing of dreams; and it rose for him in vain. To drop the figure,--he saw and won the love of a high-minded and beautiful woman, in one of the northern states, and they were affianced."], "Which Christian character(s) does Stowe portray as hypocritically tolerant of the cruelty of slavery?": [" I\u2019ll teach her, with all her airs, that she\u2019s no better than the raggedest black wench that walks the streets!

As for Tom\u2019s Bible, though it had no annotations and helps in margin from learned commentators, still it had been embellished with certain way-marks and guide-boards of Tom\u2019s own invention, and which helped him more than the most learned expositions could have done. It had been his custom to get the Bible read to him by his master\u2019s children, in particular by young Master George; and, as they read, he would designate, by bold, strong marks and dashes, with pen and ink, the passages which more particularly gratified his ear or affected his heart. His Bible was thus marked through, from one end to the other, with a variety of styles and designations; so he could in a moment seize upon his favorite passages, without the labor of spelling out what lay between them;--and while it lay there before him, every passage breathing of some old home scene, and recalling some past enjoyment, his Bible seemed to him all of this life that remained, as well as the promise of a future one."], "When did the novel become popular again, after years of declined interest?": [" After the birth of little Harry, however, she had gradually become tranquillized and settled; and every bleeding tie and throbbing nerve, once more entwined with that little life, seemed to become sound and healthful, and Eliza was a happy woman up to the time that her husband was rudely torn from his kind employer, and brought under the iron sway of his legal owner.

Eva, after this, declined rapidly; there was no more any doubt of the event; the fondest hope could not be blinded. Her beautiful room was avowedly a sick room; and Miss Ophelia day and night performed the duties of a nurse,--and never did her friends appreciate her value more than in that capacity. With so well-trained a hand and eye, such perfect adroitness and practice in every art which could promote neatness and comfort, and keep out of sight every disagreeable incident of sickness,--with such a perfect sense of time, such a clear, untroubled head, such exact accuracy in remembering every prescription and direction of the doctors,--she was everything to him.", " He wrote to her immediately: \u201cI have received yours,--but too late.

Of course, in a novel, people\u2019s hearts break, and they die, and that is the end of it; and in a story this is very convenient.

Now, what\u2019s your name?\u201d \u201cMy name\u2019s Tom; the little chil\u2019en used to call me Uncle Tom, way back thar in Kentuck.\u201d \u201cThen I mean to call you Uncle Tom, because, you see, I like you,\u201d said Eva. \u201cSo, Uncle Tom, where are you going?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, Miss Eva.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t know?\u201d said Eva. \u201cNo, I am going to be sold to somebody.

The boat here stopped at a small landing to take in wood, and Eva, hearing her father\u2019s voice, bounded nimbly away. Tom rose up, and went forward to offer his service in wooding, and soon was busy among the hands.", " The prayer-meeting at Uncle Tom\u2019s had, in the order of hymn-singing, been protracted to a very late hour; and, as Uncle Tom had indulged himself in a few lengthy solos afterwards, the consequence was, that, although it was now between twelve and one o\u2019clock, he and his worthy helpmeet were not yet asleep. \u201cGood Lord! what\u2019s that?\u201d said Aunt Chloe, starting up and hastily drawing the curtain. \u201cMy sakes alive, if it an\u2019t Lizy!

As each one took their gift, Miss Ophelia, who was apprehensive for the effect of all this excitement on her little patient, signed to each one to pass out of the apartment. At last, all were gone but Tom and Mammy. \u201cHere, Uncle Tom,\u201d said Eva, \u201cis a beautiful one for you.

Leisurely tipped back on one chair, with his heels in another, he was enjoying his after-dinner cigar. Mrs. Shelby sat in the door, busy about some fine sewing; she seemed like one who had something on her mind, which she was seeking an opportunity to introduce. \u201cDo you know,\u201d she said, \u201cthat Chloe has had a letter from Tom?\u201d \u201cAh! has she?

It was the topic in every mouth, everywhere; and nothing was done in the house or in the field, but to discuss its probable results. Eliza\u2019s flight--an unprecedented event on the place--was also a great accessory in stimulating the general excitement. Black Sam, as he was commonly called, from his being about three shades blacker than any other son of ebony on the place, was revolving the matter profoundly in all its phases and bearings, with a comprehensiveness of vision and a strict lookout to his own personal well-being, that would have done credit to any white patriot in Washington.", " I could choose another, if you say so.

But the _real_ remained,--the _real_, like the flat, bare, oozy tide-mud, when the blue sparkling wave, with all its company of gliding boats and white-winged ships, its music of oars and chiming waters, has gone down, and there it lies, flat, slimy, bare,--exceedingly real. Of course, in a novel, people\u2019s hearts break, and they die, and that is the end of it; and in a story this is very convenient. But in real life we do not die when all that makes life bright dies to us. There is a most busy and important round of eating, drinking, dressing, walking, visiting, buying, selling, talking, reading, and all that makes up what is commonly called _living_, yet to be gone through; and this yet remained to Augustine.", " I can\u2019t encourage it.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want you to joke, but to reason,\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cThere is no use in my trying to make this child a Christian child, unless I save her from all the chances and reverses of slavery; and, if you really are willing I should have her, I want you to give me a deed of gift, or some legal paper.\u201d \u201cWell, well,\u201d said St. Clare, \u201cI will;\u201d and he sat down, and unfolded a newspaper to read. \u201cBut I want it done now,\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cWhat\u2019s your hurry?\u201d \u201cBecause now is the only time there ever is to do a thing in,\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cCome, now, here\u2019s paper, pen, and ink; just write a paper.\u201d St. Clare, like most men of his class of mind, cordially hated the present tense of action, generally; and, therefore, he was considerably annoyed by Miss Ophelia\u2019s downrightness. \u201cWhy, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d said he. \u201cCan\u2019t you take my word? One would think you had taken lessons of the Jews, coming at a fellow so!\u201d \u201cI want to make sure of it,\u201d said Miss Ophelia.", " St. Clare quietly made this commentary to himself, and went on smoking, like a hard-hearted wretch of a man as he was, till a carriage drove up before the verandah, and Eva and Miss Ophelia alighted. Miss Ophelia marched straight to her own chamber, to put away her bonnet and shawl, as was always her manner, before she spoke a word on any subject; while Eva came, at St. Clare\u2019s call, and was sitting on his knee, giving him an account of the services they had heard. They soon heard loud exclamations from Miss Ophelia\u2019s room, which, like the one in which they were sitting, opened on to the verandah and violent reproof addressed to somebody. \u201cWhat new witchcraft has Tops been brewing?\u201d asked St. Clare. \u201cThat commotion is of her raising, I\u2019ll be bound!\u201d And, in a moment after, Miss Ophelia, in high indignation, came dragging the culprit along. \u201cCome out here, now!\u201d she said. \u201cI _will_ tell your master!\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the case now?\u201d asked Augustine.", " The idea appeared to amuse her considerably; for her eyes twinkled, and she added, \u201cI spect I grow\u2019d.

It\u2019ll be long enough \u2019fore you get more.

She stopped short,--a word of choking feelings, rising in her heart, kept her silent. Cassy had always kept over Legree the kind of influence that a strong, impassioned woman can ever keep over the most brutal man; but, of late, she had grown more and more irritable and restless, under the hideous yoke of her servitude, and her irritability, at times, broke out into raving insanity; and this liability made her a sort of object of dread to Legree, who had that superstitious horror of insane persons which is common to coarse and uninstructed minds."], "Where is the evil of slavery shown in its most hideous form?": [" It is a sin to hold a slave under laws like ours,--I always felt it was,--I always thought so when I was a girl,--I thought so still more after I joined the church; but I thought I could gild it over,--I thought, by kindness, and care, and instruction, I could make the condition of mine better than freedom--fool that I was!\u201d \u201cWhy, wife, you are getting to be an abolitionist, quite.\u201d \u201cAbolitionist! if they knew all I know about slavery, they _might_ talk!

For many years of her life, the author avoided all reading upon or allusion to the subject of slavery, considering it as too painful to be inquired into, and one which advancing light and civilization would certainly live down. But, since the legislative act of 1850, when she heard, with perfect surprise and consternation, Christian and humane people actually recommending the remanding escaped fugitives into slavery, as a duty binding on good citizens,--when she heard, on all hands, from kind, compassionate and estimable people, in the free states of the North, deliberations and discussions as to what Christian duty could be on this head,--she could only think, These men and Christians cannot know what slavery is; if they did, such a question could never be open for discussion. And from this arose a desire to exhibit it in a _living dramatic reality_.", " Alfred scolds me, every time we meet; and he has the better of me, I grant,--for he really does something; his life is a logical result of his opinions and mine is a contemptible _non sequitur_.\u201d \u201cMy dear cousin, can you be satisfied with such a way of spending your probation?\u201d \u201cSatisfied! Was I not just telling you I despised it? But, then, to come back to this point,--we were on this liberation business. I don\u2019t think my feelings about slavery are peculiar. I find many men who, in their hearts, think of it just as I do. The land groans under it; and, bad as it is for the slave, it is worse, if anything, for the master. It takes no spectacles to see that a great class of vicious, improvident, degraded people, among us, are an evil to us, as well as to themselves. The capitalist and aristocrat of England cannot feel that as we do, because they do not mingle with the class they degrade as we do.", " This man proceeded to a very free personal examination of the lot. He seized Tom by the jaw, and pulled open his mouth to inspect his teeth; made him strip up his sleeve, to show his muscle; turned him round, made him jump and spring, to show his paces. \u201cWhere was you raised?\u201d he added, briefly, to these investigations. \u201cIn Kintuck, Mas\u2019r,\u201d said Tom, looking about, as if for deliverance. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d \u201cHad care of Mas\u2019r\u2019s farm,\u201d said Tom. \u201cLikely story!\u201d said the other, shortly, as he passed on. He paused a moment before Dolph; then spitting a discharge of tobacco-juice on his well-blacked boots, and giving a contemptuous umph, he walked on. Again he stopped before Susan and Emmeline. He put out his heavy, dirty hand, and drew the girl towards him; passed it over her neck and bust, felt her arms, looked at her teeth, and then pushed her back against her mother, whose patient face showed the suffering she had been going through at every motion of the hideous stranger."], "Who is the most morally perfect white character in the novel?": [" to be sure, I shouldn\u2019t.

Mrs. Shelby was a woman of high class, both intellectually and morally. To that natural magnanimity and generosity of mind which one often marks as characteristic of the women of Kentucky, she added high moral and religious sensibility and principle, carried out with great energy and ability into practical results. Her husband, who made no professions to any particular religious character, nevertheless reverenced and respected the consistency of hers, and stood, perhaps, a little in awe of her opinion.", " He wrote to her immediately: \u201cI have received yours,--but too late.

Eva\u2019s little table, covered with white, bore on it her favorite vase, with a single white moss rose-bud in it. The folds of the drapery, the fall of the curtains, had been arranged and rearranged, by Adolph and Rosa, with that nicety of eye which characterizes their race. Even now, while St. Clare stood there thinking, little Rosa tripped softly into the chamber with a basket of white flowers. She stepped back when she saw St. Clare, and stopped respectfully; but, seeing that he did not observe her, she came forward to place them around the dead. St. Clare saw her as in a dream, while she placed in the small hands a fair cape jessamine, and, with admirable taste, disposed other flowers around the couch. The door opened again, and Topsy, her eyes swelled with crying, appeared, holding something under her apron.", " \u201cThat makes no difference,\u201d said Eva. \u201cI believe him, and in a few days I shall _see_ him;\u201d and the young face grew fervent, radiant with joy. St. Clare said no more. It was a feeling which he had seen before in his mother; but no chord within vibrated to it. Eva, after this, declined rapidly; there was no more any doubt of the event; the fondest hope could not be blinded. Her beautiful room was avowedly a sick room; and Miss Ophelia day and night performed the duties of a nurse,--and never did her friends appreciate her value more than in that capacity. With so well-trained a hand and eye, such perfect adroitness and practice in every art which could promote neatness and comfort, and keep out of sight every disagreeable incident of sickness,--with such a perfect sense of time, such a clear, untroubled head, such exact accuracy in remembering every prescription and direction of the doctors,--she was everything to him."], "What does Stowe imply a parallel to with the oppression of blacks?": [" His very soul bled within him for what seemed to him the _wrongs_ of the poor suffering thing that lay like a crushed reed on the boxes; the feeling, living, bleeding, yet immortal _thing_, which American state law coolly classes with the bundles, and bales, and boxes, among which she is lying. * Dr. Joel Parker of Philadelphia.

Mrs. Stowe attempted unsuccessfully to have this identifying note removed from the stereotype-plate of the first edition. Tom drew near, and tried to say something; but she only groaned. Honestly, and with tears running down his own cheeks, he spoke of a heart of love in the skies, of a pitying Jesus, and an eternal home; but the ear was deaf with anguish, and the palsied heart could not feel. Night came on,--night calm, unmoved, and glorious, shining down with her innumerable and solemn angel eyes, twinkling, beautiful, but silent.", " \u201cYes, he is! Well, his mouth\u2019s shut up, at last,--that\u2019s one comfort!\u201d Yes, Legree; but who shall shut up that voice in thy soul? that soul, past repentance, past prayer, past hope, in whom the fire that never shall be quenched is already burning! Yet Tom was not quite gone. His wondrous words and pious prayers had struck upon the hearts of the imbruted blacks, who had been the instruments of cruelty upon him; and, the instant Legree withdrew, they took him down, and, in their ignorance, sought to call him back to life,--as if _that_ were any favor to him. \u201cSartin, we \u2019s been doin\u2019 a drefful wicked thing!\u201d said Sambo; \u201chopes Mas\u2019r\u2019ll have to \u2019count for it, and not we.\u201d They washed his wounds,--they provided a rude bed, of some refuse cotton, for him to lie down on; and one of them, stealing up to the house, begged a drink of brandy of Legree, pretending that he was tired, and wanted it for himself.", " Tom Loker was soon carefully deposited in a much cleaner and softer bed than he had ever been in the habit of occupying. His wound was carefully dressed and bandaged, and he lay languidly opening and shutting his eyes on the white window-curtains and gently-gliding figures of his sick room, like a weary child. And here, for the present, we shall take our leave of one party. CHAPTER XVIII Miss Ophelia\u2019s Experiences and Opinions Our friend Tom, in his own simple musings, often compared his more fortunate lot, in the bondage into which he was cast, with that of Joseph in Egypt; and, in fact, as time went on, and he developed more and more under the eye of his master, the strength of the parallel increased. St. Clare was indolent and careless of money. Hitherto the providing and marketing had been principally done by Adolph, who was, to the full, as careless and extravagant as his master; and, between them both, they had carried on the dispersing process with great alacrity.", " From the same source was derived the character of the planter Legree. Of him her brother thus wrote, speaking of visiting his plantation, on a collecting tour; \u201cHe actually made me feel of his fist, which was like a blacksmith\u2019s hammer, or a nodule of iron, telling me that it was \u2018calloused with knocking down niggers.\u2019 When I left the plantation, I drew a long breath, and felt as if I had escaped from an ogre\u2019s den.\u201d That the tragical fate of Tom, also, has too many times had its parallel, there are living witnesses, all over our land, to testify. Let it be remembered that in all southern states it is a principle of jurisprudence that no person of colored lineage can testify in a suit against a white, and it will be easy to see that such a case may occur, wherever there is a man whose passions outweigh his interests, and a slave who has manhood or principle enough to resist his will. There is, actually, nothing to protect the slave\u2019s life, but the _character_ of the master."], "Besides Tom, what other character has a Christ-like death?": [" \u201cIt is true what she told me; if we want to give sight to the blind, we must be willing to do as Christ did,--call them to us, and _put our hands on them_.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve always had a prejudice against negroes,\u201d said Miss Ophelia, \u201cand it\u2019s a fact, I never could bear to have that child touch me; but, I don\u2019t think she knew it.\u201d \u201cTrust any child to find that out,\u201d said St. Clare; \u201cthere\u2019s no keeping it from them. But I believe that all the trying in the world to benefit a child, and all the substantial favors you can do them, will never excite one emotion of gratitude, while that feeling of repugnance remains in the heart;--it\u2019s a queer kind of a fact,--but so it is.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how I can help it,\u201d said Miss Ophelia; \u201cthey _are_ disagreeable to me,--this child in particular,--how can I help feeling so?\u201d \u201cEva does, it seems.\u201d \u201cWell, she\u2019s so loving! After all, though, she\u2019s no more than Christ-like,\u201d said Miss Ophelia; \u201cI wish I were like her.", " So he reasons, because, as I said, he is born an aristocrat;--so I don\u2019t believe, because I was born a democrat.\u201d \u201cHow in the world can the two things be compared?\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cThe English laborer is not sold, traded, parted from his family, whipped.\u201d \u201cHe is as much at the will of his employer as if he were sold to him. The slave-owner can whip his refractory slave to death,--the capitalist can starve him to death. As to family security, it is hard to say which is the worst,--to have one\u2019s children sold, or see them starve to death at home.\u201d \u201cBut it\u2019s no kind of apology for slavery, to prove that it isn\u2019t worse than some other bad thing.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t give it for one,--nay, I\u2019ll say, besides, that ours is the more bold and palpable infringement of human rights; actually buying a man up, like a horse,--looking at his teeth, cracking his joints, and trying his paces and then paying down for him,--having speculators, breeders, traders, and brokers in human bodies and souls,--sets the thing before the eyes of the civilized world in a more tangible form, though the thing done be, after all, in its nature, the same; that is, appropriating one set of human beings to the use and improvement of another without any regard to their own.\u201d \u201cI never thought of the matter in this light,\u201d said Miss Ophelia.", " He brought it back, and poured it down Tom\u2019s throat. \u201cO, Tom!\u201d said Quimbo, \u201cwe\u2019s been awful wicked to ye!\u201d \u201cI forgive ye, with all my heart!\u201d said Tom, faintly. \u201cO, Tom! do tell us who is _Jesus_, anyhow?\u201d said Sambo;--\u201cJesus, that\u2019s been a standin\u2019 by you so, all this night!--Who is he?\u201d The word roused the failing, fainting spirit. He poured forth a few energetic sentences of that wondrous One,--his life, his death, his everlasting presence, and power to save. They wept,--both the two savage men. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I never hear this before?\u201d said Sambo; \u201cbut I do believe!--I can\u2019t help it! Lord Jesus, have mercy on us!\u201d \u201cPoor critters!\u201d said Tom, \u201cI\u2019d be willing to bar all I have, if it\u2019ll only bring ye to Christ! O, Lord! give me these two more souls, I pray!\u201d That prayer was answered! CHAPTER XLI The Young Master Two days after, a young man drove a light wagon up through the avenue of China trees, and, throwing the reins hastily on the horse\u2019s neck, sprang out and inquired for the owner of the place.", " \u201cI wish,\u201d said Tom, looking at her earnestly,--\u201cI wish I could persuade you to leave off drinking. Don\u2019t you know it will be the ruin of ye, body and soul?\u201d \u201cI knows I\u2019m gwine to torment,\u201d said the woman, sullenly. \u201cYe don\u2019t need to tell me that ar.

Her room opened by a side door to the river. She caught her child, and sprang down the steps towards it. The trader caught a full glimpse of her just as she was disappearing down the bank; and throwing himself from his horse, and calling loudly on Sam and Andy, he was after her like a hound after a deer. In that dizzy moment her feet to her scarce seemed to touch the ground, and a moment brought her to the water\u2019s edge. Right on behind they came; and, nerved with strength such as God gives only to the desperate, with one wild cry and flying leap, she vaulted sheer over the turbid current by the shore, on to the raft of ice beyond. It was a desperate leap--impossible to anything but madness and despair; and Haley, Sam, and Andy, instinctively cried out, and lifted up their hands, as she did it. The huge green fragment of ice on which she alighted pitched and creaked as her weight came on it, but she staid there not a moment.", " With wild cries and desperate energy she leaped to another and still another cake; stumbling--leaping--slipping--springing upwards again! Her shoes are gone--her stockings cut from her feet--while blood marked every step; but she saw nothing, felt nothing, till dimly, as in a dream, she saw the Ohio side, and a man helping her up the bank. \u201cYer a brave gal, now, whoever ye ar!\u201d said the man, with an oath. Eliza recognized the voice and face for a man who owned a farm not far from her old home. \u201cO, Mr. Symmes!--save me--do save me--do hide me!\u201d said Elia. \u201cWhy, what\u2019s this?\u201d said the man. \u201cWhy, if \u2019tan\u2019t Shelby\u2019s gal!\u201d \u201cMy child!--this boy!--he\u2019d sold him!

I like grit, wherever I see it.\u201d When they had gained the top of the bank, the man paused.", " CHAPTER VIII Eliza\u2019s Escape Eliza made her desperate retreat across the river just in the dusk of twilight. The gray mist of evening, rising slowly from the river, enveloped her as she disappeared up the bank, and the swollen current and floundering masses of ice presented a hopeless barrier between her and her pursuer. Haley therefore slowly and discontentedly returned to the little tavern, to ponder further what was to be done. The woman opened to him the door of a little parlor, covered with a rag carpet, where stood a table with a very shining black oil-cloth, sundry lank, high-backed wood chairs, with some plaster images in resplendent colors on the mantel-shelf, above a very dimly-smoking grate; a long hard-wood settle extended its uneasy length by the chimney, and here Haley sat him down to meditate on the instability of human hopes and happiness in general. \u201cWhat did I want with the little cuss, now,\u201d he said to himself, \u201cthat I should have got myself treed like a coon, as I am, this yer way?\u201d and Haley relieved himself by repeating over a not very select litany of imprecations on himself, which, though there was the best possible reason to consider them as true, we shall, as a matter of taste, omit.", " Eliza stood, for a moment, contemplating this unfavorable aspect of things, which she saw at once must prevent the usual ferry-boat from running, and then turned into a small public house on the bank, to make a few inquiries. The hostess, who was busy in various fizzing and stewing operations over the fire, preparatory to the evening meal, stopped, with a fork in her hand, as Eliza\u2019s sweet and plaintive voice arrested her. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d she said. \u201cIsn\u2019t there any ferry or boat, that takes people over to B----, now?\u201d she said. \u201cNo, indeed!\u201d said the woman; \u201cthe boats has stopped running.\u201d Eliza\u2019s look of dismay and disappointment struck the woman, and she said, inquiringly, \u201cMay be you\u2019re wanting to get over?--anybody sick? Ye seem mighty anxious?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got a child that\u2019s very dangerous,\u201d said Eliza. \u201cI never heard of it till last night, and I\u2019ve walked quite a piece today, in hopes to get to the ferry.\u201d \u201cWell, now, that\u2019s onlucky,\u201d said the woman, whose motherly sympathies were much aroused; \u201cI\u2019m re\u2019lly consarned for ye."], "Who is Arthur Shelby reluctant to sell to Mr. Haley?": [" I shall have to sell some of my hands.\u201d \u201cTo that creature? Impossible!

O, Mr. Shelby!--and you have promised him his freedom, too,--you and I have spoken to him a hundred times of it. Well, I can believe anything now,--I can believe _now_ that you could sell little Harry, poor Eliza\u2019s only child!\u201d said Mrs. Shelby, in a tone between grief and indignation. \u201cWell, since you must know all, it is so. I have agreed to sell Tom and Harry both; and I don\u2019t know why I am to be rated, as if I were a monster, for doing what every one does every day.\u201d \u201cBut why, of all others, choose these?\u201d said Mrs. Shelby. \u201cWhy sell them, of all on the place, if you must sell at all?\u201d \u201cBecause they will bring the highest sum of any,--that\u2019s why.", " \u201cIf I had the little devils!\u201d muttered Haley, between his teeth. \u201cBut you ha\u2019nt got \u2019em, though!\u201d said Andy, with a triumphant flourish, and making a string of indescribable mouths at the unfortunate trader\u2019s back, when he was fairly beyond hearing. \u201cI say now, Shelby, this yer \u2019s a most extro\u2019rnary business!\u201d said Haley, as he abruptly entered the parlor. \u201cIt seems that gal \u2019s off, with her young un.\u201d \u201cMr. Haley, Mrs. Shelby is present,\u201d said Mr. Shelby. \u201cI beg pardon, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Haley, bowing slightly, with a still lowering brow; \u201cbut still I say, as I said before, this yer\u2019s a sing\u2019lar report.

Andy, take Mr. Haley\u2019s hat and riding-whip. Take a seat, sir. Yes, sir; I regret to say that the young woman, excited by overhearing, or having reported to her, something of this business, has taken her child in the night, and made off.\u201d \u201cI did expect fair dealing in this matter, I confess,\u201d said Haley.", " He was lounging in a large easy-chair, looking over some letters that had come in the afternoon mail, and she was standing before her mirror, brushing out the complicated braids and curls in which Eliza had arranged her hair; for, noticing her pale cheeks and haggard eyes, she had excused her attendance that night, and ordered her to bed. The employment, naturally enough, suggested her conversation with the girl in the morning; and turning to her husband, she said, carelessly, \u201cBy the by, Arthur, who was that low-bred fellow that you lugged in to our dinner-table today?\u201d \u201cHaley is his name,\u201d said Shelby, turning himself rather uneasily in his chair, and continuing with his eyes fixed on a letter. \u201cHaley! Who is he, and what may be his business here, pray?\u201d \u201cWell, he\u2019s a man that I transacted some business with, last time I was at Natchez,\u201d said Mr. Shelby. \u201cAnd he presumed on it to make himself quite at home, and call and dine here, ay?\u201d \u201cWhy, I invited him; I had some accounts with him,\u201d said Shelby.", " \u201cHaley,\u201d said Mr. Shelby, \u201cI hope you\u2019ll remember that you promised, on your honor, you wouldn\u2019t sell Tom, without knowing what sort of hands he\u2019s going into.\u201d \u201cWhy, you\u2019ve just done it sir,\u201d said the trader. \u201cCircumstances, you well know, _obliged_ me,\u201d said Shelby, haughtily. \u201cWal, you know, they may \u2019blige _me_, too,\u201d said the trader. \u201cHowsomever, I\u2019ll do the very best I can in gettin\u2019 Tom a good berth; as to my treatin\u2019 on him bad, you needn\u2019t be a grain afeard. If there\u2019s anything that I thank the Lord for, it is that I\u2019m never noways cruel.\u201d After the expositions which the trader had previously given of his humane principles, Mr. Shelby did not feel particularly reassured by these declarations; but, as they were the best comfort the case admitted of, he allowed the trader to depart in silence, and betook himself to a solitary cigar.

This young man had been hired out by his master to work in a bagging factory, where his adroitness and ingenuity caused him to be considered the first hand in the place. He had invented a machine for the cleaning of the hemp, which, considering the education and circumstances of the inventor, displayed quite as much mechanical genius as Whitney\u2019s cotton-gin. * * A machine of this description was really the invention of a young colored man in Kentucky. [Mrs. Stowe\u2019s note.] He was possessed of a handsome person and pleasing manners, and was a general favorite in the factory. Nevertheless, as this young man was in the eye of the law not a man, but a thing, all these superior qualifications were subject to the control of a vulgar, narrow-minded, tyrannical master.", " This same gentleman, having heard of the fame of George\u2019s invention, took a ride over to the factory, to see what this intelligent chattel had been about. He was received with great enthusiasm by the employer, who congratulated him on possessing so valuable a slave. He was waited upon over the factory, shown the machinery by George, who, in high spirits, talked so fluently, held himself so erect, looked so handsome and manly, that his master began to feel an uneasy consciousness of inferiority. What business had his slave to be marching round the country, inventing machines, and holding up his head among gentlemen? He\u2019d soon put a stop to it. He\u2019d take him back, and put him to hoeing and digging, and \u201csee if he\u2019d step about so smart.\u201d Accordingly, the manufacturer and all hands concerned were astounded when he suddenly demanded George\u2019s wages, and announced his intention of taking him home.", " \u201cDo you know,\u201d said Madame de Thoux to him, one day, \u201cof any man, in your neighborhood, of the name of Harris?\u201d \u201cThere is an old fellow, of that name, lives not far from my father\u2019s place,\u201d said George. \u201cWe never have had much intercourse with him, though.\u201d \u201cHe is a large slave-owner, I believe,\u201d said Madame de Thoux, with a manner which seemed to betray more interest than she was exactly willing to show. \u201cHe is,\u201d said George, looking rather surprised at her manner. \u201cDid you ever know of his having--perhaps, you may have heard of his having a mulatto boy, named George?\u201d \u201cO, certainly,--George Harris,--I know him well; he married a servant of my mother\u2019s, but has escaped, now, to Canada.\u201d \u201cHe has?\u201d said Madame de Thoux, quickly. \u201cThank God!\u201d George looked a surprised inquiry, but said nothing.

An hour before sunset, she entered the village of T----, by the Ohio river, weary and foot-sore, but still strong in heart. Her first glance was at the river, which lay, like Jordan, between her and the Canaan of liberty on the other side. It was now early spring, and the river was swollen and turbulent; great cakes of floating ice were swinging heavily to and fro in the turbid waters. Owing to the peculiar form of the shore on the Kentucky side, the land bending far out into the water, the ice had been lodged and detained in great quantities, and the narrow channel which swept round the bend was full of ice, piled one cake over another, thus forming a temporary barrier to the descending ice, which lodged, and formed a great, undulating raft, filling up the whole river, and extending almost to the Kentucky shore.", " At first he only scolded and grumbled these things; but yesterday he told me that I should take Mina for a wife, and settle down in a cabin with her, or he would sell me down river.\u201d \u201cWhy--but you were married to _me_, by the minister, as much as if you\u2019d been a white man!\u201d said Eliza, simply. \u201cDon\u2019t you know a slave can\u2019t be married?

Miss Ophelia, who seldom sat much in Marie\u2019s company, followed him into the parlor, having first carefully laid away the paper. \u201cAugustine,\u201d she said, suddenly, as she sat knitting, \u201chave you ever made any provision for your servants, in case of your death?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said St. Clare, as he read on. \u201cThen all your indulgence to them may prove a great cruelty, by and by.\u201d St. Clare had often thought the same thing himself; but he answered, negligently. \u201cWell, I mean to make a provision, by and by.\u201d \u201cWhen?\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cO, one of these days.\u201d \u201cWhat if you should die first?\u201d \u201cCousin, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d said St. Clare, laying down his paper and looking at her.", " Tom woke.

He was an expert and efficient workman in whatever he undertook; and was, both from habit and principle, prompt and faithful. Quiet and peaceable in his disposition, he hoped, by unremitting diligence, to avert from himself at least a portion of the evils of his condition. He saw enough of abuse and misery to make him sick and weary; but he determined to toil on, with religious patience, committing himself to Him that judgeth righteously, not without hope that some way of escape might yet be opened to him."], "When Marie complains of the slaves' selfishness, whose kindness does Eva attempt to remind her off?": [" Augustine was glad in his heart that he had married so undiscerning a woman; but as the glosses and civilities of the honeymoon wore away, he discovered that a beautiful young woman, who has lived all her life to be caressed and waited on, might prove quite a hard mistress in domestic life. Marie never had possessed much capability of affection, or much sensibility, and the little that she had, had been merged into a most intense and unconscious selfishness; a selfishness the more hopeless, from its quiet obtuseness, its utter ignorance of any claims but her own. From her infancy, she had been surrounded with servants, who lived only to study her caprices; the idea that they had either feelings or rights had never dawned upon her, even in distant perspective. Her father, whose only child she had been, had never denied her anything that lay within the compass of human possibility; and when she entered life, beautiful, accomplished, and an heiress, she had, of course, all the eligibles and non-eligibles of the other sex sighing at her feet, and she had no doubt that Augustine was a most fortunate man in having obtained her.", " \u201cYou know \u2019t isn\u2019t so.

You must try and do something with her.\u201d \u201cThe child has improved greatly,\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cI have great hopes of her; but, Augustine,\u201d she said, laying her hand on his arm, \u201cone thing I want to ask; whose is this child to be?--yours or mine?\u201d \u201cWhy, I gave her to you,\u201d said Augustine. \u201cBut not legally;--I want her to be mine legally,\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cWhew! cousin,\u201d said Augustine. \u201cWhat will the Abolition Society think? They\u2019ll have a day of fasting appointed for this backsliding, if you become a slaveholder!\u201d \u201cO, nonsense! I want her mine, that I may have a right to take her to the free States, and give her her liberty, that all I am trying to do be not undone.\u201d \u201cO, cousin, what an awful \u2019doing evil that good may come\u2019!", " CHAPTER XV Of Tom\u2019s New Master, and Various Other Matters Since the thread of our humble hero\u2019s life has now become interwoven with that of higher ones, it is necessary to give some brief introduction to them. Augustine St. Clare was the son of a wealthy planter of Louisiana. The family had its origin in Canada. Of two brothers, very similar in temperament and character, one had settled on a flourishing farm in Vermont, and the other became an opulent planter in Louisiana. The mother of Augustine was a Huguenot French lady, whose family had emigrated to Louisiana during the days of its early settlement. Augustine and another brother were the only children of their parents. Having inherited from his mother an exceeding delicacy of constitution, he was, at the instance of physicians, during many years of his boyhood, sent to the care of his uncle in Vermont, in order that his constitution might be strengthened by the cold of a more bracing climate."], "After Prue's death at the hands of her cruel master, which character dejectedly says: \"The most I can do is try to keep out of the way of it\"?": [" \u201cWhy not, Miss Eva?\u201d \u201cThese things sink into my heart, Tom,\u201d said Eva,--\u201cthey sink into my heart,\u201d she repeated, earnestly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go;\u201d and she turned from Tom, and went into the house. A few days after, another woman came, in old Prue\u2019s place, to bring the rusks; Miss Ophelia was in the kitchen. \u201cLor!\u201d said Dinah, \u201cwhat\u2019s got Prue?\u201d \u201cPrue isn\u2019t coming any more,\u201d said the woman, mysteriously. \u201cWhy not?\u201d said Dinah, \u201cshe an\u2019t dead, is she?\u201d \u201cWe doesn\u2019t exactly know. She\u2019s down cellar,\u201d said the woman, glancing at Miss Ophelia. After Miss Ophelia had taken the rusks, Dinah followed the woman to the door. \u201cWhat _has_ got Prue, any how?\u201d she said. The woman seemed desirous, yet reluctant, to speak, and answered, in low, mysterious tone. \u201cWell, you mustn\u2019t tell nobody, Prue, she got drunk agin,--and they had her down cellar,--and thar they left her all day,--and I hearn \u2019em saying that the _flies had got to her_,--and _she\u2019s dead_!\u201d Dinah held up her hands, and, turning, saw close by her side the spirit-like form of Evangeline, her large, mystic eyes dilated with horror, and every drop of blood driven from her lips and cheeks.", " \u201cHo, Prue! you\u2019ve come,\u201d said Dinah. Prue had a peculiar scowling expression of countenance, and a sullen, grumbling voice. She set down her basket, squatted herself down, and resting her elbows on her knees said, \u201cO Lord! I wish\u2019t I \u2019s dead!\u201d \u201cWhy do you wish you were dead?\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cI\u2019d be out o\u2019 my misery,\u201d said the woman, gruffly, without taking her eyes from the floor. \u201cWhat need you getting drunk, then, and cutting up, Prue?\u201d said a spruce quadroon chambermaid, dangling, as she spoke, a pair of coral ear-drops. The woman looked at her with a sour surly glance. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll come to it, one of these yer days. I\u2019d be glad to see you, I would; then you\u2019ll be glad of a drop, like me, to forget your misery.\u201d \u201cCome, Prue,\u201d said Dinah, \u201clet\u2019s look at your rusks. Here\u2019s Missis will pay for them.\u201d Miss Ophelia took out a couple of dozen. \u201cThar\u2019s some tickets in that ar old cracked jug on the top shelf,\u201d said Dinah.", " \u201cLor bless us! Miss Eva\u2019s gwine to faint away! What go us all, to let her har such talk? Her pa\u2019ll be rail mad.\u201d \u201cI shan\u2019t faint, Dinah,\u201d said the child, firmly; \u201cand why shouldn\u2019t I hear it? It an\u2019t so much for me to hear it, as for poor Prue to suffer it.\u201d \u201c_Lor sakes_! it isn\u2019t for sweet, delicate young ladies, like you,--these yer stories isn\u2019t; it\u2019s enough to kill \u2019em!\u201d Eva sighed again, and walked up stairs with a slow and melancholy step. Miss Ophelia anxiously inquired the woman\u2019s story. Dinah gave a very garrulous version of it, to which Tom added the particulars which he had drawn from her that morning. \u201cAn abominable business,--perfectly horrible!\u201d she exclaimed, as she entered the room where St. Clare lay reading his paper. \u201cPray, what iniquity has turned up now?\u201d said he. \u201cWhat now? why, those folks have whipped Prue to death!\u201d said Miss Ophelia, going on, with great strength of detail, into the story, and enlarging on its most shocking particulars.", " He says their faults are all owing to us, and that it would be cruel to make the fault and punish it too. He says we shouldn\u2019t do any better, in their place; just as if one could reason from them to us, you know.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you believe that the Lord made them of one blood with us?\u201d said Miss Ophelia, shortly. \u201cNo, indeed not I! A pretty story, truly! They are a degraded race.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you think they\u2019ve got immortal souls?\u201d said Miss Ophelia, with increasing indignation. \u201cO, well,\u201d said Marie, yawning, \u201cthat, of course--nobody doubts that. But as to putting them on any sort of equality with us, you know, as if we could be compared, why, it\u2019s impossible! Now, St. Clare really has talked to me as if keeping Mammy from her husband was like keeping me from mine. There\u2019s no comparing in this way. Mammy couldn\u2019t have the feelings that I should. It\u2019s a different thing altogether,--of course, it is,--and yet St. Clare pretends not to see it."], "Appealing to Ophelia's conscience, Augustine suggests that becoming Topsy's teacher would be akin to which religious calling?": [" \u201cWhat is it, Topsy?\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cPlease, Missis, was dat ar state Kintuck?\u201d \u201cWhat state, Topsy?\u201d \u201cDat state dey fell out of. I used to hear Mas\u2019r tell how we came down from Kintuck.\u201d St. Clare laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to give her a meaning, or she\u2019ll make one,\u201d said he. \u201cThere seems to be a theory of emigration suggested there.\u201d \u201cO! Augustine, be still,\u201d said Miss Ophelia; \u201chow can I do anything, if you will be laughing?\u201d \u201cWell, I won\u2019t disturb the exercises again, on my honor;\u201d and St. Clare took his paper into the parlor, and sat down, till Topsy had finished her recitations. They were all very well, only that now and then she would oddly transpose some important words, and persist in the mistake, in spite of every effort to the contrary; and St. Clare, after all his promises of goodness, took a wicked pleasure in these mistakes, calling Topsy to him whenever he had a mind to amuse himself, and getting her to repeat the offending passages, in spite of Miss Ophelia\u2019s remonstrances.", " Did any of our readers ever do the same, they will appreciate the amount of her self-sacrifice. Miss Ophelia began with Topsy by taking her into her chamber, the first morning, and solemnly commencing a course of instruction in the art and mystery of bed-making. Behold, then, Topsy, washed and shorn of all the little braided tails wherein her heart had delighted, arrayed in a clean gown, with well-starched apron, standing reverently before Miss Ophelia, with an expression of solemnity well befitting a funeral. \u201cNow, Topsy, I\u2019m going to show you just how my bed is to be made. I am very particular about my bed. You must learn exactly how to do it.\u201d \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d says Topsy, with a deep sigh, and a face of woful earnestness. \u201cNow, Topsy, look here;--this is the hem of the sheet,--this is the right side of the sheet, and this is the wrong;--will you remember?\u201d \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d says Topsy, with another sigh.", " There was a little glass-room at the corner of the verandah, which St. Clare used as a sort of reading-room; and Eva and Topsy disappeared into this place. \u201cWhat\u2019s Eva going about, now?\u201d said St. Clare; \u201cI mean to see.\u201d And, advancing on tiptoe, he lifted up a curtain that covered the glass-door, and looked in. In a moment, laying his finger on his lips, he made a silent gesture to Miss Ophelia to come and look. There sat the two children on the floor, with their side faces towards them. Topsy, with her usual air of careless drollery and unconcern; but, opposite to her, Eva, her whole face fervent with feeling, and tears in her large eyes. \u201cWhat does make you so bad, Topsy?

It\u2019s what children always have to learn, you know,\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cUnderstand it or not,\u201d said St. Clare. \u201cO, children never understand it at the time; but, after they are grown up, it\u2019ll come to them.\u201d \u201cMine hasn\u2019t come to me yet,\u201d said St. Clare, \u201cthough I\u2019ll bear testimony that you put it into me pretty thoroughly when I was a boy.\u201d\u2019 \u201cAh, you were always good at learning, Augustine. I used to have great hopes of you,\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cWell, haven\u2019t you now?\u201d said St. Clare. \u201cI wish you were as good as you were when you were a boy, Augustine.\u201d \u201cSo do I, that\u2019s a fact, Cousin,\u201d said St. Clare. \u201cWell, go ahead and catechize Topsy; may be you\u2019ll make out something yet.\u201d Topsy, who had stood like a black statue during this discussion, with hands decently folded, now, at a signal from Miss Ophelia, went on: \u201cOur first parents, being left to the freedom of their own will, fell from the state wherein they were created.\u201d Topsy\u2019s eyes twinkled, and she looked inquiringly."], "What does Topsy steal?": [" When Miss Ophelia expatiated on Topsy\u2019s naughty, wicked conduct, the child looked perplexed and sorrowful, but said, sweetly. \u201cPoor Topsy, why need you steal? You\u2019re going to be taken good care of now. I\u2019m sure I\u2019d rather give you anything of mine, than have you steal it.\u201d It was the first word of kindness the child had ever heard in her life; and the sweet tone and manner struck strangely on the wild, rude heart, and a sparkle of something like a tear shone in the keen, round, glittering eye; but it was followed by the short laugh and habitual grin. No! the ear that has never heard anything but abuse is strangely incredulous of anything so heavenly as kindness; and Topsy only thought Eva\u2019s speech something funny and inexplicable,--she did not believe it. But what was to be done with Topsy? Miss Ophelia found the case a puzzler; her rules for bringing up didn\u2019t seem to apply. She thought she would take time to think of it; and, by the way of gaining time, and in hopes of some indefinite moral virtues supposed to be inherent in dark closets, Miss Ophelia shut Topsy up in one till she had arranged her ideas further on the subject.", " There was a little glass-room at the corner of the verandah, which St. Clare used as a sort of reading-room; and Eva and Topsy disappeared into this place. \u201cWhat\u2019s Eva going about, now?\u201d said St. Clare; \u201cI mean to see.\u201d And, advancing on tiptoe, he lifted up a curtain that covered the glass-door, and looked in.

Tom, sing about \u2019spirits bright.\u2019\u201d Tom sung the words of a well-known Methodist hymn, \u201cI see a band of spirits bright, That taste the glories there; They all are robed in spotless white, And conquering palms they bear.\u201d \u201cUncle Tom, I\u2019ve seen _them_,\u201d said Eva. Tom had no doubt of it at all; it did not surprise him in the least. If Eva had told him she had been to heaven, he would have thought it entirely probable. \u201cThey come to me sometimes in my sleep, those spirits;\u201d and Eva\u2019s eyes grew dreamy, and she hummed, in a low voice, \u201cThey are all robed in spotless white, And conquering palms they bear.\u201d \u201cUncle Tom,\u201d said Eva, \u201cI\u2019m going there.\u201d \u201cWhere, Miss Eva?\u201d The child rose, and pointed her little hand to the sky; the glow of evening lit her golden hair and flushed cheek with a kind of unearthly radiance, and her eyes were bent earnestly on the skies.", " They need it a great many times when there is nobody to read it.\u201d \u201cEva, you are an odd child,\u201d said her mother. \u201cMiss Ophelia has taught Topsy to read,\u201d continued Eva. \u201cYes, and you see how much good it does. Topsy is the worst creature I ever saw!\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s poor Mammy!\u201d said Eva. \u201cShe does love the Bible so much, and wishes so she could read! And what will she do when I can\u2019t read to her?\u201d Marie was busy, turning over the contents of a drawer, as she answered, \u201cWell, of course, by and by, Eva, you will have other things to think of besides reading the Bible round to servants. Not but that is very proper; I\u2019ve done it myself, when I had health. But when you come to be dressing and going into company, you won\u2019t have time. See here!\u201d she added, \u201cthese jewels I\u2019m going to give you when you come out. I wore them to my first ball.

Dodo sprang and held the horse, while his master mounted. \u201cThere\u2019s a picayune for you to buy candy with, Dodo,\u201d said Henrique; \u201cgo get some.\u201d And Henrique cantered down the walk after Eva. Dodo stood looking after the two children. One had given him money; and one had given him what he wanted far more,--a kind word, kindly spoken. Dodo had been only a few months away from his mother. His master had bought him at a slave warehouse, for his handsome face, to be a match to the handsome pony; and he was now getting his breaking in, at the hands of his young master. The scene of the beating had been witnessed by the two brothers St. Clare, from another part of the garden. Augustine\u2019s cheek flushed; but he only observed, with his usual sarcastic carelessness. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s what we may call republican education, Alfred?\u201d \u201cHenrique is a devil of a fellow, when his blood\u2019s up,\u201d said Alfred, carelessly.", " A few cuts never come amiss with Dodo,--he\u2019s a regular spirit, I can tell you; but I won\u2019t beat him again before you, if it troubles you.\u201d Eva was not satisfied, but found it in vain to try to make her handsome cousin understand her feelings. Dodo soon appeared, with the horses. \u201cWell, Dodo, you\u2019ve done pretty well, this time,\u201d said his young master, with a more gracious air. \u201cCome, now, and hold Miss Eva\u2019s horse while I put her on to the saddle.\u201d Dodo came and stood by Eva\u2019s pony. His face was troubled; his eyes looked as if he had been crying. Henrique, who valued himself on his gentlemanly adroitness in all matters of gallantry, soon had his fair cousin in the saddle, and, gathering the reins, placed them in her hands. But Eva bent to the other side of the horse, where Dodo was standing, and said, as he relinquished the reins,--\u201cThat\u2019s a good boy, Dodo;--thank you!\u201d Dodo looked up in amazement into the sweet young face; the blood rushed to his cheeks, and the tears to his eyes.", " \u201cDear Cousin, I\u2019m sorry this stupid fellow has kept you waiting,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s sit down here, on this seat till they come. What\u2019s the matter, Cousin?--you look sober.\u201d \u201cHow could you be so cruel and wicked to poor Dodo?\u201d asked Eva. \u201cCruel,--wicked!\u201d said the boy, with unaffected surprise. \u201cWhat do you mean, dear Eva?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want you to call me dear Eva, when you do so,\u201d said Eva. \u201cDear Cousin, you don\u2019t know Dodo; it\u2019s the only way to manage him, he\u2019s so full of lies and excuses. The only way is to put him down at once,--not let him open his mouth; that\u2019s the way papa manages.\u201d \u201cBut Uncle Tom said it was an accident, and he never tells what isn\u2019t true.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s an uncommon old nigger, then!\u201d said Henrique. \u201cDodo will lie as fast as he can speak.\u201d \u201cYou frighten him into deceiving, if you treat him so.\u201d \u201cWhy, Eva, you\u2019ve really taken such a fancy to Dodo, that I shall be jealous.\u201d \u201cBut you beat him,--and he didn\u2019t deserve it.\u201d \u201cO, well, it may go for some time when he does, and don\u2019t get it.", " \u201cDo you know, Eva, I\u2019m sorry papa is only going to stay two days here, and then I shan\u2019t see you again for ever so long! If I stay with you, I\u2019d try to be good, and not be cross to Dodo, and so on. I don\u2019t mean to treat Dodo ill; but, you know, I\u2019ve got such a quick temper. I\u2019m not really bad to him, though. I give him a picayune, now and then; and you see he dresses well.

He owned to that, and, when I bid him tell me where they was, he up and said he knew, but he wouldn\u2019t tell; and stood to it, though I gave him the cussedest flogging I ever gave nigger yet.

Legree kicked the boy, and swore at him; but George, without saying another word, turned and strode to the spot. Tom had been lying two days since the fatal night, not suffering, for every nerve of suffering was blunted and destroyed. He lay, for the most part, in a quiet stupor; for the laws of a powerful and well-knit frame would not at once release the imprisoned spirit.", " \u201cYes, Uncle Tom, it really begins to look beautiful,\u201d said Eva, gazing delightedly on it. \u201cHow pleased your wife\u2019ll be, and the poor little children! O, it\u2019s a shame you ever had to go away from them!

I\u2019ll do it, when I come home from my ride.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very important he should write,\u201d said Eva, \u201cbecause his mistress is going to send down money to redeem him, you know, papa; he told me they told him so.\u201d St. Clare thought, in his heart, that this was probably only one of those things which good-natured owners say to their servants, to alleviate their horror of being sold, without any intention of fulfilling the expectation thus excited. But he did not make any audible comment upon it,--only ordered Tom to get the horses out for a ride. Tom\u2019s letter was written in due form for him that evening, and safely lodged in the post-office. Miss Ophelia still persevered in her labors in the housekeeping line. It was universally agreed, among all the household, from Dinah down to the youngest urchin, that Miss Ophelia was decidedly \u201ccuris,\u201d--a term by which a southern servant implies that his or her betters don\u2019t exactly suit them.", " But at last they got on quite confidential terms. \u201cWhat\u2019s little missy\u2019s name?\u201d said Tom, at last, when he thought matters were ripe to push such an inquiry. \u201cEvangeline St. Clare,\u201d said the little one, \u201cthough papa and everybody else call me Eva. Now, what\u2019s your name?\u201d \u201cMy name\u2019s Tom; the little chil\u2019en used to call me Uncle Tom, way back thar in Kentuck.\u201d \u201cThen I mean to call you Uncle Tom, because, you see, I like you,\u201d said Eva. \u201cSo, Uncle Tom, where are you going?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, Miss Eva.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t know?\u201d said Eva. \u201cNo, I am going to be sold to somebody.

The boat here stopped at a small landing to take in wood, and Eva, hearing her father\u2019s voice, bounded nimbly away. Tom rose up, and went forward to offer his service in wooding, and soon was busy among the hands."], "What is Eva willing to do to Topsy that Ophelia is not, making apparent Ophelia's secret prejudice?": [" There was a little glass-room at the corner of the verandah, which St. Clare used as a sort of reading-room; and Eva and Topsy disappeared into this place. \u201cWhat\u2019s Eva going about, now?\u201d said St. Clare; \u201cI mean to see.\u201d And, advancing on tiptoe, he lifted up a curtain that covered the glass-door, and looked in. In a moment, laying his finger on his lips, he made a silent gesture to Miss Ophelia to come and look. There sat the two children on the floor, with their side faces towards them. Topsy, with her usual air of careless drollery and unconcern; but, opposite to her, Eva, her whole face fervent with feeling, and tears in her large eyes. \u201cWhat does make you so bad, Topsy? Why won\u2019t you try and be good? Don\u2019t you love _anybody_, Topsy?\u201d \u201cDonno nothing \u2019bout love; I loves candy and sich, that\u2019s all,\u201d said Topsy. \u201cBut you love your father and mother?\u201d \u201cNever had none, ye know.

Miss Ophelia began with Topsy by taking her into her chamber, the first morning, and solemnly commencing a course of instruction in the art and mystery of bed-making. Behold, then, Topsy, washed and shorn of all the little braided tails wherein her heart had delighted, arrayed in a clean gown, with well-starched apron, standing reverently before Miss Ophelia, with an expression of solemnity well befitting a funeral. \u201cNow, Topsy, I\u2019m going to show you just how my bed is to be made. I am very particular about my bed. You must learn exactly how to do it.\u201d \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d says Topsy, with a deep sigh, and a face of woful earnestness. \u201cNow, Topsy, look here;--this is the hem of the sheet,--this is the right side of the sheet, and this is the wrong;--will you remember?\u201d \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d says Topsy, with another sigh.", " \u201cWhere did you start up from?\u201d she said, suddenly. \u201cI was here,\u201d said Topsy, wiping the tears from her eyes. \u201cO, Miss Eva, I\u2019ve been a bad girl; but won\u2019t you give _me_ one, too?\u201d \u201cYes, poor Topsy! to be sure, I will. There--every time you look at that, think that I love you, and wanted you to be a good girl!\u201d \u201cO, Miss Eva, I _is_ tryin!\u201d said Topsy, earnestly; \u201cbut, Lor, it\u2019s so hard to be good! \u2019Pears like I an\u2019t used to it, no ways!\u201d \u201cJesus knows it, Topsy; he is sorry for you; he will help you.\u201d Topsy, with her eyes hid in her apron, was silently passed from the apartment by Miss Ophelia; but, as she went, she hid the precious curl in her bosom. All being gone, Miss Ophelia shut the door. That worthy lady had wiped away many tears of her own, during the scene; but concern for the consequence of such an excitement to her young charge was uppermost in her mind. St. Clare had been sitting, during the whole time, with his hand shading his eyes, in the same attitude.", " \u201cIt is true what she told me; if we want to give sight to the blind, we must be willing to do as Christ did,--call them to us, and _put our hands on them_.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve always had a prejudice against negroes,\u201d said Miss Ophelia, \u201cand it\u2019s a fact, I never could bear to have that child touch me; but, I don\u2019t think she knew it.\u201d \u201cTrust any child to find that out,\u201d said St. Clare; \u201cthere\u2019s no keeping it from them. But I believe that all the trying in the world to benefit a child, and all the substantial favors you can do them, will never excite one emotion of gratitude, while that feeling of repugnance remains in the heart;--it\u2019s a queer kind of a fact,--but so it is.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how I can help it,\u201d said Miss Ophelia; \u201cthey _are_ disagreeable to me,--this child in particular,--how can I help feeling so?\u201d \u201cEva does, it seems.\u201d \u201cWell, she\u2019s so loving! After all, though, she\u2019s no more than Christ-like,\u201d said Miss Ophelia; \u201cI wish I were like her."], "What does Eva reply when, in her dying moments, her father asks her what she sees?": [" I will be resigned; I was wicked to speak as I did.\u201d Eva soon lay like a wearied dove in her father\u2019s arms; and he, bending over her, soothed her by every tender word he could think of. Marie rose and threw herself out of the apartment into her own, when she fell into violent hysterics. \u201cYou didn\u2019t give me a curl, Eva,\u201d said her father, smiling sadly. \u201cThey are all yours, papa,\u201d said she, smiling--\u201cyours and mamma\u2019s; and you must give dear aunty as many as she wants. I only gave them to our poor people myself, because you know, papa, they might be forgotten when I am gone, and because I hoped it might help them remember. . . . You are a Christian, are you not, papa?\u201d said Eva, doubtfully. \u201cWhy do you ask me?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know.

Harry has lost his long curls; but he can never lose those eyes and eyelashes, and that fine, bold brow, that flushes with triumph, as he answers, \u201cI did it, every bit of it, _myself_, father; and _nobody_ helped me!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d says his father; \u201cdepend on yourself, my son.

The delighted--\u201cWhy! this you?\u201d--calls up her husband; and the good pastor of Amherstberg is welcomed. There are two more women with him, and Eliza asks them to sit down. Now, if the truth must be told, the honest pastor had arranged a little programme, according to which this affair was to develop itself; and, on the way up, all had very cautiously and prudently exhorted each other not to let things out, except according to previous arrangement.", " Thou canst say, who hast seen that same expression on the face dearest to thee;--that look indescribable, hopeless, unmistakable, that says to thee that thy beloved is no longer thine. On the face of the child, however, there was no ghastly imprint,--only a high and almost sublime expression,--the overshadowing presence of spiritual natures, the dawning of immortal life in that childish soul. They stood there so still, gazing upon her, that even the ticking of the watch seemed too loud. In a few moments, Tom returned, with the doctor. He entered, gave one look, and stood silent as the rest. \u201cWhen did this change take place?\u201d said he, in a low whisper, to Miss Ophelia. \u201cAbout the turn of the night,\u201d was the reply. Marie, roused by the entrance of the doctor, appeared, hurriedly, from the next room. \u201cAugustine! Cousin!--O!--what!\u201d she hurriedly began. \u201cHush!\u201d said St. Clare, hoarsely; _\u201cshe is dying!\u201d_ Mammy heard the words, and flew to awaken the servants.", " Was he much unlike other folks? \u201cYou see, Evangeline,\u201d said her mother, \u201cit\u2019s always right and proper to be kind to servants, but it isn\u2019t proper to treat them _just_ as we would our relations, or people in our own class of life. Now, if Mammy was sick, you wouldn\u2019t want to put her in your own bed.\u201d \u201cI should feel just like it, mamma,\u201d said Eva, \u201cbecause then it would be handier to take care of her, and because, you know, my bed is better than hers.\u201d Marie was in utter despair at the entire want of moral perception evinced in this reply. \u201cWhat can I do to make this child understand me?\u201d she said. \u201cNothing,\u201d said Miss Ophelia, significantly. Eva looked sorry and disconcerted for a moment; but children, luckily, do not keep to one impression long, and in a few moments she was merrily laughing at various things which she saw from the coach-windows, as it rattled along. ***** \u201cWell, ladies,\u201d said St. Clare, as they were comfortably seated at the dinner-table, \u201cand what was the bill of fare at church today?\u201d \u201cO, Dr. G---- preached a splendid sermon,\u201d said Marie."], "After Eva's funeral, what does Tom do when Augustine tells him that he is unable to pray?": [" \u201cWouldn\u2019t it shake your faith some, Tom?\u201d \u201cNot a grain,\u201d said Tom. \u201cWhy, Tom, you must know I know the most.\u201d \u201cO, Mas\u2019r, haven\u2019t you jest read how he hides from the wise and prudent, and reveals unto babes?

But come, Tom, you pray now, and show me how.\u201d Tom\u2019s heart was full; he poured it out in prayer, like waters that have been long suppressed. One thing was plain enough; Tom thought there was somebody to hear, whether there were or not. In fact, St. Clare felt himself borne, on the tide of his faith and feeling, almost to the gates of that heaven he seemed so vividly to conceive.", " The deep fervor of Tom\u2019s feelings, the softness of his voice, his tears, fell like dew on the wild, unsettled spirit of the poor woman. A softness gathered over the lurid fires of her eye; she looked down, and Tom could feel the relaxing muscles of her hands, as she said, \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you that evil spirits followed me? O! Father Tom, I can\u2019t pray,--I wish I could. I never have prayed since my children were sold! What you say must be right, I know it must; but when I try to pray, I can only hate and curse. I can\u2019t pray!\u201d \u201cPoor soul!\u201d said Tom, compassionately. \u201cSatan desires to have ye, and sift ye as wheat. I pray the Lord for ye. O! Misse Cassy, turn to the dear Lord Jesus. He came to bind up the broken-hearted, and comfort all that mourn.\u201d Cassy stood silent, while large, heavy tears dropped from her downcast eyes. \u201cMisse Cassy,\u201d said Tom, in a hesitating tone, after surveying her in silence, \u201cif ye only could get away from here,--if the thing was possible,--I\u2019d \u2019vise ye and Emmeline to do it; that is, if ye could go without blood-guiltiness,--not otherwise.\u201d \u201cWould you try it with us, Father Tom?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Tom; \u201ctime was when I would; but the Lord\u2019s given me a work among these yer poor souls, and I\u2019ll stay with \u2019em and bear my cross with \u2019em till the end.", " But at last they got on quite confidential terms. \u201cWhat\u2019s little missy\u2019s name?\u201d said Tom, at last, when he thought matters were ripe to push such an inquiry. \u201cEvangeline St. Clare,\u201d said the little one, \u201cthough papa and everybody else call me Eva. Now, what\u2019s your name?\u201d \u201cMy name\u2019s Tom; the little chil\u2019en used to call me Uncle Tom, way back thar in Kentuck.\u201d \u201cThen I mean to call you Uncle Tom, because, you see, I like you,\u201d said Eva. \u201cSo, Uncle Tom, where are you going?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, Miss Eva.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t know?\u201d said Eva. \u201cNo, I am going to be sold to somebody. I don\u2019t know who.\u201d \u201cMy papa can buy you,\u201d said Eva, quickly; \u201cand if he buys you, you will have good times. I mean to ask him, this very day.\u201d \u201cThank you, my little lady,\u201d said Tom. The boat here stopped at a small landing to take in wood, and Eva, hearing her father\u2019s voice, bounded nimbly away. Tom rose up, and went forward to offer his service in wooding, and soon was busy among the hands.", " \u201cPoor creatures!\u201d he said, and an expression of bitter self-reproach passed over his face. Adolph absolutely refused to go. Terror had deprived him of all presence of mind; he threw himself along the floor, and nothing could persuade him to rise. The rest yielded to Miss Ophelia\u2019s urgent representations, that their master\u2019s safety depended on their stillness and obedience. St. Clare could say but little; he lay with his eyes shut, but it was evident that he wrestled with bitter thoughts. After a while, he laid his hand on Tom\u2019s, who was kneeling beside him, and said, \u201cTom! poor fellow!\u201d \u201cWhat, Mas\u2019r?\u201d said Tom, earnestly. \u201cI am dying!\u201d said St. Clare, pressing his hand; \u201cpray!\u201d \u201cIf you would like a clergyman--\u201d said the physician. St. Clare hastily shook his head, and said again to Tom, more earnestly, \u201cPray!\u201d And Tom did pray, with all his mind and strength, for the soul that was passing,--the soul that seemed looking so steadily and mournfully from those large, melancholy blue eyes."], "What are Augustine's joyful last words?": [" I think Henrique, now, has a keener sense of the beauty of truth, from seeing lying and deception the universal badge of slavery.\u201d \u201cA Christian-like view of the subject, certainly!\u201d said Augustine. \u201cIt\u2019s true, Christian-like or not; and is about as Christian-like as most other things in the world,\u201d said Alfred. \u201cThat may be,\u201d said St. Clare. \u201cWell, there\u2019s no use in talking, Augustine.

Augustine St. Clare was the son of a wealthy planter of Louisiana. The family had its origin in Canada. Of two brothers, very similar in temperament and character, one had settled on a flourishing farm in Vermont, and the other became an opulent planter in Louisiana. The mother of Augustine was a Huguenot French lady, whose family had emigrated to Louisiana during the days of its early settlement. Augustine and another brother were the only children of their parents. Having inherited from his mother an exceeding delicacy of constitution, he was, at the instance of physicians, during many years of his boyhood, sent to the care of his uncle in Vermont, in order that his constitution might be strengthened by the cold of a more bracing climate."], "What promise did Augustine's sudden death prevent him from fulfilling?": [" Had his wife been a whole woman, she might yet have done something--as woman can--to mend the broken threads of life, and weave again into a tissue of brightness. But Marie St. Clare could not even see that they had been broken. As before stated, she consisted of a fine figure, a pair of splendid eyes, and a hundred thousand dollars; and none of these items were precisely the ones to minister to a mind diseased. When Augustine, pale as death, was found lying on the sofa, and pleaded sudden sick-headache as the cause of his distress, she recommended to him to smell of hartshorn; and when the paleness and headache came on week after week, she only said that she never thought Mr. St. Clare was sickly; but it seems he was very liable to sick-headaches, and that it was a very unfortunate thing for her, because he didn\u2019t enjoy going into company with her, and it seemed odd to go so much alone, when they were just married.", " I think Henrique, now, has a keener sense of the beauty of truth, from seeing lying and deception the universal badge of slavery.\u201d \u201cA Christian-like view of the subject, certainly!\u201d said Augustine. \u201cIt\u2019s true, Christian-like or not; and is about as Christian-like as most other things in the world,\u201d said Alfred. \u201cThat may be,\u201d said St. Clare. \u201cWell, there\u2019s no use in talking, Augustine.

I took the little fellow in my arms, when he was two weeks old, and kissed him, and cried over him; and then I gave him laudanum, and held him close to my bosom, while he slept to death. How I mourned and cried over it! and who ever dreamed that it was anything but a mistake, that had made me give it the laudanum? but it\u2019s one of the few things that I\u2019m glad of, now. I am not sorry, to this day; he, at least, is out of pain. What better than death could I give him, poor child! After a while, the cholera came, and Captain Stuart died; everybody died that wanted to live,--and I,--I, though I went down to death\u2019s door,--_I lived!_ Then I was sold, and passed from hand to hand, till I grew faded and wrinkled, and I had a fever; and then this wretch bought me, and brought me here,--and here I am!\u201d The woman stopped."], "Which of Emmeline\u2019s physical attributes does Susan attempt concealing so as to prevent her from being sold into sex slavery?": [" Susan had been trained as a Christian, brought up in the daily reading of the Bible, and had the same horror of her child\u2019s being sold to a life of shame that any other Christian mother might have; but she had no hope,--no protection. \u201cMother, I think we might do first rate, if you could get a place as cook, and I as chambermaid or seamstress, in some family. I dare say we shall. Let\u2019s both look as bright and lively as we can, and tell all we can do, and perhaps we shall,\u201d said Emmeline. \u201cI want you to brush your hair all back straight, tomorrow,\u201d said Susan. \u201cWhat for, mother?

I know their ways better \u2019n you do,\u201d said Susan. \u201cWell, mother, then I will.\u201d \u201cAnd, Emmeline, if we shouldn\u2019t ever see each other again, after tomorrow,--if I\u2019m sold way up on a plantation somewhere, and you somewhere else,--always remember how you\u2019ve been brought up, and all Missis has told you; take your Bible with you, and your hymn-book; and if you\u2019re faithful to the Lord, he\u2019ll be faithful to you.\u201d So speaks the poor soul, in sore discouragement; for she knows that tomorrow any man, however vile and brutal, however godless and merciless, if he only has money to pay for her, may become owner of her daughter, body and soul; and then, how is the child to be faithful?", " The day after the letter arrived in New Orleans, Susan and Emmeline were attached, and sent to the depot to await a general auction on the following morning; and as they glimmer faintly upon us in the moonlight which steals through the grated window, we may listen to their conversation. Both are weeping, but each quietly, that the other may not hear. \u201cMother, just lay your head on my lap, and see if you can\u2019t sleep a little,\u201d says the girl, trying to appear calm. \u201cI haven\u2019t any heart to sleep, Em; I can\u2019t; it\u2019s the last night we may be together!\u201d \u201cO, mother, don\u2019t say so! perhaps we shall get sold together,--who knows?\u201d \u201cIf \u2019t was anybody\u2019s else case, I should say so, too, Em,\u201d said the woman; \u201cbut I\u2019m so feard of losin\u2019 you that I don\u2019t see anything but the danger.\u201d \u201cWhy, mother, the man said we were both likely, and would sell well.\u201d Susan remembered the man\u2019s looks and words. With a deadly sickness at her heart, she remembered how he had looked at Emmeline\u2019s hands, and lifted up her curly hair, and pronounced her a first-rate article.", " \u201cI meant to stop your fainting,\u201d said Cassy, \u201cand I did do it. And now I tell you, Emmeline, you must make up your mind _not_ to faint, let what will come; there\u2019s no sort of need of it. If I had not stopped you, that wretch might have had his hands on you now.\u201d Emmeline shuddered. The two remained some time in silence. Cassy busied herself with a French book; Emmeline, overcome with the exhaustion, fell into a doze, and slept some time. She was awakened by loud shouts and outcries, the tramp of horses\u2019 feet, and the baying of dogs. She started up, with a faint shriek. \u201cOnly the hunt coming back,\u201d said Cassy, coolly; \u201cnever fear. Look out of this knot-hole. Don\u2019t you see \u2019em all down there? Simon has to give up, for this night. Look, how muddy his horse is, flouncing about in the swamp; the dogs, too, look rather crestfallen.

She has the same soft, dark eye, with longer lashes, and her curling hair is of a luxuriant brown. She also is dressed with great neatness, and her white, delicate hands betray very little acquaintance with servile toil. These two are to be sold tomorrow, in the same lot with the St. Clare servants; and the gentleman to whom they belong, and to whom the money for their sale is to be transmitted, is a member of a Christian church in New York, who will receive the money, and go thereafter to the sacrament of his Lord and theirs, and think no more of it. These two, whom we shall call Susan and Emmeline, had been the personal attendants of an amiable and pious lady of New Orleans, by whom they had been carefully and piously instructed and trained. They had been taught to read and write, diligently instructed in the truths of religion, and their lot had been as happy an one as in their condition it was possible to be."], "When Simon Legree confiscates Uncle Tom's possessions, what does Tom hide in his pocket?": [" \u201cTake off your boots,\u201d said Mr. Legree. Tom did so. \u201cThere,\u201d said the former, throwing him a pair of coarse, stout shoes, such as were common among the slaves, \u201cput these on.\u201d In Tom\u2019s hurried exchange, he had not forgotten to transfer his cherished Bible to his pocket. It was well he did so; for Mr. Legree, having refitted Tom\u2019s handcuffs, proceeded deliberately to investigate the contents of his pockets. He drew out a silk handkerchief, and put it into his own pocket. Several little trifles, which Tom had treasured, chiefly because they had amused Eva, he looked upon with a contemptuous grunt, and tossed them over his shoulder into the river. Tom\u2019s Methodist hymn-book, which, in his hurry, he had forgotten, he now held up and turned over. Humph! pious, to be sure. So, what\u2019s yer name,--you belong to the church, eh?\u201d \u201cYes, Mas\u2019r,\u201d said Tom, firmly. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll soon have _that_ out of you.", " But at last they got on quite confidential terms. \u201cWhat\u2019s little missy\u2019s name?\u201d said Tom, at last, when he thought matters were ripe to push such an inquiry. \u201cEvangeline St. Clare,\u201d said the little one, \u201cthough papa and everybody else call me Eva.

Ye couldn\u2019t treat a poor sinner, now, to a bit of sermon, could ye,--eh?\u201d Tom answered nothing. \u201cGet up, you beast!\u201d said Legree, kicking him again. This was a difficult matter for one so bruised and faint; and, as Tom made efforts to do so, Legree laughed brutally. \u201cWhat makes ye so spry, this morning, Tom? Cotched cold, may be, last night.\u201d Tom by this time had gained his feet, and was confronting his master with a steady, unmoved front. \u201cThe devil, you can!\u201d said Legree, looking him over. \u201cI believe you haven\u2019t got enough yet. Now, Tom, get right down on yer knees and beg my pardon, for yer shines last night.\u201d Tom did not move. \u201cDown, you dog!\u201d said Legree, striking him with his riding-whip."], "What do Uncle Tom and Cassy help one another with in Simon Legree's cotton fields until they are punished for cooperation?": [" The under-servants, who were called on to effect this movement, were running and bustling about with great zeal and confusion, when Legree returned from a ride. \u201cHallo! you Cass!\u201d said Legree, \u201cwhat\u2019s in the wind now?\u201d \u201cNothing; only I choose to have another room,\u201d said Cassy, doggedly. \u201cAnd what for, pray?\u201d said Legree. \u201cI choose to,\u201d said Cassy. \u201cThe devil you do! and what for?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to get some sleep, now and then.\u201d \u201cSleep! well, what hinders your sleeping?\u201d \u201cI could tell, I suppose, if you want to hear,\u201d said Cassy, dryly. \u201cSpeak out, you minx!\u201d said Legree. \u201cO! nothing.

Of course, the moment the doors were opened, the wind had drafted down, and extinguished the light. This may serve as a specimen of the game that Cassy played with Legree, until he would sooner have put his head into a lion\u2019s mouth than to have explored that garret. Meanwhile, in the night, when everybody else was asleep, Cassy slowly and carefully accumulated there a stock of provisions sufficient to afford subsistence for some time; she transferred, article by article, a greater part of her own and Emmeline\u2019s wardrobe.", " \u201cBecause he\u2019s done right, and he knows it, and won\u2019t say he\u2019s done wrong.\u201d \u201cWho a cuss cares what he knows?

Legree, though he talked so stoutly to Cassy, still sallied forth from the house with a degree of misgiving which was not common with him.

Tom, what do you say?\u201d \u201cWe must cross the river tonight, no mistake,\u201d said Tom."], "When Cassy approaches Tom to explain her plan to kill Simon Legree, what does he plead that she do instead?": [" The under-servants, who were called on to effect this movement, were running and bustling about with great zeal and confusion, when Legree returned from a ride. \u201cHallo! you Cass!\u201d said Legree, \u201cwhat\u2019s in the wind now?\u201d \u201cNothing; only I choose to have another room,\u201d said Cassy, doggedly. \u201cAnd what for, pray?\u201d said Legree. \u201cI choose to,\u201d said Cassy. \u201cThe devil you do! and what for?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to get some sleep, now and then.\u201d \u201cSleep! well, what hinders your sleeping?\u201d \u201cI could tell, I suppose, if you want to hear,\u201d said Cassy, dryly. \u201cSpeak out, you minx!\u201d said Legree. \u201cO! nothing. I suppose it wouldn\u2019t disturb _you!_ Only groans, and people scuffing, and rolling round on the garret floor, half the night, from twelve to morning!\u201d \u201cPeople up garret!\u201d said Legree, uneasily, but forcing a laugh; \u201cwho are they, Cassy?\u201d Cassy raised her sharp, black eyes, and looked in the face of Legree, with an expression that went through his bones, as she said, \u201cTo be sure, Simon, who are they?", " Cassy lit a small lamp, and creeping round under the eaves, they established themselves in it. It was spread with a couple of small mattresses and some pillows; a box near by was plentifully stored with candles, provisions, and all the clothing necessary to their journey, which Cassy had arranged into bundles of an astonishingly small compass. \u201cThere,\u201d said Cassy, as she fixed the lamp into a small hook, which she had driven into the side of the box for that purpose; \u201cthis is to be our home for the present. How do you like it?\u201d \u201cAre you sure they won\u2019t come and search the garret?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to see Simon Legree doing that,\u201d said Cassy. \u201cNo, indeed; he will be too glad to keep away. As to the servants, they would any of them stand and be shot, sooner than show their faces here.\u201d Somewhat reassured, Emmeline settled herself back on her pillow. \u201cWhat did you mean, Cassy, by saying you would kill me?\u201d she said, simply.", " \u201cBecause he\u2019s done right, and he knows it, and won\u2019t say he\u2019s done wrong.\u201d \u201cWho a cuss cares what he knows? The nigger shall say what I please, or--\u201d \u201cOr, you\u2019ll lose your bet on the cotton crop, by keeping him out of the field, just at this very press.\u201d \u201cBut he _will_ give up,--course, he will; don\u2019t I know what niggers is? He\u2019ll beg like a dog, this morning.\u201d \u201cHe won\u2019t, Simon; you don\u2019t know this kind. You may kill him by inches,--you won\u2019t get the first word of confession out of him.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll see,--where is he?\u201d said Legree, going out. \u201cIn the waste-room of the gin-house,\u201d said Cassy. Legree, though he talked so stoutly to Cassy, still sallied forth from the house with a degree of misgiving which was not common with him. His dreams of the past night, mingled with Cassy\u2019s prudential suggestions, considerably affected his mind. He resolved that nobody should be witness of his encounter with Tom; and determined, if he could not subdue him by bullying, to defer his vengeance, to be wreaked in a more convenient season.", " \u201cI hope you are satisfied,\u201d said she. \u201cBlast you, Cass!\u201d said Legree. \u201cWhat for?\u201d said Cassy. \u201cI only went up and shut the doors. _What\u2019s the matter with that garret_, Simon, do you suppose?\u201d said she. \u201cNone of your business!\u201d said Legree. \u201cO, it an\u2019t? Well,\u201d said Cassy, \u201cat any rate, I\u2019m glad _I_ don\u2019t sleep under it.\u201d Anticipating the rising of the wind, that very evening, Cassy had been up and opened the garret window. Of course, the moment the doors were opened, the wind had drafted down, and extinguished the light. This may serve as a specimen of the game that Cassy played with Legree, until he would sooner have put his head into a lion\u2019s mouth than to have explored that garret. Meanwhile, in the night, when everybody else was asleep, Cassy slowly and carefully accumulated there a stock of provisions sufficient to afford subsistence for some time; she transferred, article by article, a greater part of her own and Emmeline\u2019s wardrobe."], "Where do Cassy and Emmeline hide overnight after escaping Legree's house and running through the nearby swamp?": [" The establishment was, of a consequence, wholly deserted, when Cassy and Emmeline glided into it the back way. The whooping and shouts of their pursuers were still filling the air; and, looking from the sitting-room windows, Cassy and Emmeline could see the troop, with their flambeaux, just dispersing themselves along the edge of the swamp. \u201cSee there!\u201d said Emmeline, pointing to Cassy; \u201cthe hunt is begun! Look how those lights dance about! Hark! the dogs! Don\u2019t you hear? If we were only _there_, our chances wouldn\u2019t be worth a picayune. O, for pity\u2019s sake, do let\u2019s hide ourselves. Quick!\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no occasion for hurry,\u201d said Cassy, coolly; \u201cthey are all out after the hunt,--that\u2019s the amusement of the evening! We\u2019ll go up stairs, by and by. Meanwhile,\u201d said she, deliberately taking a key from the pocket of a coat that Legree had thrown down in his hurry, \u201cmeanwhile I shall take something to pay our passage.\u201d She unlocked the desk, took from it a roll of bills, which she counted over rapidly.", " It was not Sambo, however, but Legree, who was pursuing them with violent execrations. At the sound, the feebler spirit of Emmeline gave way; and, laying hold of Cassy\u2019s arm, she said, \u201cO, Cassy, I\u2019m going to faint!\u201d \u201cIf you do, I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d said Cassy, drawing a small, glittering stiletto, and flashing it before the eyes of the girl. The diversion accomplished the purpose. Emmeline did not faint, and succeeded in plunging, with Cassy, into a part of the labyrinth of swamp, so deep and dark that it was perfectly hopeless for Legree to think of following them, without assistance. \u201cWell,\u201d said he, chuckling brutally; \u201cat any rate, they\u2019ve got themselves into a trap now--the baggage! They\u2019re safe enough. They shall sweat for it!\u201d \u201cHulloa, there! Sambo! Quimbo! All hands!\u201d called Legree, coming to the quarters, when the men and women were just returning from work. \u201cThere\u2019s two runaways in the swamps.", " \u201cI meant to stop your fainting,\u201d said Cassy, \u201cand I did do it. And now I tell you, Emmeline, you must make up your mind _not_ to faint, let what will come; there\u2019s no sort of need of it. If I had not stopped you, that wretch might have had his hands on you now.\u201d Emmeline shuddered. The two remained some time in silence. Cassy busied herself with a French book; Emmeline, overcome with the exhaustion, fell into a doze, and slept some time. She was awakened by loud shouts and outcries, the tramp of horses\u2019 feet, and the baying of dogs. She started up, with a faint shriek. \u201cOnly the hunt coming back,\u201d said Cassy, coolly; \u201cnever fear. Look out of this knot-hole. Don\u2019t you see \u2019em all down there? Simon has to give up, for this night. Look, how muddy his horse is, flouncing about in the swamp; the dogs, too, look rather crestfallen. Ah, my good sir, you\u2019ll have to try the race again and again,--the game isn\u2019t there.\u201d \u201cO, don\u2019t speak a word!\u201d said Emmeline; \u201cwhat if they should hear you?\u201d \u201cIf they do hear anything, it will make them very particular to keep away,\u201d said Cassy.", " I shall love you, Cassy, whether you love me or not!\u201d The gentle, child-like spirit conquered. Cassy sat down by her, put her arm round her neck, stroked her soft, brown hair; and Emmeline then wondered at the beauty of her magnificent eyes, now soft with tears. \u201cO, Em!\u201d said Cassy, \u201cI\u2019ve hungered for my children, and thirsted for them, and my eyes fail with longing for them! Here! here!\u201d she said, striking her breast, \u201cit\u2019s all desolate, all empty! If God would give me back my children, then I could pray.\u201d \u201cYou must trust him, Cassy,\u201d said Emmeline; \u201che is our Father!\u201d \u201cHis wrath is upon us,\u201d said Cassy; \u201che has turned away in anger.\u201d \u201cNo, Cassy! He will be good to us! Let us hope in Him,\u201d said Emmeline,--\u201cI always have had hope.\u201d The hunt was long, animated, and thorough, but unsuccessful; and, with grave, ironic exultation, Cassy looked down on Legree, as, weary and dispirited, he alighted from his horse."], "What are the relationships of Madame de Thoux to George Harris, and Cassy to Eliza, respectively?": [" \u201cDo you know,\u201d said Madame de Thoux to him, one day, \u201cof any man, in your neighborhood, of the name of Harris?\u201d \u201cThere is an old fellow, of that name, lives not far from my father\u2019s place,\u201d said George. \u201cWe never have had much intercourse with him, though.\u201d \u201cHe is a large slave-owner, I believe,\u201d said Madame de Thoux, with a manner which seemed to betray more interest than she was exactly willing to show. \u201cHe is,\u201d said George, looking rather surprised at her manner. \u201cDid you ever know of his having--perhaps, you may have heard of his having a mulatto boy, named George?\u201d \u201cO, certainly,--George Harris,--I know him well; he married a servant of my mother\u2019s, but has escaped, now, to Canada.\u201d \u201cHe has?\u201d said Madame de Thoux, quickly. \u201cThank God!\u201d George looked a surprised inquiry, but said nothing.

He took me with him to the West Indies, set me free, and married me. It is but lately that he died; and I was going up to Kentucky, to see if I could find and redeem my brother.\u201d \u201cI heard him speak of a sister Emily, that was sold South,\u201d said George. \u201cYes, indeed!

This lady, having gathered, from George\u2019s conversation, that he was from Kentucky, seemed evidently disposed to cultivate his acquaintance; in which design she was seconded by the graces of her little girl, who was about as pretty a plaything as ever diverted the weariness of a fortnight\u2019s trip on a steamboat. George\u2019s chair was often placed at her state-room door; and Cassy, as she sat upon the guards, could hear their conversation. Madame de Thoux was very minute in her inquiries as to Kentucky, where she said she had resided in a former period of her life. George discovered, to his surprise, that her former residence must have been in his own vicinity; and her inquiries showed a knowledge of people and things in his vicinity, that was perfectly surprising to him."], "George Harris advocates the immigration of freed slaves to ___.": [" No danger! niggers are too plaguy scared!\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know why I _shouldn\u2019t_ save my skin,\u201d said Marks. \u201cIt\u2019s the best I\u2019ve got; and niggers _do_ fight like the devil, sometimes.\u201d At this moment, George appeared on the top of a rock above them, and, speaking in a calm, clear voice, said, \u201cGentlemen, who are you, down there, and what do you want?\u201d \u201cWe want a party of runaway niggers,\u201d said Tom Loker. \u201cOne George Harris, and Eliza Harris, and their son, and Jim Selden, and an old woman.

She stopped short,--a word of choking feelings, rising in her heart, kept her silent. Cassy had always kept over Legree the kind of influence that a strong, impassioned woman can ever keep over the most brutal man; but, of late, she had grown more and more irritable and restless, under the hideous yoke of her servitude, and her irritability, at times, broke out into raving insanity; and this liability made her a sort of object of dread to Legree, who had that superstitious horror of insane persons which is common to coarse and uninstructed minds.", " The under-servants, who were called on to effect this movement, were running and bustling about with great zeal and confusion, when Legree returned from a ride. \u201cHallo! you Cass!\u201d said Legree, \u201cwhat\u2019s in the wind now?\u201d \u201cNothing; only I choose to have another room,\u201d said Cassy, doggedly. \u201cAnd what for, pray?\u201d said Legree. \u201cI choose to,\u201d said Cassy. \u201cThe devil you do! and what for?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to get some sleep, now and then.\u201d \u201cSleep! well, what hinders your sleeping?\u201d \u201cI could tell, I suppose, if you want to hear,\u201d said Cassy, dryly. \u201cSpeak out, you minx!\u201d said Legree. \u201cO! nothing.

He sulkily followed them to where the wagon stood at the door. George spread his cloak in the wagon, and had the body carefully disposed of in it,--moving the seat, so as to give it room. Then he turned, fixed his eyes on Legree, and said, with forced composure, \u201cI have not, as yet, said to you what I think of this most atrocious affair;--this is not the time and place. But, sir, this innocent blood shall have justice. I will proclaim this murder.
