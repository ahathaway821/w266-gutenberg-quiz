{"To whom does Shelbysell Tom and Harry?": [" But he was no man,\u201d he added, suddenly. \u201cNo man ever had such long and living power! O, that I could believe what my mother taught me, and pray as I did when I was a boy!\u201d \u201cIf Mas\u2019r pleases,\u201d said Tom, \u201cMiss Eva used to read this so beautifully. I wish Mas\u2019r\u2019d be so good as read it. Don\u2019t get no readin\u2019, hardly, now Miss Eva\u2019s gone.\u201d The chapter was the eleventh of John,--the touching account of the raising of Lazarus, St. Clare read it aloud, often pausing to wrestle down feelings which were roused by the pathos of the story. Tom knelt before him, with clasped hands, and with an absorbed expression of love, trust, adoration, on his quiet face. \u201cTom,\u201d said his Master, \u201cthis is all _real_ to you!\u201d \u201cI can jest fairly _see_ it Mas\u2019r,\u201d said Tom. \u201cI wish I had your eyes, Tom.\u201d \u201cI wish, to the dear Lord, Mas\u2019r had!\u201d \u201cBut, Tom, you know that I have a great deal more knowledge than you; what if I should tell you that I don\u2019t believe this Bible?\u201d \u201cO, Mas\u2019r!\u201d said Tom, holding up his hands, with a deprecating gesture. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it shake your faith some, Tom?\u201d \u201cNot a grain,\u201d said Tom. \u201cWhy, Tom, you must know I know the most.\u201d \u201cO, Mas\u2019r, haven\u2019t you jest read how he hides from the wise and prudent, and reveals unto babes? But Mas\u2019r wasn\u2019t in earnest, for sartin, now?\u201d said Tom, anxiously. \u201cNo, Tom, I was not. I don\u2019t disbelieve, and I think there is reason to believe; and still I don\u2019t. It\u2019s a troublesome bad habit I\u2019ve got, Tom.\u201d \u201cIf Mas\u2019r would only pray!\u201d \u201cHow do you know I don\u2019t, Tom?\u201d \u201cDoes Mas\u2019r?\u201d \u201cI would, Tom, if there was anybody there when I pray; but it\u2019s all speaking unto nothing, when I do.", " \u201cIt will have to come out,\u201d said he, mentally; \u201cas well now as ever.\u201d \u201cI told Eliza,\u201d said Mrs. Shelby, as she continued brushing her hair, \u201cthat she was a little fool for her pains, and that you never had anything to do with that sort of persons. Of course, I knew you never meant to sell any of our people,--least of all, to such a fellow.\u201d \u201cWell, Emily,\u201d said her husband, \u201cso I have always felt and said; but the fact is that my business lies so that I cannot get on without. I shall have to sell some of my hands.\u201d \u201cTo that creature? Impossible! Mr. Shelby, you cannot be serious.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say that I am,\u201d said Mr. Shelby. \u201cI\u2019ve agreed to sell Tom.\u201d \u201cWhat! our Tom?--that good, faithful creature!--been your faithful servant from a boy! O, Mr. Shelby!--and you have promised him his freedom, too,--you and I have spoken to him a hundred times of it. Well, I can believe anything now,--I can believe _now_ that you could sell little Harry, poor Eliza\u2019s only child!\u201d said Mrs. Shelby, in a tone between grief and indignation. \u201cWell, since you must know all, it is so. I have agreed to sell Tom and Harry both; and I don\u2019t know why I am to be rated, as if I were a monster, for doing what every one does every day.\u201d \u201cBut why, of all others, choose these?\u201d said Mrs. Shelby. \u201cWhy sell them, of all on the place, if you must sell at all?\u201d \u201cBecause they will bring the highest sum of any,--that\u2019s why.", " Tom and Adolph assisted to get him composed for the night, the latter in high spirits, evidently regarding the matter as a good joke, and laughing heartily at the rusticity of Tom\u2019s horror, who really was simple enough to lie awake most of the rest of the night, praying for his young master. \u201cWell, Tom, what are you waiting for?\u201d said St. Clare, the next day, as he sat in his library, in dressing-gown and slippers. St. Clare had just been entrusting Tom with some money, and various commissions. \u201cIsn\u2019t all right there, Tom?\u201d he added, as Tom still stood waiting. \u201cI\u2019m \u2019fraid not, Mas\u2019r,\u201d said Tom, with a grave face. St. Clare laid down his paper, and set down his coffee-cup, and looked at Tom. \u201cWhy Tom, what\u2019s the case? You look as solemn as a coffin.\u201d \u201cI feel very bad, Mas\u2019r. I allays have thought that Mas\u2019r would be good to everybody.\u201d \u201cWell, Tom, haven\u2019t I been? Come, now, what do you want? There\u2019s something you haven\u2019t got, I suppose, and this is the preface.\u201d \u201cMas\u2019r allays been good to me. I haven\u2019t nothing to complain of on that head. But there is one that Mas\u2019r isn\u2019t good to.\u201d \u201cWhy, Tom, what\u2019s got into you? Speak out; what do you mean?\u201d \u201cLast night, between one and two, I thought so. I studied upon the matter then. Mas\u2019r isn\u2019t good to _himself_.\u201d Tom said this with his back to his master, and his hand on the door-knob. St. Clare felt his face flush crimson, but he laughed.", " Some dim ideas of imprudence or impropriety in the measure seemed to embarrass him considerably; for he often stopped, as Eliza glided forward, and looked wistfully, first at her and then at the house, and then, as if reassured by reflection, he pattered along after her again. A few minutes brought them to the window of Uncle Tom\u2019s cottage, and Eliza stopping, tapped lightly on the window-pane. The prayer-meeting at Uncle Tom\u2019s had, in the order of hymn-singing, been protracted to a very late hour; and, as Uncle Tom had indulged himself in a few lengthy solos afterwards, the consequence was, that, although it was now between twelve and one o\u2019clock, he and his worthy helpmeet were not yet asleep. \u201cGood Lord! what\u2019s that?\u201d said Aunt Chloe, starting up and hastily drawing the curtain. \u201cMy sakes alive, if it an\u2019t Lizy! Get on your clothes, old man, quick!--there\u2019s old Bruno, too, a pawin round; what on airth! I\u2019m gwine to open the door.\u201d And suiting the action to the word, the door flew open, and the light of the tallow candle, which Tom had hastily lighted, fell on the haggard face and dark, wild eyes of the fugitive. \u201cLord bless you!--I\u2019m skeered to look at ye, Lizy! Are ye tuck sick, or what\u2019s come over ye?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m running away--Uncle Tom and Aunt Chloe--carrying off my child--Master sold him!\u201d \u201cSold him?\u201d echoed both, lifting up their hands in dismay. \u201cYes, sold him!\u201d said Eliza, firmly; \u201cI crept into the closet by Mistress\u2019 door tonight, and I heard Master tell Missis that he had sold my Harry, and you, Uncle Tom, both, to a trader; and that he was going off this morning on his horse, and that the man was to take possession today.\u201d Tom had stood, during this speech, with his hands raised, and his eyes dilated, like a man in a dream."], "In what year wasthe Fugitive Slave Act passed?": [" Our good senator in his native state had not been exceeded by any of his brethren at Washington, in the sort of eloquence which has won for them immortal renown! How sublimely he had sat with his hands in his pockets, and scouted all sentimental weakness of those who would put the welfare of a few miserable fugitives before great state interests! He was as bold as a lion about it, and \u201cmightily convinced\u201d not only himself, but everybody that heard him;--but then his idea of a fugitive was only an idea of the letters that spell the word,--or at the most, the image of a little newspaper picture of a man with a stick and bundle with \u201cRan away from the subscriber\u201d under it. The magic of the real presence of distress,--the imploring human eye, the frail, trembling human hand, the despairing appeal of helpless agony,--these he had never tried. He had never thought that a fugitive might be a hapless mother, a defenceless child,--like that one which was now wearing his lost boy\u2019s little well-known cap; and so, as our poor senator was not stone or steel,--as he was a man, and a downright noble-hearted one, too,--he was, as everybody must see, in a sad case for his patriotism. And you need not exult over him, good brother of the Southern States; for we have some inklings that many of you, under similar circumstances, would not do much better. We have reason to know, in Kentucky, as in Mississippi, are noble and generous hearts, to whom never was tale of suffering told in vain.", " Have you not, in your own secret souls, in your own private conversings, felt that there are woes and evils, in this accursed system, far beyond what are here shadowed, or can be shadowed? Can it be otherwise? Is _man_ ever a creature to be trusted with wholly irresponsible power? And does not the slave system, by denying the slave all legal right of testimony, make every individual owner an irresponsible despot? Can anybody fail to make the inference what the practical result will be? If there is, as we admit, a public sentiment among you, men of honor, justice and humanity, is there not also another kind of public sentiment among the ruffian, the brutal and debased? And cannot the ruffian, the brutal, the debased, by slave law, own just as many slaves as the best and purest? Are the honorable, the just, the high-minded and compassionate, the majority anywhere in this world? The slave-trade is now, by American law, considered as piracy. But a slave-trade, as systematic as ever was carried on on the coast of Africa, is an inevitable attendant and result of American slavery. And its heart-break and its horrors, can they be told? The writer has given only a faint shadow, a dim picture, of the anguish and despair that are, at this very moment, riving thousands of hearts, shattering thousands of families, and driving a helpless and sensitive race to frenzy and despair. There are those living who know the mothers whom this accursed traffic has driven to the murder of their children; and themselves seeking in death a shelter from woes more dreaded than death.", " The daughter of this woman married a slave. She was a remarkably active and capable young woman, and, by her industry and thrift, and the most persevering self-denial, raised nine hundred dollars for her husband\u2019s freedom, which she paid, as she raised it, into the hands of his master. She yet wanted a hundred dollars of the price, when he died. She never recovered any of the money. These are but few facts, among multitudes which might be adduced, to show the self-denial, energy, patience, and honesty, which the slave has exhibited in a state of freedom. And let it be remembered that these individuals have thus bravely succeeded in conquering for themselves comparative wealth and social position, in the face of every disadvantage and discouragement. The colored man, by the law of Ohio, cannot be a voter, and, till within a few years, was even denied the right of testimony in legal suits with the white. Nor are these instances confined to the State of Ohio. In all states of the Union we see men, but yesterday burst from the shackles of slavery, who, by a self-educating force, which cannot be too much admired, have risen to highly respectable stations in society. Pennington, among clergymen, Douglas and Ward, among editors, are well known instances. If this persecuted race, with every discouragement and disadvantage, have done thus much, how much more they might do if the Christian church would act towards them in the spirit of her Lord!", " at last!\u201d The effort of speaking exhausted him. The sinking paleness of death fell on him; but with it there fell, as if shed from the wings of some pitying spirit, a beautiful expression of peace, like that of a wearied child who sleeps. So he lay for a few moments. They saw that the mighty hand was on him. Just before the spirit parted, he opened his eyes, with a sudden light, as of joy and recognition, and said _\u201cMother!\u201d_ and then he was gone! CHAPTER XXIX The Unprotected We hear often of the distress of the negro servants, on the loss of a kind master; and with good reason, for no creature on God\u2019s earth is left more utterly unprotected and desolate than the slave in these circumstances. The child who has lost a father has still the protection of friends, and of the law; he is something, and can do something,--has acknowledged rights and position; the slave has none. The law regards him, in every respect, as devoid of rights as a bale of merchandise. The only possible acknowledgment of any of the longings and wants of a human and immortal creature, which are given to him, comes to him through the sovereign and irresponsible will of his master; and when that master is stricken down, nothing remains. The number of those men who know how to use wholly irresponsible power humanely and generously is small. Everybody knows this, and the slave knows it best of all; so that he feels that there are ten chances of his finding an abusive and tyrannical master, to one of his finding a considerate and kind one."], "In what city dothe St. Clares live?": [" Tom and Eva both started. \u201cWhat\u2019s here?\u201d said St. Clare, coming up and looking at the slate. \u201cO, it\u2019s Tom\u2019s letter. I\u2019m helping him to write it,\u201d said Eva; \u201cisn\u2019t it nice?\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t discourage either of you,\u201d said St. Clare, \u201cbut I rather think, Tom, you\u2019d better get me to write your letter for you. I\u2019ll do it, when I come home from my ride.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very important he should write,\u201d said Eva, \u201cbecause his mistress is going to send down money to redeem him, you know, papa; he told me they told him so.\u201d St. Clare thought, in his heart, that this was probably only one of those things which good-natured owners say to their servants, to alleviate their horror of being sold, without any intention of fulfilling the expectation thus excited. But he did not make any audible comment upon it,--only ordered Tom to get the horses out for a ride. Tom\u2019s letter was written in due form for him that evening, and safely lodged in the post-office. Miss Ophelia still persevered in her labors in the housekeeping line. It was universally agreed, among all the household, from Dinah down to the youngest urchin, that Miss Ophelia was decidedly \u201ccuris,\u201d--a term by which a southern servant implies that his or her betters don\u2019t exactly suit them. The higher circle in the family--to wit, Adolph, Jane and Rosa--agreed that she was no lady; ladies never keep working about as she did,--that she had no _air_ at all; and they were surprised that she should be any relation of the St. Clares.", " As, for example, Mr. Haley: he thought first of Tom\u2019s length, and breadth, and height, and what he would sell for, if he was kept fat and in good case till he got him into market. He thought of how he should make out his gang; he thought of the respective market value of certain supposititious men and women and children who were to compose it, and other kindred topics of the business; then he thought of himself, and how humane he was, that whereas other men chained their \u201cniggers\u201d hand and foot both, he only put fetters on the feet, and left Tom the use of his hands, as long as he behaved well; and he sighed to think how ungrateful human nature was, so that there was even room to doubt whether Tom appreciated his mercies. He had been taken in so by \u201cniggers\u201d whom he had favored; but still he was astonished to consider how good-natured he yet remained! As to Tom, he was thinking over some words of an unfashionable old book, which kept running through his head, again and again, as follows: \u201cWe have here no continuing city, but we seek one to come; wherefore God himself is not ashamed to be called our God; for he hath prepared for us a city.\u201d These words of an ancient volume, got up principally by \u201cignorant and unlearned men,\u201d have, through all time, kept up, somehow, a strange sort of power over the minds of poor, simple fellows, like Tom. They stir up the soul from its depths, and rouse, as with trumpet call, courage, energy, and enthusiasm, where before was only the blackness of despair.", " Of course, in a community so organized, what can a man of honorable and humane feelings do, but shut his eyes all he can, and harden his heart? I can\u2019t buy every poor wretch I see. I can\u2019t turn knight-errant, and undertake to redress every individual case of wrong in such a city as this. The most I can do is to try and keep out of the way of it.\u201d St. Clare\u2019s fine countenance was for a moment overcast; he said, \u201cCome, cousin, don\u2019t stand there looking like one of the Fates; you\u2019ve only seen a peep through the curtain,--a specimen of what is going on, the world over, in some shape or other. If we are to be prying and spying into all the dismals of life, we should have no heart to anything. \u2019T is like looking too close into the details of Dinah\u2019s kitchen;\u201d and St. Clare lay back on the sofa, and busied himself with his paper. Miss Ophelia sat down, and pulled out her knitting-work, and sat there grim with indignation. She knit and knit, but while she mused the fire burned; at last she broke out--\u201cI tell you, Augustine, I can\u2019t get over things so, if you can. It\u2019s a perfect abomination for you to defend such a system,--that\u2019s _my_ mind!\u201d \u201cWhat now?\u201d said St. Clare, looking up. \u201cAt it again, hey?\u201d \u201cI say it\u2019s perfectly abominable for you to defend such a system!\u201d said Miss Ophelia, with increasing warmth. \u201c_I_ defend it, my dear lady? Who ever said I did defend it?\u201d said St. Clare. \u201cOf course, you defend it,--you all do,--all you Southerners.", " Tom, however, had a feeling at his own heart, that drew him to his master. He followed him wherever he walked, wistfully and sadly; and when he saw him sitting, so pale and quiet, in Eva\u2019s room, holding before his eyes her little open Bible, though seeing no letter or word of what was in it, there was more sorrow to Tom in that still, fixed, tearless eye, than in all Marie\u2019s moans and lamentations. In a few days the St. Clare family were back again in the city; Augustine, with the restlessness of grief, longing for another scene, to change the current of his thoughts. So they left the house and garden, with its little grave, and came back to New Orleans; and St. Clare walked the streets busily, and strove to fill up the chasm in his heart with hurry and bustle, and change of place; and people who saw him in the street, or met him at the cafe, knew of his loss only by the weed on his hat; for there he was, smiling and talking, and reading the newspaper, and speculating on politics, and attending to business matters; and who could see that all this smiling outside was but a hollowed shell over a heart that was a dark and silent sepulchre? \u201cMr. St. Clare is a singular man,\u201d said Marie to Miss Ophelia, in a complaining tone. \u201cI used to think, if there was anything in the world he did love, it was our dear little Eva; but he seems to be forgetting her very easily. I cannot ever get him to talk about her."], "How old is Emmeline?": [" The establishment was, of a consequence, wholly deserted, when Cassy and Emmeline glided into it the back way. The whooping and shouts of their pursuers were still filling the air; and, looking from the sitting-room windows, Cassy and Emmeline could see the troop, with their flambeaux, just dispersing themselves along the edge of the swamp. \u201cSee there!\u201d said Emmeline, pointing to Cassy; \u201cthe hunt is begun! Look how those lights dance about! Hark! the dogs! Don\u2019t you hear? If we were only _there_, our chances wouldn\u2019t be worth a picayune. O, for pity\u2019s sake, do let\u2019s hide ourselves. Quick!\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no occasion for hurry,\u201d said Cassy, coolly; \u201cthey are all out after the hunt,--that\u2019s the amusement of the evening! We\u2019ll go up stairs, by and by. Meanwhile,\u201d said she, deliberately taking a key from the pocket of a coat that Legree had thrown down in his hurry, \u201cmeanwhile I shall take something to pay our passage.\u201d She unlocked the desk, took from it a roll of bills, which she counted over rapidly. \u201cO, don\u2019t let\u2019s do that!\u201d said Emmeline. \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d said Cassy; \u201cwhy not? Would you have us starve in the swamps, or have that that will pay our way to the free states. Money will do anything, girl.\u201d And, as she spoke, she put the money in her bosom. \u201cIt would be stealing,\u201d said Emmeline, in a distressed whisper. \u201cStealing!\u201d said Cassy, with a scornful laugh. \u201cThey who steal body and soul needn\u2019t talk to us.", " One must have something;--things don\u2019t look so dreadful, when you take that.\u201d \u201cMother used to tell me never to touch any such thing,\u201d said Emmeline. \u201c_Mother_ told you!\u201d said Cassy, with a thrilling and bitter emphasis on the word mother. \u201cWhat use is it for mothers to say anything? You are all to be bought and paid for, and your souls belong to whoever gets you. That\u2019s the way it goes. I say, _drink_ brandy; drink all you can, and it\u2019ll make things come easier.\u201d \u201cO, Cassy! do pity me!\u201d \u201cPity you!--don\u2019t I? Haven\u2019t I a daughter,--Lord knows where she is, and whose she is, now,--going the way her mother went, before her, I suppose, and that her children must go, after her! There\u2019s no end to the curse--forever!\u201d \u201cI wish I\u2019d never been born!\u201d said Emmeline, wringing her hands. \u201cThat\u2019s an old wish with me,\u201d said Cassy. \u201cI\u2019ve got used to wishing that. I\u2019d die, if I dared to,\u201d she said, looking out into the darkness, with that still, fixed despair which was the habitual expression of her face when at rest. \u201cIt would be wicked to kill one\u2019s self,\u201d said Emmeline. \u201cI don\u2019t know why,--no wickeder than things we live and do, day after day. But the sisters told me things, when I was in the convent, that make me afraid to die. If it would only be the end of us, why, then--\u201d Emmeline turned away, and hid her face in her hands. While this conversation was passing in the chamber, Legree, overcome with his carouse, had sunk to sleep in the room below.", " A grave sneer overcast the dark, severe gravity of her face, as she listened, and heard them divide out the ground, discuss the rival merits of the dogs, give orders about firing, and the treatment of each, in case of capture. Cassy drew back; and, clasping her hands, looked upward, and said, \u201cO, great Almighty God! we are _all_ sinners; but what have _we_ done, more than all the rest of the world, that we should be treated so?\u201d There was a terrible earnestness in her face and voice, as she spoke. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for _you_, child,\u201d she said, looking at Emmeline, \u201cI\u2019d _go_ out to them; and I\u2019d thank any one of them that _would_ shoot me down; for what use will freedom be to me? Can it give me back my children, or make me what I used to be?\u201d Emmeline, in her child-like simplicity, was half afraid of the dark moods of Cassy. She looked perplexed, but made no answer. She only took her hand, with a gentle, caressing movement. \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d said Cassy, trying to draw it away; \u201cyou\u2019ll get me to loving you; and I never mean to love anything, again!\u201d \u201cPoor Cassy!\u201d said Emmeline, \u201cdon\u2019t feel so! If the Lord gives us liberty, perhaps he\u2019ll give you back your daughter; at any rate, I\u2019ll be like a daughter to you. I know I\u2019ll never see my poor old mother again! I shall love you, Cassy, whether you love me or not!\u201d The gentle, child-like spirit conquered. Cassy sat down by her, put her arm round her neck, stroked her soft, brown hair; and Emmeline then wondered at the beauty of her magnificent eyes, now soft with tears.", " \u201cWhat did you mean, Cassy, by saying you would kill me?\u201d she said, simply. \u201cI meant to stop your fainting,\u201d said Cassy, \u201cand I did do it. And now I tell you, Emmeline, you must make up your mind _not_ to faint, let what will come; there\u2019s no sort of need of it. If I had not stopped you, that wretch might have had his hands on you now.\u201d Emmeline shuddered. The two remained some time in silence. Cassy busied herself with a French book; Emmeline, overcome with the exhaustion, fell into a doze, and slept some time. She was awakened by loud shouts and outcries, the tramp of horses\u2019 feet, and the baying of dogs. She started up, with a faint shriek. \u201cOnly the hunt coming back,\u201d said Cassy, coolly; \u201cnever fear. Look out of this knot-hole. Don\u2019t you see \u2019em all down there? Simon has to give up, for this night. Look, how muddy his horse is, flouncing about in the swamp; the dogs, too, look rather crestfallen. Ah, my good sir, you\u2019ll have to try the race again and again,--the game isn\u2019t there.\u201d \u201cO, don\u2019t speak a word!\u201d said Emmeline; \u201cwhat if they should hear you?\u201d \u201cIf they do hear anything, it will make them very particular to keep away,\u201d said Cassy. \u201cNo danger; we may make any noise we please, and it will only add to the effect.\u201d At length the stillness of midnight settled down over the house. Legree, cursing his ill luck, and vowing dire vengeance on the morrow, went to bed.

Will these years and years of misery come to an end?--shall we be free? \u201cI am sure of it, George,\u201d said Eliza, looking upward, while tears of hope and enthusiasm shone on her long, dark lashes. \u201cI feel it in me, that God is going to bring us out of bondage, this very day.\u201d \u201cI will believe you, Eliza,\u201d said George, rising suddenly up, \u201cI will believe,--come let\u2019s be off. Well, indeed,\u201d said he, holding her off at arm\u2019s length, and looking admiringly at her, \u201cyou _are_ a pretty little fellow. That crop of little, short curls, is quite becoming. Put on your cap. So--a little to one side. I never saw you look quite so pretty. But, it\u2019s almost time for the carriage;--I wonder if Mrs. Smyth has got Harry rigged?\u201d The door opened, and a respectable, middle-aged woman entered, leading little Harry, dressed in girl\u2019s clothes. \u201cWhat a pretty girl he makes,\u201d said Eliza, turning him round.", " \u201cWe call him Harriet, you see;--don\u2019t the name come nicely?\u201d The child stood gravely regarding his mother in her new and strange attire, observing a profound silence, and occasionally drawing deep sighs, and peeping at her from under his dark curls. \u201cDoes Harry know mamma?\u201d said Eliza, stretching her hands toward him. The child clung shyly to the woman. \u201cCome Eliza, why do you try to coax him, when you know that he has got to be kept away from you?\u201d \u201cI know it\u2019s foolish,\u201d said Eliza; \u201cyet, I can\u2019t bear to have him turn away from me. But come,--where\u2019s my cloak? Here,--how is it men put on cloaks, George?\u201d \u201cYou must wear it so,\u201d said her husband, throwing it over his shoulders. \u201cSo, then,\u201d said Eliza, imitating the motion,--\u201cand I must stamp, and take long steps, and try to look saucy.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t exert yourself,\u201d said George. \u201cThere is, now and then, a modest young man; and I think it would be easier for you to act that character.\u201d \u201cAnd these gloves! mercy upon us!\u201d said Eliza; \u201cwhy, my hands are lost in them.\u201d \u201cI advise you to keep them on pretty strictly,\u201d said George. \u201cYour slender paw might bring us all out. Now, Mrs. Smyth, you are to go under our charge, and be our aunty,--you mind.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve heard,\u201d said Mrs. Smyth, \u201cthat there have been men down, warning all the packet captains against a man and woman, with a little boy.\u201d \u201cThey have!\u201d said George. \u201cWell, if we see any such people, we can tell them.\u201d A hack now drove to the door, and the friendly family who had received the fugitives crowded around them with farewell greetings.", " She would gladly have stopped at the door to listen, as she came out; but her mistress just then calling, she was obliged to hasten away. Still she thought she heard the trader make an offer for her boy;--could she be mistaken? Her heart swelled and throbbed, and she involuntarily strained him so tight that the little fellow looked up into her face in astonishment. \u201cEliza, girl, what ails you today?\u201d said her mistress, when Eliza had upset the wash-pitcher, knocked down the workstand, and finally was abstractedly offering her mistress a long nightgown in place of the silk dress she had ordered her to bring from the wardrobe. Eliza started. \u201cO, missis!\u201d she said, raising her eyes; then, bursting into tears, she sat down in a chair, and began sobbing. \u201cWhy, Eliza child, what ails you?\u201d said her mistress. \u201cO! missis, missis,\u201d said Eliza, \u201cthere\u2019s been a trader talking with master in the parlor! I heard him.\u201d \u201cWell, silly child, suppose there has.\u201d \u201cO, missis, _do_ you suppose mas\u2019r would sell my Harry?\u201d And the poor creature threw herself into a chair, and sobbed convulsively. \u201cSell him! No, you foolish girl! You know your master never deals with those southern traders, and never means to sell any of his servants, as long as they behave well. Why, you silly child, who do you think would want to buy your Harry? Do you think all the world are set on him as you are, you goosie? Come, cheer up, and hook my dress.", " All this may happen to him yet!\u201d \u201cO, but master is so kind!\u201d \u201cYes, but who knows?--he may die--and then he may be sold to nobody knows who. What pleasure is it that he is handsome, and smart, and bright? I tell you, Eliza, that a sword will pierce through your soul for every good and pleasant thing your child is or has; it will make him worth too much for you to keep.\u201d The words smote heavily on Eliza\u2019s heart; the vision of the trader came before her eyes, and, as if some one had struck her a deadly blow, she turned pale and gasped for breath. She looked nervously out on the verandah, where the boy, tired of the grave conversation, had retired, and where he was riding triumphantly up and down on Mr. Shelby\u2019s walking-stick. She would have spoken to tell her husband her fears, but checked herself. \u201cNo, no,--he has enough to bear, poor fellow!\u201d she thought. \u201cNo, I won\u2019t tell him; besides, it an\u2019t true; Missis never deceives us.\u201d \u201cSo, Eliza, my girl,\u201d said the husband, mournfully, \u201cbear up, now; and good-by, for I\u2019m going.\u201d \u201cGoing, George! Going where?\u201d \u201cTo Canada,\u201d said he, straightening himself up; \u201cand when I\u2019m there, I\u2019ll buy you; that\u2019s all the hope that\u2019s left us. You have a kind master, that won\u2019t refuse to sell you.

A few minutes brought them to the window of Uncle Tom\u2019s cottage, and Eliza stopping, tapped lightly on the window-pane. The prayer-meeting at Uncle Tom\u2019s had, in the order of hymn-singing, been protracted to a very late hour; and, as Uncle Tom had indulged himself in a few lengthy solos afterwards, the consequence was, that, although it was now between twelve and one o\u2019clock, he and his worthy helpmeet were not yet asleep. \u201cGood Lord! what\u2019s that?\u201d said Aunt Chloe, starting up and hastily drawing the curtain. \u201cMy sakes alive, if it an\u2019t Lizy! Get on your clothes, old man, quick!--there\u2019s old Bruno, too, a pawin round; what on airth! I\u2019m gwine to open the door.\u201d And suiting the action to the word, the door flew open, and the light of the tallow candle, which Tom had hastily lighted, fell on the haggard face and dark, wild eyes of the fugitive. \u201cLord bless you!--I\u2019m skeered to look at ye, Lizy! Are ye tuck sick, or what\u2019s come over ye?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m running away--Uncle Tom and Aunt Chloe--carrying off my child--Master sold him!\u201d \u201cSold him?\u201d echoed both, lifting up their hands in dismay. \u201cYes, sold him!\u201d said Eliza, firmly; \u201cI crept into the closet by Mistress\u2019 door tonight, and I heard Master tell Missis that he had sold my Harry, and you, Uncle Tom, both, to a trader; and that he was going off this morning on his horse, and that the man was to take possession today.\u201d Tom had stood, during this speech, with his hands raised, and his eyes dilated, like a man in a dream.", " Now, what\u2019s your name?\u201d \u201cMy name\u2019s Tom; the little chil\u2019en used to call me Uncle Tom, way back thar in Kentuck.\u201d \u201cThen I mean to call you Uncle Tom, because, you see, I like you,\u201d said Eva. \u201cSo, Uncle Tom, where are you going?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, Miss Eva.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t know?\u201d said Eva. \u201cNo, I am going to be sold to somebody.

I mean to ask him, this very day.\u201d \u201cThank you, my little lady,\u201d said Tom. The boat here stopped at a small landing to take in wood, and Eva, hearing her father\u2019s voice, bounded nimbly away. Tom rose up, and went forward to offer his service in wooding, and soon was busy among the hands. Eva and her father were standing together by the railings to see the boat start from the landing-place, the wheel had made two or three revolutions in the water, when, by some sudden movement, the little one suddenly lost her balance and fell sheer over the side of the boat into the water. Her father, scarce knowing what he did, was plunging in after her, but was held back by some behind him, who saw that more efficient aid had followed his child. Tom was standing just under her on the lower deck, as she fell. He saw her strike the water, and sink, and was after her in a moment. A broad-chested, strong-armed fellow, it was nothing for him to keep afloat in the water, till, in a moment or two the child rose to the surface, and he caught her in his arms, and, swimming with her to the boat-side, handed her up, all dripping, to the grasp of hundreds of hands, which, as if they had all belonged to one man, were stretched eagerly out to receive her.", " It won\u2019t help me any, to anger him.\u201d \u201cWell, I won\u2019t, then, for your sake; but only to think of it--isn\u2019t it a shame?

It was late in the summer afternoon, and the doors and windows of the large parlor all stood open, to invite any stray breeze, that might feel in a good humor, to enter. Mr. Shelby sat in a large hall opening into the room, and running through the whole length of the house, to a balcony on either end. Leisurely tipped back on one chair, with his heels in another, he was enjoying his after-dinner cigar. Mrs. Shelby sat in the door, busy about some fine sewing; she seemed like one who had something on her mind, which she was seeking an opportunity to introduce. \u201cDo you know,\u201d she said, \u201cthat Chloe has had a letter from Tom?\u201d \u201cAh! has she? Tom \u2019s got some friend there, it seems. How is the old boy?\u201d \u201cHe has been bought by a very fine family, I should think,\u201d said Mrs. Shelby,--\u201cis kindly treated, and has not much to do.\u201d \u201cAh! well, I\u2019m glad of it,--very glad,\u201d said Mr. Shelby, heartily. \u201cTom, I suppose, will get reconciled to a Southern residence;--hardly want to come up here again.\u201d \u201cOn the contrary he inquires very anxiously,\u201d said Mrs. Shelby, \u201cwhen the money for his redemption is to be raised.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure _I_ don\u2019t know,\u201d said Mr. Shelby. \u201cOnce get business running wrong, there does seem to be no end to it.", " \u201cIt will have to come out,\u201d said he, mentally; \u201cas well now as ever.\u201d \u201cI told Eliza,\u201d said Mrs. Shelby, as she continued brushing her hair, \u201cthat she was a little fool for her pains, and that you never had anything to do with that sort of persons. Of course, I knew you never meant to sell any of our people,--least of all, to such a fellow.\u201d \u201cWell, Emily,\u201d said her husband, \u201cso I have always felt and said; but the fact is that my business lies so that I cannot get on without. I shall have to sell some of my hands.\u201d \u201cTo that creature? Impossible! Mr. Shelby, you cannot be serious.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say that I am,\u201d said Mr. Shelby. \u201cI\u2019ve agreed to sell Tom.\u201d \u201cWhat! our Tom?--that good, faithful creature!--been your faithful servant from a boy! O, Mr. Shelby!--and you have promised him his freedom, too,--you and I have spoken to him a hundred times of it. Well, I can believe anything now,--I can believe _now_ that you could sell little Harry, poor Eliza\u2019s only child!\u201d said Mrs. Shelby, in a tone between grief and indignation. \u201cWell, since you must know all, it is so. I have agreed to sell Tom and Harry both; and I don\u2019t know why I am to be rated, as if I were a monster, for doing what every one does every day.\u201d \u201cBut why, of all others, choose these?\u201d said Mrs. Shelby. \u201cWhy sell them, of all on the place, if you must sell at all?\u201d \u201cBecause they will bring the highest sum of any,--that\u2019s why.", " His conversation was in free and easy defiance of Murray\u2019s Grammar,* and was garnished at convenient intervals with various profane expressions, which not even the desire to be graphic in our account shall induce us to transcribe. * English Grammar (1795), by Lindley Murray (1745-1826), the most authoritative American grammarian of his day. His companion, Mr. Shelby, had the appearance of a gentleman; and the arrangements of the house, and the general air of the housekeeping, indicated easy, and even opulent circumstances. As we before stated, the two were in the midst of an earnest conversation. \u201cThat is the way I should arrange the matter,\u201d said Mr. Shelby. \u201cI can\u2019t make trade that way--I positively can\u2019t, Mr. Shelby,\u201d said the other, holding up a glass of wine between his eye and the light. \u201cWhy, the fact is, Haley, Tom is an uncommon fellow; he is certainly worth that sum anywhere,--steady, honest, capable, manages my whole farm like a clock.\u201d \u201cYou mean honest, as niggers go,\u201d said Haley, helping himself to a glass of brandy. \u201cNo; I mean, really, Tom is a good, steady, sensible, pious fellow. He got religion at a camp-meeting, four years ago; and I believe he really _did_ get it. I\u2019ve trusted him, since then, with everything I have,--money, house, horses,--and let him come and go round the country; and I always found him true and square in everything.\u201d \u201cSome folks don\u2019t believe there is pious niggers Shelby,\u201d said Haley, with a candid flourish of his hand, \u201cbut _I do_.", " He was lounging in a large easy-chair, looking over some letters that had come in the afternoon mail, and she was standing before her mirror, brushing out the complicated braids and curls in which Eliza had arranged her hair; for, noticing her pale cheeks and haggard eyes, she had excused her attendance that night, and ordered her to bed. The employment, naturally enough, suggested her conversation with the girl in the morning; and turning to her husband, she said, carelessly, \u201cBy the by, Arthur, who was that low-bred fellow that you lugged in to our dinner-table today?\u201d \u201cHaley is his name,\u201d said Shelby, turning himself rather uneasily in his chair, and continuing with his eyes fixed on a letter. \u201cHaley!

To be sure, it says a great many such things; but, then, nobody ever thinks of doing them,--you know, Eva, nobody does.\u201d Eva did not speak; her eyes were fixed and thoughtful for a few moments. \u201cAt any rate,\u201d she said, \u201cdear Cousin, do love poor Dodo, and be kind to him, for my sake!\u201d \u201cI could love anything, for your sake, dear Cousin; for I really think you are the loveliest creature that I ever saw!\u201d And Henrique spoke with an earnestness that flushed his handsome face. Eva received it with perfect simplicity, without even a change of feature; merely saying, \u201cI\u2019m glad you feel so, dear Henrique! I hope you will remember.\u201d The dinner-bell put an end to the interview. CHAPTER XXIV Foreshadowings Two days after this, Alfred St. Clare and Augustine parted; and Eva, who had been stimulated, by the society of her young cousin, to exertions beyond her strength, began to fail rapidly. St. Clare was at last willing to call in medical advice,--a thing from which he had always shrunk, because it was the admission of an unwelcome truth. But, for a day or two, Eva was so unwell as to be confined to the house; and the doctor was called.", " He had heard Miss Ophelia speak often of a cough, that all her medicaments could not cure; and even now that fervent cheek and little hand were burning with hectic fever; and yet the thought that Eva\u2019s words suggested had never come to him till now. Has there ever been a child like Eva? Yes, there have been; but their names are always on grave-stones, and their sweet smiles, their heavenly eyes, their singular words and ways, are among the buried treasures of yearning hearts. In how many families do you hear the legend that all the goodness and graces of the living are nothing to the peculiar charms of one who _is not_. It is as if heaven had an especial band of angels, whose office it was to sojourn for a season here, and endear to them the wayward human heart, that they might bear it upward with them in their homeward flight. When you see that deep, spiritual light in the eye,--when the little soul reveals itself in words sweeter and wiser than the ordinary words of children,--hope not to retain that child; for the seal of heaven is on it, and the light of immortality looks out from its eyes. Even so, beloved Eva! fair star of thy dwelling! Thou art passing away; but they that love thee dearest know it not. The colloquy between Tom and Eva was interrupted by a hasty call from Miss Ophelia. \u201cEva--Eva!--why, child, the dew is falling; you mustn\u2019t be out there!\u201d Eva and Tom hastened in."], "In what statewas Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin written?": [" Some dim ideas of imprudence or impropriety in the measure seemed to embarrass him considerably; for he often stopped, as Eliza glided forward, and looked wistfully, first at her and then at the house, and then, as if reassured by reflection, he pattered along after her again. A few minutes brought them to the window of Uncle Tom\u2019s cottage, and Eliza stopping, tapped lightly on the window-pane. The prayer-meeting at Uncle Tom\u2019s had, in the order of hymn-singing, been protracted to a very late hour; and, as Uncle Tom had indulged himself in a few lengthy solos afterwards, the consequence was, that, although it was now between twelve and one o\u2019clock, he and his worthy helpmeet were not yet asleep. \u201cGood Lord! what\u2019s that?\u201d said Aunt Chloe, starting up and hastily drawing the curtain. \u201cMy sakes alive, if it an\u2019t Lizy! Get on your clothes, old man, quick!--there\u2019s old Bruno, too, a pawin round; what on airth! I\u2019m gwine to open the door.\u201d And suiting the action to the word, the door flew open, and the light of the tallow candle, which Tom had hastily lighted, fell on the haggard face and dark, wild eyes of the fugitive. \u201cLord bless you!--I\u2019m skeered to look at ye, Lizy! Are ye tuck sick, or what\u2019s come over ye?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m running away--Uncle Tom and Aunt Chloe--carrying off my child--Master sold him!\u201d \u201cSold him?\u201d echoed both, lifting up their hands in dismay. \u201cYes, sold him!\u201d said Eliza, firmly; \u201cI crept into the closet by Mistress\u2019 door tonight, and I heard Master tell Missis that he had sold my Harry, and you, Uncle Tom, both, to a trader; and that he was going off this morning on his horse, and that the man was to take possession today.\u201d Tom had stood, during this speech, with his hands raised, and his eyes dilated, like a man in a dream.", " They will kill me, fast enough; they never will get me down the river alive!\u201d \u201cO, George, for my sake, do be careful! Don\u2019t do anything wicked; don\u2019t lay hands on yourself, or anybody else! You are tempted too much--too much; but don\u2019t--go you must--but go carefully, prudently; pray God to help you.\u201d \u201cWell, then, Eliza, hear my plan. Mas\u2019r took it into his head to send me right by here, with a note to Mr. Symmes, that lives a mile past. I believe he expected I should come here to tell you what I have. It would please him, if he thought it would aggravate \u2018Shelby\u2019s folks,\u2019 as he calls \u2019em. I\u2019m going home quite resigned, you understand, as if all was over. I\u2019ve got some preparations made,--and there are those that will help me; and, in the course of a week or so, I shall be among the missing, some day. Pray for me, Eliza; perhaps the good Lord will hear _you_.\u201d \u201cO, pray yourself, George, and go trusting in him; then you won\u2019t do anything wicked.\u201d \u201cWell, now, _good-by_,\u201d said George, holding Eliza\u2019s hands, and gazing into her eyes, without moving. They stood silent; then there were last words, and sobs, and bitter weeping,--such parting as those may make whose hope to meet again is as the spider\u2019s web,--and the husband and wife were parted. CHAPTER IV An Evening in Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin The cabin of Uncle Tom was a small log building, close adjoining to \u201cthe house,\u201d as the negro _par excellence_ designates his master\u2019s dwelling.", " *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK UNCLE TOM\u2019S CABIN *** Produced by Judith Boss, An Anonymous Volunteer and David Widger UNCLE TOM\u2019S CABIN or Life among the Lowly By Harriet Beecher Stowe VOLUME I CHAPTER I In Which the Reader Is Introduced to a Man of Humanity Late in the afternoon of a chilly day in February, two gentlemen were sitting alone over their wine, in a well-furnished dining parlor, in the town of P----, in Kentucky. There were no servants present, and the gentlemen, with chairs closely approaching, seemed to be discussing some subject with great earnestness. For convenience sake, we have said, hitherto, two _gentlemen_. One of the parties, however, when critically examined, did not seem, strictly speaking, to come under the species. He was a short, thick-set man, with coarse, commonplace features, and that swaggering air of pretension which marks a low man who is trying to elbow his way upward in the world. He was much over-dressed, in a gaudy vest of many colors, a blue neckerchief, bedropped gayly with yellow spots, and arranged with a flaunting tie, quite in keeping with the general air of the man. His hands, large and coarse, were plentifully bedecked with rings; and he wore a heavy gold watch-chain, with a bundle of seals of portentous size, and a great variety of colors, attached to it,--which, in the ardor of conversation, he was in the habit of flourishing and jingling with evident satisfaction.", " Now, what\u2019s your name?\u201d \u201cMy name\u2019s Tom; the little chil\u2019en used to call me Uncle Tom, way back thar in Kentuck.\u201d \u201cThen I mean to call you Uncle Tom, because, you see, I like you,\u201d said Eva. \u201cSo, Uncle Tom, where are you going?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, Miss Eva.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t know?\u201d said Eva. \u201cNo, I am going to be sold to somebody. I don\u2019t know who.\u201d \u201cMy papa can buy you,\u201d said Eva, quickly; \u201cand if he buys you, you will have good times. I mean to ask him, this very day.\u201d \u201cThank you, my little lady,\u201d said Tom. The boat here stopped at a small landing to take in wood, and Eva, hearing her father\u2019s voice, bounded nimbly away. Tom rose up, and went forward to offer his service in wooding, and soon was busy among the hands. Eva and her father were standing together by the railings to see the boat start from the landing-place, the wheel had made two or three revolutions in the water, when, by some sudden movement, the little one suddenly lost her balance and fell sheer over the side of the boat into the water. Her father, scarce knowing what he did, was plunging in after her, but was held back by some behind him, who saw that more efficient aid had followed his child. Tom was standing just under her on the lower deck, as she fell. He saw her strike the water, and sink, and was after her in a moment. A broad-chested, strong-armed fellow, it was nothing for him to keep afloat in the water, till, in a moment or two the child rose to the surface, and he caught her in his arms, and, swimming with her to the boat-side, handed her up, all dripping, to the grasp of hundreds of hands, which, as if they had all belonged to one man, were stretched eagerly out to receive her."], "Over what riverdoes Eliza make her miraculous crossing?": [" Only a day and a night on the lake, and then--oh, then!--\u201d \u201cO, Eliza!\u201d said George, drawing her towards him; \u201cthat is it! Now my fate is all narrowing down to a point. To come so near, to be almost in sight, and then lose all. I should never live under it, Eliza.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t fear,\u201d said his wife, hopefully. \u201cThe good Lord would not have brought us so far, if he didn\u2019t mean to carry us through. I seem to feel him with us, George.\u201d \u201cYou are a blessed woman, Eliza!\u201d said George, clasping her with a convulsive grasp. \u201cBut,--oh, tell me! can this great mercy be for us? Will these years and years of misery come to an end?--shall we be free? \u201cI am sure of it, George,\u201d said Eliza, looking upward, while tears of hope and enthusiasm shone on her long, dark lashes. \u201cI feel it in me, that God is going to bring us out of bondage, this very day.\u201d \u201cI will believe you, Eliza,\u201d said George, rising suddenly up, \u201cI will believe,--come let\u2019s be off. Well, indeed,\u201d said he, holding her off at arm\u2019s length, and looking admiringly at her, \u201cyou _are_ a pretty little fellow. That crop of little, short curls, is quite becoming. Put on your cap. So--a little to one side. I never saw you look quite so pretty. But, it\u2019s almost time for the carriage;--I wonder if Mrs. Smyth has got Harry rigged?\u201d The door opened, and a respectable, middle-aged woman entered, leading little Harry, dressed in girl\u2019s clothes. \u201cWhat a pretty girl he makes,\u201d said Eliza, turning him round.", " She would gladly have stopped at the door to listen, as she came out; but her mistress just then calling, she was obliged to hasten away. Still she thought she heard the trader make an offer for her boy;--could she be mistaken? Her heart swelled and throbbed, and she involuntarily strained him so tight that the little fellow looked up into her face in astonishment. \u201cEliza, girl, what ails you today?\u201d said her mistress, when Eliza had upset the wash-pitcher, knocked down the workstand, and finally was abstractedly offering her mistress a long nightgown in place of the silk dress she had ordered her to bring from the wardrobe. Eliza started. \u201cO, missis!\u201d she said, raising her eyes; then, bursting into tears, she sat down in a chair, and began sobbing. \u201cWhy, Eliza child, what ails you?\u201d said her mistress. \u201cO! missis, missis,\u201d said Eliza, \u201cthere\u2019s been a trader talking with master in the parlor! I heard him.\u201d \u201cWell, silly child, suppose there has.\u201d \u201cO, missis, _do_ you suppose mas\u2019r would sell my Harry?\u201d And the poor creature threw herself into a chair, and sobbed convulsively. \u201cSell him! No, you foolish girl! You know your master never deals with those southern traders, and never means to sell any of his servants, as long as they behave well. Why, you silly child, who do you think would want to buy your Harry? Do you think all the world are set on him as you are, you goosie? Come, cheer up, and hook my dress.", " All this may happen to him yet!\u201d \u201cO, but master is so kind!\u201d \u201cYes, but who knows?--he may die--and then he may be sold to nobody knows who. What pleasure is it that he is handsome, and smart, and bright? I tell you, Eliza, that a sword will pierce through your soul for every good and pleasant thing your child is or has; it will make him worth too much for you to keep.\u201d The words smote heavily on Eliza\u2019s heart; the vision of the trader came before her eyes, and, as if some one had struck her a deadly blow, she turned pale and gasped for breath. She looked nervously out on the verandah, where the boy, tired of the grave conversation, had retired, and where he was riding triumphantly up and down on Mr. Shelby\u2019s walking-stick. She would have spoken to tell her husband her fears, but checked herself. \u201cNo, no,--he has enough to bear, poor fellow!\u201d she thought. \u201cNo, I won\u2019t tell him; besides, it an\u2019t true; Missis never deceives us.\u201d \u201cSo, Eliza, my girl,\u201d said the husband, mournfully, \u201cbear up, now; and good-by, for I\u2019m going.\u201d \u201cGoing, George! Going where?\u201d \u201cTo Canada,\u201d said he, straightening himself up; \u201cand when I\u2019m there, I\u2019ll buy you; that\u2019s all the hope that\u2019s left us. You have a kind master, that won\u2019t refuse to sell you. I\u2019ll buy you and the boy;--God helping me, I will!\u201d \u201cO, dreadful! if you should be taken?\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t be taken, Eliza; I\u2019ll _die_ first! I\u2019ll be free, or I\u2019ll die!\u201d \u201cYou won\u2019t kill yourself!\u201d \u201cNo need of that.", " \u201cWe call him Harriet, you see;--don\u2019t the name come nicely?\u201d The child stood gravely regarding his mother in her new and strange attire, observing a profound silence, and occasionally drawing deep sighs, and peeping at her from under his dark curls. \u201cDoes Harry know mamma?\u201d said Eliza, stretching her hands toward him. The child clung shyly to the woman. \u201cCome Eliza, why do you try to coax him, when you know that he has got to be kept away from you?\u201d \u201cI know it\u2019s foolish,\u201d said Eliza; \u201cyet, I can\u2019t bear to have him turn away from me. But come,--where\u2019s my cloak? Here,--how is it men put on cloaks, George?\u201d \u201cYou must wear it so,\u201d said her husband, throwing it over his shoulders. \u201cSo, then,\u201d said Eliza, imitating the motion,--\u201cand I must stamp, and take long steps, and try to look saucy.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t exert yourself,\u201d said George. \u201cThere is, now and then, a modest young man; and I think it would be easier for you to act that character.\u201d \u201cAnd these gloves! mercy upon us!\u201d said Eliza; \u201cwhy, my hands are lost in them.\u201d \u201cI advise you to keep them on pretty strictly,\u201d said George. \u201cYour slender paw might bring us all out. Now, Mrs. Smyth, you are to go under our charge, and be our aunty,--you mind.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve heard,\u201d said Mrs. Smyth, \u201cthat there have been men down, warning all the packet captains against a man and woman, with a little boy.\u201d \u201cThey have!\u201d said George. \u201cWell, if we see any such people, we can tell them.\u201d A hack now drove to the door, and the friendly family who had received the fugitives crowded around them with farewell greetings."], "Who inheritsownership of Tom when St. Clare dies?": [" \u201cNo, no, Mas\u2019r! \u2019tan\u2019t that,--it\u2019s bein\u2019 a _freeman!_ that\u2019s what I\u2019m joyin\u2019 for.\u201d \u201cWhy, Tom, don\u2019t you think, for your own part, you\u2019ve been better off than to be free?\u201d \u201c_No, indeed_, Mas\u2019r St. Clare,\u201d said Tom, with a flash of energy. \u201cNo, indeed!\u201d \u201cWhy, Tom, you couldn\u2019t possibly have earned, by your work, such clothes and such living as I have given you.\u201d \u201cKnows all that, Mas\u2019r St. Clare; Mas\u2019r\u2019s been too good; but, Mas\u2019r, I\u2019d rather have poor clothes, poor house, poor everything, and have \u2019em _mine_, than have the best, and have \u2019em any man\u2019s else,--I had _so_, Mas\u2019r; I think it\u2019s natur, Mas\u2019r.\u201d \u201cI suppose so, Tom, and you\u2019ll be going off and leaving me, in a month or so,\u201d he added, rather discontentedly. \u201cThough why you shouldn\u2019t, no mortal knows,\u201d he said, in a gayer tone; and, getting up, he began to walk the floor. \u201cNot while Mas\u2019r is in trouble,\u201d said Tom. \u201cI\u2019ll stay with Mas\u2019r as long as he wants me,--so as I can be any use.\u201d \u201cNot while I\u2019m in trouble, Tom?\u201d said St. Clare, looking sadly out of the window. . . . \u201cAnd when will _my_ trouble be over?\u201d \u201cWhen Mas\u2019r St. Clare\u2019s a Christian,\u201d said Tom. \u201cAnd you really mean to stay by till that day comes?\u201d said St. Clare, half smiling, as he turned from the window, and laid his hand on Tom\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAh, Tom, you soft, silly boy! I won\u2019t keep you till that day. Go home to your wife and children, and give my love to all.\u201d \u201cI \u2019s faith to believe that day will come,\u201d said Tom, earnestly, and with tears in his eyes; \u201cthe Lord has a work for Mas\u2019r.\u201d \u201cA work, hey?\u201d said St. Clare, \u201cwell, now, Tom, give me your views on what sort of a work it is;--let\u2019s hear.\u201d \u201cWhy, even a poor fellow like me has a work from the Lord; and Mas\u2019r St. Clare, that has larnin, and riches, and friends,--how much he might do for the Lord!\u201d \u201cTom, you seem to think the Lord needs a great deal done for him,\u201d said St. Clare, smiling.", " \u201cTom,\u201d he said, \u201cthese folks that get such hard measure seem to have been doing just what I have,--living good, easy, respectable lives; and not troubling themselves to inquire how many of their brethren were hungry or athirst, or sick, or in prison.\u201d Tom did not answer. St. Clare rose up and walked thoughtfully up and down the verandah, seeming to forget everything in his own thoughts; so absorbed was he, that Tom had to remind him twice that the teabell had rung, before he could get his attention. St. Clare was absent and thoughtful, all tea-time. After tea, he and Marie and Miss Ophelia took possession of the parlor almost in silence. Marie disposed herself on a lounge, under a silken mosquito curtain, and was soon sound asleep. Miss Ophelia silently busied herself with her knitting. St. Clare sat down to the piano, and began playing a soft and melancholy movement with the \u00c6olian accompaniment. He seemed in a deep reverie, and to be soliloquizing to himself by music. After a little, he opened one of the drawers, took out an old music-book whose leaves were yellow with age, and began turning it over. \u201cThere,\u201d he said to Miss Ophelia, \u201cthis was one of my mother\u2019s books,--and here is her handwriting,--come and look at it. She copied and arranged this from Mozart\u2019s Requiem.\u201d Miss Ophelia came accordingly. \u201cIt was something she used to sing often,\u201d said St. Clare. \u201cI think I can hear her now.\u201d He struck a few majestic chords, and began singing that grand old Latin piece, the \u201cDies Ir\u00e6.\u201d Tom, who was listening in the outer verandah, was drawn by the sound to the very door, where he stood earnestly.", " Tom and Adolph assisted to get him composed for the night, the latter in high spirits, evidently regarding the matter as a good joke, and laughing heartily at the rusticity of Tom\u2019s horror, who really was simple enough to lie awake most of the rest of the night, praying for his young master. \u201cWell, Tom, what are you waiting for?\u201d said St. Clare, the next day, as he sat in his library, in dressing-gown and slippers. St. Clare had just been entrusting Tom with some money, and various commissions. \u201cIsn\u2019t all right there, Tom?\u201d he added, as Tom still stood waiting. \u201cI\u2019m \u2019fraid not, Mas\u2019r,\u201d said Tom, with a grave face. St. Clare laid down his paper, and set down his coffee-cup, and looked at Tom. \u201cWhy Tom, what\u2019s the case? You look as solemn as a coffin.\u201d \u201cI feel very bad, Mas\u2019r. I allays have thought that Mas\u2019r would be good to everybody.\u201d \u201cWell, Tom, haven\u2019t I been? Come, now, what do you want? There\u2019s something you haven\u2019t got, I suppose, and this is the preface.\u201d \u201cMas\u2019r allays been good to me. I haven\u2019t nothing to complain of on that head. But there is one that Mas\u2019r isn\u2019t good to.\u201d \u201cWhy, Tom, what\u2019s got into you? Speak out; what do you mean?\u201d \u201cLast night, between one and two, I thought so. I studied upon the matter then. Mas\u2019r isn\u2019t good to _himself_.\u201d Tom said this with his back to his master, and his hand on the door-knob. St. Clare felt his face flush crimson, but he laughed.", " He entered softly. St. Clare lay on his lounge, at the further end of the room. He was lying on his face, with Eva\u2019s Bible open before him, at a little distance. Tom walked up, and stood by the sofa. He hesitated; and, while he was hesitating, St. Clare suddenly raised himself up. The honest face, so full of grief, and with such an imploring expression of affection and sympathy, struck his master. He laid his hand on Tom\u2019s, and bowed down his forehead on it. \u201cO, Tom, my boy, the whole world is as empty as an egg-shell.\u201d \u201cI know it, Mas\u2019r,--I know it,\u201d said Tom; \u201cbut, oh, if Mas\u2019r could only look up,--up where our dear Miss Eva is,--up to the dear Lord Jesus!\u201d \u201cAh, Tom! I do look up; but the trouble is, I don\u2019t see anything, when I do, I wish I could.\u201d Tom sighed heavily. \u201cIt seems to be given to children, and poor, honest fellows, like you, to see what we can\u2019t,\u201d said St. Clare. \u201cHow comes it?\u201d \u201cThou has \u2019hid from the wise and prudent, and revealed unto babes,\u2019\u201d murmured Tom; \u201c\u2018even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.\u2019\u201d \u201cTom, I don\u2019t believe,--I can\u2019t believe,--I\u2019ve got the habit of doubting,\u201d said St. Clare. \u201cI want to believe this Bible,--and I can\u2019t.\u201d \u201cDear Mas\u2019r, pray to the good Lord,--\u2018Lord, I believe; help thou my unbelief.\u2019\u201d \u201cWho knows anything about anything?\u201d said St. Clare, his eyes wandering dreamily, and speaking to himself. \u201cWas all that beautiful love and faith only one of the ever-shifting phases of human feeling, having nothing real to rest on, passing away with the little breath?"], "How does St.Clare die?": [" That\u2019s the only way. If I wasn\u2019t such a poor, feeble piece, I believe I should manage with twice the energy that St. Clare does.\u201d \u201cAnd how does St. Clare contrive to manage?\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cYou say he never strikes a blow.\u201d \u201cWell, men have a more commanding way, you know; it is easier for them; besides, if you ever looked full in his eye, it\u2019s peculiar,--that eye,--and if he speaks decidedly, there\u2019s a kind of flash. I\u2019m afraid of it, myself; and the servants know they must mind. I couldn\u2019t do as much by a regular storm and scolding as St. Clare can by one turn of his eye, if once he is in earnest. O, there\u2019s no trouble about St. Clare; that\u2019s the reason he\u2019s no more feeling for me. But you\u2019ll find, when you come to manage, that there\u2019s no getting along without severity,--they are so bad, so deceitful, so lazy.\u201d \u201cThe old tune,\u201d said St. Clare, sauntering in. \u201cWhat an awful account these wicked creatures will have to settle, at last, especially for being lazy! You see, cousin,\u201d said he, as he stretched himself at full length on a lounge opposite to Marie, \u201cit\u2019s wholly inexcusable in them, in the light of the example that Marie and I set them,--this laziness.\u201d \u201cCome, now, St. Clare, you are too bad!\u201d said Marie. \u201cAm I, now? Why, I thought I was talking good, quite remarkably for me. I try to enforce your remarks, Marie, always.\u201d \u201cYou know you meant no such thing, St. Clare,\u201d said Marie.", " St. Clare could say but little; he lay with his eyes shut, but it was evident that he wrestled with bitter thoughts. After a while, he laid his hand on Tom\u2019s, who was kneeling beside him, and said, \u201cTom! poor fellow!\u201d \u201cWhat, Mas\u2019r?\u201d said Tom, earnestly. \u201cI am dying!\u201d said St. Clare, pressing his hand; \u201cpray!\u201d \u201cIf you would like a clergyman--\u201d said the physician. St. Clare hastily shook his head, and said again to Tom, more earnestly, \u201cPray!\u201d And Tom did pray, with all his mind and strength, for the soul that was passing,--the soul that seemed looking so steadily and mournfully from those large, melancholy blue eyes. It was literally prayer offered with strong crying and tears. When Tom ceased to speak, St. Clare reached out and took his hand, looking earnestly at him, but saying nothing. He closed his eyes, but still retained his hold; for, in the gates of eternity, the black hand and the white hold each other with an equal clasp. He murmured softly to himself, at broken intervals, \u201cRecordare Jesu pie-- * * * * Ne me perdas--illa die Qu\u00e6rens me--sedisti lassus.\u201d It was evident that the words he had been singing that evening were passing through his mind,--words of entreaty addressed to Infinite Pity. His lips moved at intervals, as parts of the hymn fell brokenly from them. \u201cHis mind is wandering,\u201d said the doctor. \u201cNo! it is coming HOME, at last!\u201d said St. Clare, energetically; \u201cat last!", " \u201cNo, no, Mas\u2019r! \u2019tan\u2019t that,--it\u2019s bein\u2019 a _freeman!_ that\u2019s what I\u2019m joyin\u2019 for.\u201d \u201cWhy, Tom, don\u2019t you think, for your own part, you\u2019ve been better off than to be free?\u201d \u201c_No, indeed_, Mas\u2019r St. Clare,\u201d said Tom, with a flash of energy. \u201cNo, indeed!\u201d \u201cWhy, Tom, you couldn\u2019t possibly have earned, by your work, such clothes and such living as I have given you.\u201d \u201cKnows all that, Mas\u2019r St. Clare; Mas\u2019r\u2019s been too good; but, Mas\u2019r, I\u2019d rather have poor clothes, poor house, poor everything, and have \u2019em _mine_, than have the best, and have \u2019em any man\u2019s else,--I had _so_, Mas\u2019r; I think it\u2019s natur, Mas\u2019r.\u201d \u201cI suppose so, Tom, and you\u2019ll be going off and leaving me, in a month or so,\u201d he added, rather discontentedly. \u201cThough why you shouldn\u2019t, no mortal knows,\u201d he said, in a gayer tone; and, getting up, he began to walk the floor. \u201cNot while Mas\u2019r is in trouble,\u201d said Tom. \u201cI\u2019ll stay with Mas\u2019r as long as he wants me,--so as I can be any use.\u201d \u201cNot while I\u2019m in trouble, Tom?\u201d said St. Clare, looking sadly out of the window. . . . \u201cAnd when will _my_ trouble be over?\u201d \u201cWhen Mas\u2019r St. Clare\u2019s a Christian,\u201d said Tom. \u201cAnd you really mean to stay by till that day comes?\u201d said St. Clare, half smiling, as he turned from the window, and laid his hand on Tom\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAh, Tom, you soft, silly boy! I won\u2019t keep you till that day. Go home to your wife and children, and give my love to all.\u201d \u201cI \u2019s faith to believe that day will come,\u201d said Tom, earnestly, and with tears in his eyes; \u201cthe Lord has a work for Mas\u2019r.\u201d \u201cA work, hey?\u201d said St. Clare, \u201cwell, now, Tom, give me your views on what sort of a work it is;--let\u2019s hear.\u201d \u201cWhy, even a poor fellow like me has a work from the Lord; and Mas\u2019r St. Clare, that has larnin, and riches, and friends,--how much he might do for the Lord!\u201d \u201cTom, you seem to think the Lord needs a great deal done for him,\u201d said St. Clare, smiling.", " Go right and take it back this moment!\u201d Eva looked downcast and aggrieved, and turned slowly. \u201cI say, Marie, let the child alone; she shall do as she pleases,\u201d said St. Clare. \u201cSt. Clare, how will she ever get along in the world?\u201d said Marie. \u201cThe Lord knows,\u201d said St. Clare, \u201cbut she\u2019ll get along in heaven better than you or I.\u201d \u201cO, papa, don\u2019t,\u201d said Eva, softly touching his elbow; \u201cit troubles mother.\u201d \u201cWell, cousin, are you ready to go to meeting?\u201d said Miss Ophelia, turning square about on St. Clare. \u201cI\u2019m not going, thank you.\u201d \u201cI do wish St. Clare ever would go to church,\u201d said Marie; \u201cbut he hasn\u2019t a particle of religion about him. It really isn\u2019t respectable.\u201d \u201cI know it,\u201d said St. Clare. \u201cYou ladies go to church to learn how to get along in the world, I suppose, and your piety sheds respectability on us. If I did go at all, I would go where Mammy goes; there\u2019s something to keep a fellow awake there, at least.\u201d \u201cWhat! those shouting Methodists? Horrible!\u201d said Marie. \u201cAnything but the dead sea of your respectable churches, Marie. Positively, it\u2019s too much to ask of a man. Eva, do you like to go? Come, stay at home and play with me.\u201d \u201cThank you, papa; but I\u2019d rather go to church.\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t it dreadful tiresome?\u201d said St. Clare. \u201cI think it is tiresome, some,\u201d said Eva, \u201cand I am sleepy, too, but I try to keep awake.\u201d \u201cWhat do you go for, then?\u201d \u201cWhy, you know, papa,\u201d she said, in a whisper, \u201ccousin told me that God wants to have us; and he gives us everything, you know; and it isn\u2019t much to do it, if he wants us to."], "Who saves Evafrom drowning?": [" No, I _won\u2019t_!\u201d he said, clenching his hand with a fierce frown. Eliza trembled, and was silent. She had never seen her husband in this mood before; and her gentle system of ethics seemed to bend like a reed in the surges of such passions. \u201cYou know poor little Carlo, that you gave me,\u201d added George; \u201cthe creature has been about all the comfort that I\u2019ve had. He has slept with me nights, and followed me around days, and kind o\u2019 looked at me as if he understood how I felt. Well, the other day I was just feeding him with a few old scraps I picked up by the kitchen door, and Mas\u2019r came along, and said I was feeding him up at his expense, and that he couldn\u2019t afford to have every nigger keeping his dog, and ordered me to tie a stone to his neck and throw him in the pond.\u201d \u201cO, George, you didn\u2019t do it!\u201d \u201cDo it? not I!--but he did. Mas\u2019r and Tom pelted the poor drowning creature with stones. Poor thing! he looked at me so mournful, as if he wondered why I didn\u2019t save him. I had to take a flogging because I wouldn\u2019t do it myself. I don\u2019t care. Mas\u2019r will find out that I\u2019m one that whipping won\u2019t tame. My day will come yet, if he don\u2019t look out.\u201d \u201cWhat are you going to do? O, George, don\u2019t do anything wicked; if you only trust in God, and try to do right, he\u2019ll deliver you.\u201d \u201cI an\u2019t a Christian like you, Eliza; my heart\u2019s full of bitterness; I can\u2019t trust in God. Why does he let things be so?\u201d \u201cO, George, we must have faith.", " Tom had with him quite a sizable trunk full of clothing, as had most others of them. They were ushered, for the night, into a long room, where many other men, of all ages, sizes, and shades of complexion, were assembled, and from which roars of laughter and unthinking merriment were proceeding. \u201cAh, ha! that\u2019s right. Go it, boys,--go it!\u201d said Mr. Skeggs, the keeper. \u201cMy people are always so merry! Sambo, I see!\u201d he said, speaking approvingly to a burly negro who was performing tricks of low buffoonery, which occasioned the shouts which Tom had heard. As might be imagined, Tom was in no humor to join these proceedings; and, therefore, setting his trunk as far as possible from the noisy group, he sat down on it, and leaned his face against the wall. The dealers in the human article make scrupulous and systematic efforts to promote noisy mirth among them, as a means of drowning reflection, and rendering them insensible to their condition. The whole object of the training to which the negro is put, from the time he is sold in the northern market till he arrives south, is systematically directed towards making him callous, unthinking, and brutal. The slave-dealer collects his gang in Virginia or Kentucky, and drives them to some convenient, healthy place,--often a watering place,--to be fattened. Here they are fed full daily; and, because some incline to pine, a fiddle is kept commonly going among them, and they are made to dance daily; and he who refuses to be merry--in whose soul thoughts of wife, or child, or home, are too strong for him to be gay--is marked as sullen and dangerous, and subjected to all the evils which the ill will of an utterly irresponsible and hardened man can inflict upon him."], "In what stateis Legree\u2019s plantation located?": [" Legree had trained them in savageness and brutality as systematically as he had his bull-dogs; and, by long practice in hardness and cruelty, brought their whole nature to about the same range of capacities. It is a common remark, and one that is thought to militate strongly against the character of the race, that the negro overseer is always more tyrannical and cruel than the white one. This is simply saying that the negro mind has been more crushed and debased than the white. It is no more true of this race than of every oppressed race, the world over. The slave is always a tyrant, if he can get a chance to be one. Legree, like some potentates we read of in history, governed his plantation by a sort of resolution of forces. Sambo and Quimbo cordially hated each other; the plantation hands, one and all, cordially hated them; and, by playing off one against another, he was pretty sure, through one or the other of the three parties, to get informed of whatever was on foot in the place. Nobody can live entirely without social intercourse; and Legree encouraged his two black satellites to a kind of coarse familiarity with him,--a familiarity, however, at any moment liable to get one or the other of them into trouble; for, on the slightest provocation, one of them always stood ready, at a nod, to be a minister of his vengeance on the other. As they stood there now by Legree, they seemed an apt illustration of the fact that brutal men are lower even than animals.", " The outrageous treatment of poor Tom had roused her still more; and she had followed Legree to the house, with no particular intention, but to upbraid him for his brutality. \u201cI wish, Cassy,\u201d said Legree, \u201cyou\u2019d behave yourself decently.\u201d \u201c_You_ talk about behaving decently! And what have you been doing?--you, who haven\u2019t even sense enough to keep from spoiling one of your best hands, right in the most pressing season, just for your devilish temper!\u201d \u201cI was a fool, it\u2019s a fact, to let any such brangle come up,\u201d said Legree; \u201cbut, when the boy set up his will, he had to be broke in.\u201d \u201cI reckon you won\u2019t break _him_ in!\u201d \u201cWon\u2019t I?\u201d said Legree, rising, passionately. \u201cI\u2019d like to know if I won\u2019t? He\u2019ll be the first nigger that ever came it round me! I\u2019ll break every bone in his body, but he _shall_ give up!\u201d Just then the door opened, and Sambo entered. He came forward, bowing, and holding out something in a paper. \u201cWhat\u2019s that, you dog?\u201d said Legree. \u201cIt\u2019s a witch thing, Mas\u2019r!\u201d \u201cA what?\u201d \u201cSomething that niggers gets from witches. Keeps \u2019em from feelin\u2019 when they \u2019s flogged. He had it tied round his neck, with a black string.\u201d Legree, like most godless and cruel men, was superstitious. He took the paper, and opened it uneasily. There dropped out of it a silver dollar, and a long, shining curl of fair hair,--hair which, like a living thing, twined itself round Legree\u2019s fingers. \u201cDamnation!\u201d he screamed, in sudden passion, stamping on the floor, and pulling furiously at the hair, as if it burned him.", " And O, there\u2019s all ETERNITY to come, after that!\u201d ETERNITY,--the word thrilled through the black man\u2019s soul with light and power, as he spoke; it thrilled through the sinner\u2019s soul, too, like the bite of a scorpion. Legree gnashed on him with his teeth, but rage kept him silent; and Tom, like a man disenthralled, spoke, in a clear and cheerful voice, \u201cMas\u2019r Legree, as ye bought me, I\u2019ll be a true and faithful servant to ye. I\u2019ll give ye all the work of my hands, all my time, all my strength; but my soul I won\u2019t give up to mortal man. I will hold on to the Lord, and put his commands before all,--die or live; you may be sure on \u2019t. Mas\u2019r Legree, I ain\u2019t a grain afeard to die. I\u2019d as soon die as not. Ye may whip me, starve me, burn me,--it\u2019ll only send me sooner where I want to go.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll make ye give out, though, \u2019fore I\u2019ve done!\u201d said Legree, in a rage. \u201cI shall have _help_,\u201d said Tom; \u201cyou\u2019ll never do it.\u201d \u201cWho the devil\u2019s going to help you?\u201d said Legree, scornfully. \u201cThe Lord Almighty,\u201d said Tom. \u201cD--n you!\u201d said Legree, as with one blow of his fist he felled Tom to the earth. A cold soft hand fell on Legree\u2019s at this moment. He turned,--it was Cassy\u2019s; but the cold soft touch recalled his dream of the night before, and, flashing through the chambers of his brain, came all the fearful images of the night-watches, with a portion of the horror that accompanied them. \u201cWill you be a fool?\u201d said Cassy, in French.", " \u201cI\u2019ll have this yer thing examined. I\u2019ll look into it, this very night. I\u2019ll take my pistols--\u201d \u201cDo,\u201d said Cassy; \u201csleep in that room. I\u2019d like to see you doing it. Fire your pistols,--do!\u201d Legree stamped his foot, and swore violently. \u201cDon\u2019t swear,\u201d said Cassy; \u201cnobody knows who may be hearing you. Hark! What was that?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d said Legree, starting. A heavy old Dutch clock, that stood in the corner of the room, began, and slowly struck twelve. For some reason or other, Legree neither spoke nor moved; a vague horror fell on him; while Cassy, with a keen, sneering glitter in her eyes, stood looking at him, counting the strokes. \u201cTwelve o\u2019clock; well _now_ we\u2019ll see,\u201d said she, turning, and opening the door into the passage-way, and standing as if listening. \u201cHark! What\u2019s that?\u201d said she, raising her finger. \u201cIt\u2019s only the wind,\u201d said Legree. \u201cDon\u2019t you hear how cursedly it blows?\u201d \u201cSimon, come here,\u201d said Cassy, in a whisper, laying her hand on his, and leading him to the foot of the stairs: \u201cdo you know what _that_ is? Hark!\u201d A wild shriek came pealing down the stairway. It came from the garret. Legree\u2019s knees knocked together; his face grew white with fear. \u201cHadn\u2019t you better get your pistols?\u201d said Cassy, with a sneer that froze Legree\u2019s blood. \u201cIt\u2019s time this thing was looked into, you know. I\u2019d like to have you go up now; _they\u2019re at it_.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t go!\u201d said Legree, with an oath."], "Who heals Loker?": [" \u201cEdwards--Dick and Lucy--man and wife, six hundred dollars; wench Polly and two children--six hundred for her or her head. \u201cI\u2019m jest a runnin\u2019 over our business, to see if we can take up this yer handily.

An\u2019t it beautiful?\u201d Tom, whose great heavy mouth had stood ajar during this communication, now suddenly snapped it together, as a big dog closes on a piece of meat, and seemed to be digesting the idea at his leisure.", " Suppose you want to lie by a day or two, till the gal \u2019s been carried on the underground line up to Sandusky or so, before you start.\u201d \u201cO, no; I an\u2019t a grain afraid,\u201d said Marks, \u201conly--\u201d \u201cOnly what?\u201d said Tom. \u201cWell, about the boat.

If you or Shelby wants to chase us, look where the partridges was last year; if you find them or us, you\u2019re quite welcome.\u201d \u201cO, wal, certainly, jest let it go at that,\u201d said Haley, alarmed; \u201cyou catch the boy for the job;--you allers did trade _far_ with me, Tom, and was up to yer word.\u201d \u201cYe know that,\u201d said Tom; \u201cI don\u2019t pretend none of your snivelling ways, but I won\u2019t lie in my \u2019counts with the devil himself. What I ses I\u2019ll do, I will do,--you know _that_, Dan Haley.\u201d \u201cJes so, jes so,--I said so, Tom,\u201d said Haley; \u201cand if you\u2019d only promise to have the boy for me in a week, at any point you\u2019ll name, that\u2019s all I want.\u201d \u201cBut it an\u2019t all I want, by a long jump,\u201d said Tom."], "What term describesCassy\u2019s racial heritage?": [" Tom and Eva both started. \u201cWhat\u2019s here?\u201d said St. Clare, coming up and looking at the slate. \u201cO, it\u2019s Tom\u2019s letter. I\u2019m helping him to write it,\u201d said Eva; \u201cisn\u2019t it nice?\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t discourage either of you,\u201d said St. Clare, \u201cbut I rather think, Tom, you\u2019d better get me to write your letter for you. I\u2019ll do it, when I come home from my ride.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very important he should write,\u201d said Eva, \u201cbecause his mistress is going to send down money to redeem him, you know, papa; he told me they told him so.\u201d St. Clare thought, in his heart, that this was probably only one of those things which good-natured owners say to their servants, to alleviate their horror of being sold, without any intention of fulfilling the expectation thus excited. But he did not make any audible comment upon it,--only ordered Tom to get the horses out for a ride. Tom\u2019s letter was written in due form for him that evening, and safely lodged in the post-office. Miss Ophelia still persevered in her labors in the housekeeping line. It was universally agreed, among all the household, from Dinah down to the youngest urchin, that Miss Ophelia was decidedly \u201ccuris,\u201d--a term by which a southern servant implies that his or her betters don\u2019t exactly suit them. The higher circle in the family--to wit, Adolph, Jane and Rosa--agreed that she was no lady; ladies never keep working about as she did,--that she had no _air_ at all; and they were surprised that she should be any relation of the St. Clares.", " But I have considered, and counted the cost. I go to _Liberia_, not as an Elysium of romance, but as to _a field of work_. I expect to work with both hands,--to work _hard_; to work against all sorts of difficulties and discouragements; and to work till I die. This is what I go for; and in this I am quite sure I shall not be disappointed. \u201cWhatever you may think of my determination, do not divorce me from your confidence; and think that, in whatever I do, I act with a heart wholly given to my people. \u201cGEORGE HARRIS.\u201d George, with his wife, children, sister and mother, embarked for Africa, some few weeks after. If we are not mistaken, the world will yet hear from him there. Of our other characters we have nothing very particular to write, except a word relating to Miss Ophelia and Topsy, and a farewell chapter, which we shall dedicate to George Shelby. Miss Ophelia took Topsy home to Vermont with her, much to the surprise of the grave deliberative body whom a New Englander recognizes under the term \u201c_Our folks_.\u201d \u201cOur folks,\u201d at first, thought it an odd and unnecessary addition to their well-trained domestic establishment; but, so thoroughly efficient was Miss Ophelia in her conscientious endeavor to do her duty by her _\u00e9l\u00e8ve_, that the child rapidly grew in grace and in favor with the family and neighborhood. At the age of womanhood, she was, by her own request, baptized, and became a member of the Christian church in the place; and showed so much intelligence, activity and zeal, and desire to do good in the world, that she was at last recommended, and approved as a missionary to one of the stations in Africa; and we have heard that the same activity and ingenuity which, when a child, made her so multiform and restless in her developments, is now employed, in a safer and wholesomer manner, in teaching the children of her own country."], "What Presidentreportedly claimed that Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin started the Civil War?": [" Some dim ideas of imprudence or impropriety in the measure seemed to embarrass him considerably; for he often stopped, as Eliza glided forward, and looked wistfully, first at her and then at the house, and then, as if reassured by reflection, he pattered along after her again. A few minutes brought them to the window of Uncle Tom\u2019s cottage, and Eliza stopping, tapped lightly on the window-pane. The prayer-meeting at Uncle Tom\u2019s had, in the order of hymn-singing, been protracted to a very late hour; and, as Uncle Tom had indulged himself in a few lengthy solos afterwards, the consequence was, that, although it was now between twelve and one o\u2019clock, he and his worthy helpmeet were not yet asleep. \u201cGood Lord! what\u2019s that?\u201d said Aunt Chloe, starting up and hastily drawing the curtain. \u201cMy sakes alive, if it an\u2019t Lizy! Get on your clothes, old man, quick!--there\u2019s old Bruno, too, a pawin round; what on airth! I\u2019m gwine to open the door.\u201d And suiting the action to the word, the door flew open, and the light of the tallow candle, which Tom had hastily lighted, fell on the haggard face and dark, wild eyes of the fugitive. \u201cLord bless you!--I\u2019m skeered to look at ye, Lizy! Are ye tuck sick, or what\u2019s come over ye?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m running away--Uncle Tom and Aunt Chloe--carrying off my child--Master sold him!\u201d \u201cSold him?\u201d echoed both, lifting up their hands in dismay. \u201cYes, sold him!\u201d said Eliza, firmly; \u201cI crept into the closet by Mistress\u2019 door tonight, and I heard Master tell Missis that he had sold my Harry, and you, Uncle Tom, both, to a trader; and that he was going off this morning on his horse, and that the man was to take possession today.\u201d Tom had stood, during this speech, with his hands raised, and his eyes dilated, like a man in a dream.", " They will kill me, fast enough; they never will get me down the river alive!\u201d \u201cO, George, for my sake, do be careful! Don\u2019t do anything wicked; don\u2019t lay hands on yourself, or anybody else! You are tempted too much--too much; but don\u2019t--go you must--but go carefully, prudently; pray God to help you.\u201d \u201cWell, then, Eliza, hear my plan. Mas\u2019r took it into his head to send me right by here, with a note to Mr. Symmes, that lives a mile past. I believe he expected I should come here to tell you what I have. It would please him, if he thought it would aggravate \u2018Shelby\u2019s folks,\u2019 as he calls \u2019em. I\u2019m going home quite resigned, you understand, as if all was over. I\u2019ve got some preparations made,--and there are those that will help me; and, in the course of a week or so, I shall be among the missing, some day. Pray for me, Eliza; perhaps the good Lord will hear _you_.\u201d \u201cO, pray yourself, George, and go trusting in him; then you won\u2019t do anything wicked.\u201d \u201cWell, now, _good-by_,\u201d said George, holding Eliza\u2019s hands, and gazing into her eyes, without moving. They stood silent; then there were last words, and sobs, and bitter weeping,--such parting as those may make whose hope to meet again is as the spider\u2019s web,--and the husband and wife were parted. CHAPTER IV An Evening in Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin The cabin of Uncle Tom was a small log building, close adjoining to \u201cthe house,\u201d as the negro _par excellence_ designates his master\u2019s dwelling.", " People, you know, can get up as much enthusiasm in hunting a man as a deer, if it is only customary; in fact, I got a little excited myself, though I had only put in as a sort of mediator, in case he was caught. \u201cWell, the dogs bayed and howled, and we rode and scampered, and finally we started him. He ran and bounded like a buck, and kept us well in the rear for some time; but at last he got caught in an impenetrable thicket of cane; then he turned to bay, and I tell you he fought the dogs right gallantly. He dashed them to right and left, and actually killed three of them with only his naked fists, when a shot from a gun brought him down, and he fell, wounded and bleeding, almost at my feet. The poor fellow looked up at me with manhood and despair both in his eye. I kept back the dogs and the party, as they came pressing up, and claimed him as my prisoner. It was all I could do to keep them from shooting him, in the flush of success; but I persisted in my bargain, and Alfred sold him to me. Well, I took him in hand, and in one fortnight I had him tamed down as submissive and tractable as heart could desire.\u201d \u201cWhat in the world did you do to him?\u201d said Marie. \u201cWell, it was quite a simple process. I took him to my own room, had a good bed made for him, dressed his wounds, and tended him myself, until he got fairly on his feet again. And, in process of time, I had free papers made out for him, and told him he might go where he liked.\u201d \u201cAnd did he go?\u201d said Miss Ophelia.", " *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK UNCLE TOM\u2019S CABIN *** Produced by Judith Boss, An Anonymous Volunteer and David Widger UNCLE TOM\u2019S CABIN or Life among the Lowly By Harriet Beecher Stowe VOLUME I CHAPTER I In Which the Reader Is Introduced to a Man of Humanity Late in the afternoon of a chilly day in February, two gentlemen were sitting alone over their wine, in a well-furnished dining parlor, in the town of P----, in Kentucky. There were no servants present, and the gentlemen, with chairs closely approaching, seemed to be discussing some subject with great earnestness. For convenience sake, we have said, hitherto, two _gentlemen_. One of the parties, however, when critically examined, did not seem, strictly speaking, to come under the species. He was a short, thick-set man, with coarse, commonplace features, and that swaggering air of pretension which marks a low man who is trying to elbow his way upward in the world. He was much over-dressed, in a gaudy vest of many colors, a blue neckerchief, bedropped gayly with yellow spots, and arranged with a flaunting tie, quite in keeping with the general air of the man. His hands, large and coarse, were plentifully bedecked with rings; and he wore a heavy gold watch-chain, with a bundle of seals of portentous size, and a great variety of colors, attached to it,--which, in the ardor of conversation, he was in the habit of flourishing and jingling with evident satisfaction."], "From where doesEliza cross into Canada?": [" \u201cBecause he _was_ a kind master; I\u2019ll say that of him, any way;--and my mistress was kind; but they couldn\u2019t help themselves. They were owing money; and there was some way, I can\u2019t tell how, that a man had a hold on them, and they were obliged to give him his will. I listened, and heard him telling mistress that, and she begging and pleading for me,--and he told her he couldn\u2019t help himself, and that the papers were all drawn;--and then it was I took him and left my home, and came away. I knew \u2019t was no use of my trying to live, if they did it; for \u2019t \u2019pears like this child is all I have.\u201d \u201cHave you no husband?\u201d \u201cYes, but he belongs to another man. His master is real hard to him, and won\u2019t let him come to see me, hardly ever; and he\u2019s grown harder and harder upon us, and he threatens to sell him down south;--it\u2019s like I\u2019ll never see _him_ again!\u201d The quiet tone in which the woman pronounced these words might have led a superficial observer to think that she was entirely apathetic; but there was a calm, settled depth of anguish in her large, dark eye, that spoke of something far otherwise. \u201cAnd where do you mean to go, my poor woman?\u201d said Mrs. Bird. \u201cTo Canada, if I only knew where that was. Is it very far off, is Canada?\u201d said she, looking up, with a simple, confiding air, to Mrs. Bird\u2019s face. \u201cPoor thing!\u201d said Mrs. Bird, involuntarily. \u201cIs \u2019t a very great way off, think?\u201d said the woman, earnestly.", " And this, oh Africa! latest called of nations,--called to the crown of thorns, the scourge, the bloody sweat, the cross of agony,--this is to be _thy_ victory; by this shalt thou reign with Christ when his kingdom shall come on earth. The deep fervor of Tom\u2019s feelings, the softness of his voice, his tears, fell like dew on the wild, unsettled spirit of the poor woman. A softness gathered over the lurid fires of her eye; she looked down, and Tom could feel the relaxing muscles of her hands, as she said, \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you that evil spirits followed me? O! Father Tom, I can\u2019t pray,--I wish I could. I never have prayed since my children were sold! What you say must be right, I know it must; but when I try to pray, I can only hate and curse. I can\u2019t pray!\u201d \u201cPoor soul!\u201d said Tom, compassionately. \u201cSatan desires to have ye, and sift ye as wheat. I pray the Lord for ye. O! Misse Cassy, turn to the dear Lord Jesus. He came to bind up the broken-hearted, and comfort all that mourn.\u201d Cassy stood silent, while large, heavy tears dropped from her downcast eyes. \u201cMisse Cassy,\u201d said Tom, in a hesitating tone, after surveying her in silence, \u201cif ye only could get away from here,--if the thing was possible,--I\u2019d \u2019vise ye and Emmeline to do it; that is, if ye could go without blood-guiltiness,--not otherwise.\u201d \u201cWould you try it with us, Father Tom?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Tom; \u201ctime was when I would; but the Lord\u2019s given me a work among these yer poor souls, and I\u2019ll stay with \u2019em and bear my cross with \u2019em till the end.", " Perhaps you cannot,--but she felt as sure, in that hour, that God had had mercy on her, and that she should see her daughter,--as she did, months afterwards,--when--but we anticipate. CHAPTER XLIII Results The rest of our story is soon told. George Shelby, interested, as any other young man might be, by the romance of the incident, no less than by feelings of humanity, was at the pains to send to Cassy the bill of sale of Eliza; whose date and name all corresponded with her own knowledge of facts, and felt no doubt upon her mind as to the identity of her child. It remained now only for her to trace out the path of the fugitives. Madame de Thoux and she, thus drawn together by the singular coincidence of their fortunes, proceeded immediately to Canada, and began a tour of inquiry among the stations, where the numerous fugitives from slavery are located. At Amherstberg they found the missionary with whom George and Eliza had taken shelter, on their first arrival in Canada; and through him were enabled to trace the family to Montreal. George and Eliza had now been five years free. George had found constant occupation in the shop of a worthy machinist, where he had been earning a competent support for his family, which, in the mean time, had been increased by the addition of another daughter. Little Harry--a fine bright boy--had been put to a good school, and was making rapid proficiency in knowledge.", " I don\u2019t want anything to do with your affairs,\u201d--in fact, she looked about as sympathizing as a stone lion. But Marie didn\u2019t care for that. She had got somebody to talk to, and she felt it her duty to talk, and that was enough; and reinforcing herself by smelling again at her vinaigrette, she went on. \u201cYou see, I brought my own property and servants into the connection, when I married St. Clare, and I am legally entitled to manage them my own way. St. Clare had his fortune and his servants, and I\u2019m well enough content he should manage them his way; but St. Clare will be interfering. He has wild, extravagant notions about things, particularly about the treatment of servants. He really does act as if he set his servants before me, and before himself, too; for he lets them make him all sorts of trouble, and never lifts a finger. Now, about some things, St. Clare is really frightful--he frightens me--good-natured as he looks, in general. Now, he has set down his foot that, come what will, there shall not be a blow struck in this house, except what he or I strike; and he does it in a way that I really dare not cross him. Well, you may see what that leads to; for St. Clare wouldn\u2019t raise his hand, if every one of them walked over him, and I--you see how cruel it would be to require me to make the exertion. Now, you know these servants are nothing but grown-up children.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it, and I thank the Lord that I don\u2019t!\u201d said Miss Ophelia, shortly."], "Whom does St.Clare give to Ophelia to educate?": [" That\u2019s the only way. If I wasn\u2019t such a poor, feeble piece, I believe I should manage with twice the energy that St. Clare does.\u201d \u201cAnd how does St. Clare contrive to manage?\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cYou say he never strikes a blow.\u201d \u201cWell, men have a more commanding way, you know; it is easier for them; besides, if you ever looked full in his eye, it\u2019s peculiar,--that eye,--and if he speaks decidedly, there\u2019s a kind of flash. I\u2019m afraid of it, myself; and the servants know they must mind. I couldn\u2019t do as much by a regular storm and scolding as St. Clare can by one turn of his eye, if once he is in earnest. O, there\u2019s no trouble about St. Clare; that\u2019s the reason he\u2019s no more feeling for me. But you\u2019ll find, when you come to manage, that there\u2019s no getting along without severity,--they are so bad, so deceitful, so lazy.\u201d \u201cThe old tune,\u201d said St. Clare, sauntering in. \u201cWhat an awful account these wicked creatures will have to settle, at last, especially for being lazy! You see, cousin,\u201d said he, as he stretched himself at full length on a lounge opposite to Marie, \u201cit\u2019s wholly inexcusable in them, in the light of the example that Marie and I set them,--this laziness.\u201d \u201cCome, now, St. Clare, you are too bad!\u201d said Marie. \u201cAm I, now? Why, I thought I was talking good, quite remarkably for me. I try to enforce your remarks, Marie, always.\u201d \u201cYou know you meant no such thing, St. Clare,\u201d said Marie.", " \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said St. Clare. \u201cThis is a day of great deeds. Heroism and disinterestedness are rising up, here and there, in the earth. The Hungarian nobles set free millions of serfs, at an immense pecuniary loss; and, perhaps, among us may be found generous spirits, who do not estimate honor and justice by dollars and cents.\u201d \u201cI hardly think so,\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cBut, suppose we should rise up tomorrow and emancipate, who would educate these millions, and teach them how to use their freedom? They never would rise to do much among us. The fact is, we are too lazy and unpractical, ourselves, ever to give them much of an idea of that industry and energy which is necessary to form them into men. They will have to go north, where labor is the fashion,--the universal custom; and tell me, now, is there enough Christian philanthropy, among your northern states, to bear with the process of their education and elevation? You send thousands of dollars to foreign missions; but could you endure to have the heathen sent into your towns and villages, and give your time, and thoughts, and money, to raise them to the Christian standard? That\u2019s what I want to know. If we emancipate, are you willing to educate? How many families, in your town, would take a negro man and woman, teach them, bear with them, and seek to make them Christians? How many merchants would take Adolph, if I wanted to make him a clerk; or mechanics, if I wanted him taught a trade?", " \u201cI\u2019m sure, if anybody does more for servants than we do, I\u2019d like to know who; and it don\u2019t do \u2019em a bit good,--not a particle,--they get worse and worse. As to talking to them, or anything like that, I\u2019m sure I have talked till I was tired and hoarse, telling them their duty, and all that; and I\u2019m sure they can go to church when they like, though they don\u2019t understand a word of the sermon, more than so many pigs,--so it isn\u2019t of any great use for them to go, as I see; but they do go, and so they have every chance; but, as I said before, they are a degraded race, and always will be, and there isn\u2019t any help for them; you can\u2019t make anything of them, if you try. You see, Cousin Ophelia, I\u2019ve tried, and you haven\u2019t; I was born and bred among them, and I know.\u201d Miss Ophelia thought she had said enough, and therefore sat silent. St. Clare whistled a tune. \u201cSt. Clare, I wish you wouldn\u2019t whistle,\u201d said Marie; \u201cit makes my head worse.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d said St. Clare. \u201cIs there anything else you wouldn\u2019t wish me to do?\u201d \u201cI wish you _would_ have some kind of sympathy for my trials; you never have any feeling for me.\u201d \u201cMy dear accusing angel!\u201d said St. Clare. \u201cIt\u2019s provoking to be talked to in that way.\u201d \u201cThen, how will you be talked to? I\u2019ll talk to order,--any way you\u2019ll mention,--only to give satisfaction.\u201d A gay laugh from the court rang through the silken curtains of the verandah. St. Clare stepped out, and lifting up the curtain, laughed too.", " I used to have great hopes of you,\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cWell, haven\u2019t you now?\u201d said St. Clare. \u201cI wish you were as good as you were when you were a boy, Augustine.\u201d \u201cSo do I, that\u2019s a fact, Cousin,\u201d said St. Clare. \u201cWell, go ahead and catechize Topsy; may be you\u2019ll make out something yet.\u201d Topsy, who had stood like a black statue during this discussion, with hands decently folded, now, at a signal from Miss Ophelia, went on: \u201cOur first parents, being left to the freedom of their own will, fell from the state wherein they were created.\u201d Topsy\u2019s eyes twinkled, and she looked inquiringly. \u201cWhat is it, Topsy?\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cPlease, Missis, was dat ar state Kintuck?\u201d \u201cWhat state, Topsy?\u201d \u201cDat state dey fell out of. I used to hear Mas\u2019r tell how we came down from Kintuck.\u201d St. Clare laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to give her a meaning, or she\u2019ll make one,\u201d said he. \u201cThere seems to be a theory of emigration suggested there.\u201d \u201cO! Augustine, be still,\u201d said Miss Ophelia; \u201chow can I do anything, if you will be laughing?\u201d \u201cWell, I won\u2019t disturb the exercises again, on my honor;\u201d and St. Clare took his paper into the parlor, and sat down, till Topsy had finished her recitations. They were all very well, only that now and then she would oddly transpose some important words, and persist in the mistake, in spite of every effort to the contrary; and St. Clare, after all his promises of goodness, took a wicked pleasure in these mistakes, calling Topsy to him whenever he had a mind to amuse himself, and getting her to repeat the offending passages, in spite of Miss Ophelia\u2019s remonstrances."], "Which characterdirectly opposes the Fugitive Slave Law?": [" \u201cNo, no, Mary, no doctoring! a cup of your good hot tea, and some of our good home living, is what I want. It\u2019s a tiresome business, this legislating!\u201d And the senator smiled, as if he rather liked the idea of considering himself a sacrifice to his country. \u201cWell,\u201d said his wife, after the business of the tea-table was getting rather slack, \u201cand what have they been doing in the Senate?\u201d Now, it was a very unusual thing for gentle little Mrs. Bird ever to trouble her head with what was going on in the house of the state, very wisely considering that she had enough to do to mind her own. Mr. Bird, therefore, opened his eyes in surprise, and said, \u201cNot very much of importance.\u201d \u201cWell; but is it true that they have been passing a law forbidding people to give meat and drink to those poor colored folks that come along? I heard they were talking of some such law, but I didn\u2019t think any Christian legislature would pass it!\u201d \u201cWhy, Mary, you are getting to be a politician, all at once.\u201d \u201cNo, nonsense! I wouldn\u2019t give a fig for all your politics, generally, but I think this is something downright cruel and unchristian. I hope, my dear, no such law has been passed.\u201d \u201cThere has been a law passed forbidding people to help off the slaves that come over from Kentucky, my dear; so much of that thing has been done by these reckless Abolitionists, that our brethren in Kentucky are very strongly excited, and it seems necessary, and no more than Christian and kind, that something should be done by our state to quiet the excitement.\u201d \u201cAnd what is the law?", " Have you not, in your own secret souls, in your own private conversings, felt that there are woes and evils, in this accursed system, far beyond what are here shadowed, or can be shadowed? Can it be otherwise? Is _man_ ever a creature to be trusted with wholly irresponsible power? And does not the slave system, by denying the slave all legal right of testimony, make every individual owner an irresponsible despot? Can anybody fail to make the inference what the practical result will be? If there is, as we admit, a public sentiment among you, men of honor, justice and humanity, is there not also another kind of public sentiment among the ruffian, the brutal and debased? And cannot the ruffian, the brutal, the debased, by slave law, own just as many slaves as the best and purest? Are the honorable, the just, the high-minded and compassionate, the majority anywhere in this world? The slave-trade is now, by American law, considered as piracy. But a slave-trade, as systematic as ever was carried on on the coast of Africa, is an inevitable attendant and result of American slavery. And its heart-break and its horrors, can they be told? The writer has given only a faint shadow, a dim picture, of the anguish and despair that are, at this very moment, riving thousands of hearts, shattering thousands of families, and driving a helpless and sensitive race to frenzy and despair. There are those living who know the mothers whom this accursed traffic has driven to the murder of their children; and themselves seeking in death a shelter from woes more dreaded than death.", " at last!\u201d The effort of speaking exhausted him. The sinking paleness of death fell on him; but with it there fell, as if shed from the wings of some pitying spirit, a beautiful expression of peace, like that of a wearied child who sleeps. So he lay for a few moments. They saw that the mighty hand was on him. Just before the spirit parted, he opened his eyes, with a sudden light, as of joy and recognition, and said _\u201cMother!\u201d_ and then he was gone! CHAPTER XXIX The Unprotected We hear often of the distress of the negro servants, on the loss of a kind master; and with good reason, for no creature on God\u2019s earth is left more utterly unprotected and desolate than the slave in these circumstances. The child who has lost a father has still the protection of friends, and of the law; he is something, and can do something,--has acknowledged rights and position; the slave has none. The law regards him, in every respect, as devoid of rights as a bale of merchandise. The only possible acknowledgment of any of the longings and wants of a human and immortal creature, which are given to him, comes to him through the sovereign and irresponsible will of his master; and when that master is stricken down, nothing remains. The number of those men who know how to use wholly irresponsible power humanely and generously is small. Everybody knows this, and the slave knows it best of all; so that he feels that there are ten chances of his finding an abusive and tyrannical master, to one of his finding a considerate and kind one.", " Our good senator in his native state had not been exceeded by any of his brethren at Washington, in the sort of eloquence which has won for them immortal renown! How sublimely he had sat with his hands in his pockets, and scouted all sentimental weakness of those who would put the welfare of a few miserable fugitives before great state interests! He was as bold as a lion about it, and \u201cmightily convinced\u201d not only himself, but everybody that heard him;--but then his idea of a fugitive was only an idea of the letters that spell the word,--or at the most, the image of a little newspaper picture of a man with a stick and bundle with \u201cRan away from the subscriber\u201d under it. The magic of the real presence of distress,--the imploring human eye, the frail, trembling human hand, the despairing appeal of helpless agony,--these he had never tried. He had never thought that a fugitive might be a hapless mother, a defenceless child,--like that one which was now wearing his lost boy\u2019s little well-known cap; and so, as our poor senator was not stone or steel,--as he was a man, and a downright noble-hearted one, too,--he was, as everybody must see, in a sad case for his patriotism. And you need not exult over him, good brother of the Southern States; for we have some inklings that many of you, under similar circumstances, would not do much better. We have reason to know, in Kentucky, as in Mississippi, are noble and generous hearts, to whom never was tale of suffering told in vain."], "Who beats UncleTom to death?": [" \u201cAugustine,\u201d she said, suddenly, as she sat knitting, \u201chave you ever made any provision for your servants, in case of your death?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said St. Clare, as he read on. \u201cThen all your indulgence to them may prove a great cruelty, by and by.\u201d St. Clare had often thought the same thing himself; but he answered, negligently. \u201cWell, I mean to make a provision, by and by.\u201d \u201cWhen?\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cO, one of these days.\u201d \u201cWhat if you should die first?\u201d \u201cCousin, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d said St. Clare, laying down his paper and looking at her. \u201cDo you think I show symptoms of yellow fever or cholera, that you are making post mortem arrangements with such zeal?\u201d \u201c\u2018In the midst of life we are in death,\u2019\u201d said Miss Ophelia. St. Clare rose up, and laying the paper down, carelessly, walked to the door that stood open on the verandah, to put an end to a conversation that was not agreeable to him. Mechanically, he repeated the last word again,--_\u201cDeath!\u201d_--and, as he leaned against the railings, and watched the sparkling water as it rose and fell in the fountain; and, as in a dim and dizzy haze, saw flowers and trees and vases of the courts, he repeated, again the mystic word so common in every mouth, yet of such fearful power,--\u201cDEATH!\u201d \u201cStrange that there should be such a word,\u201d he said, \u201cand such a thing, and we ever forget it; that one should be living, warm and beautiful, full of hopes, desires and wants, one day, and the next be gone, utterly gone, and forever!\u201d It was a warm, golden evening; and, as he walked to the other end of the verandah, he saw Tom busily intent on his Bible, pointing, as he did so, with his finger to each successive word, and whispering them to himself with an earnest air.", " He bought me, at last, and promised to do all he could to find and buy back my children. He went to the hotel where my Henry was; they told him he had been sold to a planter up on Pearl River; that was the last that I ever heard. Then he found where my daughter was; an old woman was keeping her. He offered an immense sum for her, but they would not sell her. Butler found out that it was for me he wanted her; and he sent me word that I should never have her. Captain Stuart was very kind to me; he had a splendid plantation, and took me to it. In the course of a year, I had a son born. O, that child!--how I loved it! How just like my poor Henry the little thing looked! But I had made up my mind,--yes, I had. I would never again let a child live to grow up! I took the little fellow in my arms, when he was two weeks old, and kissed him, and cried over him; and then I gave him laudanum, and held him close to my bosom, while he slept to death. How I mourned and cried over it! and who ever dreamed that it was anything but a mistake, that had made me give it the laudanum? but it\u2019s one of the few things that I\u2019m glad of, now. I am not sorry, to this day; he, at least, is out of pain. What better than death could I give him, poor child! After a while, the cholera came, and Captain Stuart died; everybody died that wanted to live,--and I,--I, though I went down to death\u2019s door,--_I lived!_ Then I was sold, and passed from hand to hand, till I grew faded and wrinkled, and I had a fever; and then this wretch bought me, and brought me here,--and here I am!\u201d The woman stopped.", " He defends both,--and I think, at least, _consistently_. He says that there can be no high civilization without enslavement of the masses, either nominal or real. There must, he says, be a lower class, given up to physical toil and confined to an animal nature; and a higher one thereby acquires leisure and wealth for a more expanded intelligence and improvement, and becomes the directing soul of the lower. So he reasons, because, as I said, he is born an aristocrat;--so I don\u2019t believe, because I was born a democrat.\u201d \u201cHow in the world can the two things be compared?\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cThe English laborer is not sold, traded, parted from his family, whipped.\u201d \u201cHe is as much at the will of his employer as if he were sold to him. The slave-owner can whip his refractory slave to death,--the capitalist can starve him to death. As to family security, it is hard to say which is the worst,--to have one\u2019s children sold, or see them starve to death at home.\u201d \u201cBut it\u2019s no kind of apology for slavery, to prove that it isn\u2019t worse than some other bad thing.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t give it for one,--nay, I\u2019ll say, besides, that ours is the more bold and palpable infringement of human rights; actually buying a man up, like a horse,--looking at his teeth, cracking his joints, and trying his paces and then paying down for him,--having speculators, breeders, traders, and brokers in human bodies and souls,--sets the thing before the eyes of the civilized world in a more tangible form, though the thing done be, after all, in its nature, the same; that is, appropriating one set of human beings to the use and improvement of another without any regard to their own.\u201d \u201cI never thought of the matter in this light,\u201d said Miss Ophelia.", " What is it?\u201d said her father. A bright, a glorious smile passed over her face, and she said, brokenly,--\u201cO! love,--joy,--peace!\u201d gave one sigh and passed from death unto life! \u201cFarewell, beloved child! the bright, eternal doors have closed after thee; we shall see thy sweet face no more. O, woe for them who watched thy entrance into heaven, when they shall wake and find only the cold gray sky of daily life, and thou gone forever!\u201d CHAPTER XXVII \u201cThis Is the Last of Earth\u201d * * \u201cThis is the last of Earth! I am content,\u201d last words of John Quincy Adams, uttered February 21, 1848. The statuettes and pictures in Eva\u2019s room were shrouded in white napkins, and only hushed breathings and muffled footfalls were heard there, and the light stole in solemnly through windows partially darkened by closed blinds. The bed was draped in white; and there, beneath the drooping angel-figure, lay a little sleeping form,--sleeping never to waken! There she lay, robed in one of the simple white dresses she had been wont to wear when living; the rose-colored light through the curtains cast over the icy coldness of death a warm glow. The heavy eyelashes drooped softly on the pure cheek; the head was turned a little to one side, as if in natural sleep, but there was diffused over every lineament of the face that high celestial expression, that mingling of rapture and repose, which showed it was no earthly or temporary sleep, but the long, sacred rest which \u201cHe giveth to his beloved.\u201d There is no death to such as thou, dear Eva!"], "What is Mrs.Shelby\u2019s first name?": [" \u2018Thar,\u2019 says she, \u2018Tom, that\u2019s to be _your_ young Mas\u2019r; take good care on him,\u2019 says she. And now I jist ask you, Mas\u2019r, have I ever broke word to you, or gone contrary to you, \u2019specially since I was a Christian?\u201d Mr. Shelby was fairly overcome, and the tears rose to his eyes. \u201cMy good boy,\u201d said he, \u201cthe Lord knows you say but the truth; and if I was able to help it, all the world shouldn\u2019t buy you.\u201d \u201cAnd sure as I am a Christian woman,\u201d said Mrs. Shelby, \u201cyou shall be redeemed as soon as I can any way bring together means. Sir,\u201d she said to Haley, \u201ctake good account of who you sell him to, and let me know.\u201d \u201cLor, yes, for that matter,\u201d said the trader, \u201cI may bring him up in a year, not much the wuss for wear, and trade him back.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll trade with you then, and make it for your advantage,\u201d said Mrs. Shelby. \u201cOf course,\u201d said the trader, \u201call \u2019s equal with me; li\u2019ves trade \u2019em up as down, so I does a good business. All I want is a livin\u2019, you know, ma\u2019am; that\u2019s all any on us wants, I, s\u2019pose.\u201d Mr. and Mrs. Shelby both felt annoyed and degraded by the familiar impudence of the trader, and yet both saw the absolute necessity of putting a constraint on their feelings. The more hopelessly sordid and insensible he appeared, the greater became Mrs. Shelby\u2019s dread of his succeeding in recapturing Eliza and her child, and of course the greater her motive for detaining him by every female artifice.", " CHAPTER XXI Kentuck Our readers may not be unwilling to glance back, for a brief interval, at Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, on the Kentucky farm, and see what has been transpiring among those whom he had left behind. It was late in the summer afternoon, and the doors and windows of the large parlor all stood open, to invite any stray breeze, that might feel in a good humor, to enter. Mr. Shelby sat in a large hall opening into the room, and running through the whole length of the house, to a balcony on either end. Leisurely tipped back on one chair, with his heels in another, he was enjoying his after-dinner cigar. Mrs. Shelby sat in the door, busy about some fine sewing; she seemed like one who had something on her mind, which she was seeking an opportunity to introduce. \u201cDo you know,\u201d she said, \u201cthat Chloe has had a letter from Tom?\u201d \u201cAh! has she? Tom \u2019s got some friend there, it seems. How is the old boy?\u201d \u201cHe has been bought by a very fine family, I should think,\u201d said Mrs. Shelby,--\u201cis kindly treated, and has not much to do.\u201d \u201cAh! well, I\u2019m glad of it,--very glad,\u201d said Mr. Shelby, heartily. \u201cTom, I suppose, will get reconciled to a Southern residence;--hardly want to come up here again.\u201d \u201cOn the contrary he inquires very anxiously,\u201d said Mrs. Shelby, \u201cwhen the money for his redemption is to be raised.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure _I_ don\u2019t know,\u201d said Mr. Shelby. \u201cOnce get business running wrong, there does seem to be no end to it.", " \u201cIt will have to come out,\u201d said he, mentally; \u201cas well now as ever.\u201d \u201cI told Eliza,\u201d said Mrs. Shelby, as she continued brushing her hair, \u201cthat she was a little fool for her pains, and that you never had anything to do with that sort of persons. Of course, I knew you never meant to sell any of our people,--least of all, to such a fellow.\u201d \u201cWell, Emily,\u201d said her husband, \u201cso I have always felt and said; but the fact is that my business lies so that I cannot get on without. I shall have to sell some of my hands.\u201d \u201cTo that creature? Impossible! Mr. Shelby, you cannot be serious.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say that I am,\u201d said Mr. Shelby. \u201cI\u2019ve agreed to sell Tom.\u201d \u201cWhat! our Tom?--that good, faithful creature!--been your faithful servant from a boy! O, Mr. Shelby!--and you have promised him his freedom, too,--you and I have spoken to him a hundred times of it. Well, I can believe anything now,--I can believe _now_ that you could sell little Harry, poor Eliza\u2019s only child!\u201d said Mrs. Shelby, in a tone between grief and indignation. \u201cWell, since you must know all, it is so. I have agreed to sell Tom and Harry both; and I don\u2019t know why I am to be rated, as if I were a monster, for doing what every one does every day.\u201d \u201cBut why, of all others, choose these?\u201d said Mrs. Shelby. \u201cWhy sell them, of all on the place, if you must sell at all?\u201d \u201cBecause they will bring the highest sum of any,--that\u2019s why.", " She was then in attendance on the sick-bed of her husband, who lay delirious in the crisis of a fever. Master George Shelby, who, in the interval, had changed from a boy to a tall young man, was her constant and faithful assistant, and her only reliance in superintending his father\u2019s affairs. Miss Ophelia had taken the precaution to send them the name of the lawyer who did business for the St. Clares; and the most that, in the emergency, could be done, was to address a letter of inquiry to him. The sudden death of Mr. Shelby, a few days after, brought, of course, an absorbing pressure of other interests, for a season. Mr. Shelby showed his confidence in his wife\u2019s ability, by appointing her sole executrix upon his estates; and thus immediately a large and complicated amount of business was brought upon her hands. Mrs. Shelby, with characteristic energy, applied herself to the work of straightening the entangled web of affairs; and she and George were for some time occupied with collecting and examining accounts, selling property and settling debts; for Mrs. Shelby was determined that everything should be brought into tangible and recognizable shape, let the consequences to her prove what they might. In the mean time, they received a letter from the lawyer to whom Miss Ophelia had referred them, saying that he knew nothing of the matter; that the man was sold at a public auction, and that, beyond receiving the money, he knew nothing of the affair."], "In what statedoes Tom die?": [" When George entered the shed, he felt his head giddy and his heart sick. \u201cIs it possible,--is it possible?\u201d said he, kneeling down by him. \u201cUncle Tom, my poor, poor old friend!\u201d Something in the voice penetrated to the ear of the dying. He moved his head gently, smiled, and said, \u201cJesus can make a dying-bed Feel soft as down pillows are.\u201d Tears which did honor to his manly heart fell from the young man\u2019s eyes, as he bent over his poor friend. \u201cO, dear Uncle Tom! do wake,--do speak once more! Look up! Here\u2019s Mas\u2019r George,--your own little Mas\u2019r George.

Slowly the idea seemed to fill his soul; and the vacant eye became fixed and brightened, the whole face lighted up, the hard hands clasped, and tears ran down the cheeks. \u201cBless the Lord! it is,--it is,--it\u2019s all I wanted! They haven\u2019t forgot me. It warms my soul; it does my heart good! Now I shall die content! Bless the Lord, on my soul!\u201d \u201cYou shan\u2019t die! you _mustn\u2019t_ die, nor think of it!

Children do not usually generalize; but Eva was an uncommonly mature child, and the things that she had witnessed of the evils of the system under which they were living had fallen, one by one, into the depths of her thoughtful, pondering heart. She had vague longings to do something for them,--to bless and save not only them, but all in their condition,--longings that contrasted sadly with the feebleness of her little frame. \u201cUncle Tom,\u201d she said, one day, when she was reading to her friend, \u201cI can understand why Jesus _wanted_ to die for us.\u201d \u201cWhy, Miss Eva?\u201d \u201cBecause I\u2019ve felt so, too.\u201d \u201cWhat is it Miss Eva?--I don\u2019t understand.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t tell you; but, when I saw those poor creatures on the boat, you know, when you came up and I,--some had lost their mothers, and some their husbands, and some mothers cried for their little children--and when I heard about poor Prue,--oh, wasn\u2019t that dreadful!--and a great many other times, I\u2019ve felt that I would be glad to die, if my dying could stop all this misery. _I would_ die for them, Tom, if I could,\u201d said the child, earnestly, laying her little thin hand on his. Tom looked at the child with awe; and when she, hearing her father\u2019s voice, glided away, he wiped his eyes many times, as he looked after her. \u201cIt\u2019s jest no use tryin\u2019 to keep Miss Eva here,\u201d he said to Mammy, whom he met a moment after.", " And O, there\u2019s all ETERNITY to come, after that!\u201d ETERNITY,--the word thrilled through the black man\u2019s soul with light and power, as he spoke; it thrilled through the sinner\u2019s soul, too, like the bite of a scorpion. Legree gnashed on him with his teeth, but rage kept him silent; and Tom, like a man disenthralled, spoke, in a clear and cheerful voice, \u201cMas\u2019r Legree, as ye bought me, I\u2019ll be a true and faithful servant to ye. I\u2019ll give ye all the work of my hands, all my time, all my strength; but my soul I won\u2019t give up to mortal man. I will hold on to the Lord, and put his commands before all,--die or live; you may be sure on \u2019t. Mas\u2019r Legree, I ain\u2019t a grain afeard to die. I\u2019d as soon die as not.

A cold soft hand fell on Legree\u2019s at this moment. He turned,--it was Cassy\u2019s; but the cold soft touch recalled his dream of the night before, and, flashing through the chambers of his brain, came all the fearful images of the night-watches, with a portion of the horror that accompanied them. \u201cWill you be a fool?\u201d said Cassy, in French.", " But he was no man,\u201d he added, suddenly. \u201cNo man ever had such long and living power!

A little older she looks; her form a little fuller; her air more matronly than of yore; but evidently contented and happy as woman need be. \u201cHarry, my boy, how did you come on in that sum, today?\u201d says George, as he laid his hand on his son\u2019s head. Harry has lost his long curls; but he can never lose those eyes and eyelashes, and that fine, bold brow, that flushes with triumph, as he answers, \u201cI did it, every bit of it, _myself_, father; and _nobody_ helped me!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d says his father; \u201cdepend on yourself, my son. You have a better chance than ever your poor father had.\u201d At this moment, there is a rap at the door; and Eliza goes and opens it. The delighted--\u201cWhy! this you?\u201d--calls up her husband; and the good pastor of Amherstberg is welcomed. There are two more women with him, and Eliza asks them to sit down. Now, if the truth must be told, the honest pastor had arranged a little programme, according to which this affair was to develop itself; and, on the way up, all had very cautiously and prudently exhorted each other not to let things out, except according to previous arrangement. What was the good man\u2019s consternation, therefore, just as he had motioned to the ladies to be seated, and was taking out his pocket-handkerchief to wipe his mouth, so as to proceed to his introductory speech in good order, when Madame de Thoux upset the whole plan, by throwing her arms around George\u2019s neck, and letting all out at once, by saying, \u201cO, George!", " \u201cWe call him Harriet, you see;--don\u2019t the name come nicely?\u201d The child stood gravely regarding his mother in her new and strange attire, observing a profound silence, and occasionally drawing deep sighs, and peeping at her from under his dark curls. \u201cDoes Harry know mamma?\u201d said Eliza, stretching her hands toward him. The child clung shyly to the woman. \u201cCome Eliza, why do you try to coax him, when you know that he has got to be kept away from you?\u201d \u201cI know it\u2019s foolish,\u201d said Eliza; \u201cyet, I can\u2019t bear to have him turn away from me. But come,--where\u2019s my cloak? Here,--how is it men put on cloaks, George?\u201d \u201cYou must wear it so,\u201d said her husband, throwing it over his shoulders. \u201cSo, then,\u201d said Eliza, imitating the motion,--\u201cand I must stamp, and take long steps, and try to look saucy.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t exert yourself,\u201d said George. \u201cThere is, now and then, a modest young man; and I think it would be easier for you to act that character.\u201d \u201cAnd these gloves! mercy upon us!\u201d said Eliza; \u201cwhy, my hands are lost in them.\u201d \u201cI advise you to keep them on pretty strictly,\u201d said George. \u201cYour slender paw might bring us all out. Now, Mrs. Smyth, you are to go under our charge, and be our aunty,--you mind.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve heard,\u201d said Mrs. Smyth, \u201cthat there have been men down, warning all the packet captains against a man and woman, with a little boy.\u201d \u201cThey have!\u201d said George. \u201cWell, if we see any such people, we can tell them.\u201d A hack now drove to the door, and the friendly family who had received the fugitives crowded around them with farewell greetings."], "What boundary, separating Kentucky and the North, do Eliza and Harry cross to evade capture?": [" Only a day and a night on the lake, and then--oh, then!--\u201d \u201cO, Eliza!\u201d said George, drawing her towards him; \u201cthat is it! Now my fate is all narrowing down to a point. To come so near, to be almost in sight, and then lose all. I should never live under it, Eliza.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t fear,\u201d said his wife, hopefully. \u201cThe good Lord would not have brought us so far, if he didn\u2019t mean to carry us through. I seem to feel him with us, George.\u201d \u201cYou are a blessed woman, Eliza!\u201d said George, clasping her with a convulsive grasp. \u201cBut,--oh, tell me! can this great mercy be for us? Will these years and years of misery come to an end?--shall we be free? \u201cI am sure of it, George,\u201d said Eliza, looking upward, while tears of hope and enthusiasm shone on her long, dark lashes. \u201cI feel it in me, that God is going to bring us out of bondage, this very day.\u201d \u201cI will believe you, Eliza,\u201d said George, rising suddenly up, \u201cI will believe,--come let\u2019s be off. Well, indeed,\u201d said he, holding her off at arm\u2019s length, and looking admiringly at her, \u201cyou _are_ a pretty little fellow. That crop of little, short curls, is quite becoming. Put on your cap. So--a little to one side. I never saw you look quite so pretty. But, it\u2019s almost time for the carriage;--I wonder if Mrs. Smyth has got Harry rigged?\u201d The door opened, and a respectable, middle-aged woman entered, leading little Harry, dressed in girl\u2019s clothes. \u201cWhat a pretty girl he makes,\u201d said Eliza, turning him round.", " If I wanted to put Jane and Rosa to a school, how many schools are there in the northern states that would take them in? how many families that would board them? and yet they are as white as many a woman, north or south. You see, Cousin, I want justice done us. We are in a bad position. We are the more _obvious_ oppressors of the negro; but the unchristian prejudice of the north is an oppressor almost equally severe.\u201d \u201cWell, Cousin, I know it is so,\u201d said Miss Ophelia,--\u201cI know it was so with me, till I saw that it was my duty to overcome it; but, I trust I have overcome it; and I know there are many good people at the north, who in this matter need only to be _taught_ what their duty is, to do it. It would certainly be a greater self-denial to receive heathen among us, than to send missionaries to them; but I think we would do it.\u201d \u201c_You_ would, I know,\u201d said St. Clare. \u201cI\u2019d like to see anything you wouldn\u2019t do, if you thought it your duty!\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019m not uncommonly good,\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cOthers would, if they saw things as I do. I intend to take Topsy home, when I go. I suppose our folks will wonder, at first; but I think they will be brought to see as I do. Besides, I know there are many people at the north who do exactly what you said.\u201d \u201cYes, but they are a minority; and, if we should begin to emancipate to any extent, we should soon hear from you.\u201d Miss Ophelia did not reply.", " She would gladly have stopped at the door to listen, as she came out; but her mistress just then calling, she was obliged to hasten away. Still she thought she heard the trader make an offer for her boy;--could she be mistaken? Her heart swelled and throbbed, and she involuntarily strained him so tight that the little fellow looked up into her face in astonishment. \u201cEliza, girl, what ails you today?\u201d said her mistress, when Eliza had upset the wash-pitcher, knocked down the workstand, and finally was abstractedly offering her mistress a long nightgown in place of the silk dress she had ordered her to bring from the wardrobe. Eliza started. \u201cO, missis!\u201d she said, raising her eyes; then, bursting into tears, she sat down in a chair, and began sobbing. \u201cWhy, Eliza child, what ails you?\u201d said her mistress. \u201cO! missis, missis,\u201d said Eliza, \u201cthere\u2019s been a trader talking with master in the parlor!

No, you foolish girl! You know your master never deals with those southern traders, and never means to sell any of his servants, as long as they behave well. Why, you silly child, who do you think would want to buy your Harry? Do you think all the world are set on him as you are, you goosie?

I tell you, Eliza, that a sword will pierce through your soul for every good and pleasant thing your child is or has; it will make him worth too much for you to keep.\u201d The words smote heavily on Eliza\u2019s heart; the vision of the trader came before her eyes, and, as if some one had struck her a deadly blow, she turned pale and gasped for breath. She looked nervously out on the verandah, where the boy, tired of the grave conversation, had retired, and where he was riding triumphantly up and down on Mr. Shelby\u2019s walking-stick. She would have spoken to tell her husband her fears, but checked herself. \u201cNo, no,--he has enough to bear, poor fellow!\u201d she thought. \u201cNo, I won\u2019t tell him; besides, it an\u2019t true; Missis never deceives us.\u201d \u201cSo, Eliza, my girl,\u201d said the husband, mournfully, \u201cbear up, now; and good-by, for I\u2019m going.\u201d \u201cGoing, George!

A very humane jurist once said, The worst use you can put a man to is to hang him. No; there is another use that a man can be put to that is WORSE! CHAPTER III The Husband and Father Mrs. Shelby had gone on her visit, and Eliza stood in the verandah, rather dejectedly looking after the retreating carriage, when a hand was laid on her shoulder. She turned, and a bright smile lighted up her fine eyes. \u201cGeorge, is it you? How you frightened me! Well; I am so glad you \u2019s come! Missis is gone to spend the afternoon; so come into my little room, and we\u2019ll have the time all to ourselves.\u201d Saying this, she drew him into a neat little apartment opening on the verandah, where she generally sat at her sewing, within call of her mistress. \u201cHow glad I am!--why don\u2019t you smile?--and look at Harry--how he grows.\u201d The boy stood shyly regarding his father through his curls, holding close to the skirts of his mother\u2019s dress. \u201cIsn\u2019t he beautiful?\u201d said Eliza, lifting his long curls and kissing him. \u201cI wish he\u2019d never been born!\u201d said George, bitterly. \u201cI wish I\u2019d never been born myself!\u201d Surprised and frightened, Eliza sat down, leaned her head on her husband\u2019s shoulder, and burst into tears."], "Who does Uncle Tom quickly befriend on Mr. Haley's boat?": [" Now, what\u2019s your name?\u201d \u201cMy name\u2019s Tom; the little chil\u2019en used to call me Uncle Tom, way back thar in Kentuck.\u201d \u201cThen I mean to call you Uncle Tom, because, you see, I like you,\u201d said Eva. \u201cSo, Uncle Tom, where are you going?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, Miss Eva.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t know?\u201d said Eva. \u201cNo, I am going to be sold to somebody. I don\u2019t know who.\u201d \u201cMy papa can buy you,\u201d said Eva, quickly; \u201cand if he buys you, you will have good times. I mean to ask him, this very day.\u201d \u201cThank you, my little lady,\u201d said Tom. The boat here stopped at a small landing to take in wood, and Eva, hearing her father\u2019s voice, bounded nimbly away. Tom rose up, and went forward to offer his service in wooding, and soon was busy among the hands. Eva and her father were standing together by the railings to see the boat start from the landing-place, the wheel had made two or three revolutions in the water, when, by some sudden movement, the little one suddenly lost her balance and fell sheer over the side of the boat into the water. Her father, scarce knowing what he did, was plunging in after her, but was held back by some behind him, who saw that more efficient aid had followed his child. Tom was standing just under her on the lower deck, as she fell. He saw her strike the water, and sink, and was after her in a moment. A broad-chested, strong-armed fellow, it was nothing for him to keep afloat in the water, till, in a moment or two the child rose to the surface, and he caught her in his arms, and, swimming with her to the boat-side, handed her up, all dripping, to the grasp of hundreds of hands, which, as if they had all belonged to one man, were stretched eagerly out to receive her.", " \u201cAnd that ar an\u2019t the worst on \u2019t,\u201d said John; \u201cmabbee it won\u2019t go down with the Lord, neither, when ye come to settle with Him, one o\u2019 these days, as all on us must, I reckon.\u201d Haley walked reflectively to the other end of the boat. \u201cIf I make pretty handsomely on one or two next gangs,\u201d he thought, \u201cI reckon I\u2019ll stop off this yer; it\u2019s really getting dangerous.\u201d And he took out his pocket-book, and began adding over his accounts,--a process which many gentlemen besides Mr. Haley have found a specific for an uneasy conscience. The boat swept proudly away from the shore, and all went on merrily, as before. Men talked, and loafed, and read, and smoked. Women sewed, and children played, and the boat passed on her way. One day, when she lay to for a while at a small town in Kentucky, Haley went up into the place on a little matter of business. Tom, whose fetters did not prevent his taking a moderate circuit, had drawn near the side of the boat, and stood listlessly gazing over the railing. After a time, he saw the trader returning, with an alert step, in company with a colored woman, bearing in her arms a young child. She was dressed quite respectably, and a colored man followed her, bringing along a small trunk. The woman came cheerfully onward, talking, as she came, with the man who bore her trunk, and so passed up the plank into the boat. The bell rung, the steamer whizzed, the engine groaned and coughed, and away swept the boat down the river.", " Bob!\u201d \u201cCome, come, gentlemen, I say; this isn\u2019t business,\u201d said Marks. \u201cThere\u2019s different ways, you know, of looking at all subjects. Mr. Haley is a very nice man, no doubt, and has his own conscience; and, Tom, you have your ways, and very good ones, too, Tom; but quarrelling, you know, won\u2019t answer no kind of purpose. Let\u2019s go to business. Now, Mr. Haley, what is it?--you want us to undertake to catch this yer gal?\u201d \u201cThe gal\u2019s no matter of mine,--she\u2019s Shelby\u2019s; it\u2019s only the boy. I was a fool for buying the monkey!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re generally a fool!\u201d said Tom, gruffly. \u201cCome, now, Loker, none of your huffs,\u201d said Marks, licking his lips; \u201cyou see, Mr. Haley \u2019s a puttin\u2019 us in a way of a good job, I reckon; just hold still--these yer arrangements is my forte. This yer gal, Mr. Haley, how is she? what is she?\u201d \u201cWal! white and handsome--well brought up. I\u2019d a gin Shelby eight hundred or a thousand, and then made well on her.\u201d \u201cWhite and handsome--well brought up!\u201d said Marks, his sharp eyes, nose and mouth, all alive with enterprise. \u201cLook here, now, Loker, a beautiful opening. We\u2019ll do a business here on our own account;--we does the catchin\u2019; the boy, of course, goes to Mr. Haley,--we takes the gal to Orleans to speculate on. An\u2019t it beautiful?\u201d Tom, whose great heavy mouth had stood ajar during this communication, now suddenly snapped it together, as a big dog closes on a piece of meat, and seemed to be digesting the idea at his leisure.", " \u201cIt seems that gal \u2019s off, with her young un.\u201d \u201cMr. Haley, Mrs. Shelby is present,\u201d said Mr. Shelby. \u201cI beg pardon, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Haley, bowing slightly, with a still lowering brow; \u201cbut still I say, as I said before, this yer\u2019s a sing\u2019lar report. Is it true, sir?\u201d \u201cSir,\u201d said Mr. Shelby, \u201cif you wish to communicate with me, you must observe something of the decorum of a gentleman. Andy, take Mr. Haley\u2019s hat and riding-whip. Take a seat, sir. Yes, sir; I regret to say that the young woman, excited by overhearing, or having reported to her, something of this business, has taken her child in the night, and made off.\u201d \u201cI did expect fair dealing in this matter, I confess,\u201d said Haley. \u201cWell, sir,\u201d said Mr. Shelby, turning sharply round upon him, \u201cwhat am I to understand by that remark? If any man calls my honor in question, I have but one answer for him.\u201d The trader cowered at this, and in a somewhat lower tone said that \u201cit was plaguy hard on a fellow, that had made a fair bargain, to be gulled that way.\u201d \u201cMr. Haley,\u201d said Mr. Shelby, \u201cif I did not think you had some cause for disappointment, I should not have borne from you the rude and unceremonious style of your entrance into my parlor this morning. I say thus much, however, since appearances call for it, that I shall allow of no insinuations cast upon me, as if I were at all partner to any unfairness in this matter. Moreover, I shall feel bound to give you every assistance, in the use of horses, servants, &c., in the recovery of your property."], "What two spiritual visions renew Uncle Tom's wavering faith while he is enduring Simon Legree's cruelty?": [" She has all her life presumed on her delicacy, and her good looks, and her lady-like airs, till she forgets who she is;--and I\u2019ll give her one lesson that will bring her down, I fancy!\u201d \u201cBut, Cousin, consider that, if you destroy delicacy and a sense of shame in a young girl, you deprave her very fast.\u201d \u201cDelicacy!\u201d said Marie, with a scornful laugh,--\u201ca fine word for such as she! I\u2019ll teach her, with all her airs, that she\u2019s no better than the raggedest black wench that walks the streets! She\u2019ll take no more airs with me!\u201d \u201cYou will answer to God for such cruelty!\u201d said Miss Ophelia, with energy. \u201cCruelty,--I\u2019d like to know what the cruelty is!

Once let them feel that they are to take any airs about delicacy, and all that, and they\u2019ll run all over you, just as my servants always have. I\u2019ve begun now to bring them under; and I\u2019ll have them all to know that I\u2019ll send one out to be whipped, as soon as another, if they don\u2019t mind themselves!\u201d said Marie, looking around her decidedly. Jane hung her head and cowered at this, for she felt as if it was particularly directed to her.", " They would gladly have met to hear, and pray, and sing, in some place, together; but Legree would not permit it, and more than once broke up such attempts, with oaths and brutal execrations,--so that the blessed news had to circulate from individual to individual. Yet who can speak the simple joy with which some of those poor outcasts, to whom life was a joyless journey to a dark unknown, heard of a compassionate Redeemer and a heavenly home? It is the statement of missionaries, that, of all races of the earth, none have received the Gospel with such eager docility as the African. The principle of reliance and unquestioning faith, which is its foundation, is more a native element in this race than any other; and it has often been found among them, that a stray seed of truth, borne on some breeze of accident into hearts the most ignorant, has sprung up into fruit, whose abundance has shamed that of higher and more skilful culture. The poor mulatto woman, whose simple faith had been well-nigh crushed and overwhelmed, by the avalanche of cruelty and wrong which had fallen upon her, felt her soul raised up by the hymns and passages of Holy Writ, which this lowly missionary breathed into her ear in intervals, as they were going to and returning from work; and even the half-crazed and wandering mind of Cassy was soothed and calmed by his simple and unobtrusive influences. Stung to madness and despair by the crushing agonies of a life, Cassy had often resolved in her soul an hour of retribution, when her hand should avenge on her oppressor all the injustice and cruelty to which she had been witness, or which _she_ had in her own person suffered.", " Some dim ideas of imprudence or impropriety in the measure seemed to embarrass him considerably; for he often stopped, as Eliza glided forward, and looked wistfully, first at her and then at the house, and then, as if reassured by reflection, he pattered along after her again. A few minutes brought them to the window of Uncle Tom\u2019s cottage, and Eliza stopping, tapped lightly on the window-pane. The prayer-meeting at Uncle Tom\u2019s had, in the order of hymn-singing, been protracted to a very late hour; and, as Uncle Tom had indulged himself in a few lengthy solos afterwards, the consequence was, that, although it was now between twelve and one o\u2019clock, he and his worthy helpmeet were not yet asleep. \u201cGood Lord! what\u2019s that?\u201d said Aunt Chloe, starting up and hastily drawing the curtain. \u201cMy sakes alive, if it an\u2019t Lizy! Get on your clothes, old man, quick!--there\u2019s old Bruno, too, a pawin round; what on airth! I\u2019m gwine to open the door.\u201d And suiting the action to the word, the door flew open, and the light of the tallow candle, which Tom had hastily lighted, fell on the haggard face and dark, wild eyes of the fugitive. \u201cLord bless you!--I\u2019m skeered to look at ye, Lizy! Are ye tuck sick, or what\u2019s come over ye?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m running away--Uncle Tom and Aunt Chloe--carrying off my child--Master sold him!\u201d \u201cSold him?\u201d echoed both, lifting up their hands in dismay. \u201cYes, sold him!\u201d said Eliza, firmly; \u201cI crept into the closet by Mistress\u2019 door tonight, and I heard Master tell Missis that he had sold my Harry, and you, Uncle Tom, both, to a trader; and that he was going off this morning on his horse, and that the man was to take possession today.\u201d Tom had stood, during this speech, with his hands raised, and his eyes dilated, like a man in a dream.", " And, therefore, without shuddering or trembling, he heard the voice of his persecutor, as he drew near. \u201cWell, my boy,\u201d said Legree, with a contemptuous kick, \u201chow do you find yourself? Didn\u2019t I tell yer I could larn yer a thing or two? How do yer like it--eh? How did yer whaling agree with yer, Tom? An\u2019t quite so crank as ye was last night. Ye couldn\u2019t treat a poor sinner, now, to a bit of sermon, could ye,--eh?\u201d Tom answered nothing. \u201cGet up, you beast!\u201d said Legree, kicking him again. This was a difficult matter for one so bruised and faint; and, as Tom made efforts to do so, Legree laughed brutally. \u201cWhat makes ye so spry, this morning, Tom? Cotched cold, may be, last night.\u201d Tom by this time had gained his feet, and was confronting his master with a steady, unmoved front. \u201cThe devil, you can!\u201d said Legree, looking him over. \u201cI believe you haven\u2019t got enough yet. Now, Tom, get right down on yer knees and beg my pardon, for yer shines last night.\u201d Tom did not move. \u201cDown, you dog!\u201d said Legree, striking him with his riding-whip. \u201cMas\u2019r Legree,\u201d said Tom, \u201cI can\u2019t do it. I did only what I thought was right. I shall do just so again, if ever the time comes. I never will do a cruel thing, come what may.\u201d \u201cYes, but ye don\u2019t know what may come, Master Tom. Ye think what you\u2019ve got is something. I tell you \u2019tan\u2019t anything,--nothing \u2019t all. How would ye like to be tied to a tree, and have a slow fire lit up around ye;--wouldn\u2019t that be pleasant,--eh, Tom?\u201d \u201cMas\u2019r,\u201d said Tom, \u201cI know ye can do dreadful things; but,\u201d--he stretched himself upward and clasped his hands,--\u201cbut, after ye\u2019ve killed the body, there an\u2019t no more ye can do."], "Where does the reunited Harris family settle?": [" I\u2019m for going right up.

There are no servants in the house, but the lady in the snowy cap, with the spectacles, who sits sewing every afternoon among her daughters, as if nothing ever had been done, or were to be done,--she and her girls, in some long-forgotten fore part of the day, \u201c_did up the work_,\u201d and for the rest of the time, probably, at all hours when you would see them, it is \u201c_done up_.\u201d The old kitchen floor never seems stained or spotted; the tables, the chairs, and the various cooking utensils, never seem deranged or disordered; though three and sometimes four meals a day are got there, though the family washing and ironing is there performed, and though pounds of butter and cheese are in some silent and mysterious manner there brought into existence. * _The Ancient History_, ten volumes (1730-1738), by the French historian Charles Rollin (1661-1741). ** _Scott\u2019s Family Bible_ (1788-1792), edited with notes by the English Biblical commentator, Thomas Scott (1747-1821). On such a farm, in such a house and family, Miss Ophelia had spent a quiet existence of some forty-five years, when her cousin invited her to visit his southern mansion.", " This lady, having gathered, from George\u2019s conversation, that he was from Kentucky, seemed evidently disposed to cultivate his acquaintance; in which design she was seconded by the graces of her little girl, who was about as pretty a plaything as ever diverted the weariness of a fortnight\u2019s trip on a steamboat. George\u2019s chair was often placed at her state-room door; and Cassy, as she sat upon the guards, could hear their conversation. Madame de Thoux was very minute in her inquiries as to Kentucky, where she said she had resided in a former period of her life. George discovered, to his surprise, that her former residence must have been in his own vicinity; and her inquiries showed a knowledge of people and things in his vicinity, that was perfectly surprising to him. \u201cDo you know,\u201d said Madame de Thoux to him, one day, \u201cof any man, in your neighborhood, of the name of Harris?\u201d \u201cThere is an old fellow, of that name, lives not far from my father\u2019s place,\u201d said George. \u201cWe never have had much intercourse with him, though.\u201d \u201cHe is a large slave-owner, I believe,\u201d said Madame de Thoux, with a manner which seemed to betray more interest than she was exactly willing to show. \u201cHe is,\u201d said George, looking rather surprised at her manner. \u201cDid you ever know of his having--perhaps, you may have heard of his having a mulatto boy, named George?\u201d \u201cO, certainly,--George Harris,--I know him well; he married a servant of my mother\u2019s, but has escaped, now, to Canada.\u201d \u201cHe has?\u201d said Madame de Thoux, quickly."], "Who does Simon Legree buy at the slave market to replace Cassy as his mistress?": [" This hint was enough to repress talking, though, of course, it did not disturb the credit of the story in the least. Gradually, the staircase that led to the garret, and even the passage-way to the staircase, were avoided by every one in the house, from every one fearing to speak of it, and the legend was gradually falling into desuetude. It had suddenly occurred to Cassy to make use of the superstitious excitability, which was so great in Legree, for the purpose of her liberation, and that of her fellow-sufferer. The sleeping-room of Cassy was directly under the garret. One day, without consulting Legree, she suddenly took it upon her, with some considerable ostentation, to change all the furniture and appurtenances of the room to one at some considerable distance. The under-servants, who were called on to effect this movement, were running and bustling about with great zeal and confusion, when Legree returned from a ride. \u201cHallo! you Cass!\u201d said Legree, \u201cwhat\u2019s in the wind now?\u201d \u201cNothing; only I choose to have another room,\u201d said Cassy, doggedly. \u201cAnd what for, pray?\u201d said Legree. \u201cI choose to,\u201d said Cassy. \u201cThe devil you do! and what for?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to get some sleep, now and then.\u201d \u201cSleep! well, what hinders your sleeping?\u201d \u201cI could tell, I suppose, if you want to hear,\u201d said Cassy, dryly. \u201cSpeak out, you minx!\u201d said Legree. \u201cO! nothing. I suppose it wouldn\u2019t disturb _you!_ Only groans, and people scuffing, and rolling round on the garret floor, half the night, from twelve to morning!\u201d \u201cPeople up garret!\u201d said Legree, uneasily, but forcing a laugh; \u201cwho are they, Cassy?\u201d Cassy raised her sharp, black eyes, and looked in the face of Legree, with an expression that went through his bones, as she said, \u201cTo be sure, Simon, who are they?", " \u201cI\u2019ll have this yer thing examined. I\u2019ll look into it, this very night. I\u2019ll take my pistols--\u201d \u201cDo,\u201d said Cassy; \u201csleep in that room. I\u2019d like to see you doing it. Fire your pistols,--do!\u201d Legree stamped his foot, and swore violently. \u201cDon\u2019t swear,\u201d said Cassy; \u201cnobody knows who may be hearing you. Hark! What was that?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d said Legree, starting. A heavy old Dutch clock, that stood in the corner of the room, began, and slowly struck twelve. For some reason or other, Legree neither spoke nor moved; a vague horror fell on him; while Cassy, with a keen, sneering glitter in her eyes, stood looking at him, counting the strokes. \u201cTwelve o\u2019clock; well _now_ we\u2019ll see,\u201d said she, turning, and opening the door into the passage-way, and standing as if listening. \u201cHark!

Hark!\u201d A wild shriek came pealing down the stairway. It came from the garret. Legree\u2019s knees knocked together; his face grew white with fear. \u201cHadn\u2019t you better get your pistols?\u201d said Cassy, with a sneer that froze Legree\u2019s blood. \u201cIt\u2019s time this thing was looked into, you know. I\u2019d like to have you go up now; _they\u2019re at it_.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t go!\u201d said Legree, with an oath.", " There was that strange light in her eyes that always impressed Legree with uneasiness. \u201cThem noises was nothing but rats and the wind,\u201d said Legree. \u201cRats will make a devil of a noise. I used to hear \u2019em sometimes down in the hold of the ship; and wind,--Lord\u2019s sake! ye can make anything out o\u2019 wind.\u201d Cassy knew Legree was uneasy under her eyes, and, therefore, she made no answer, but sat fixing them on him, with that strange, unearthly expression, as before. \u201cCome, speak out, woman,--don\u2019t you think so?\u201d said Legree. \u201cCan rats walk down stairs, and come walking through the entry, and open a door when you\u2019ve locked it and set a chair against it?\u201d said Cassy; \u201cand come walk, walk, walking right up to your bed, and put out their hand, so?\u201d Cassy kept her glittering eyes fixed on Legree, as she spoke, and he stared at her like a man in the nightmare, till, when she finished by laying her hand, icy cold, on his, he sprung back, with an oath. \u201cWoman! what do you mean? Nobody did?\u201d \u201cO, no,--of course not,--did I say they did?\u201d said Cassy, with a smile of chilling derision. \u201cBut--did--have you really seen?--Come, Cass, what is it, now,--speak out!\u201d \u201cYou may sleep there, yourself,\u201d said Cassy, \u201cif you want to know.\u201d \u201cDid it come from the garret, Cassy?\u201d \u201c_It_,--what?\u201d said Cassy. \u201cWhy, what you told of--\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you anything,\u201d said Cassy, with dogged sullenness. Legree walked up and down the room, uneasily.", " \u201cWhy not? There an\u2019t any such thing as ghosts, you know! Come!\u201d and Cassy flitted up the winding stairway, laughing, and looking back after him. \u201cCome on.\u201d \u201cI believe you _are_ the devil!\u201d said Legree. \u201cCome back you hag,--come back, Cass! You shan\u2019t go!\u201d But Cassy laughed wildly, and fled on. He heard her open the entry doors that led to the garret. A wild gust of wind swept down, extinguishing the candle he held in his hand, and with it the fearful, unearthly screams; they seemed to be shrieked in his very ear. Legree fled frantically into the parlor, whither, in a few moments, he was followed by Cassy, pale, calm, cold as an avenging spirit, and with that same fearful light in her eye. \u201cI hope you are satisfied,\u201d said she. \u201cBlast you, Cass!\u201d said Legree. \u201cWhat for?\u201d said Cassy. \u201cI only went up and shut the doors. _What\u2019s the matter with that garret_, Simon, do you suppose?\u201d said she. \u201cNone of your business!\u201d said Legree. \u201cO, it an\u2019t? Well,\u201d said Cassy, \u201cat any rate, I\u2019m glad _I_ don\u2019t sleep under it.\u201d Anticipating the rising of the wind, that very evening, Cassy had been up and opened the garret window. Of course, the moment the doors were opened, the wind had drafted down, and extinguished the light. This may serve as a specimen of the game that Cassy played with Legree, until he would sooner have put his head into a lion\u2019s mouth than to have explored that garret. Meanwhile, in the night, when everybody else was asleep, Cassy slowly and carefully accumulated there a stock of provisions sufficient to afford subsistence for some time; she transferred, article by article, a greater part of her own and Emmeline\u2019s wardrobe."], "What experience prompts Tom Loker to abandon slave hunting and live a pious life?": [" \u201cPapa, do buy him! it\u2019s no matter what you pay,\u201d whispered Eva, softly, getting up on a package, and putting her arm around her father\u2019s neck. \u201cYou have money enough, I know.

Well, now, but I\u2019m not sure, after all, about this religion,\u201d said he, the old wicked expression returning to his eye; \u201cthe country is almost ruined with pious white people; such pious politicians as we have just before elections,--such pious goings on in all departments of church and state, that a fellow does not know who\u2019ll cheat him next.

Well, Mr. Wilson, hear what I can tell you. I had a father--one of your Kentucky gentlemen--who didn\u2019t think enough of me to keep me from being sold with his dogs and horses, to satisfy the estate, when he died. I saw my mother put up at sheriff\u2019s sale, with her seven children. They were sold before her eyes, one by one, all to different masters; and I was the youngest. She came and kneeled down before old Mas\u2019r, and begged him to buy her with me, that she might have at least one child with her; and he kicked her away with his heavy boot. I saw him do it; and the last that I heard was her moans and screams, when I was tied to his horse\u2019s neck, to be carried off to his place.\u201d \u201cWell, then?\u201d \u201cMy master traded with one of the men, and bought my oldest sister. She was a pious, good girl,--a member of the Baptist church,--and as handsome as my poor mother had been. She was well brought up, and had good manners. At first, I was glad she was bought, for I had one friend near me. I was soon sorry for it. Sir, I have stood at the door and heard her whipped, when it seemed as if every blow cut into my naked heart, and I couldn\u2019t do anything to help her; and she was whipped, sir, for wanting to live a decent Christian life, such as your laws give no slave girl a right to live; and at last I saw her chained with a trader\u2019s gang, to be sent to market in Orleans,--sent there for nothing else but that,--and that\u2019s the last I know of her.", " Well, I don\u2019t care if we do.

Do you say that the people of the free state have nothing to do with it, and can do nothing? Would to God this were true! But it is not true. The people of the free states have defended, encouraged, and participated; and are more guilty for it, before God, than the South, in that they have not the apology of education or custom. If the mothers of the free states had all felt as they should, in times past, the sons of the free states would not have been the holders, and, proverbially, the hardest masters of slaves; the sons of the free states would not have connived at the extension of slavery, in our national body; the sons of the free states would not, as they do, trade the souls and bodies of men as an equivalent to money, in their mercantile dealings. There are multitudes of slaves temporarily owned, and sold again, by merchants in northern cities; and shall the whole guilt or obloquy of slavery fall only on the South? Northern men, northern mothers, northern Christians, have something more to do than denounce their brethren at the South; they have to look to the evil among themselves. But, what can any individual do? Of that, every individual can judge. There is one thing that every individual can do,--they can see to it that _they feel right_. An atmosphere of sympathetic influence encircles every human being; and the man or woman who _feels_ strongly, healthily and justly, on the great interests of humanity, is a constant benefactor to the human race.", " The good looks of the latter won the affection of the first mate of the vessel; and, shortly after entering the port, she became his wife. George remained four years at a French university, and, applying himself with an unintermitted zeal, obtained a very thorough education. Political troubles in France, at last, led the family again to seek an asylum in this country. George\u2019s feelings and views, as an educated man, may be best expressed in a letter to one of his friends. \u201cI feel somewhat at a loss, as to my future course. True, as you have said to me, I might mingle in the circles of the whites, in this country, my shade of color is so slight, and that of my wife and family scarce perceptible. Well, perhaps, on sufferance, I might. But, to tell you the truth, I have no wish to. \u201cMy sympathies are not for my father\u2019s race, but for my mother\u2019s. To him I was no more than a fine dog or horse: to my poor heart-broken mother I was a _child_; and, though I never saw her, after the cruel sale that separated us, till she died, yet I _know_ she always loved me dearly. I know it by my own heart. When I think of all she suffered, of my own early sufferings, of the distresses and struggles of my heroic wife, of my sister, sold in the New Orleans slave-market,--though I hope to have no unchristian sentiments, yet I may be excused for saying, I have no wish to pass for an American, or to identify myself with them.", " * Dr. Joel Parker of Philadelphia.

He felt at peace about his master; for in that hour, when he had poured forth his prayer into the bosom of his Father, he had found an answer of quietness and assurance springing up within himself. In the depths of his own affectionate nature, he felt able to perceive something of the fulness of Divine love; for an old oracle hath thus written,--\u201cHe that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.\u201d Tom hoped and trusted, and was at peace. But the funeral passed, with all its pageant of black crape, and prayers, and solemn faces; and back rolled the cool, muddy waves of every-day life; and up came the everlasting hard inquiry of \u201cWhat is to be done next?\u201d It rose to the mind of Marie, as, dressed in loose morning-robes, and surrounded by anxious servants, she sat up in a great easy-chair, and inspected samples of crape and bombazine. It rose to Miss Ophelia, who began to turn her thoughts towards her northern home. It rose, in silent terrors, to the minds of the servants, who well knew the unfeeling, tyrannical character of the mistress in whose hands they were left. All knew, very well, that the indulgences which had been accorded to them were not from their mistress, but from their master; and that, now he was gone, there would be no screen between them and every tyrannous infliction which a temper soured by affliction might devise."], "Which Christian character(s) does Stowe portray as hypocritically tolerant of the cruelty of slavery?": [" She has all her life presumed on her delicacy, and her good looks, and her lady-like airs, till she forgets who she is;--and I\u2019ll give her one lesson that will bring her down, I fancy!\u201d \u201cBut, Cousin, consider that, if you destroy delicacy and a sense of shame in a young girl, you deprave her very fast.\u201d \u201cDelicacy!\u201d said Marie, with a scornful laugh,--\u201ca fine word for such as she!

I wrote orders for only fifteen lashes, and told him to put them on lightly. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s no cruelty there!\u201d \u201cNo cruelty!\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cI\u2019m sure any girl might rather be killed outright!\u201d \u201cIt might seem so to anybody with your feeling; but all these creatures get used to it; it\u2019s the only way they can be kept in order. Once let them feel that they are to take any airs about delicacy, and all that, and they\u2019ll run all over you, just as my servants always have. I\u2019ve begun now to bring them under; and I\u2019ll have them all to know that I\u2019ll send one out to be whipped, as soon as another, if they don\u2019t mind themselves!\u201d said Marie, looking around her decidedly.

After the birth of little Harry, however, she had gradually become tranquillized and settled; and every bleeding tie and throbbing nerve, once more entwined with that little life, seemed to become sound and healthful, and Eliza was a happy woman up to the time that her husband was rudely torn from his kind employer, and brought under the iron sway of his legal owner.

St. Clare said no more. It was a feeling which he had seen before in his mother; but no chord within vibrated to it. Eva, after this, declined rapidly; there was no more any doubt of the event; the fondest hope could not be blinded. Her beautiful room was avowedly a sick room; and Miss Ophelia day and night performed the duties of a nurse,--and never did her friends appreciate her value more than in that capacity. With so well-trained a hand and eye, such perfect adroitness and practice in every art which could promote neatness and comfort, and keep out of sight every disagreeable incident of sickness,--with such a perfect sense of time, such a clear, untroubled head, such exact accuracy in remembering every prescription and direction of the doctors,--she was everything to him. They who had shrugged their shoulders at her little peculiarities and setnesses, so unlike the careless freedom of southern manners, acknowledged that now she was the exact person that was wanted. Uncle Tom was much in Eva\u2019s room. The child suffered much from nervous restlessness, and it was a relief to her to be carried; and it was Tom\u2019s greatest delight to carry her little frail form in his arms, resting on a pillow, now up and down her room, now out into the verandah; and when the fresh sea-breezes blew from the lake,--and the child felt freshest in the morning,--he would sometimes walk with her under the orange-trees in the garden, or, sitting down in some of their old seats, sing to her their favorite old hymns.", " The letter ended with expressions of hope and thankfulness, and professions of undying affection, which were more bitter than death to the unhappy young man. He wrote to her immediately: \u201cI have received yours,--but too late. I believed all I heard. I was desperate. _I am married_, and all is over. Only forget,--it is all that remains for either of us.\u201d And thus ended the whole romance and ideal of life for Augustine St. Clare. But the _real_ remained,--the _real_, like the flat, bare, oozy tide-mud, when the blue sparkling wave, with all its company of gliding boats and white-winged ships, its music of oars and chiming waters, has gone down, and there it lies, flat, slimy, bare,--exceedingly real. Of course, in a novel, people\u2019s hearts break, and they die, and that is the end of it; and in a story this is very convenient. But in real life we do not die when all that makes life bright dies to us. There is a most busy and important round of eating, drinking, dressing, walking, visiting, buying, selling, talking, reading, and all that makes up what is commonly called _living_, yet to be gone through; and this yet remained to Augustine. Had his wife been a whole woman, she might yet have done something--as woman can--to mend the broken threads of life, and weave again into a tissue of brightness. But Marie St. Clare could not even see that they had been broken. As before stated, she consisted of a fine figure, a pair of splendid eyes, and a hundred thousand dollars; and none of these items were precisely the ones to minister to a mind diseased."], "What is the biggest misconception about the character of Uncle Tom?": [" Some dim ideas of imprudence or impropriety in the measure seemed to embarrass him considerably; for he often stopped, as Eliza glided forward, and looked wistfully, first at her and then at the house, and then, as if reassured by reflection, he pattered along after her again. A few minutes brought them to the window of Uncle Tom\u2019s cottage, and Eliza stopping, tapped lightly on the window-pane. The prayer-meeting at Uncle Tom\u2019s had, in the order of hymn-singing, been protracted to a very late hour; and, as Uncle Tom had indulged himself in a few lengthy solos afterwards, the consequence was, that, although it was now between twelve and one o\u2019clock, he and his worthy helpmeet were not yet asleep. \u201cGood Lord! what\u2019s that?\u201d said Aunt Chloe, starting up and hastily drawing the curtain. \u201cMy sakes alive, if it an\u2019t Lizy!

I\u2019m gwine to open the door.\u201d And suiting the action to the word, the door flew open, and the light of the tallow candle, which Tom had hastily lighted, fell on the haggard face and dark, wild eyes of the fugitive. \u201cLord bless you!--I\u2019m skeered to look at ye, Lizy! Are ye tuck sick, or what\u2019s come over ye?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m running away--Uncle Tom and Aunt Chloe--carrying off my child--Master sold him!\u201d \u201cSold him?\u201d echoed both, lifting up their hands in dismay. \u201cYes, sold him!\u201d said Eliza, firmly; \u201cI crept into the closet by Mistress\u2019 door tonight, and I heard Master tell Missis that he had sold my Harry, and you, Uncle Tom, both, to a trader; and that he was going off this morning on his horse, and that the man was to take possession today.\u201d Tom had stood, during this speech, with his hands raised, and his eyes dilated, like a man in a dream.", " Now, what\u2019s your name?\u201d \u201cMy name\u2019s Tom; the little chil\u2019en used to call me Uncle Tom, way back thar in Kentuck.\u201d \u201cThen I mean to call you Uncle Tom, because, you see, I like you,\u201d said Eva. \u201cSo, Uncle Tom, where are you going?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, Miss Eva.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t know?\u201d said Eva. \u201cNo, I am going to be sold to somebody. I don\u2019t know who.\u201d \u201cMy papa can buy you,\u201d said Eva, quickly; \u201cand if he buys you, you will have good times. I mean to ask him, this very day.\u201d \u201cThank you, my little lady,\u201d said Tom. The boat here stopped at a small landing to take in wood, and Eva, hearing her father\u2019s voice, bounded nimbly away. Tom rose up, and went forward to offer his service in wooding, and soon was busy among the hands. Eva and her father were standing together by the railings to see the boat start from the landing-place, the wheel had made two or three revolutions in the water, when, by some sudden movement, the little one suddenly lost her balance and fell sheer over the side of the boat into the water. Her father, scarce knowing what he did, was plunging in after her, but was held back by some behind him, who saw that more efficient aid had followed his child. Tom was standing just under her on the lower deck, as she fell. He saw her strike the water, and sink, and was after her in a moment. A broad-chested, strong-armed fellow, it was nothing for him to keep afloat in the water, till, in a moment or two the child rose to the surface, and he caught her in his arms, and, swimming with her to the boat-side, handed her up, all dripping, to the grasp of hundreds of hands, which, as if they had all belonged to one man, were stretched eagerly out to receive her.", " \u201cThere\u2019s a \u2019sea of glass, mingled with fire.\u2019\u201d \u201cTrue enough, Miss Eva,\u201d said Tom; and Tom sang-- \u201cO, had I the wings of the morning, I\u2019d fly away to Canaan\u2019s shore; Bright angels should convey me home, To the new Jerusalem.\u201d \u201cWhere do you suppose new Jerusalem is, Uncle Tom?\u201d said Eva. \u201cO, up in the clouds, Miss Eva.\u201d \u201cThen I think I see it,\u201d said Eva. \u201cLook in those clouds!--they look like great gates of pearl; and you can see beyond them--far, far off--it\u2019s all gold. Tom, sing about \u2019spirits bright.\u2019\u201d Tom sung the words of a well-known Methodist hymn, \u201cI see a band of spirits bright, That taste the glories there; They all are robed in spotless white, And conquering palms they bear.\u201d \u201cUncle Tom, I\u2019ve seen _them_,\u201d said Eva. Tom had no doubt of it at all; it did not surprise him in the least. If Eva had told him she had been to heaven, he would have thought it entirely probable. \u201cThey come to me sometimes in my sleep, those spirits;\u201d and Eva\u2019s eyes grew dreamy, and she hummed, in a low voice, \u201cThey are all robed in spotless white, And conquering palms they bear.\u201d \u201cUncle Tom,\u201d said Eva, \u201cI\u2019m going there.\u201d \u201cWhere, Miss Eva?\u201d The child rose, and pointed her little hand to the sky; the glow of evening lit her golden hair and flushed cheek with a kind of unearthly radiance, and her eyes were bent earnestly on the skies. \u201cI\u2019m going _there_,\u201d she said, \u201cto the spirits bright, Tom; _I\u2019m going, before long_.\u201d The faithful old heart felt a sudden thrust; and Tom thought how often he had noticed, within six months, that Eva\u2019s little hands had grown thinner, and her skin more transparent, and her breath shorter; and how, when she ran or played in the garden, as she once could for hours, she became soon so tired and languid.", " \u201cO, Uncle Tom! what funny things you _are_ making, there!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m trying to write to my poor old woman, Miss Eva, and my little chil\u2019en,\u201d said Tom, drawing the back of his hand over his eyes; \u201cbut, some how, I\u2019m feard I shan\u2019t make it out.\u201d \u201cI wish I could help you, Tom! I\u2019ve learnt to write some. Last year I could make all the letters, but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve forgotten.\u201d So Eva put her golden head close to his, and the two commenced a grave and anxious discussion, each one equally earnest, and about equally ignorant; and, with a deal of consulting and advising over every word, the composition began, as they both felt very sanguine, to look quite like writing. \u201cYes, Uncle Tom, it really begins to look beautiful,\u201d said Eva, gazing delightedly on it. \u201cHow pleased your wife\u2019ll be, and the poor little children! O, it\u2019s a shame you ever had to go away from them! I mean to ask papa to let you go back, some time.\u201d \u201cMissis said that she would send down money for me, as soon as they could get it together,\u201d said Tom. \u201cI\u2019m \u2019spectin, she will. Young Mas\u2019r George, he said he\u2019d come for me; and he gave me this yer dollar as a sign;\u201d and Tom drew from under his clothes the precious dollar. \u201cO, he\u2019ll certainly come, then!\u201d said Eva. \u201cI\u2019m so glad!\u201d \u201cAnd I wanted to send a letter, you know, to let \u2019em know whar I was, and tell poor Chloe that I was well off,--cause she felt so drefful, poor soul!\u201d \u201cI say Tom!\u201d said St. Clare\u2019s voice, coming in the door at this moment."], "What event provides the motivation for Shelby to release all the slaves?": [" So, in short, Haley,\u201d said he, suddenly dropping from the tone of dignified coolness to his ordinary one of easy frankness, \u201cthe best way for you is to keep good-natured and eat some breakfast, and we will then see what is to be done.\u201d Mrs. Shelby now rose, and said her engagements would prevent her being at the breakfast-table that morning; and, deputing a very respectable mulatto woman to attend to the gentlemen\u2019s coffee at the side-board, she left the room. \u201cOld lady don\u2019t like your humble servant, over and above,\u201d said Haley, with an uneasy effort to be very familiar. \u201cI am not accustomed to hear my wife spoken of with such freedom,\u201d said Mr. Shelby, dryly. \u201cBeg pardon; of course, only a joke, you know,\u201d said Haley, forcing a laugh. \u201cSome jokes are less agreeable than others,\u201d rejoined Shelby. \u201cDevilish free, now I\u2019ve signed those papers, cuss him!\u201d muttered Haley to himself; \u201cquite grand, since yesterday!\u201d Never did fall of any prime minister at court occasion wider surges of sensation than the report of Tom\u2019s fate among his compeers on the place. It was the topic in every mouth, everywhere; and nothing was done in the house or in the field, but to discuss its probable results. Eliza\u2019s flight--an unprecedented event on the place--was also a great accessory in stimulating the general excitement. Black Sam, as he was commonly called, from his being about three shades blacker than any other son of ebony on the place, was revolving the matter profoundly in all its phases and bearings, with a comprehensiveness of vision and a strict lookout to his own personal well-being, that would have done credit to any white patriot in Washington.", " CHAPTER XXI Kentuck Our readers may not be unwilling to glance back, for a brief interval, at Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, on the Kentucky farm, and see what has been transpiring among those whom he had left behind. It was late in the summer afternoon, and the doors and windows of the large parlor all stood open, to invite any stray breeze, that might feel in a good humor, to enter. Mr. Shelby sat in a large hall opening into the room, and running through the whole length of the house, to a balcony on either end. Leisurely tipped back on one chair, with his heels in another, he was enjoying his after-dinner cigar. Mrs. Shelby sat in the door, busy about some fine sewing; she seemed like one who had something on her mind, which she was seeking an opportunity to introduce. \u201cDo you know,\u201d she said, \u201cthat Chloe has had a letter from Tom?\u201d \u201cAh! has she? Tom \u2019s got some friend there, it seems. How is the old boy?\u201d \u201cHe has been bought by a very fine family, I should think,\u201d said Mrs. Shelby,--\u201cis kindly treated, and has not much to do.\u201d \u201cAh! well, I\u2019m glad of it,--very glad,\u201d said Mr. Shelby, heartily. \u201cTom, I suppose, will get reconciled to a Southern residence;--hardly want to come up here again.\u201d \u201cOn the contrary he inquires very anxiously,\u201d said Mrs. Shelby, \u201cwhen the money for his redemption is to be raised.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure _I_ don\u2019t know,\u201d said Mr. Shelby. \u201cOnce get business running wrong, there does seem to be no end to it.", " \u201cIt will have to come out,\u201d said he, mentally; \u201cas well now as ever.\u201d \u201cI told Eliza,\u201d said Mrs. Shelby, as she continued brushing her hair, \u201cthat she was a little fool for her pains, and that you never had anything to do with that sort of persons. Of course, I knew you never meant to sell any of our people,--least of all, to such a fellow.\u201d \u201cWell, Emily,\u201d said her husband, \u201cso I have always felt and said; but the fact is that my business lies so that I cannot get on without. I shall have to sell some of my hands.\u201d \u201cTo that creature? Impossible! Mr. Shelby, you cannot be serious.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say that I am,\u201d said Mr. Shelby. \u201cI\u2019ve agreed to sell Tom.\u201d \u201cWhat! our Tom?--that good, faithful creature!--been your faithful servant from a boy! O, Mr. Shelby!--and you have promised him his freedom, too,--you and I have spoken to him a hundred times of it. Well, I can believe anything now,--I can believe _now_ that you could sell little Harry, poor Eliza\u2019s only child!\u201d said Mrs. Shelby, in a tone between grief and indignation. \u201cWell, since you must know all, it is so. I have agreed to sell Tom and Harry both; and I don\u2019t know why I am to be rated, as if I were a monster, for doing what every one does every day.\u201d \u201cBut why, of all others, choose these?\u201d said Mrs. Shelby. \u201cWhy sell them, of all on the place, if you must sell at all?\u201d \u201cBecause they will bring the highest sum of any,--that\u2019s why.", " He was lounging in a large easy-chair, looking over some letters that had come in the afternoon mail, and she was standing before her mirror, brushing out the complicated braids and curls in which Eliza had arranged her hair; for, noticing her pale cheeks and haggard eyes, she had excused her attendance that night, and ordered her to bed. The employment, naturally enough, suggested her conversation with the girl in the morning; and turning to her husband, she said, carelessly, \u201cBy the by, Arthur, who was that low-bred fellow that you lugged in to our dinner-table today?\u201d \u201cHaley is his name,\u201d said Shelby, turning himself rather uneasily in his chair, and continuing with his eyes fixed on a letter. \u201cHaley! Who is he, and what may be his business here, pray?\u201d \u201cWell, he\u2019s a man that I transacted some business with, last time I was at Natchez,\u201d said Mr. Shelby. \u201cAnd he presumed on it to make himself quite at home, and call and dine here, ay?\u201d \u201cWhy, I invited him; I had some accounts with him,\u201d said Shelby. \u201cIs he a negro-trader?\u201d said Mrs. Shelby, noticing a certain embarrassment in her husband\u2019s manner. \u201cWhy, my dear, what put that into your head?\u201d said Shelby, looking up. \u201cNothing,--only Eliza came in here, after dinner, in a great worry, crying and taking on, and said you were talking with a trader, and that she heard him make an offer for her boy--the ridiculous little goose!\u201d \u201cShe did, hey?\u201d said Mr. Shelby, returning to his paper, which he seemed for a few moments quite intent upon, not perceiving that he was holding it bottom upwards."], "Who is Ophelia a surrogate for in the novel?": [" The letter ended with expressions of hope and thankfulness, and professions of undying affection, which were more bitter than death to the unhappy young man. He wrote to her immediately: \u201cI have received yours,--but too late. I believed all I heard. I was desperate. _I am married_, and all is over. Only forget,--it is all that remains for either of us.\u201d And thus ended the whole romance and ideal of life for Augustine St. Clare. But the _real_ remained,--the _real_, like the flat, bare, oozy tide-mud, when the blue sparkling wave, with all its company of gliding boats and white-winged ships, its music of oars and chiming waters, has gone down, and there it lies, flat, slimy, bare,--exceedingly real. Of course, in a novel, people\u2019s hearts break, and they die, and that is the end of it; and in a story this is very convenient. But in real life we do not die when all that makes life bright dies to us. There is a most busy and important round of eating, drinking, dressing, walking, visiting, buying, selling, talking, reading, and all that makes up what is commonly called _living_, yet to be gone through; and this yet remained to Augustine. Had his wife been a whole woman, she might yet have done something--as woman can--to mend the broken threads of life, and weave again into a tissue of brightness. But Marie St. Clare could not even see that they had been broken. As before stated, she consisted of a fine figure, a pair of splendid eyes, and a hundred thousand dollars; and none of these items were precisely the ones to minister to a mind diseased.", " \u201cBut not legally;--I want her to be mine legally,\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cWhew! cousin,\u201d said Augustine. \u201cWhat will the Abolition Society think? They\u2019ll have a day of fasting appointed for this backsliding, if you become a slaveholder!\u201d \u201cO, nonsense! I want her mine, that I may have a right to take her to the free States, and give her her liberty, that all I am trying to do be not undone.\u201d \u201cO, cousin, what an awful \u2019doing evil that good may come\u2019! I can\u2019t encourage it.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want you to joke, but to reason,\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cThere is no use in my trying to make this child a Christian child, unless I save her from all the chances and reverses of slavery; and, if you really are willing I should have her, I want you to give me a deed of gift, or some legal paper.\u201d \u201cWell, well,\u201d said St. Clare, \u201cI will;\u201d and he sat down, and unfolded a newspaper to read. \u201cBut I want it done now,\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cWhat\u2019s your hurry?\u201d \u201cBecause now is the only time there ever is to do a thing in,\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cCome, now, here\u2019s paper, pen, and ink; just write a paper.\u201d St. Clare, like most men of his class of mind, cordially hated the present tense of action, generally; and, therefore, he was considerably annoyed by Miss Ophelia\u2019s downrightness. \u201cWhy, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d said he. \u201cCan\u2019t you take my word? One would think you had taken lessons of the Jews, coming at a fellow so!\u201d \u201cI want to make sure of it,\u201d said Miss Ophelia.", " Tom and Miss Ophelia alone seemed to have any presence of mind; for Marie was in strong hysteric convulsions. At Miss Ophelia\u2019s direction, one of the lounges in the parlor was hastily prepared, and the bleeding form laid upon it. St. Clare had fainted, through pain and loss of blood; but, as Miss Ophelia applied restoratives, he revived, opened his eyes, looked fixedly on them, looked earnestly around the room, his eyes travelling wistfully over every object, and finally they rested on his mother\u2019s picture. The physician now arrived, and made his examination. It was evident, from the expression of his face, that there was no hope; but he applied himself to dressing the wound, and he and Miss Ophelia and Tom proceeded composedly with this work, amid the lamentations and sobs and cries of the affrighted servants, who had clustered about the doors and windows of the verandah. \u201cNow,\u201d said the physician, \u201cwe must turn all these creatures out; all depends on his being kept quiet.\u201d St. Clare opened his eyes, and looked fixedly on the distressed beings, whom Miss Ophelia and the doctor were trying to urge from the apartment. \u201cPoor creatures!\u201d he said, and an expression of bitter self-reproach passed over his face. Adolph absolutely refused to go. Terror had deprived him of all presence of mind; he threw himself along the floor, and nothing could persuade him to rise. The rest yielded to Miss Ophelia\u2019s urgent representations, that their master\u2019s safety depended on their stillness and obedience.", " No! the ear that has never heard anything but abuse is strangely incredulous of anything so heavenly as kindness; and Topsy only thought Eva\u2019s speech something funny and inexplicable,--she did not believe it. But what was to be done with Topsy? Miss Ophelia found the case a puzzler; her rules for bringing up didn\u2019t seem to apply. She thought she would take time to think of it; and, by the way of gaining time, and in hopes of some indefinite moral virtues supposed to be inherent in dark closets, Miss Ophelia shut Topsy up in one till she had arranged her ideas further on the subject. \u201cI don\u2019t see,\u201d said Miss Ophelia to St. Clare, \u201chow I\u2019m going to manage that child, without whipping her.\u201d \u201cWell, whip her, then, to your heart\u2019s content; I\u2019ll give you full power to do what you like.\u201d \u201cChildren always have to be whipped,\u201d said Miss Ophelia; \u201cI never heard of bringing them up without.\u201d \u201cO, well, certainly,\u201d said St. Clare; \u201cdo as you think best. Only I\u2019ll make one suggestion: I\u2019ve seen this child whipped with a poker, knocked down with the shovel or tongs, whichever came handiest, &c.; and, seeing that she is used to that style of operation, I think your whippings will have to be pretty energetic, to make much impression.\u201d \u201cWhat is to be done with her, then?\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cYou have started a serious question,\u201d said St. Clare; \u201cI wish you\u2019d answer it. What is to be done with a human being that can be governed only by the lash,--_that_ fails,--it\u2019s a very common state of things down here!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure I don\u2019t know; I never saw such a child as this.\u201d \u201cSuch children are very common among us, and such men and women, too."], "Who does Simon show legitimate affection for?": [" \u201cYes, indeed.

Tell ye, sir, the flesh on \u2019t has come jest like a stone, practising on nigger--feel on it.\u201d The stranger applied his fingers to the implement in question, and simply said, \u201c\u2018T is hard enough; and, I suppose,\u201d he added, \u201cpractice has made your heart just like it.\u201d \u201cWhy, yes, I may say so,\u201d said Simon, with a hearty laugh. \u201cI reckon there\u2019s as little soft in me as in any one going.

Stout fellers last six or seven years; trashy ones gets worked up in two or three.", " You\u2019s got to look chipper, I tell ye!\u201d \u201cI say, all on ye,\u201d he said retreating a pace or two back, \u201clook at me,--look at me,--look me right in the eye,--_straight_, now!\u201d said he, stamping his foot at every pause. As by a fascination, every eye was now directed to the glaring greenish-gray eye of Simon. \u201cNow,\u201d said he, doubling his great, heavy fist into something resembling a blacksmith\u2019s hammer, \u201cd\u2019ye see this fist?

So, now, mind yerselves; for I don\u2019t show no mercy!\u201d The women involuntarily drew in their breath, and the whole gang sat with downcast, dejected faces. Meanwhile, Simon turned on his heel, and marched up to the bar of the boat for a dram. \u201cThat\u2019s the way I begin with my niggers,\u201d he said, to a gentlemanly man, who had stood by him during his speech. \u201cIt\u2019s my system to begin strong,--just let \u2019em know what to expect.\u201d \u201cIndeed!\u201d said the stranger, looking upon him with the curiosity of a naturalist studying some out-of-the-way specimen.", " Legree was just mixing himself a tumbler of punch, pouring his hot water from a cracked and broken-nosed pitcher, grumbling, as he did so, \u201cPlague on that Sambo, to kick up this yer row between me and the new hands! The fellow won\u2019t be fit to work for a week, now,--right in the press of the season!\u201d \u201cYes, just like you,\u201d said a voice, behind his chair.

He only glared for a moment on the downcast face of Tom, and walked off. He took Tom\u2019s trunk, which contained a very neat and abundant wardrobe, to the forecastle, where it was soon surrounded by various hands of the boat. With much laughing, at the expense of niggers who tried to be gentlemen, the articles very readily were sold to one and another, and the empty trunk finally put up at auction. It was a good joke, they all thought, especially to see how Tom looked after his things, as they were going this way and that; and then the auction of the trunk, that was funnier than all, and occasioned abundant witticisms. This little affair being over, Simon sauntered up again to his property. \u201cNow, Tom, I\u2019ve relieved you of any extra baggage, you see. Take mighty good care of them clothes. It\u2019ll be long enough \u2019fore you get more. I go in for making niggers careful; one suit has to do for one year, on my place.\u201d Simon next walked up to the place where Emmeline was sitting, chained to another woman. \u201cWell, my dear,\u201d he said, chucking her under the chin, \u201ckeep up your spirits.\u201d The involuntary look of horror, fright and aversion, with which the girl regarded him, did not escape his eye. He frowned fiercely. \u201cNone o\u2019 your shines, gal! you\u2019s got to keep a pleasant face, when I speak to ye,--d\u2019ye hear? And you, you old yellow poco moonshine!\u201d he said, giving a shove to the mulatto woman to whom Emmeline was chained, \u201cdon\u2019t you carry that sort of face!"], "Where is the evil of slavery shown in its most hideous form?": [" \u201cThis is God\u2019s curse on slavery!--a bitter, bitter, most accursed thing!--a curse to the master and a curse to the slave! I was a fool to think I could make anything good out of such a deadly evil. It is a sin to hold a slave under laws like ours,--I always felt it was,--I always thought so when I was a girl,--I thought so still more after I joined the church; but I thought I could gild it over,--I thought, by kindness, and care, and instruction, I could make the condition of mine better than freedom--fool that I was!\u201d \u201cWhy, wife, you are getting to be an abolitionist, quite.\u201d \u201cAbolitionist! if they knew all I know about slavery, they _might_ talk! We don\u2019t need them to tell us; you know I never thought that slavery was right--never felt willing to own slaves.\u201d \u201cWell, therein you differ from many wise and pious men,\u201d said Mr. Shelby. \u201cYou remember Mr. B.\u2019s sermon, the other Sunday?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear such sermons; I never wish to hear Mr. B. in our church again. Ministers can\u2019t help the evil, perhaps,--can\u2019t cure it, any more than we can,--but defend it!--it always went against my common sense. And I think you didn\u2019t think much of that sermon, either.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Shelby, \u201cI must say these ministers sometimes carry matters further than we poor sinners would exactly dare to do. We men of the world must wink pretty hard at various things, and get used to a deal that isn\u2019t the exact thing.", " At last, raising his head with a sudden effort--\u201cMr. Wilson, you have shown yourself a Christian in your treatment of me,--I want to ask one last deed of Christian kindness of you.\u201d \u201cWell, George.\u201d \u201cWell, sir,--what you said was true. I _am_ running a dreadful risk. There isn\u2019t, on earth, a living soul to care if I die,\u201d he added, drawing his breath hard, and speaking with a great effort,--\u201cI shall be kicked out and buried like a dog, and nobody\u2019ll think of it a day after,--_only my poor wife!_ Poor soul! she\u2019ll mourn and grieve; and if you\u2019d only contrive, Mr. Wilson, to send this little pin to her. She gave it to me for a Christmas present, poor child! Give it to her, and tell her I loved her to the last. Will you? _Will_ you?\u201d he added, earnestly. \u201cYes, certainly--poor fellow!\u201d said the old gentleman, taking the pin, with watery eyes, and a melancholy quiver in his voice. \u201cTell her one thing,\u201d said George; \u201cit\u2019s my last wish, if she _can_ get to Canada, to go there. No matter how kind her mistress is,--no matter how much she loves her home; beg her not to go back,--for slavery always ends in misery. Tell her to bring up our boy a free man, and then he won\u2019t suffer as I have. Tell her this, Mr. Wilson, will you?\u201d \u201cYes, George. I\u2019ll tell her; but I trust you won\u2019t die; take heart,--you\u2019re a brave fellow. Trust in the Lord, George. I wish in my heart you were safe through, though,--that\u2019s what I do.\u201d \u201c_Is_ there a God to trust in?\u201d said George, in such a tone of bitter despair as arrested the old gentleman\u2019s words.", " Such instances save us from utter despair of our kind. But, she asks any person, who knows the world, are such characters _common_, anywhere? For many years of her life, the author avoided all reading upon or allusion to the subject of slavery, considering it as too painful to be inquired into, and one which advancing light and civilization would certainly live down. But, since the legislative act of 1850, when she heard, with perfect surprise and consternation, Christian and humane people actually recommending the remanding escaped fugitives into slavery, as a duty binding on good citizens,--when she heard, on all hands, from kind, compassionate and estimable people, in the free states of the North, deliberations and discussions as to what Christian duty could be on this head,--she could only think, These men and Christians cannot know what slavery is; if they did, such a question could never be open for discussion. And from this arose a desire to exhibit it in a _living dramatic reality_. She has endeavored to show it fairly, in its best and its worst phases. In its _best_ aspect, she has, perhaps, been successful; but, oh! who shall say what yet remains untold in that valley and shadow of death, that lies the other side? To you, generous, noble-minded men and women, of the South,--you, whose virtue, and magnanimity and purity of character, are the greater for the severer trial it has encountered,--to you is her appeal.", " Two days after, the lawyer of the Christian firm of B. & Co., New York, send on their money to them. On the reverse of that draft, so obtained, let them write these words of the great Paymaster, to whom they shall make up their account in a future day: _\u201cWhen he maketh inquisition for blood, he forgetteth not the cry of the humble!\u201d_ CHAPTER XXXI The Middle Passage \u201cThou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look upon iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he?\u201d--HAB. 1: 13. On the lower part of a small, mean boat, on the Red River, Tom sat,--chains on his wrists, chains on his feet, and a weight heavier than chains lay on his heart. All had faded from his sky,--moon and star; all had passed by him, as the trees and banks were now passing, to return no more. Kentucky home, with wife and children, and indulgent owners; St. Clare home, with all its refinements and splendors; the golden head of Eva, with its saint-like eyes; the proud, gay, handsome, seemingly careless, yet ever-kind St. Clare; hours of ease and indulgent leisure,--all gone! and in place thereof, _what_ remains? It is one of the bitterest apportionments of a lot of slavery, that the negro, sympathetic and assimilative, after acquiring, in a refined family, the tastes and feelings which form the atmosphere of such a place, is not the less liable to become the bond-slave of the coarsest and most brutal,--just as a chair or table, which once decorated the superb saloon, comes, at last, battered and defaced, to the barroom of some filthy tavern, or some low haunt of vulgar debauchery."], "Who is the most morally perfect white character in the novel?": [" There now, put my back hair up in that pretty braid you learnt the other day, and don\u2019t go listening at doors any more.\u201d \u201cWell, but, missis, _you_ never would give your consent--to--to--\u201d \u201cNonsense, child! to be sure, I shouldn\u2019t. What do you talk so for? I would as soon have one of my own children sold. But really, Eliza, you are getting altogether too proud of that little fellow. A man can\u2019t put his nose into the door, but you think he must be coming to buy him.\u201d Reassured by her mistress\u2019 confident tone, Eliza proceeded nimbly and adroitly with her toilet, laughing at her own fears, as she proceeded. Mrs. Shelby was a woman of high class, both intellectually and morally. To that natural magnanimity and generosity of mind which one often marks as characteristic of the women of Kentucky, she added high moral and religious sensibility and principle, carried out with great energy and ability into practical results. Her husband, who made no professions to any particular religious character, nevertheless reverenced and respected the consistency of hers, and stood, perhaps, a little in awe of her opinion. Certain it was that he gave her unlimited scope in all her benevolent efforts for the comfort, instruction, and improvement of her servants, though he never took any decided part in them himself. In fact, if not exactly a believer in the doctrine of the efficiency of the extra good works of saints, he really seemed somehow or other to fancy that his wife had piety and benevolence enough for two--to indulge a shadowy expectation of getting into heaven through her superabundance of qualities to which he made no particular pretension.", " The letter ended with expressions of hope and thankfulness, and professions of undying affection, which were more bitter than death to the unhappy young man. He wrote to her immediately: \u201cI have received yours,--but too late. I believed all I heard. I was desperate. _I am married_, and all is over. Only forget,--it is all that remains for either of us.\u201d And thus ended the whole romance and ideal of life for Augustine St. Clare. But the _real_ remained,--the _real_, like the flat, bare, oozy tide-mud, when the blue sparkling wave, with all its company of gliding boats and white-winged ships, its music of oars and chiming waters, has gone down, and there it lies, flat, slimy, bare,--exceedingly real. Of course, in a novel, people\u2019s hearts break, and they die, and that is the end of it; and in a story this is very convenient. But in real life we do not die when all that makes life bright dies to us. There is a most busy and important round of eating, drinking, dressing, walking, visiting, buying, selling, talking, reading, and all that makes up what is commonly called _living_, yet to be gone through; and this yet remained to Augustine. Had his wife been a whole woman, she might yet have done something--as woman can--to mend the broken threads of life, and weave again into a tissue of brightness. But Marie St. Clare could not even see that they had been broken. As before stated, she consisted of a fine figure, a pair of splendid eyes, and a hundred thousand dollars; and none of these items were precisely the ones to minister to a mind diseased.", " The personal appearance of Eliza, the character ascribed to her, are sketches drawn from life. The incorruptible fidelity, piety and honesty, of Uncle Tom, had more than one development, to her personal knowledge. Some of the most deeply tragic and romantic, some of the most terrible incidents, have also their parallels in reality. The incident of the mother\u2019s crossing the Ohio river on the ice is a well-known fact. The story of \u201cold Prue,\u201d in the second volume, was an incident that fell under the personal observation of a brother of the writer, then collecting-clerk to a large mercantile house, in New Orleans. From the same source was derived the character of the planter Legree. Of him her brother thus wrote, speaking of visiting his plantation, on a collecting tour; \u201cHe actually made me feel of his fist, which was like a blacksmith\u2019s hammer, or a nodule of iron, telling me that it was \u2018calloused with knocking down niggers.\u2019 When I left the plantation, I drew a long breath, and felt as if I had escaped from an ogre\u2019s den.\u201d That the tragical fate of Tom, also, has too many times had its parallel, there are living witnesses, all over our land, to testify. Let it be remembered that in all southern states it is a principle of jurisprudence that no person of colored lineage can testify in a suit against a white, and it will be easy to see that such a case may occur, wherever there is a man whose passions outweigh his interests, and a slave who has manhood or principle enough to resist his will.", " Legree had trained them in savageness and brutality as systematically as he had his bull-dogs; and, by long practice in hardness and cruelty, brought their whole nature to about the same range of capacities. It is a common remark, and one that is thought to militate strongly against the character of the race, that the negro overseer is always more tyrannical and cruel than the white one. This is simply saying that the negro mind has been more crushed and debased than the white. It is no more true of this race than of every oppressed race, the world over. The slave is always a tyrant, if he can get a chance to be one. Legree, like some potentates we read of in history, governed his plantation by a sort of resolution of forces. Sambo and Quimbo cordially hated each other; the plantation hands, one and all, cordially hated them; and, by playing off one against another, he was pretty sure, through one or the other of the three parties, to get informed of whatever was on foot in the place. Nobody can live entirely without social intercourse; and Legree encouraged his two black satellites to a kind of coarse familiarity with him,--a familiarity, however, at any moment liable to get one or the other of them into trouble; for, on the slightest provocation, one of them always stood ready, at a nod, to be a minister of his vengeance on the other. As they stood there now by Legree, they seemed an apt illustration of the fact that brutal men are lower even than animals."], "What does Stowe imply a parallel to with the oppression of blacks?": [" * Dr. Joel Parker of Philadelphia. [Mrs. Stowe\u2019s note.] Presbyterian clergyman (1798-1873), a friend of the Beecher family. Mrs. Stowe attempted unsuccessfully to have this identifying note removed from the stereotype-plate of the first edition. Tom drew near, and tried to say something; but she only groaned. Honestly, and with tears running down his own cheeks, he spoke of a heart of love in the skies, of a pitying Jesus, and an eternal home; but the ear was deaf with anguish, and the palsied heart could not feel. Night came on,--night calm, unmoved, and glorious, shining down with her innumerable and solemn angel eyes, twinkling, beautiful, but silent. There was no speech nor language, no pitying voice or helping hand, from that distant sky. One after another, the voices of business or pleasure died away; all on the boat were sleeping, and the ripples at the prow were plainly heard. Tom stretched himself out on a box, and there, as he lay, he heard, ever and anon, a smothered sob or cry from the prostrate creature,--\u201cO! what shall I do? O Lord! O good Lord, do help me!\u201d and so, ever and anon, until the murmur died away in silence. At midnight, Tom waked, with a sudden start. Something black passed quickly by him to the side of the boat, and he heard a splash in the water. No one else saw or heard anything. He raised his head,--the woman\u2019s place was vacant! He got up, and sought about him in vain.", " But the brave, true heart was firm on the Eternal Rock. Like his Master, he knew that, if he saved others, himself he could not save; nor could utmost extremity wring from him words, save of prayers and holy trust. \u201cHe\u2019s most gone, Mas\u2019r,\u201d said Sambo, touched, in spite of himself, by the patience of his victim. \u201cPay away, till he gives up! Give it to him!--give it to him!\u201d shouted Legree. \u201cI\u2019ll take every drop of blood he has, unless he confesses!\u201d Tom opened his eyes, and looked upon his master. \u201cYe poor miserable critter!\u201d he said, \u201cthere ain\u2019t no more ye can do! I forgive ye, with all my soul!\u201d and he fainted entirely away. \u201cI b\u2019lieve, my soul, he\u2019s done for, finally,\u201d said Legree, stepping forward, to look at him. \u201cYes, he is! Well, his mouth\u2019s shut up, at last,--that\u2019s one comfort!\u201d Yes, Legree; but who shall shut up that voice in thy soul? that soul, past repentance, past prayer, past hope, in whom the fire that never shall be quenched is already burning! Yet Tom was not quite gone. His wondrous words and pious prayers had struck upon the hearts of the imbruted blacks, who had been the instruments of cruelty upon him; and, the instant Legree withdrew, they took him down, and, in their ignorance, sought to call him back to life,--as if _that_ were any favor to him. \u201cSartin, we \u2019s been doin\u2019 a drefful wicked thing!\u201d said Sambo; \u201chopes Mas\u2019r\u2019ll have to \u2019count for it, and not we.\u201d They washed his wounds,--they provided a rude bed, of some refuse cotton, for him to lie down on; and one of them, stealing up to the house, begged a drink of brandy of Legree, pretending that he was tired, and wanted it for himself.", " The hearts of those that saw her were touched with pity for her fate. They offered eighteen hundred dollars to redeem her; and some there were who offered to give, that would not have much left after the gift; but the fiend of a slave-trader was inexorable. She was despatched to New Orleans; but, when about half way there, God had mercy on her, and smote her with death. There were two girls named Edmundson in the same company. When about to be sent to the same market, an older sister went to the shambles, to plead with the wretch who owned them, for the love of God, to spare his victims. He bantered her, telling what fine dresses and fine furniture they would have. \u2018Yes,\u2019 she said, \u2018that may do very well in this life, but what will become of them in the next?\u2019 They too were sent to New Orleans; but were afterwards redeemed, at an enormous ransom, and brought back.\u201d Is it not plain, from this, that the histories of Emmeline and Cassy may have many counterparts? Justice, too, obliges the author to state that the fairness of mind and generosity attributed to St. Clare are not without a parallel, as the following anecdote will show. A few years since, a young southern gentleman was in Cincinnati, with a favorite servant, who had been his personal attendant from a boy. The young man took advantage of this opportunity to secure his own freedom, and fled to the protection of a Quaker, who was quite noted in affairs of this kind.", " \u201cO, carry him along to Amariah\u2019s. There\u2019s old Grandmam Stephens there,--Dorcas, they call her,--she\u2019s most an amazin\u2019 nurse. She takes to nursing real natural, and an\u2019t never better suited than when she gets a sick body to tend. We may reckon on turning him over to her for a fortnight or so.\u201d A ride of about an hour more brought the party to a neat farmhouse, where the weary travellers were received to an abundant breakfast. Tom Loker was soon carefully deposited in a much cleaner and softer bed than he had ever been in the habit of occupying. His wound was carefully dressed and bandaged, and he lay languidly opening and shutting his eyes on the white window-curtains and gently-gliding figures of his sick room, like a weary child. And here, for the present, we shall take our leave of one party. CHAPTER XVIII Miss Ophelia\u2019s Experiences and Opinions Our friend Tom, in his own simple musings, often compared his more fortunate lot, in the bondage into which he was cast, with that of Joseph in Egypt; and, in fact, as time went on, and he developed more and more under the eye of his master, the strength of the parallel increased. St. Clare was indolent and careless of money. Hitherto the providing and marketing had been principally done by Adolph, who was, to the full, as careless and extravagant as his master; and, between them both, they had carried on the dispersing process with great alacrity."], "Besides Tom, what other character has a Christ-like death?": [" And is there no more Eva,--no heaven,--no Christ,--nothing?\u201d \u201cO, dear Mas\u2019r, there is! I know it; I\u2019m sure of it,\u201d said Tom, falling on his knees. \u201cDo, do, dear Mas\u2019r, believe it!\u201d \u201cHow do you know there\u2019s any Christ, Tom! You never saw the Lord.\u201d \u201cFelt Him in my soul, Mas\u2019r,--feel Him now! O, Mas\u2019r, when I was sold away from my old woman and the children, I was jest a\u2019most broke up. I felt as if there warn\u2019t nothin\u2019 left; and then the good Lord, he stood by me, and he says, \u2018Fear not, Tom;\u2019 and he brings light and joy in a poor feller\u2019s soul,--makes all peace; and I \u2019s so happy, and loves everybody, and feels willin\u2019 jest to be the Lord\u2019s, and have the Lord\u2019s will done, and be put jest where the Lord wants to put me. I know it couldn\u2019t come from me, cause I \u2019s a poor, complainin\u2019 cretur; it comes from the Lord; and I know He\u2019s willin\u2019 to do for Mas\u2019r.\u201d Tom spoke with fast-running tears and choking voice. St. Clare leaned his head on his shoulder, and wrung the hard, faithful, black hand. \u201cTom, you love me,\u201d he said. \u201cI \u2019s willin\u2019 to lay down my life, this blessed day, to see Mas\u2019r a Christian.\u201d \u201cPoor, foolish boy!\u201d said St. Clare, half-raising himself. \u201cI\u2019m not worth the love of one good, honest heart, like yours.\u201d \u201cO, Mas\u2019r, dere\u2019s more than me loves you,--the blessed Lord Jesus loves you.\u201d \u201cHow do you know that Tom?\u201d said St. Clare. \u201cFeels it in my soul. O, Mas\u2019r! \u2019the love of Christ, that passeth knowledge.\u2019\u201d \u201cSingular!\u201d said St. Clare, turning away, \u201cthat the story of a man that lived and died eighteen hundred years ago can affect people so yet.", " But I believe that all the trying in the world to benefit a child, and all the substantial favors you can do them, will never excite one emotion of gratitude, while that feeling of repugnance remains in the heart;--it\u2019s a queer kind of a fact,--but so it is.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know how I can help it,\u201d said Miss Ophelia; \u201cthey _are_ disagreeable to me,--this child in particular,--how can I help feeling so?\u201d \u201cEva does, it seems.\u201d \u201cWell, she\u2019s so loving! After all, though, she\u2019s no more than Christ-like,\u201d said Miss Ophelia; \u201cI wish I were like her. She might teach me a lesson.\u201d \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time a little child had been used to instruct an old disciple, if it _were_ so,\u201d said St. Clare. CHAPTER XXVI Death Weep not for those whom the veil of the tomb, In life\u2019s early morning, hath hid from our eyes. * * \u201cWeep Not for Those,\u201d a poem by Thomas Moore (1779-1852). Eva\u2019s bed-room was a spacious apartment, which, like all the other rooms in the house, opened on to the broad verandah. The room communicated, on one side, with her father and mother\u2019s apartment; on the other, with that appropriated to Miss Ophelia. St. Clare had gratified his own eye and taste, in furnishing this room in a style that had a peculiar keeping with the character of her for whom it was intended. The windows were hung with curtains of rose-colored and white muslin, the floor was spread with a matting which had been ordered in Paris, to a pattern of his own device, having round it a border of rose-buds and leaves, and a centre-piece with full-flown roses.", " \u201cO, that\u2019s all, is it?\u201d he said, gayly. \u201cAll!\u201d said Tom, turning suddenly round and falling on his knees. \u201cO, my dear young Mas\u2019r; I\u2019m \u2019fraid it will be _loss of all--all_--body and soul. The good Book says, \u2019it biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an adder!\u2019 my dear Mas\u2019r!\u201d Tom\u2019s voice choked, and the tears ran down his cheeks. \u201cYou poor, silly fool!\u201d said St. Clare, with tears in his own eyes. \u201cGet up, Tom. I\u2019m not worth crying over.\u201d But Tom wouldn\u2019t rise, and looked imploring. \u201cWell, I won\u2019t go to any more of their cursed nonsense, Tom,\u201d said St. Clare; \u201con my honor, I won\u2019t. I don\u2019t know why I haven\u2019t stopped long ago. I\u2019ve always despised _it_, and myself for it,--so now, Tom, wipe up your eyes, and go about your errands. Come, come,\u201d he added, \u201cno blessings. I\u2019m not so wonderfully good, now,\u201d he said, as he gently pushed Tom to the door. \u201cThere, I\u2019ll pledge my honor to you, Tom, you don\u2019t see me so again,\u201d he said; and Tom went off, wiping his eyes, with great satisfaction. \u201cI\u2019ll keep my faith with him, too,\u201d said St. Clare, as he closed the door. And St. Clare did so,--for gross sensualism, in any form, was not the peculiar temptation of his nature. But, all this time, who shall detail the tribulations manifold of our friend Miss Ophelia, who had begun the labors of a Southern housekeeper? There is all the difference in the world in the servants of Southern establishments, according to the character and capacity of the mistresses who have brought them up.", " He brought it back, and poured it down Tom\u2019s throat. \u201cO, Tom!\u201d said Quimbo, \u201cwe\u2019s been awful wicked to ye!\u201d \u201cI forgive ye, with all my heart!\u201d said Tom, faintly. \u201cO, Tom! do tell us who is _Jesus_, anyhow?\u201d said Sambo;--\u201cJesus, that\u2019s been a standin\u2019 by you so, all this night!--Who is he?\u201d The word roused the failing, fainting spirit. He poured forth a few energetic sentences of that wondrous One,--his life, his death, his everlasting presence, and power to save. They wept,--both the two savage men. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I never hear this before?\u201d said Sambo; \u201cbut I do believe!--I can\u2019t help it! Lord Jesus, have mercy on us!\u201d \u201cPoor critters!\u201d said Tom, \u201cI\u2019d be willing to bar all I have, if it\u2019ll only bring ye to Christ! O, Lord! give me these two more souls, I pray!\u201d That prayer was answered! CHAPTER XLI The Young Master Two days after, a young man drove a light wagon up through the avenue of China trees, and, throwing the reins hastily on the horse\u2019s neck, sprang out and inquired for the owner of the place. It was George Shelby; and, to show how he came to be there, we must go back in our story. The letter of Miss Ophelia to Mrs. Shelby had, by some unfortunate accident, been detained, for a month or two, at some remote post-office, before it reached its destination; and, of course, before it was received, Tom was already lost to view among the distant swamps of the Red River. Mrs. Shelby read the intelligence with the deepest concern; but any immediate action upon it was an impossibility."], "What is the subject represented in the symbolism of Eliza\u2019s leap from one bank to the other of the river?": [" A thousand lives seemed to be concentrated in that one moment to Eliza. Her room opened by a side door to the river. She caught her child, and sprang down the steps towards it. The trader caught a full glimpse of her just as she was disappearing down the bank; and throwing himself from his horse, and calling loudly on Sam and Andy, he was after her like a hound after a deer. In that dizzy moment her feet to her scarce seemed to touch the ground, and a moment brought her to the water\u2019s edge. Right on behind they came; and, nerved with strength such as God gives only to the desperate, with one wild cry and flying leap, she vaulted sheer over the turbid current by the shore, on to the raft of ice beyond. It was a desperate leap--impossible to anything but madness and despair; and Haley, Sam, and Andy, instinctively cried out, and lifted up their hands, as she did it. The huge green fragment of ice on which she alighted pitched and creaked as her weight came on it, but she staid there not a moment. With wild cries and desperate energy she leaped to another and still another cake; stumbling--leaping--slipping--springing upwards again! Her shoes are gone--her stockings cut from her feet--while blood marked every step; but she saw nothing, felt nothing, till dimly, as in a dream, she saw the Ohio side, and a man helping her up the bank. \u201cYer a brave gal, now, whoever ye ar!\u201d said the man, with an oath.", " ker chunk! ker splash! Spring! Lord! how she goes it!\u201d and Sam and Andy laughed till the tears rolled down their cheeks. \u201cI\u2019ll make ye laugh t\u2019 other side yer mouths!\u201d said the trader, laying about their heads with his riding-whip. Both ducked, and ran shouting up the bank, and were on their horses before he was up. \u201cGood-evening, Mas\u2019r!\u201d said Sam, with much gravity. \u201cI berry much spect Missis be anxious \u2019bout Jerry. Mas\u2019r Haley won\u2019t want us no longer. Missis wouldn\u2019t hear of our ridin\u2019 the critters over Lizy\u2019s bridge tonight;\u201d and, with a facetious poke into Andy\u2019s ribs, he started off, followed by the latter, at full speed,--their shouts of laughter coming faintly on the wind. CHAPTER VIII Eliza\u2019s Escape Eliza made her desperate retreat across the river just in the dusk of twilight. The gray mist of evening, rising slowly from the river, enveloped her as she disappeared up the bank, and the swollen current and floundering masses of ice presented a hopeless barrier between her and her pursuer. Haley therefore slowly and discontentedly returned to the little tavern, to ponder further what was to be done. The woman opened to him the door of a little parlor, covered with a rag carpet, where stood a table with a very shining black oil-cloth, sundry lank, high-backed wood chairs, with some plaster images in resplendent colors on the mantel-shelf, above a very dimly-smoking grate; a long hard-wood settle extended its uneasy length by the chimney, and here Haley sat him down to meditate on the instability of human hopes and happiness in general.", " Eliza recognized the voice and face for a man who owned a farm not far from her old home. \u201cO, Mr. Symmes!--save me--do save me--do hide me!\u201d said Elia. \u201cWhy, what\u2019s this?\u201d said the man. \u201cWhy, if \u2019tan\u2019t Shelby\u2019s gal!\u201d \u201cMy child!--this boy!--he\u2019d sold him! There is his Mas\u2019r,\u201d said she, pointing to the Kentucky shore. \u201cO, Mr. Symmes, you\u2019ve got a little boy!\u201d \u201cSo I have,\u201d said the man, as he roughly, but kindly, drew her up the steep bank. \u201cBesides, you\u2019re a right brave gal. I like grit, wherever I see it.\u201d When they had gained the top of the bank, the man paused. \u201cI\u2019d be glad to do something for ye,\u201d said he; \u201cbut then there\u2019s nowhar I could take ye. The best I can do is to tell ye to go _thar_,\u201d said he, pointing to a large white house which stood by itself, off the main street of the village. \u201cGo thar; they\u2019re kind folks. Thar\u2019s no kind o\u2019 danger but they\u2019ll help you,--they\u2019re up to all that sort o\u2019 thing.\u201d \u201cThe Lord bless you!\u201d said Eliza, earnestly. \u201cNo \u2019casion, no \u2019casion in the world,\u201d said the man. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve done\u2019s of no \u2019count.\u201d \u201cAnd, oh, surely, sir, you won\u2019t tell any one!\u201d \u201cGo to thunder, gal! What do you take a feller for? In course not,\u201d said the man. \u201cCome, now, go along like a likely, sensible gal, as you are. You\u2019ve arnt your liberty, and you shall have it, for all me.\u201d The woman folded her child to her bosom, and walked firmly and swiftly away. The man stood and looked after her.", " \u201cNow, Sam, tell us distinctly how the matter was,\u201d said Mr. Shelby. \u201cWhere is Eliza, if you know?\u201d \u201cWal, Mas\u2019r, I saw her, with my own eyes, a crossin\u2019 on the floatin\u2019 ice. She crossed most \u2019markably; it wasn\u2019t no less nor a miracle; and I saw a man help her up the \u2019Hio side, and then she was lost in the dusk.\u201d \u201cSam, I think this rather apocryphal,--this miracle. Crossing on floating ice isn\u2019t so easily done,\u201d said Mr. Shelby. \u201cEasy! couldn\u2019t nobody a done it, without de Lord. Why, now,\u201d said Sam, \u201c\u2018t was jist dis yer way. Mas\u2019r Haley, and me, and Andy, we comes up to de little tavern by the river, and I rides a leetle ahead,--(I\u2019s so zealous to be a cotchin\u2019 Lizy, that I couldn\u2019t hold in, no way),--and when I comes by the tavern winder, sure enough there she was, right in plain sight, and dey diggin\u2019 on behind. Wal, I loses off my hat, and sings out nuff to raise the dead. Course Lizy she hars, and she dodges back, when Mas\u2019r Haley he goes past the door; and then, I tell ye, she clared out de side door; she went down de river bank;--Mas\u2019r Haley he seed her, and yelled out, and him, and me, and Andy, we took arter. Down she come to the river, and thar was the current running ten feet wide by the shore, and over t\u2019 other side ice a sawin\u2019 and a jiggling up and down, kinder as \u2019t were a great island. We come right behind her, and I thought my soul he\u2019d got her sure enough,--when she gin sich a screech as I never hearn, and thar she was, clar over t\u2019 other side of the current, on the ice, and then on she went, a screeching and a jumpin\u2019,--the ice went crack!"], "Who is Arthur Shelby reluctant to sell to Mr. Haley?": [" \u201cIt will have to come out,\u201d said he, mentally; \u201cas well now as ever.\u201d \u201cI told Eliza,\u201d said Mrs. Shelby, as she continued brushing her hair, \u201cthat she was a little fool for her pains, and that you never had anything to do with that sort of persons. Of course, I knew you never meant to sell any of our people,--least of all, to such a fellow.\u201d \u201cWell, Emily,\u201d said her husband, \u201cso I have always felt and said; but the fact is that my business lies so that I cannot get on without. I shall have to sell some of my hands.\u201d \u201cTo that creature? Impossible! Mr. Shelby, you cannot be serious.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say that I am,\u201d said Mr. Shelby. \u201cI\u2019ve agreed to sell Tom.\u201d \u201cWhat! our Tom?--that good, faithful creature!--been your faithful servant from a boy! O, Mr. Shelby!--and you have promised him his freedom, too,--you and I have spoken to him a hundred times of it. Well, I can believe anything now,--I can believe _now_ that you could sell little Harry, poor Eliza\u2019s only child!\u201d said Mrs. Shelby, in a tone between grief and indignation. \u201cWell, since you must know all, it is so. I have agreed to sell Tom and Harry both; and I don\u2019t know why I am to be rated, as if I were a monster, for doing what every one does every day.\u201d \u201cBut why, of all others, choose these?\u201d said Mrs. Shelby. \u201cWhy sell them, of all on the place, if you must sell at all?\u201d \u201cBecause they will bring the highest sum of any,--that\u2019s why.", " \u201cIt seems that gal \u2019s off, with her young un.\u201d \u201cMr. Haley, Mrs. Shelby is present,\u201d said Mr. Shelby. \u201cI beg pardon, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Haley, bowing slightly, with a still lowering brow; \u201cbut still I say, as I said before, this yer\u2019s a sing\u2019lar report. Is it true, sir?\u201d \u201cSir,\u201d said Mr. Shelby, \u201cif you wish to communicate with me, you must observe something of the decorum of a gentleman. Andy, take Mr. Haley\u2019s hat and riding-whip. Take a seat, sir. Yes, sir; I regret to say that the young woman, excited by overhearing, or having reported to her, something of this business, has taken her child in the night, and made off.\u201d \u201cI did expect fair dealing in this matter, I confess,\u201d said Haley. \u201cWell, sir,\u201d said Mr. Shelby, turning sharply round upon him, \u201cwhat am I to understand by that remark? If any man calls my honor in question, I have but one answer for him.\u201d The trader cowered at this, and in a somewhat lower tone said that \u201cit was plaguy hard on a fellow, that had made a fair bargain, to be gulled that way.\u201d \u201cMr. Haley,\u201d said Mr. Shelby, \u201cif I did not think you had some cause for disappointment, I should not have borne from you the rude and unceremonious style of your entrance into my parlor this morning. I say thus much, however, since appearances call for it, that I shall allow of no insinuations cast upon me, as if I were at all partner to any unfairness in this matter. Moreover, I shall feel bound to give you every assistance, in the use of horses, servants, &c., in the recovery of your property.", " He was lounging in a large easy-chair, looking over some letters that had come in the afternoon mail, and she was standing before her mirror, brushing out the complicated braids and curls in which Eliza had arranged her hair; for, noticing her pale cheeks and haggard eyes, she had excused her attendance that night, and ordered her to bed. The employment, naturally enough, suggested her conversation with the girl in the morning; and turning to her husband, she said, carelessly, \u201cBy the by, Arthur, who was that low-bred fellow that you lugged in to our dinner-table today?\u201d \u201cHaley is his name,\u201d said Shelby, turning himself rather uneasily in his chair, and continuing with his eyes fixed on a letter. \u201cHaley! Who is he, and what may be his business here, pray?\u201d \u201cWell, he\u2019s a man that I transacted some business with, last time I was at Natchez,\u201d said Mr. Shelby. \u201cAnd he presumed on it to make himself quite at home, and call and dine here, ay?\u201d \u201cWhy, I invited him; I had some accounts with him,\u201d said Shelby. \u201cIs he a negro-trader?\u201d said Mrs. Shelby, noticing a certain embarrassment in her husband\u2019s manner. \u201cWhy, my dear, what put that into your head?\u201d said Shelby, looking up. \u201cNothing,--only Eliza came in here, after dinner, in a great worry, crying and taking on, and said you were talking with a trader, and that she heard him make an offer for her boy--the ridiculous little goose!\u201d \u201cShe did, hey?\u201d said Mr. Shelby, returning to his paper, which he seemed for a few moments quite intent upon, not perceiving that he was holding it bottom upwards.", " Haley produced, from a well-worn valise, a parchment, which, after looking over it a moment, he handed to Mr. Shelby, who took it with a gesture of suppressed eagerness. \u201cWal, now, the thing\u2019s _done_!\u201d said the trader, getting up. \u201cIt\u2019s _done_!\u201d said Mr. Shelby, in a musing tone; and, fetching a long breath, he repeated, _\u201cIt\u2019s done!\u201d_ \u201cYer don\u2019t seem to feel much pleased with it, \u2019pears to me,\u201d said the trader. \u201cHaley,\u201d said Mr. Shelby, \u201cI hope you\u2019ll remember that you promised, on your honor, you wouldn\u2019t sell Tom, without knowing what sort of hands he\u2019s going into.\u201d \u201cWhy, you\u2019ve just done it sir,\u201d said the trader. \u201cCircumstances, you well know, _obliged_ me,\u201d said Shelby, haughtily. \u201cWal, you know, they may \u2019blige _me_, too,\u201d said the trader. \u201cHowsomever, I\u2019ll do the very best I can in gettin\u2019 Tom a good berth; as to my treatin\u2019 on him bad, you needn\u2019t be a grain afeard. If there\u2019s anything that I thank the Lord for, it is that I\u2019m never noways cruel.\u201d After the expositions which the trader had previously given of his humane principles, Mr. Shelby did not feel particularly reassured by these declarations; but, as they were the best comfort the case admitted of, he allowed the trader to depart in silence, and betook himself to a solitary cigar. CHAPTER V Showing the Feelings of Living Property on Changing Owners Mr. and Mrs. Shelby had retired to their apartment for the night."], "What invention won George Harris the respect of his factory's proprietor?": [" She had been married to a bright and talented young mulatto man, who was a slave on a neighboring estate, and bore the name of George Harris. This young man had been hired out by his master to work in a bagging factory, where his adroitness and ingenuity caused him to be considered the first hand in the place. He had invented a machine for the cleaning of the hemp, which, considering the education and circumstances of the inventor, displayed quite as much mechanical genius as Whitney\u2019s cotton-gin. * * A machine of this description was really the invention of a young colored man in Kentucky. [Mrs. Stowe\u2019s note.] He was possessed of a handsome person and pleasing manners, and was a general favorite in the factory. Nevertheless, as this young man was in the eye of the law not a man, but a thing, all these superior qualifications were subject to the control of a vulgar, narrow-minded, tyrannical master. This same gentleman, having heard of the fame of George\u2019s invention, took a ride over to the factory, to see what this intelligent chattel had been about. He was received with great enthusiasm by the employer, who congratulated him on possessing so valuable a slave. He was waited upon over the factory, shown the machinery by George, who, in high spirits, talked so fluently, held himself so erect, looked so handsome and manly, that his master began to feel an uneasy consciousness of inferiority.", " I\u2019m for going right up.

I could not have advised you to it.\u201d \u201cI can do it on my own responsibility,\u201d said George, with the same proud smile. We remark, _en passant_, that George was, by his father\u2019s side, of white descent. His mother was one of those unfortunates of her race, marked out by personal beauty to be the slave of the passions of her possessor, and the mother of children who may never know a father. From one of the proudest families in Kentucky he had inherited a set of fine European features, and a high, indomitable spirit. From his mother he had received only a slight mulatto tinge, amply compensated by its accompanying rich, dark eye. A slight change in the tint of the skin and the color of his hair had metamorphosed him into the Spanish-looking fellow he then appeared; and as gracefulness of movement and gentlemanly manners had always been perfectly natural to him, he found no difficulty in playing the bold part he had adopted--that of a gentleman travelling with his domestic.

A few minutes brought them to the window of Uncle Tom\u2019s cottage, and Eliza stopping, tapped lightly on the window-pane. The prayer-meeting at Uncle Tom\u2019s had, in the order of hymn-singing, been protracted to a very late hour; and, as Uncle Tom had indulged himself in a few lengthy solos afterwards, the consequence was, that, although it was now between twelve and one o\u2019clock, he and his worthy helpmeet were not yet asleep. \u201cGood Lord! what\u2019s that?\u201d said Aunt Chloe, starting up and hastily drawing the curtain. \u201cMy sakes alive, if it an\u2019t Lizy!

Come, come, Emily,\u201d said he, passing his arm round her, \u201cyou are cold and all in a shiver; you allow yourself to feel too much.\u201d \u201cFeel too much! Am not I a woman,--a mother? Are we not both responsible to God for this poor girl? My God! lay not this sin to our charge.\u201d \u201cWhat sin, Emily? You see yourself that we have only done what we were obliged to.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s an awful feeling of guilt about it, though,\u201d said Mrs. Shelby. \u201cI can\u2019t reason it away.\u201d \u201cHere, Andy, you nigger, be alive!\u201d called Sam, under the verandah; \u201ctake these yer hosses to der barn; don\u2019t ye hear Mas\u2019r a callin\u2019?\u201d and Sam soon appeared, palm-leaf in hand, at the parlor door.", " \u201cWhy have you been loitering so, Sam? I sent Andy to tell you to hurry.\u201d \u201cLord bless you, Missis!\u201d said Sam, \u201chorses won\u2019t be cotched all in a minit; they\u2019d done clared out way down to the south pasture, and the Lord knows whar!\u201d \u201cSam, how often must I tell you not to say \u2018Lord bless you, and the Lord knows,\u2019 and such things? It\u2019s wicked.\u201d \u201cO, Lord bless my soul! I done forgot, Missis! I won\u2019t say nothing of de sort no more.\u201d \u201cWhy, Sam, you just _have_ said it again.\u201d \u201cDid I? O, Lord! I mean--I didn\u2019t go fur to say it.\u201d \u201cYou must be _careful_, Sam.\u201d \u201cJust let me get my breath, Missis, and I\u2019ll start fair. I\u2019ll be bery careful.\u201d \u201cWell, Sam, you are to go with Mr. Haley, to show him the road, and help him. Be careful of the horses, Sam; you know Jerry was a little lame last week; _don\u2019t ride them too fast_.\u201d Mrs. Shelby spoke the last words with a low voice, and strong emphasis. \u201cLet dis child alone for dat!\u201d said Sam, rolling up his eyes with a volume of meaning. \u201cLord knows! High! Didn\u2019t say dat!\u201d said he, suddenly catching his breath, with a ludicrous flourish of apprehension, which made his mistress laugh, spite of herself. \u201cYes, Missis, I\u2019ll look out for de hosses!\u201d \u201cNow, Andy,\u201d said Sam, returning to his stand under the beech-trees, \u201cyou see I wouldn\u2019t be \u2019t all surprised if dat ar gen\u2019lman\u2019s crittur should gib a fling, by and by, when he comes to be a gettin\u2019 up. You know, Andy, critturs _will_ do such things;\u201d and therewith Sam poked Andy in the side, in a highly suggestive manner.", " \u201cIt\u2019s an ill wind dat blow nowhar,--dat ar a fact,\u201d said Sam, sententiously, giving an additional hoist to his pantaloons, and adroitly substituting a long nail in place of a missing suspender-button, with which effort of mechanical genius he seemed highly delighted. \u201cYes, it\u2019s an ill wind blows nowhar,\u201d he repeated. \u201cNow, dar, Tom\u2019s down--wal, course der\u2019s room for some nigger to be up--and why not dis nigger?--dat\u2019s de idee. Tom, a ridin\u2019 round de country--boots blacked--pass in his pocket--all grand as Cuffee--but who he? Now, why shouldn\u2019t Sam?--dat\u2019s what I want to know.\u201d \u201cHalloo, Sam--O Sam!

He\u2019s de nigger. See if I don\u2019t cotch her, now; Mas\u2019r\u2019ll see what Sam can do!\u201d \u201cAh! but, Sam,\u201d said Andy, \u201cyou\u2019d better think twice; for Missis don\u2019t want her cotched, and she\u2019ll be in yer wool.\u201d \u201cHigh!\u201d said Sam, opening his eyes. \u201cHow you know dat?\u201d \u201cHeard her say so, my own self, dis blessed mornin\u2019, when I bring in Mas\u2019r\u2019s shaving-water.", " She therefore graciously smiled, assented, chatted familiarly, and did all she could to make time pass imperceptibly. At two o\u2019clock Sam and Andy brought the horses up to the posts, apparently greatly refreshed and invigorated by the scamper of the morning. Sam was there new oiled from dinner, with an abundance of zealous and ready officiousness. As Haley approached, he was boasting, in flourishing style, to Andy, of the evident and eminent success of the operation, now that he had \u201cfarly come to it.\u201d \u201cYour master, I s\u2019pose, don\u2019t keep no dogs,\u201d said Haley, thoughtfully, as he prepared to mount. \u201cHeaps on \u2019em,\u201d said Sam, triumphantly; \u201cthar\u2019s Bruno--he\u2019s a roarer! and, besides that, \u2019bout every nigger of us keeps a pup of some natur or uther.\u201d \u201cPoh!\u201d said Haley,--and he said something else, too, with regard to the said dogs, at which Sam muttered, \u201cI don\u2019t see no use cussin\u2019 on \u2019em, no way.\u201d \u201cBut your master don\u2019t keep no dogs (I pretty much know he don\u2019t) for trackin\u2019 out niggers.\u201d Sam knew exactly what he meant, but he kept on a look of earnest and desperate simplicity. \u201cOur dogs all smells round considable sharp. I spect they\u2019s the kind, though they han\u2019t never had no practice. They \u2019s _far_ dogs, though, at most anything, if you\u2019d get \u2019em started. Here, Bruno,\u201d he called, whistling to the lumbering Newfoundland, who came pitching tumultuously toward them. \u201cYou go hang!\u201d said Haley, getting up."], "How does Eliza cross the Ohio River?": [" On this presumption, she stopped at noon at a neat farmhouse, to rest herself, and buy some dinner for her child and self; for, as the danger decreased with the distance, the supernatural tension of the nervous system lessened, and she found herself both weary and hungry. The good woman, kindly and gossipping, seemed rather pleased than otherwise with having somebody come in to talk with; and accepted, without examination, Eliza\u2019s statement, that she \u201cwas going on a little piece, to spend a week with her friends,\u201d--all which she hoped in her heart might prove strictly true. An hour before sunset, she entered the village of T----, by the Ohio river, weary and foot-sore, but still strong in heart. Her first glance was at the river, which lay, like Jordan, between her and the Canaan of liberty on the other side. It was now early spring, and the river was swollen and turbulent; great cakes of floating ice were swinging heavily to and fro in the turbid waters. Owing to the peculiar form of the shore on the Kentucky side, the land bending far out into the water, the ice had been lodged and detained in great quantities, and the narrow channel which swept round the bend was full of ice, piled one cake over another, thus forming a temporary barrier to the descending ice, which lodged, and formed a great, undulating raft, filling up the whole river, and extending almost to the Kentucky shore.", " How the touch of those warm arms, the gentle breathings that came in her neck, seemed to add fire and spirit to her movements! It seemed to her as if strength poured into her in electric streams, from every gentle touch and movement of the sleeping, confiding child. Sublime is the dominion of the mind over the body, that, for a time, can make flesh and nerve impregnable, and string the sinews like steel, so that the weak become so mighty. The boundaries of the farm, the grove, the wood-lot, passed by her dizzily, as she walked on; and still she went, leaving one familiar object after another, slacking not, pausing not, till reddening daylight found her many a long mile from all traces of any familiar objects upon the open highway. She had often been, with her mistress, to visit some connections, in the little village of T----, not far from the Ohio river, and knew the road well. To go thither, to escape across the Ohio river, were the first hurried outlines of her plan of escape; beyond that, she could only hope in God. When horses and vehicles began to move along the highway, with that alert perception peculiar to a state of excitement, and which seems to be a sort of inspiration, she became aware that her headlong pace and distracted air might bring on her remark and suspicion. She therefore put the boy on the ground, and, adjusting her dress and bonnet, she walked on at as rapid a pace as she thought consistent with the preservation of appearances.", " Only a day and a night on the lake, and then--oh, then!--\u201d \u201cO, Eliza!\u201d said George, drawing her towards him; \u201cthat is it! Now my fate is all narrowing down to a point. To come so near, to be almost in sight, and then lose all. I should never live under it, Eliza.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t fear,\u201d said his wife, hopefully. \u201cThe good Lord would not have brought us so far, if he didn\u2019t mean to carry us through. I seem to feel him with us, George.\u201d \u201cYou are a blessed woman, Eliza!\u201d said George, clasping her with a convulsive grasp. \u201cBut,--oh, tell me! can this great mercy be for us? Will these years and years of misery come to an end?--shall we be free? \u201cI am sure of it, George,\u201d said Eliza, looking upward, while tears of hope and enthusiasm shone on her long, dark lashes. \u201cI feel it in me, that God is going to bring us out of bondage, this very day.\u201d \u201cI will believe you, Eliza,\u201d said George, rising suddenly up, \u201cI will believe,--come let\u2019s be off. Well, indeed,\u201d said he, holding her off at arm\u2019s length, and looking admiringly at her, \u201cyou _are_ a pretty little fellow. That crop of little, short curls, is quite becoming. Put on your cap. So--a little to one side. I never saw you look quite so pretty. But, it\u2019s almost time for the carriage;--I wonder if Mrs. Smyth has got Harry rigged?\u201d The door opened, and a respectable, middle-aged woman entered, leading little Harry, dressed in girl\u2019s clothes. \u201cWhat a pretty girl he makes,\u201d said Eliza, turning him round.", " \u201cWe call him Harriet, you see;--don\u2019t the name come nicely?\u201d The child stood gravely regarding his mother in her new and strange attire, observing a profound silence, and occasionally drawing deep sighs, and peeping at her from under his dark curls. \u201cDoes Harry know mamma?\u201d said Eliza, stretching her hands toward him. The child clung shyly to the woman. \u201cCome Eliza, why do you try to coax him, when you know that he has got to be kept away from you?\u201d \u201cI know it\u2019s foolish,\u201d said Eliza; \u201cyet, I can\u2019t bear to have him turn away from me. But come,--where\u2019s my cloak? Here,--how is it men put on cloaks, George?\u201d \u201cYou must wear it so,\u201d said her husband, throwing it over his shoulders. \u201cSo, then,\u201d said Eliza, imitating the motion,--\u201cand I must stamp, and take long steps, and try to look saucy.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t exert yourself,\u201d said George. \u201cThere is, now and then, a modest young man; and I think it would be easier for you to act that character.\u201d \u201cAnd these gloves! mercy upon us!\u201d said Eliza; \u201cwhy, my hands are lost in them.\u201d \u201cI advise you to keep them on pretty strictly,\u201d said George. \u201cYour slender paw might bring us all out. Now, Mrs. Smyth, you are to go under our charge, and be our aunty,--you mind.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve heard,\u201d said Mrs. Smyth, \u201cthat there have been men down, warning all the packet captains against a man and woman, with a little boy.\u201d \u201cThey have!\u201d said George. \u201cWell, if we see any such people, we can tell them.\u201d A hack now drove to the door, and the friendly family who had received the fugitives crowded around them with farewell greetings."], "What does Mr. Haley promise to Loker and Marks on the condition they catch and return Eliza and Harry?": [" Bob!\u201d \u201cCome, come, gentlemen, I say; this isn\u2019t business,\u201d said Marks. \u201cThere\u2019s different ways, you know, of looking at all subjects.

An\u2019t it beautiful?\u201d Tom, whose great heavy mouth had stood ajar during this communication, now suddenly snapped it together, as a big dog closes on a piece of meat, and seemed to be digesting the idea at his leisure.", " \u201cLord bless ye, Tom, ye needn\u2019t break all the glasses!\u201d said Marks; \u201csave your fist for time o\u2019 need.\u201d \u201cBut, gentlemen, an\u2019t I to come in for a share of the profits?\u201d said Haley. \u201cAn\u2019t it enough we catch the boy for ye?\u201d said Loker. \u201cWhat do ye want?\u201d \u201cWal,\u201d said Haley, \u201cif I gives you the job, it\u2019s worth something,--say ten per cent. on the profits, expenses paid.\u201d \u201cNow,\u201d said Loker, with a tremendous oath, and striking the table with his heavy fist, \u201cdon\u2019t I know _you_, Dan Haley?

A temporary bed was provided for her on the settle, near the fire; and, after a short time, she fell into a heavy slumber, with the child, who seemed no less weary, soundly sleeping on her arm; for the mother resisted, with nervous anxiety, the kindest attempts to take him from her; and, even in sleep, her arm encircled him with an unrelaxing clasp, as if she could not even then be beguiled of her vigilant hold. Mr. and Mrs. Bird had gone back to the parlor, where, strange as it may appear, no reference was made, on either side, to the preceding conversation; but Mrs. Bird busied herself with her knitting-work, and Mr. Bird pretended to be reading the paper. \u201cI wonder who and what she is!\u201d said Mr. Bird, at last, as he laid it down. \u201cWhen she wakes up and feels a little rested, we will see,\u201d said Mrs. Bird. \u201cI say, wife!\u201d said Mr. Bird after musing in silence over his newspaper. \u201cWell, dear!\u201d \u201cShe couldn\u2019t wear one of your gowns, could she, by any letting down, or such matter? She seems to be rather larger than you are.\u201d A quite perceptible smile glimmered on Mrs. Bird\u2019s face, as she answered, \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d Another pause, and Mr. Bird again broke out, \u201cI say, wife!\u201d \u201cWell! What now?\u201d \u201cWhy, there\u2019s that old bombazin cloak, that you keep on purpose to put over me when I take my afternoon\u2019s nap; you might as well give her that,--she needs clothes.\u201d At this instant, Dinah looked in to say that the woman was awake, and wanted to see Missis.", " After a while, Mrs. Bird opened a wardrobe, and, taking from thence a plain, serviceable dress or two, she sat down busily to her work-table, and, with needle, scissors, and thimble, at hand, quietly commenced the \u201cletting down\u201d process which her husband had recommended, and continued busily at it till the old clock in the corner struck twelve, and she heard the low rattling of wheels at the door. \u201cMary,\u201d said her husband, coming in, with his overcoat in his hand, \u201cyou must wake her up now; we must be off.\u201d Mrs. Bird hastily deposited the various articles she had collected in a small plain trunk, and locking it, desired her husband to see it in the carriage, and then proceeded to call the woman. Soon, arrayed in a cloak, bonnet, and shawl, that had belonged to her benefactress, she appeared at the door with her child in her arms. Mr. Bird hurried her into the carriage, and Mrs. Bird pressed on after her to the carriage steps. Eliza leaned out of the carriage, and put out her hand,--a hand as soft and beautiful as was given in return. She fixed her large, dark eyes, full of earnest meaning, on Mrs. Bird\u2019s face, and seemed going to speak. Her lips moved,--she tried once or twice, but there was no sound,--and pointing upward, with a look never to be forgotten, she fell back in the seat, and covered her face. The door was shut, and the carriage drove on. What a situation, now, for a patriotic senator, that had been all the week before spurring up the legislature of his native state to pass more stringent resolutions against escaping fugitives, their harborers and abettors!", " \u201cWere you a slave?\u201d said Mr. Bird. \u201cYes, sir; I belonged to a man in Kentucky.\u201d \u201cWas he unkind to you?\u201d \u201cNo, sir; he was a good master.\u201d \u201cAnd was your mistress unkind to you?\u201d \u201cNo, sir--no! my mistress was always good to me.\u201d \u201cWhat could induce you to leave a good home, then, and run away, and go through such dangers?\u201d The woman looked up at Mrs. Bird, with a keen, scrutinizing glance, and it did not escape her that she was dressed in deep mourning. \u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d she said, suddenly, \u201chave you ever lost a child?\u201d The question was unexpected, and it was thrust on a new wound; for it was only a month since a darling child of the family had been laid in the grave. Mr. Bird turned around and walked to the window, and Mrs. Bird burst into tears; but, recovering her voice, she said, \u201cWhy do you ask that? I have lost a little one.\u201d \u201cThen you will feel for me. I have lost two, one after another,--left \u2019em buried there when I came away; and I had only this one left. I never slept a night without him; he was all I had. He was my comfort and pride, day and night; and, ma\u2019am, they were going to take him away from me,--to _sell_ him,--sell him down south, ma\u2019am, to go all alone,--a baby that had never been away from his mother in his life! I couldn\u2019t stand it, ma\u2019am. I knew I never should be good for anything, if they did; and when I knew the papers the papers were signed, and he was sold, I took him and came off in the night; and they chased me,--the man that bought him, and some of Mas\u2019r\u2019s folks,--and they were coming down right behind me, and I heard \u2019em.", " \u201cMuch further than you think, poor child!\u201d said Mrs. Bird; \u201cbut we will try to think what can be done for you. Here, Dinah, make her up a bed in your own room, close by the kitchen, and I\u2019ll think what to do for her in the morning. Meanwhile, never fear, poor woman; put your trust in God; he will protect you.\u201d Mrs. Bird and her husband reentered the parlor. She sat down in her little rocking-chair before the fire, swaying thoughtfully to and fro. Mr. Bird strode up and down the room, grumbling to himself, \u201cPish! pshaw! confounded awkward business!\u201d At length, striding up to his wife, he said, \u201cI say, wife, she\u2019ll have to get away from here, this very night. That fellow will be down on the scent bright and early tomorrow morning: if \u2019t was only the woman, she could lie quiet till it was over; but that little chap can\u2019t be kept still by a troop of horse and foot, I\u2019ll warrant me; he\u2019ll bring it all out, popping his head out of some window or door. A pretty kettle of fish it would be for me, too, to be caught with them both here, just now! No; they\u2019ll have to be got off tonight.\u201d \u201cTonight! How is it possible?--where to?\u201d \u201cWell, I know pretty well where to,\u201d said the senator, beginning to put on his boots, with a reflective air; and, stopping when his leg was half in, he embraced his knee with both hands, and seemed to go off in deep meditation. \u201cIt\u2019s a confounded awkward, ugly business,\u201d said he, at last, beginning to tug at his boot-straps again, \u201cand that\u2019s a fact!\u201d After one boot was fairly on, the senator sat with the other in his hand, profoundly studying the figure of the carpet."], "What does George Shelby give Uncle Tom to wear on a string around his neck before Tom is taken away?": [" It won\u2019t help me any, to anger him.\u201d \u201cWell, I won\u2019t, then, for your sake; but only to think of it--isn\u2019t it a shame? They never sent for me, nor sent me any word, and, if it hadn\u2019t been for Tom Lincon, I shouldn\u2019t have heard it.

O, you\u2019ll have good times yet!\u201d Haley now came to the door, with the handcuffs in his hands. \u201cLook here, now, Mister,\u201d said George, with an air of great superiority, as he got out, \u201cI shall let father and mother know how you treat Uncle Tom!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d said the trader. \u201cI should think you\u2019d be ashamed to spend all your life buying men and women, and chaining them, like cattle!

Away he went, and Tom looked, till the clatter of his horse\u2019s heels died away, the last sound or sight of his home.", " Some dim ideas of imprudence or impropriety in the measure seemed to embarrass him considerably; for he often stopped, as Eliza glided forward, and looked wistfully, first at her and then at the house, and then, as if reassured by reflection, he pattered along after her again. A few minutes brought them to the window of Uncle Tom\u2019s cottage, and Eliza stopping, tapped lightly on the window-pane. The prayer-meeting at Uncle Tom\u2019s had, in the order of hymn-singing, been protracted to a very late hour; and, as Uncle Tom had indulged himself in a few lengthy solos afterwards, the consequence was, that, although it was now between twelve and one o\u2019clock, he and his worthy helpmeet were not yet asleep. \u201cGood Lord! what\u2019s that?\u201d said Aunt Chloe, starting up and hastily drawing the curtain. \u201cMy sakes alive, if it an\u2019t Lizy!

But now I\u2019m a free man, standing on God\u2019s free soil; and my wife and my child I claim as mine. Jim and his mother are here. We have arms to defend ourselves, and we mean to do it. You can come up, if you like; but the first one of you that comes within the range of our bullets is a dead man, and the next, and the next; and so on till the last.\u201d \u201cO, come! come!\u201d said a short, puffy man, stepping forward, and blowing his nose as he did so.", " \u201cGeorge!\u201d said Mr. Wilson. \u201cYes, George,\u201d said the young man. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have thought it!\u201d \u201cI am pretty well disguised, I fancy,\u201d said the young man, with a smile. \u201cA little walnut bark has made my yellow skin a genteel brown, and I\u2019ve dyed my hair black; so you see I don\u2019t answer to the advertisement at all.\u201d \u201cO, George! but this is a dangerous game you are playing. I could not have advised you to it.\u201d \u201cI can do it on my own responsibility,\u201d said George, with the same proud smile. We remark, _en passant_, that George was, by his father\u2019s side, of white descent. His mother was one of those unfortunates of her race, marked out by personal beauty to be the slave of the passions of her possessor, and the mother of children who may never know a father. From one of the proudest families in Kentucky he had inherited a set of fine European features, and a high, indomitable spirit. From his mother he had received only a slight mulatto tinge, amply compensated by its accompanying rich, dark eye. A slight change in the tint of the skin and the color of his hair had metamorphosed him into the Spanish-looking fellow he then appeared; and as gracefulness of movement and gentlemanly manners had always been perfectly natural to him, he found no difficulty in playing the bold part he had adopted--that of a gentleman travelling with his domestic. Mr. Wilson, a good-natured but extremely fidgety and cautious old gentleman, ambled up and down the room, appearing, as John Bunyan hath it, \u201cmuch tumbled up and down in his mind,\u201d and divided between his wish to help George, and a certain confused notion of maintaining law and order: so, as he shambled about, he delivered himself as follows: \u201cWell, George, I s\u2019pose you\u2019re running away--leaving your lawful master, George--(I don\u2019t wonder at it)--at the same time, I\u2019m sorry, George,--yes, decidedly--I think I must say that, George--it\u2019s my duty to tell you so.\u201d \u201cWhy are you sorry, sir?\u201d said George, calmly.", " This lady, having gathered, from George\u2019s conversation, that he was from Kentucky, seemed evidently disposed to cultivate his acquaintance; in which design she was seconded by the graces of her little girl, who was about as pretty a plaything as ever diverted the weariness of a fortnight\u2019s trip on a steamboat. George\u2019s chair was often placed at her state-room door; and Cassy, as she sat upon the guards, could hear their conversation. Madame de Thoux was very minute in her inquiries as to Kentucky, where she said she had resided in a former period of her life. George discovered, to his surprise, that her former residence must have been in his own vicinity; and her inquiries showed a knowledge of people and things in his vicinity, that was perfectly surprising to him. \u201cDo you know,\u201d said Madame de Thoux to him, one day, \u201cof any man, in your neighborhood, of the name of Harris?\u201d \u201cThere is an old fellow, of that name, lives not far from my father\u2019s place,\u201d said George. \u201cWe never have had much intercourse with him, though.\u201d \u201cHe is a large slave-owner, I believe,\u201d said Madame de Thoux, with a manner which seemed to betray more interest than she was exactly willing to show. \u201cHe is,\u201d said George, looking rather surprised at her manner. \u201cDid you ever know of his having--perhaps, you may have heard of his having a mulatto boy, named George?\u201d \u201cO, certainly,--George Harris,--I know him well; he married a servant of my mother\u2019s, but has escaped, now, to Canada.\u201d \u201cHe has?\u201d said Madame de Thoux, quickly.", " Here the conversation was interrupted by the approach of a small one-horse buggy to the inn. It had a genteel appearance, and a well-dressed, gentlemanly man sat on the seat, with a colored servant driving. The whole party examined the new comer with the interest with which a set of loafers in a rainy day usually examine every newcomer. He was very tall, with a dark, Spanish complexion, fine, expressive black eyes, and close-curling hair, also of a glossy blackness. His well-formed aquiline nose, straight thin lips, and the admirable contour of his finely-formed limbs, impressed the whole company instantly with the idea of something uncommon. He walked easily in among the company, and with a nod indicated to his waiter where to place his trunk, bowed to the company, and, with his hat in his hand, walked up leisurely to the bar, and gave in his name as Henry Butter, Oaklands, Shelby County. Turning, with an indifferent air, he sauntered up to the advertisement, and read it over. \u201cJim,\u201d he said to his man, \u201cseems to me we met a boy something like this, up at Beman\u2019s, didn\u2019t we?\u201d \u201cYes, Mas\u2019r,\u201d said Jim, \u201conly I an\u2019t sure about the hand.\u201d \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t look, of course,\u201d said the stranger with a careless yawn. Then walking up to the landlord, he desired him to furnish him with a private apartment, as he had some writing to do immediately. The landlord was all obsequious, and a relay of about seven negroes, old and young, male and female, little and big, were soon whizzing about, like a covey of partridges, bustling, hurrying, treading on each other\u2019s toes, and tumbling over each other, in their zeal to get Mas\u2019r\u2019s room ready, while he seated himself easily on a chair in the middle of the room, and entered into conversation with the man who sat next to him."], "When Mr. Haley and Uncle Tom stop overnight, where is Tom made to sleep, insulting his dignity?": [" Bob!\u201d \u201cCome, come, gentlemen, I say; this isn\u2019t business,\u201d said Marks. \u201cThere\u2019s different ways, you know, of looking at all subjects. Mr. Haley is a very nice man, no doubt, and has his own conscience; and, Tom, you have your ways, and very good ones, too, Tom; but quarrelling, you know, won\u2019t answer no kind of purpose.

To him she said what she would not disturb her father by saying. To him she imparted those mysterious intimations which the soul feels, as the cords begin to unbind, ere it leaves its clay forever.

If any man calls my honor in question, I have but one answer for him.\u201d The trader cowered at this, and in a somewhat lower tone said that \u201cit was plaguy hard on a fellow, that had made a fair bargain, to be gulled that way.\u201d \u201cMr. Haley,\u201d said Mr. Shelby, \u201cif I did not think you had some cause for disappointment, I should not have borne from you the rude and unceremonious style of your entrance into my parlor this morning.

But now I\u2019m a free man, standing on God\u2019s free soil; and my wife and my child I claim as mine. Jim and his mother are here. We have arms to defend ourselves, and we mean to do it. You can come up, if you like; but the first one of you that comes within the range of our bullets is a dead man, and the next, and the next; and so on till the last.\u201d \u201cO, come! come!\u201d said a short, puffy man, stepping forward, and blowing his nose as he did so.", " This lady, having gathered, from George\u2019s conversation, that he was from Kentucky, seemed evidently disposed to cultivate his acquaintance; in which design she was seconded by the graces of her little girl, who was about as pretty a plaything as ever diverted the weariness of a fortnight\u2019s trip on a steamboat. George\u2019s chair was often placed at her state-room door; and Cassy, as she sat upon the guards, could hear their conversation. Madame de Thoux was very minute in her inquiries as to Kentucky, where she said she had resided in a former period of her life. George discovered, to his surprise, that her former residence must have been in his own vicinity; and her inquiries showed a knowledge of people and things in his vicinity, that was perfectly surprising to him. \u201cDo you know,\u201d said Madame de Thoux to him, one day, \u201cof any man, in your neighborhood, of the name of Harris?\u201d \u201cThere is an old fellow, of that name, lives not far from my father\u2019s place,\u201d said George. \u201cWe never have had much intercourse with him, though.\u201d \u201cHe is a large slave-owner, I believe,\u201d said Madame de Thoux, with a manner which seemed to betray more interest than she was exactly willing to show. \u201cHe is,\u201d said George, looking rather surprised at her manner. \u201cDid you ever know of his having--perhaps, you may have heard of his having a mulatto boy, named George?\u201d \u201cO, certainly,--George Harris,--I know him well; he married a servant of my mother\u2019s, but has escaped, now, to Canada.\u201d \u201cHe has?\u201d said Madame de Thoux, quickly.", " \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d says Eliza, as she begins to cut a loaf of bread. A little older she looks; her form a little fuller; her air more matronly than of yore; but evidently contented and happy as woman need be. \u201cHarry, my boy, how did you come on in that sum, today?\u201d says George, as he laid his hand on his son\u2019s head. Harry has lost his long curls; but he can never lose those eyes and eyelashes, and that fine, bold brow, that flushes with triumph, as he answers, \u201cI did it, every bit of it, _myself_, father; and _nobody_ helped me!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d says his father; \u201cdepend on yourself, my son. You have a better chance than ever your poor father had.\u201d At this moment, there is a rap at the door; and Eliza goes and opens it. The delighted--\u201cWhy! this you?\u201d--calls up her husband; and the good pastor of Amherstberg is welcomed. There are two more women with him, and Eliza asks them to sit down. Now, if the truth must be told, the honest pastor had arranged a little programme, according to which this affair was to develop itself; and, on the way up, all had very cautiously and prudently exhorted each other not to let things out, except according to previous arrangement. What was the good man\u2019s consternation, therefore, just as he had motioned to the ladies to be seated, and was taking out his pocket-handkerchief to wipe his mouth, so as to proceed to his introductory speech in good order, when Madame de Thoux upset the whole plan, by throwing her arms around George\u2019s neck, and letting all out at once, by saying, \u201cO, George!", " \u201cGeorge!\u201d said Mr. Wilson. \u201cYes, George,\u201d said the young man. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have thought it!\u201d \u201cI am pretty well disguised, I fancy,\u201d said the young man, with a smile. \u201cA little walnut bark has made my yellow skin a genteel brown, and I\u2019ve dyed my hair black; so you see I don\u2019t answer to the advertisement at all.\u201d \u201cO, George! but this is a dangerous game you are playing. I could not have advised you to it.\u201d \u201cI can do it on my own responsibility,\u201d said George, with the same proud smile. We remark, _en passant_, that George was, by his father\u2019s side, of white descent. His mother was one of those unfortunates of her race, marked out by personal beauty to be the slave of the passions of her possessor, and the mother of children who may never know a father. From one of the proudest families in Kentucky he had inherited a set of fine European features, and a high, indomitable spirit. From his mother he had received only a slight mulatto tinge, amply compensated by its accompanying rich, dark eye. A slight change in the tint of the skin and the color of his hair had metamorphosed him into the Spanish-looking fellow he then appeared; and as gracefulness of movement and gentlemanly manners had always been perfectly natural to him, he found no difficulty in playing the bold part he had adopted--that of a gentleman travelling with his domestic. Mr. Wilson, a good-natured but extremely fidgety and cautious old gentleman, ambled up and down the room, appearing, as John Bunyan hath it, \u201cmuch tumbled up and down in his mind,\u201d and divided between his wish to help George, and a certain confused notion of maintaining law and order: so, as he shambled about, he delivered himself as follows: \u201cWell, George, I s\u2019pose you\u2019re running away--leaving your lawful master, George--(I don\u2019t wonder at it)--at the same time, I\u2019m sorry, George,--yes, decidedly--I think I must say that, George--it\u2019s my duty to tell you so.\u201d \u201cWhy are you sorry, sir?\u201d said George, calmly."], "Where are Eliza and Harry introduced to Rachel Halliday?": [" But old Simeon Halliday often declared it was as good as any music to him, and the children all avowed that they wouldn\u2019t miss of hearing mother\u2019s chair for anything in the world. For why? for twenty years or more, nothing but loving words, and gentle moralities, and motherly loving kindness, had come from that chair;--head-aches and heart-aches innumerable had been cured there,--difficulties spiritual and temporal solved there,--all by one good, loving woman, God bless her! \u201cAnd so thee still thinks of going to Canada, Eliza?\u201d she said, as she was quietly looking over her peaches. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Eliza, firmly. \u201cI must go onward.

Thee must think about that, my daughter.\u201d \u201cMy daughter\u201d came naturally from the lips of Rachel Halliday; for hers was just the face and form that made \u201cmother\u201d seem the most natural word in the world. Eliza\u2019s hands trembled, and some tears fell on her fine work; but she answered, firmly, \u201cI shall do--anything I can find. I hope I can find something.\u201d \u201cThee knows thee can stay here, as long as thee pleases,\u201d said Rachel. \u201cO, thank you,\u201d said Eliza, \u201cbut\u201d--she pointed to Harry--\u201cI can\u2019t sleep nights; I can\u2019t rest.

The Lord hath ordered it so that never hath a fugitive been stolen from our village.", " \u201cIndeed!\u201d said Rachel, looking thoughtfully, and glancing at Eliza. \u201cDid thee say thy name was Harris?\u201d said Simeon to Eliza, as he reentered. Rachel glanced quickly at her husband, as Eliza tremulously answered \u201cyes;\u201d her fears, ever uppermost, suggesting that possibly there might be advertisements out for her. \u201cMother!\u201d said Simeon, standing in the porch, and calling Rachel out. \u201cWhat does thee want, father?\u201d said Rachel, rubbing her floury hands, as she went into the porch. \u201cThis child\u2019s husband is in the settlement, and will be here tonight,\u201d said Simeon. \u201cNow, thee doesn\u2019t say that, father?\u201d said Rachel, all her face radiant with joy. \u201cIt\u2019s really true. Peter was down yesterday, with the wagon, to the other stand, and there he found an old woman and two men; and one said his name was George Harris; and from what he told of his history, I am certain who he is. He is a bright, likely fellow, too.\u201d \u201cShall we tell her now?\u201d said Simeon. \u201cLet\u2019s tell Ruth,\u201d said Rachel. \u201cHere, Ruth,--come here.\u201d Ruth laid down her knitting-work, and was in the back porch in a moment. \u201cRuth, what does thee think?\u201d said Rachel. \u201cFather says Eliza\u2019s husband is in the last company, and will be here tonight.\u201d A burst of joy from the little Quakeress interrupted the speech. She gave such a bound from the floor, as she clapped her little hands, that two stray curls fell from under her Quaker cap, and lay brightly on her white neckerchief.", " \u201cHush thee, dear!\u201d said Rachel, gently; \u201chush, Ruth! Tell us, shall we tell her now?\u201d \u201cNow! to be sure,--this very minute. Why, now, suppose \u2019t was my John, how should I feel? Do tell her, right off.\u201d \u201cThee uses thyself only to learn how to love thy neighbor, Ruth,\u201d said Simeon, looking, with a beaming face, on Ruth. \u201cTo be sure. Isn\u2019t it what we are made for? If I didn\u2019t love John and the baby, I should not know how to feel for her. Come, now do tell her,--do!\u201d and she laid her hands persuasively on Rachel\u2019s arm. \u201cTake her into thy bed-room, there, and let me fry the chicken while thee does it.\u201d Rachel came out into the kitchen, where Eliza was sewing, and opening the door of a small bed-room, said, gently, \u201cCome in here with me, my daughter; I have news to tell thee.\u201d The blood flushed in Eliza\u2019s pale face; she rose, trembling with nervous anxiety, and looked towards her boy. \u201cNo, no,\u201d said little Ruth, darting up, and seizing her hands. \u201cNever thee fear; it\u2019s good news, Eliza,--go in, go in!\u201d And she gently pushed her to the door which closed after her; and then, turning round, she caught little Harry in her arms, and began kissing him. \u201cThee\u2019ll see thy father, little one. Does thee know it? Thy father is coming,\u201d she said, over and over again, as the boy looked wonderingly at her. Meanwhile, within the door, another scene was going on. Rachel Halliday drew Eliza toward her, and said, \u201cThe Lord hath had mercy on thee, daughter; thy husband hath escaped from the house of bondage.\u201d The blood flushed to Eliza\u2019s cheek in a sudden glow, and went back to her heart with as sudden a rush.", " Rachel now took down a snowy moulding-board, and, tying on an apron, proceeded quietly to making up some biscuits, first saying to Mary,--\u201cMary, hadn\u2019t thee better tell John to get a chicken ready?\u201d and Mary disappeared accordingly. \u201cAnd how is Abigail Peters?\u201d said Rachel, as she went on with her biscuits. \u201cO, she\u2019s better,\u201d said Ruth; \u201cI was in, this morning; made the bed, tidied up the house.

Like his Master, he knew that, if he saved others, himself he could not save; nor could utmost extremity wring from him words, save of prayers and holy trust. \u201cHe\u2019s most gone, Mas\u2019r,\u201d said Sambo, touched, in spite of himself, by the patience of his victim. \u201cPay away, till he gives up! Give it to him!--give it to him!\u201d shouted Legree. \u201cI\u2019ll take every drop of blood he has, unless he confesses!\u201d Tom opened his eyes, and looked upon his master. \u201cYe poor miserable critter!\u201d he said, \u201cthere ain\u2019t no more ye can do! I forgive ye, with all my soul!\u201d and he fainted entirely away. \u201cI b\u2019lieve, my soul, he\u2019s done for, finally,\u201d said Legree, stepping forward, to look at him. \u201cYes, he is! Well, his mouth\u2019s shut up, at last,--that\u2019s one comfort!\u201d Yes, Legree; but who shall shut up that voice in thy soul? that soul, past repentance, past prayer, past hope, in whom the fire that never shall be quenched is already burning! Yet Tom was not quite gone. His wondrous words and pious prayers had struck upon the hearts of the imbruted blacks, who had been the instruments of cruelty upon him; and, the instant Legree withdrew, they took him down, and, in their ignorance, sought to call him back to life,--as if _that_ were any favor to him. \u201cSartin, we \u2019s been doin\u2019 a drefful wicked thing!\u201d said Sambo; \u201chopes Mas\u2019r\u2019ll have to \u2019count for it, and not we.\u201d They washed his wounds,--they provided a rude bed, of some refuse cotton, for him to lie down on; and one of them, stealing up to the house, begged a drink of brandy of Legree, pretending that he was tired, and wanted it for himself.", " It\u2019s perfectly ridiculous to have that going the rounds among us, to this day.\u201d \u201cI think it is,\u201d said St. Clare, significantly. \u201cBecause,\u201d said Alfred, \u201cwe can see plainly enough that all men are _not_ born free, nor born equal; they are born anything else. For my part, I think half this republican talk sheer humbug. It is the educated, the intelligent, the wealthy, the refined, who ought to have equal rights and not the canaille.\u201d \u201cIf you can keep the canaille of that opinion,\u201d said Augustine. \u201cThey took _their_ turn once, in France.\u201d \u201cOf course, they must be _kept down_, consistently, steadily, as I _should_,\u201d said Alfred, setting his foot hard down as if he were standing on somebody. \u201cIt makes a terrible slip when they get up,\u201d said Augustine,--\u201cin St. Domingo, for instance.\u201d \u201cPoh!\u201d said Alfred, \u201cwe\u2019ll take care of that, in this country. We must set our face against all this educating, elevating talk, that is getting about now; the lower class must not be educated.\u201d \u201cThat is past praying for,\u201d said Augustine; \u201ceducated they will be, and we have only to say how. Our system is educating them in barbarism and brutality. We are breaking all humanizing ties, and making them brute beasts; and, if they get the upper hand, such we shall find them.\u201d \u201cThey shall never get the upper hand!\u201d said Alfred. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said St. Clare; \u201cput on the steam, fasten down the escape-valve, and sit on it, and see where you\u2019ll land.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Alfred, \u201cwe _will_ see.", " The \u201cEmperor\u201d Dessalines, come to power in 1804, massacred all the whites on the island. Haitian bloodshed became an argument to show the barbarous nature of the Negro, a doctrine Wendell Phillips sought to combat in his celebrated lecture on Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture. \u201cWell, there is a pretty fair infusion of Anglo Saxon blood among our slaves, now,\u201d said Augustine. \u201cThere are plenty among them who have only enough of the African to give a sort of tropical warmth and fervor to our calculating firmness and foresight. If ever the San Domingo hour comes, Anglo Saxon blood will lead on the day. Sons of white fathers, with all our haughty feelings burning in their veins, will not always be bought and sold and traded. They will rise, and raise with them their mother\u2019s race.\u201d \u201cStuff!--nonsense!\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Augustine, \u201cthere goes an old saying to this effect, \u2019As it was in the days of Noah so shall it be;--they ate, they drank, they planted, they builded, and knew not till the flood came and took them.\u2019\u201d \u201cOn the whole, Augustine, I think your talents might do for a circuit rider,\u201d said Alfred, laughing. \u201cNever you fear for us; possession is our nine points.

If I wasn\u2019t such a poor, feeble piece, I believe I should manage with twice the energy that St. Clare does.\u201d \u201cAnd how does St. Clare contrive to manage?\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cYou say he never strikes a blow.\u201d \u201cWell, men have a more commanding way, you know; it is easier for them; besides, if you ever looked full in his eye, it\u2019s peculiar,--that eye,--and if he speaks decidedly, there\u2019s a kind of flash. I\u2019m afraid of it, myself; and the servants know they must mind. I couldn\u2019t do as much by a regular storm and scolding as St. Clare can by one turn of his eye, if once he is in earnest. O, there\u2019s no trouble about St. Clare; that\u2019s the reason he\u2019s no more feeling for me. But you\u2019ll find, when you come to manage, that there\u2019s no getting along without severity,--they are so bad, so deceitful, so lazy.\u201d \u201cThe old tune,\u201d said St. Clare, sauntering in. \u201cWhat an awful account these wicked creatures will have to settle, at last, especially for being lazy! You see, cousin,\u201d said he, as he stretched himself at full length on a lounge opposite to Marie, \u201cit\u2019s wholly inexcusable in them, in the light of the example that Marie and I set them,--this laziness.\u201d \u201cCome, now, St. Clare, you are too bad!\u201d said Marie. \u201cAm I, now? Why, I thought I was talking good, quite remarkably for me. I try to enforce your remarks, Marie, always.\u201d \u201cYou know you meant no such thing, St. Clare,\u201d said Marie.", " I\u2019m principled about this matter,\u201d said she, turning to Miss Ophelia; \u201cyou\u2019ll find the necessity of it. If you encourage servants in giving way to every little disagreeable feeling, and complaining of every little ailment, you\u2019ll have your hands full. I never complain myself--nobody knows what I endure. I feel it a duty to bear it quietly, and I do.\u201d Miss Ophelia\u2019s round eyes expressed an undisguised amazement at this peroration, which struck St. Clare as so supremely ludicrous, that he burst into a loud laugh. \u201cSt. Clare always laughs when I make the least allusion to my ill health,\u201d said Marie, with the voice of a suffering martyr. \u201cI only hope the day won\u2019t come when he\u2019ll remember it!\u201d and Marie put her handkerchief to her eyes. Of course, there was rather a foolish silence. Finally, St. Clare got up, looked at his watch, and said he had an engagement down street. Eva tripped away after him, and Miss Ophelia and Marie remained at the table alone. \u201cNow, that\u2019s just like St. Clare!\u201d said the latter, withdrawing her handkerchief with somewhat of a spirited flourish when the criminal to be affected by it was no longer in sight. \u201cHe never realizes, never can, never will, what I suffer, and have, for years. If I was one of the complaining sort, or ever made any fuss about my ailments, there would be some reason for it. Men do get tired, naturally, of a complaining wife. But I\u2019ve kept things to myself, and borne, and borne, till St. Clare has got in the way of thinking I can bear anything.\u201d Miss Ophelia did not exactly know what she was expected to answer to this.", " Go right and take it back this moment!\u201d Eva looked downcast and aggrieved, and turned slowly. \u201cI say, Marie, let the child alone; she shall do as she pleases,\u201d said St. Clare. \u201cSt. Clare, how will she ever get along in the world?\u201d said Marie. \u201cThe Lord knows,\u201d said St. Clare, \u201cbut she\u2019ll get along in heaven better than you or I.\u201d \u201cO, papa, don\u2019t,\u201d said Eva, softly touching his elbow; \u201cit troubles mother.\u201d \u201cWell, cousin, are you ready to go to meeting?\u201d said Miss Ophelia, turning square about on St. Clare. \u201cI\u2019m not going, thank you.\u201d \u201cI do wish St. Clare ever would go to church,\u201d said Marie; \u201cbut he hasn\u2019t a particle of religion about him. It really isn\u2019t respectable.\u201d \u201cI know it,\u201d said St. Clare. \u201cYou ladies go to church to learn how to get along in the world, I suppose, and your piety sheds respectability on us. If I did go at all, I would go where Mammy goes; there\u2019s something to keep a fellow awake there, at least.\u201d \u201cWhat! those shouting Methodists? Horrible!\u201d said Marie. \u201cAnything but the dead sea of your respectable churches, Marie. Positively, it\u2019s too much to ask of a man. Eva, do you like to go? Come, stay at home and play with me.\u201d \u201cThank you, papa; but I\u2019d rather go to church.\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t it dreadful tiresome?\u201d said St. Clare. \u201cI think it is tiresome, some,\u201d said Eva, \u201cand I am sleepy, too, but I try to keep awake.\u201d \u201cWhat do you go for, then?\u201d \u201cWhy, you know, papa,\u201d she said, in a whisper, \u201ccousin told me that God wants to have us; and he gives us everything, you know; and it isn\u2019t much to do it, if he wants us to.", " I absolutely am worse, this very morning, for the efforts I had to make to wake her last night.\u201d \u201cHasn\u2019t she sat up with you a good many nights, lately, mamma?\u201d said Eva. \u201cHow should you know that?\u201d said Marie, sharply; \u201cshe\u2019s been complaining, I suppose.\u201d \u201cShe didn\u2019t complain; she only told me what bad nights you\u2019d had,--so many in succession.\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you let Jane or Rosa take her place, a night or two,\u201d said St. Clare, \u201cand let her rest?\u201d \u201cHow can you propose it?\u201d said Marie. \u201cSt. Clare, you really are inconsiderate. So nervous as I am, the least breath disturbs me; and a strange hand about me would drive me absolutely frantic. If Mammy felt the interest in me she ought to, she\u2019d wake easier,--of course, she would. I\u2019ve heard of people who had such devoted servants, but it never was _my_ luck;\u201d and Marie sighed. Miss Ophelia had listened to this conversation with an air of shrewd, observant gravity; and she still kept her lips tightly compressed, as if determined fully to ascertain her longitude and position, before she committed herself. \u201cNow, Mammy has a _sort_ of goodness,\u201d said Marie; \u201cshe\u2019s smooth and respectful, but she\u2019s selfish at heart. Now, she never will be done fidgeting and worrying about that husband of hers. You see, when I was married and came to live here, of course, I had to bring her with me, and her husband my father couldn\u2019t spare. He was a blacksmith, and, of course, very necessary; and I thought and said, at the time, that Mammy and he had better give each other up, as it wasn\u2019t likely to be convenient for them ever to live together again."], "Ophelia's industrious, responsible, and stable disposition contrasts favorably with the disposition of which other member of the St. Clare household?": [" But let me see one of you that would take one into your house with you, and take the labor of their conversion on yourselves! No; when it comes to that, they are dirty and disagreeable, and it\u2019s too much care, and so on.\u201d \u201cAugustine, you know I didn\u2019t think of it in that light,\u201d said Miss Ophelia, evidently softening. \u201cWell, it might be a real missionary work,\u201d said she, looking rather more favorably on the child. St. Clare had touched the right string. Miss Ophelia\u2019s conscientiousness was ever on the alert. \u201cBut,\u201d she added, \u201cI really didn\u2019t see the need of buying this one;--there are enough now, in your house, to take all my time and skill.\u201d \u201cWell, then, Cousin,\u201d said St. Clare, drawing her aside, \u201cI ought to beg your pardon for my good-for-nothing speeches. You are so good, after all, that there\u2019s no sense in them. Why, the fact is, this concern belonged to a couple of drunken creatures that keep a low restaurant that I have to pass by every day, and I was tired of hearing her screaming, and them beating and swearing at her. She looked bright and funny, too, as if something might be made of her;--so I bought her, and I\u2019ll give her to you. Try, now, and give her a good orthodox New England bringing up, and see what it\u2019ll make of her. You know I haven\u2019t any gift that way; but I\u2019d like you to try.\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019ll do what I can,\u201d said Miss Ophelia; and she approached her new subject very much as a person might be supposed to approach a black spider, supposing them to have benevolent designs toward it.", " That\u2019s the only way.

I\u2019ll do it, when I come home from my ride.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very important he should write,\u201d said Eva, \u201cbecause his mistress is going to send down money to redeem him, you know, papa; he told me they told him so.\u201d St. Clare thought, in his heart, that this was probably only one of those things which good-natured owners say to their servants, to alleviate their horror of being sold, without any intention of fulfilling the expectation thus excited. But he did not make any audible comment upon it,--only ordered Tom to get the horses out for a ride. Tom\u2019s letter was written in due form for him that evening, and safely lodged in the post-office. Miss Ophelia still persevered in her labors in the housekeeping line. It was universally agreed, among all the household, from Dinah down to the youngest urchin, that Miss Ophelia was decidedly \u201ccuris,\u201d--a term by which a southern servant implies that his or her betters don\u2019t exactly suit them. The higher circle in the family--to wit, Adolph, Jane and Rosa--agreed that she was no lady; ladies never keep working about as she did,--that she had no _air_ at all; and they were surprised that she should be any relation of the St. Clares.", " I\u2019m principled about this matter,\u201d said she, turning to Miss Ophelia; \u201cyou\u2019ll find the necessity of it.

Miss Ophelia, who, after some rummaging, had hunted up a small Methodist meeting within riding distance, had gone out, with Tom as driver, to attend it; and Eva had accompanied them. \u201cI say, Augustine,\u201d said Marie after dozing a while, \u201cI must send to the city after my old Doctor Posey; I\u2019m sure I\u2019ve got the complaint of the heart.\u201d \u201cWell; why need you send for him?

I\u2019ve been thinking of it, these two or three nights past; I have such distressing pains, and such strange feelings.\u201d \u201cO, Marie, you are blue; I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s heart complaint.\u201d \u201cI dare say _you_ don\u2019t,\u201d said Marie; \u201cI was prepared to expect _that_.

Augustine was glad in his heart that he had married so undiscerning a woman; but as the glosses and civilities of the honeymoon wore away, he discovered that a beautiful young woman, who has lived all her life to be caressed and waited on, might prove quite a hard mistress in domestic life. Marie never had possessed much capability of affection, or much sensibility, and the little that she had, had been merged into a most intense and unconscious selfishness; a selfishness the more hopeless, from its quiet obtuseness, its utter ignorance of any claims but her own. From her infancy, she had been surrounded with servants, who lived only to study her caprices; the idea that they had either feelings or rights had never dawned upon her, even in distant perspective. Her father, whose only child she had been, had never denied her anything that lay within the compass of human possibility; and when she entered life, beautiful, accomplished, and an heiress, she had, of course, all the eligibles and non-eligibles of the other sex sighing at her feet, and she had no doubt that Augustine was a most fortunate man in having obtained her.", " If she hasn\u2019t been talked to, and preached to, and every earthly thing done that anybody could do;--and she\u2019s just so ugly, and always will be; you can\u2019t make anything of the creature!\u201d \u201cBut, mamma, it\u2019s so different to be brought up as I\u2019ve been, with so many friends, so many things to make me good and happy; and to be brought up as she\u2019s been, all the time, till she came here!\u201d \u201cMost likely,\u201d said Marie, yawning,--\u201cdear me, how hot it is!\u201d \u201cMamma, you believe, don\u2019t you, that Topsy could become an angel, as well as any of us, if she were a Christian?\u201d \u201cTopsy! what a ridiculous idea!

Put on your cap. So--a little to one side. I never saw you look quite so pretty. But, it\u2019s almost time for the carriage;--I wonder if Mrs. Smyth has got Harry rigged?\u201d The door opened, and a respectable, middle-aged woman entered, leading little Harry, dressed in girl\u2019s clothes. \u201cWhat a pretty girl he makes,\u201d said Eliza, turning him round.", " \u201cWe call him Harriet, you see;--don\u2019t the name come nicely?\u201d The child stood gravely regarding his mother in her new and strange attire, observing a profound silence, and occasionally drawing deep sighs, and peeping at her from under his dark curls. \u201cDoes Harry know mamma?\u201d said Eliza, stretching her hands toward him. The child clung shyly to the woman. \u201cCome Eliza, why do you try to coax him, when you know that he has got to be kept away from you?\u201d \u201cI know it\u2019s foolish,\u201d said Eliza; \u201cyet, I can\u2019t bear to have him turn away from me. But come,--where\u2019s my cloak? Here,--how is it men put on cloaks, George?\u201d \u201cYou must wear it so,\u201d said her husband, throwing it over his shoulders. \u201cSo, then,\u201d said Eliza, imitating the motion,--\u201cand I must stamp, and take long steps, and try to look saucy.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t exert yourself,\u201d said George. \u201cThere is, now and then, a modest young man; and I think it would be easier for you to act that character.\u201d \u201cAnd these gloves! mercy upon us!\u201d said Eliza; \u201cwhy, my hands are lost in them.\u201d \u201cI advise you to keep them on pretty strictly,\u201d said George. \u201cYour slender paw might bring us all out. Now, Mrs. Smyth, you are to go under our charge, and be our aunty,--you mind.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve heard,\u201d said Mrs. Smyth, \u201cthat there have been men down, warning all the packet captains against a man and woman, with a little boy.\u201d \u201cThey have!\u201d said George. \u201cWell, if we see any such people, we can tell them.\u201d A hack now drove to the door, and the friendly family who had received the fugitives crowded around them with farewell greetings.", " \u201cThere now, Eliza, it\u2019s too bad for me to make you feel so, poor girl!\u201d said he, fondly; \u201cit\u2019s too bad: O, how I wish you never had seen me--you might have been happy!\u201d \u201cGeorge! George! how can you talk so? What dreadful thing has happened, or is going to happen? I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve been very happy, till lately.\u201d \u201cSo we have, dear,\u201d said George. Then drawing his child on his knee, he gazed intently on his glorious dark eyes, and passed his hands through his long curls. \u201cJust like you, Eliza; and you are the handsomest woman I ever saw, and the best one I ever wish to see; but, oh, I wish I\u2019d never seen you, nor you me!\u201d \u201cO, George, how can you!\u201d \u201cYes, Eliza, it\u2019s all misery, misery, misery! My life is bitter as wormwood; the very life is burning out of me. I\u2019m a poor, miserable, forlorn drudge; I shall only drag you down with me, that\u2019s all. What\u2019s the use of our trying to do anything, trying to know anything, trying to be anything? What\u2019s the use of living? I wish I was dead!\u201d \u201cO, now, dear George, that is really wicked! I know how you feel about losing your place in the factory, and you have a hard master; but pray be patient, and perhaps something--\u201d \u201cPatient!\u201d said he, interrupting her; \u201chaven\u2019t I been patient? Did I say a word when he came and took me away, for no earthly reason, from the place where everybody was kind to me? I\u2019d paid him truly every cent of my earnings,--and they all say I worked well.\u201d \u201cWell, it _is_ dreadful,\u201d said Eliza; \u201cbut, after all, he is your master, you know.\u201d \u201cMy master!", " The other party now came up. The seats were taken out of the wagon. The buffalo-skins, doubled in fours, were spread all along one side, and four men, with great difficulty, lifted the heavy form of Tom into it. Before he was gotten in, he fainted entirely. The old negress, in the abundance of her compassion, sat down on the bottom, and took his head in her lap. Eliza, George and Jim, bestowed themselves, as well as they could, in the remaining space and the whole party set forward. \u201cWhat do you think of him?\u201d said George, who sat by Phineas in front. \u201cWell it\u2019s only a pretty deep flesh-wound; but, then, tumbling and scratching down that place didn\u2019t help him much. It has bled pretty freely,--pretty much drained him out, courage and all,--but he\u2019ll get over it, and may be learn a thing or two by it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear you say so,\u201d said George. \u201cIt would always be a heavy thought to me, if I\u2019d caused his death, even in a just cause.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Phineas, \u201ckilling is an ugly operation, any way they\u2019ll fix it,--man or beast. I\u2019ve seen a buck that was shot down and a dying, look that way on a feller with his eye, that it reely most made a feller feel wicked for killing on him; and human creatures is a more serious consideration yet, bein\u2019, as thy wife says, that the judgment comes to \u2019em after death. So I don\u2019t know as our people\u2019s notions on these matters is too strict; and, considerin\u2019 how I was raised, I fell in with them pretty considerably.\u201d \u201cWhat shall you do with this poor fellow?\u201d said George."], "Taking pity on the wounded Tom Locker, Eliza suggests that the Quakers carry him to ___.": [" To him, it is the right of a man to be a man, and not a brute; the right to call the wife of his bosom his wife, and to protect her from lawless violence; the right to protect and educate his child; the right to have a home of his own, a religion of his own, a character of his own, unsubject to the will of another. All these thoughts were rolling and seething in George\u2019s breast, as he was pensively leaning his head on his hand, watching his wife, as she was adapting to her slender and pretty form the articles of man\u2019s attire, in which it was deemed safest she should make her escape. \u201cNow for it,\u201d said she, as she stood before the glass, and shook down her silky abundance of black curly hair. \u201cI say, George, it\u2019s almost a pity, isn\u2019t it,\u201d she said, as she held up some of it, playfully,--\u201cpity it\u2019s all got to come off?\u201d George smiled sadly, and made no answer. Eliza turned to the glass, and the scissors glittered as one long lock after another was detached from her head. \u201cThere, now, that\u2019ll do,\u201d she said, taking up a hair-brush; \u201cnow for a few fancy touches.\u201d \u201cThere, an\u2019t I a pretty young fellow?\u201d she said, turning around to her husband, laughing and blushing at the same time. \u201cYou always will be pretty, do what you will,\u201d said George. \u201cWhat does make you so sober?\u201d said Eliza, kneeling on one knee, and laying her hand on his. \u201cWe are only within twenty-four hours of Canada, they say.", " Only a day and a night on the lake, and then--oh, then!--\u201d \u201cO, Eliza!\u201d said George, drawing her towards him; \u201cthat is it!

It was true; for after some appearance of irresolution and consultation, the whole party got on their horses and rode away. When they were quite out of sight, Phineas began to bestir himself. \u201cWell, we must go down and walk a piece,\u201d he said. \u201cI told Michael to go forward and bring help, and be along back here with the wagon; but we shall have to walk a piece along the road, I reckon, to meet them. The Lord grant he be along soon! It\u2019s early in the day; there won\u2019t be much travel afoot yet a while; we an\u2019t much more than two miles from our stopping-place. If the road hadn\u2019t been so rough last night, we could have outrun \u2019em entirely.\u201d As the party neared the fence, they discovered in the distance, along the road, their own wagon coming back, accompanied by some men on horseback. \u201cWell, now, there\u2019s Michael, and Stephen and Amariah,\u201d exclaimed Phineas, joyfully. \u201cNow we _are_ made--as safe as if we\u2019d got there.\u201d \u201cWell, do stop, then,\u201d said Eliza, \u201cand do something for that poor man; he\u2019s groaning dreadfully.\u201d \u201cIt would be no more than Christian,\u201d said George; \u201clet\u2019s take him up and carry him on.\u201d \u201cAnd doctor him up among the Quakers!\u201d said Phineas; \u201cpretty well, that!", " If she hasn\u2019t been talked to, and preached to, and every earthly thing done that anybody could do;--and she\u2019s just so ugly, and always will be; you can\u2019t make anything of the creature!\u201d \u201cBut, mamma, it\u2019s so different to be brought up as I\u2019ve been, with so many friends, so many things to make me good and happy; and to be brought up as she\u2019s been, all the time, till she came here!\u201d \u201cMost likely,\u201d said Marie, yawning,--\u201cdear me, how hot it is!\u201d \u201cMamma, you believe, don\u2019t you, that Topsy could become an angel, as well as any of us, if she were a Christian?\u201d \u201cTopsy! what a ridiculous idea!

I\u2019ll do it, when I come home from my ride.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very important he should write,\u201d said Eva, \u201cbecause his mistress is going to send down money to redeem him, you know, papa; he told me they told him so.\u201d St. Clare thought, in his heart, that this was probably only one of those things which good-natured owners say to their servants, to alleviate their horror of being sold, without any intention of fulfilling the expectation thus excited. But he did not make any audible comment upon it,--only ordered Tom to get the horses out for a ride. Tom\u2019s letter was written in due form for him that evening, and safely lodged in the post-office. Miss Ophelia still persevered in her labors in the housekeeping line. It was universally agreed, among all the household, from Dinah down to the youngest urchin, that Miss Ophelia was decidedly \u201ccuris,\u201d--a term by which a southern servant implies that his or her betters don\u2019t exactly suit them. The higher circle in the family--to wit, Adolph, Jane and Rosa--agreed that she was no lady; ladies never keep working about as she did,--that she had no _air_ at all; and they were surprised that she should be any relation of the St. Clares.", " Some dim ideas of imprudence or impropriety in the measure seemed to embarrass him considerably; for he often stopped, as Eliza glided forward, and looked wistfully, first at her and then at the house, and then, as if reassured by reflection, he pattered along after her again. A few minutes brought them to the window of Uncle Tom\u2019s cottage, and Eliza stopping, tapped lightly on the window-pane. The prayer-meeting at Uncle Tom\u2019s had, in the order of hymn-singing, been protracted to a very late hour; and, as Uncle Tom had indulged himself in a few lengthy solos afterwards, the consequence was, that, although it was now between twelve and one o\u2019clock, he and his worthy helpmeet were not yet asleep. \u201cGood Lord! what\u2019s that?\u201d said Aunt Chloe, starting up and hastily drawing the curtain. \u201cMy sakes alive, if it an\u2019t Lizy! Get on your clothes, old man, quick!--there\u2019s old Bruno, too, a pawin round; what on airth! I\u2019m gwine to open the door.\u201d And suiting the action to the word, the door flew open, and the light of the tallow candle, which Tom had hastily lighted, fell on the haggard face and dark, wild eyes of the fugitive. \u201cLord bless you!--I\u2019m skeered to look at ye, Lizy! Are ye tuck sick, or what\u2019s come over ye?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m running away--Uncle Tom and Aunt Chloe--carrying off my child--Master sold him!\u201d \u201cSold him?\u201d echoed both, lifting up their hands in dismay. \u201cYes, sold him!\u201d said Eliza, firmly; \u201cI crept into the closet by Mistress\u2019 door tonight, and I heard Master tell Missis that he had sold my Harry, and you, Uncle Tom, both, to a trader; and that he was going off this morning on his horse, and that the man was to take possession today.\u201d Tom had stood, during this speech, with his hands raised, and his eyes dilated, like a man in a dream.", " \u201cNo, no, Mas\u2019r! \u2019tan\u2019t that,--it\u2019s bein\u2019 a _freeman!_ that\u2019s what I\u2019m joyin\u2019 for.\u201d \u201cWhy, Tom, don\u2019t you think, for your own part, you\u2019ve been better off than to be free?\u201d \u201c_No, indeed_, Mas\u2019r St. Clare,\u201d said Tom, with a flash of energy. \u201cNo, indeed!\u201d \u201cWhy, Tom, you couldn\u2019t possibly have earned, by your work, such clothes and such living as I have given you.\u201d \u201cKnows all that, Mas\u2019r St. Clare; Mas\u2019r\u2019s been too good; but, Mas\u2019r, I\u2019d rather have poor clothes, poor house, poor everything, and have \u2019em _mine_, than have the best, and have \u2019em any man\u2019s else,--I had _so_, Mas\u2019r; I think it\u2019s natur, Mas\u2019r.\u201d \u201cI suppose so, Tom, and you\u2019ll be going off and leaving me, in a month or so,\u201d he added, rather discontentedly. \u201cThough why you shouldn\u2019t, no mortal knows,\u201d he said, in a gayer tone; and, getting up, he began to walk the floor. \u201cNot while Mas\u2019r is in trouble,\u201d said Tom. \u201cI\u2019ll stay with Mas\u2019r as long as he wants me,--so as I can be any use.\u201d \u201cNot while I\u2019m in trouble, Tom?\u201d said St. Clare, looking sadly out of the window. . . . \u201cAnd when will _my_ trouble be over?\u201d \u201cWhen Mas\u2019r St. Clare\u2019s a Christian,\u201d said Tom. \u201cAnd you really mean to stay by till that day comes?\u201d said St. Clare, half smiling, as he turned from the window, and laid his hand on Tom\u2019s shoulder. \u201cAh, Tom, you soft, silly boy! I won\u2019t keep you till that day. Go home to your wife and children, and give my love to all.\u201d \u201cI \u2019s faith to believe that day will come,\u201d said Tom, earnestly, and with tears in his eyes; \u201cthe Lord has a work for Mas\u2019r.\u201d \u201cA work, hey?\u201d said St. Clare, \u201cwell, now, Tom, give me your views on what sort of a work it is;--let\u2019s hear.\u201d \u201cWhy, even a poor fellow like me has a work from the Lord; and Mas\u2019r St. Clare, that has larnin, and riches, and friends,--how much he might do for the Lord!\u201d \u201cTom, you seem to think the Lord needs a great deal done for him,\u201d said St. Clare, smiling.", " Tom and Adolph assisted to get him composed for the night, the latter in high spirits, evidently regarding the matter as a good joke, and laughing heartily at the rusticity of Tom\u2019s horror, who really was simple enough to lie awake most of the rest of the night, praying for his young master. \u201cWell, Tom, what are you waiting for?\u201d said St. Clare, the next day, as he sat in his library, in dressing-gown and slippers. St. Clare had just been entrusting Tom with some money, and various commissions. \u201cIsn\u2019t all right there, Tom?\u201d he added, as Tom still stood waiting. \u201cI\u2019m \u2019fraid not, Mas\u2019r,\u201d said Tom, with a grave face. St. Clare laid down his paper, and set down his coffee-cup, and looked at Tom. \u201cWhy Tom, what\u2019s the case? You look as solemn as a coffin.\u201d \u201cI feel very bad, Mas\u2019r. I allays have thought that Mas\u2019r would be good to everybody.\u201d \u201cWell, Tom, haven\u2019t I been? Come, now, what do you want? There\u2019s something you haven\u2019t got, I suppose, and this is the preface.\u201d \u201cMas\u2019r allays been good to me. I haven\u2019t nothing to complain of on that head. But there is one that Mas\u2019r isn\u2019t good to.\u201d \u201cWhy, Tom, what\u2019s got into you? Speak out; what do you mean?\u201d \u201cLast night, between one and two, I thought so. I studied upon the matter then. Mas\u2019r isn\u2019t good to _himself_.\u201d Tom said this with his back to his master, and his hand on the door-knob. St. Clare felt his face flush crimson, but he laughed."], "What vice does Tom attempt to convince Augustine to renounce?": [" Simon rode on, however, apparently well pleased, occasionally pulling away at a flask of spirit, which he kept in his pocket. \u201cI say, _you!_\u201d he said, as he turned back and caught a glance at the dispirited faces behind him. \u201cStrike up a song, boys,--come!\u201d The men looked at each other, and the \u201c_come_\u201d was repeated, with a smart crack of the whip which the driver carried in his hands. Tom began a Methodist hymn. \u201cJerusalem, my happy home, Name ever dear to me! When shall my sorrows have an end, Thy joys when shall--\u201c* * \u201c_Jerusalem, my happy home_,\u201d anonymous hymn dating from the latter part of the sixteenth century, sung to the tune of \u201cSt. Stephen.\u201d Words derive from St. Augustine\u2019s _Meditations_. \u201cShut up, you black cuss!\u201d roared Legree; \u201cdid ye think I wanted any o\u2019 yer infernal old Methodism? I say, tune up, now, something real rowdy,--quick!\u201d One of the other men struck up one of those unmeaning songs, common among the slaves. \u201cMas\u2019r see\u2019d me cotch a coon, High boys, high! He laughed to split,--d\u2019ye see the moon, Ho! ho! ho! boys, ho! Ho! yo! hi--e! _oh!\u201d_ The singer appeared to make up the song to his own pleasure, generally hitting on rhyme, without much attempt at reason; and the party took up the chorus, at intervals, \u201cHo! ho! ho! boys, ho! High--e--oh! high--e--oh!\u201d It was sung very boisterouly, and with a forced attempt at merriment; but no wail of despair, no words of impassioned prayer, could have had such a depth of woe in them as the wild notes of the chorus.", " What\u2019s your name? Tom? Quite as likely to do it for your asking as mine, from all accounts. Can you drive horses, Tom?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been allays used to horses,\u201d said Tom. \u201cMas\u2019r Shelby raised heaps of \u2019em.\u201d \u201cWell, I think I shall put you in coachy, on condition that you won\u2019t be drunk more than once a week, unless in cases of emergency, Tom.\u201d Tom looked surprised, and rather hurt, and said, \u201cI never drink, Mas\u2019r.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve heard that story before, Tom; but then we\u2019ll see. It will be a special accommodation to all concerned, if you don\u2019t. Never mind, my boy,\u201d he added, good-humoredly, seeing Tom still looked grave; \u201cI don\u2019t doubt you mean to do well.\u201d \u201cI sartin do, Mas\u2019r,\u201d said Tom. \u201cAnd you shall have good times,\u201d said Eva. \u201cPapa is very good to everybody, only he always will laugh at them.\u201d \u201cPapa is much obliged to you for his recommendation,\u201d said St. Clare, laughing, as he turned on his heel and walked away. CHAPTER XV Of Tom\u2019s New Master, and Various Other Matters Since the thread of our humble hero\u2019s life has now become interwoven with that of higher ones, it is necessary to give some brief introduction to them. Augustine St. Clare was the son of a wealthy planter of Louisiana. The family had its origin in Canada. Of two brothers, very similar in temperament and character, one had settled on a flourishing farm in Vermont, and the other became an opulent planter in Louisiana. The mother of Augustine was a Huguenot French lady, whose family had emigrated to Louisiana during the days of its early settlement.", " The \u201cEmperor\u201d Dessalines, come to power in 1804, massacred all the whites on the island. Haitian bloodshed became an argument to show the barbarous nature of the Negro, a doctrine Wendell Phillips sought to combat in his celebrated lecture on Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture. \u201cWell, there is a pretty fair infusion of Anglo Saxon blood among our slaves, now,\u201d said Augustine. \u201cThere are plenty among them who have only enough of the African to give a sort of tropical warmth and fervor to our calculating firmness and foresight. If ever the San Domingo hour comes, Anglo Saxon blood will lead on the day. Sons of white fathers, with all our haughty feelings burning in their veins, will not always be bought and sold and traded. They will rise, and raise with them their mother\u2019s race.\u201d \u201cStuff!--nonsense!\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Augustine, \u201cthere goes an old saying to this effect, \u2019As it was in the days of Noah so shall it be;--they ate, they drank, they planted, they builded, and knew not till the flood came and took them.\u2019\u201d \u201cOn the whole, Augustine, I think your talents might do for a circuit rider,\u201d said Alfred, laughing. \u201cNever you fear for us; possession is our nine points. We\u2019ve got the power. This subject race,\u201d said he, stamping firmly, \u201cis down and shall _stay_ down! We have energy enough to manage our own powder.\u201d \u201cSons trained like your Henrique will be grand guardians of your powder-magazines,\u201d said Augustine,--\u201cso cool and self-possessed!", " But he was no man,\u201d he added, suddenly. \u201cNo man ever had such long and living power! O, that I could believe what my mother taught me, and pray as I did when I was a boy!\u201d \u201cIf Mas\u2019r pleases,\u201d said Tom, \u201cMiss Eva used to read this so beautifully. I wish Mas\u2019r\u2019d be so good as read it. Don\u2019t get no readin\u2019, hardly, now Miss Eva\u2019s gone.\u201d The chapter was the eleventh of John,--the touching account of the raising of Lazarus, St. Clare read it aloud, often pausing to wrestle down feelings which were roused by the pathos of the story. Tom knelt before him, with clasped hands, and with an absorbed expression of love, trust, adoration, on his quiet face. \u201cTom,\u201d said his Master, \u201cthis is all _real_ to you!\u201d \u201cI can jest fairly _see_ it Mas\u2019r,\u201d said Tom. \u201cI wish I had your eyes, Tom.\u201d \u201cI wish, to the dear Lord, Mas\u2019r had!\u201d \u201cBut, Tom, you know that I have a great deal more knowledge than you; what if I should tell you that I don\u2019t believe this Bible?\u201d \u201cO, Mas\u2019r!\u201d said Tom, holding up his hands, with a deprecating gesture. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it shake your faith some, Tom?\u201d \u201cNot a grain,\u201d said Tom. \u201cWhy, Tom, you must know I know the most.\u201d \u201cO, Mas\u2019r, haven\u2019t you jest read how he hides from the wise and prudent, and reveals unto babes? But Mas\u2019r wasn\u2019t in earnest, for sartin, now?\u201d said Tom, anxiously. \u201cNo, Tom, I was not. I don\u2019t disbelieve, and I think there is reason to believe; and still I don\u2019t. It\u2019s a troublesome bad habit I\u2019ve got, Tom.\u201d \u201cIf Mas\u2019r would only pray!\u201d \u201cHow do you know I don\u2019t, Tom?\u201d \u201cDoes Mas\u2019r?\u201d \u201cI would, Tom, if there was anybody there when I pray; but it\u2019s all speaking unto nothing, when I do."], "After Prue's death at the hands of her cruel master, which character dejectedly says: \"The most I can do is try to keep out of the way of it\"?": [" \u201cO, Tom! here you are. I\u2019m glad I\u2019ve found you. Papa says you may get out the ponies, and take me in my little new carriage,\u201d she said, catching his hand. \u201cBut what\u2019s the matter Tom?--you look sober.\u201d \u201cI feel bad, Miss Eva,\u201d said Tom, sorrowfully. \u201cBut I\u2019ll get the horses for you.\u201d \u201cBut do tell me, Tom, what is the matter. I saw you talking to cross old Prue.\u201d Tom, in simple, earnest phrase, told Eva the woman\u2019s history. She did not exclaim or wonder, or weep, as other children do. Her cheeks grew pale, and a deep, earnest shadow passed over her eyes. She laid both hands on her bosom, and sighed heavily. VOLUME II CHAPTER XIX Miss Ophelia\u2019s Experiences and Opinions Continued \u201cTom, you needn\u2019t get me the horses. I don\u2019t want to go,\u201d she said. \u201cWhy not, Miss Eva?\u201d \u201cThese things sink into my heart, Tom,\u201d said Eva,--\u201cthey sink into my heart,\u201d she repeated, earnestly. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go;\u201d and she turned from Tom, and went into the house. A few days after, another woman came, in old Prue\u2019s place, to bring the rusks; Miss Ophelia was in the kitchen. \u201cLor!\u201d said Dinah, \u201cwhat\u2019s got Prue?\u201d \u201cPrue isn\u2019t coming any more,\u201d said the woman, mysteriously. \u201cWhy not?\u201d said Dinah, \u201cshe an\u2019t dead, is she?\u201d \u201cWe doesn\u2019t exactly know. She\u2019s down cellar,\u201d said the woman, glancing at Miss Ophelia. After Miss Ophelia had taken the rusks, Dinah followed the woman to the door. \u201cWhat _has_ got Prue, any how?\u201d she said.", " thar\u2019s Prue a coming, grunting along like she allers does.\u201d A tall, bony colored woman now entered the kitchen, bearing on her head a basket of rusks and hot rolls. \u201cHo, Prue! you\u2019ve come,\u201d said Dinah. Prue had a peculiar scowling expression of countenance, and a sullen, grumbling voice. She set down her basket, squatted herself down, and resting her elbows on her knees said, \u201cO Lord! I wish\u2019t I \u2019s dead!\u201d \u201cWhy do you wish you were dead?\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cI\u2019d be out o\u2019 my misery,\u201d said the woman, gruffly, without taking her eyes from the floor. \u201cWhat need you getting drunk, then, and cutting up, Prue?\u201d said a spruce quadroon chambermaid, dangling, as she spoke, a pair of coral ear-drops. The woman looked at her with a sour surly glance. \u201cMaybe you\u2019ll come to it, one of these yer days. I\u2019d be glad to see you, I would; then you\u2019ll be glad of a drop, like me, to forget your misery.\u201d \u201cCome, Prue,\u201d said Dinah, \u201clet\u2019s look at your rusks. Here\u2019s Missis will pay for them.\u201d Miss Ophelia took out a couple of dozen. \u201cThar\u2019s some tickets in that ar old cracked jug on the top shelf,\u201d said Dinah. \u201cYou, Jake, climb up and get it down.\u201d \u201cTickets,--what are they for?\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cWe buy tickets of her Mas\u2019r, and she gives us bread for \u2019em.\u201d \u201cAnd they counts my money and tickets, when I gets home, to see if I \u2019s got the change; and if I han\u2019t, they half kills me.\u201d \u201cAnd serves you right,\u201d said Jane, the pert chambermaid, \u201cif you will take their money to get drunk on.", " The woman seemed desirous, yet reluctant, to speak, and answered, in low, mysterious tone. \u201cWell, you mustn\u2019t tell nobody, Prue, she got drunk agin,--and they had her down cellar,--and thar they left her all day,--and I hearn \u2019em saying that the _flies had got to her_,--and _she\u2019s dead_!\u201d Dinah held up her hands, and, turning, saw close by her side the spirit-like form of Evangeline, her large, mystic eyes dilated with horror, and every drop of blood driven from her lips and cheeks. \u201cLor bless us! Miss Eva\u2019s gwine to faint away! What go us all, to let her har such talk? Her pa\u2019ll be rail mad.\u201d \u201cI shan\u2019t faint, Dinah,\u201d said the child, firmly; \u201cand why shouldn\u2019t I hear it? It an\u2019t so much for me to hear it, as for poor Prue to suffer it.\u201d \u201c_Lor sakes_! it isn\u2019t for sweet, delicate young ladies, like you,--these yer stories isn\u2019t; it\u2019s enough to kill \u2019em!\u201d Eva sighed again, and walked up stairs with a slow and melancholy step. Miss Ophelia anxiously inquired the woman\u2019s story. Dinah gave a very garrulous version of it, to which Tom added the particulars which he had drawn from her that morning. \u201cAn abominable business,--perfectly horrible!\u201d she exclaimed, as she entered the room where St. Clare lay reading his paper. \u201cPray, what iniquity has turned up now?\u201d said he. \u201cWhat now? why, those folks have whipped Prue to death!\u201d said Miss Ophelia, going on, with great strength of detail, into the story, and enlarging on its most shocking particulars.", " I used to talk to Tom. \u2018Why, Tom,\u2019 I used to say, \u2018when your gals takes on and cry, what\u2019s the use o\u2019 crackin on\u2019 em over the head, and knockin\u2019 on \u2019em round? It\u2019s ridiculous,\u2019 says I, \u2018and don\u2019t do no sort o\u2019 good. Why, I don\u2019t see no harm in their cryin\u2019, says I; \u2019it\u2019s natur,\u2019 says I, \u2019and if natur can\u2019t blow off one way, it will another. Besides, Tom,\u2019 says I, \u2019it jest spiles your gals; they get sickly, and down in the mouth; and sometimes they gets ugly,--particular yallow gals do,--and it\u2019s the devil and all gettin\u2019 on \u2019em broke in. Now,\u2019 says I, \u2018why can\u2019t you kinder coax \u2019em up, and speak \u2019em fair? Depend on it, Tom, a little humanity, thrown in along, goes a heap further than all your jawin\u2019 and crackin\u2019; and it pays better,\u2019 says I, \u2018depend on \u2019t.\u2019 But Tom couldn\u2019t get the hang on \u2019t; and he spiled so many for me, that I had to break off with him, though he was a good-hearted fellow, and as fair a business hand as is goin\u2019.\u201d \u201cAnd do you find your ways of managing do the business better than Tom\u2019s?\u201d said Mr. Shelby. \u201cWhy, yes, sir, I may say so. You see, when I any ways can, I takes a leetle care about the onpleasant parts, like selling young uns and that,--get the gals out of the way--out of sight, out of mind, you know,--and when it\u2019s clean done, and can\u2019t be helped, they naturally gets used to it. \u2019Tan\u2019t, you know, as if it was white folks, that\u2019s brought up in the way of \u2019spectin\u2019 to keep their children and wives, and all that."], "Appealing to Ophelia's conscience, Augustine suggests that becoming Topsy's teacher would be akin to which religious calling?": [" I used to have great hopes of you,\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cWell, haven\u2019t you now?\u201d said St. Clare. \u201cI wish you were as good as you were when you were a boy, Augustine.\u201d \u201cSo do I, that\u2019s a fact, Cousin,\u201d said St. Clare. \u201cWell, go ahead and catechize Topsy; may be you\u2019ll make out something yet.\u201d Topsy, who had stood like a black statue during this discussion, with hands decently folded, now, at a signal from Miss Ophelia, went on: \u201cOur first parents, being left to the freedom of their own will, fell from the state wherein they were created.\u201d Topsy\u2019s eyes twinkled, and she looked inquiringly. \u201cWhat is it, Topsy?\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cPlease, Missis, was dat ar state Kintuck?\u201d \u201cWhat state, Topsy?\u201d \u201cDat state dey fell out of. I used to hear Mas\u2019r tell how we came down from Kintuck.\u201d St. Clare laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to give her a meaning, or she\u2019ll make one,\u201d said he. \u201cThere seems to be a theory of emigration suggested there.\u201d \u201cO! Augustine, be still,\u201d said Miss Ophelia; \u201chow can I do anything, if you will be laughing?\u201d \u201cWell, I won\u2019t disturb the exercises again, on my honor;\u201d and St. Clare took his paper into the parlor, and sat down, till Topsy had finished her recitations. They were all very well, only that now and then she would oddly transpose some important words, and persist in the mistake, in spite of every effort to the contrary; and St. Clare, after all his promises of goodness, took a wicked pleasure in these mistakes, calling Topsy to him whenever he had a mind to amuse himself, and getting her to repeat the offending passages, in spite of Miss Ophelia\u2019s remonstrances.", " In a moment, laying his finger on his lips, he made a silent gesture to Miss Ophelia to come and look. There sat the two children on the floor, with their side faces towards them. Topsy, with her usual air of careless drollery and unconcern; but, opposite to her, Eva, her whole face fervent with feeling, and tears in her large eyes. \u201cWhat does make you so bad, Topsy? Why won\u2019t you try and be good? Don\u2019t you love _anybody_, Topsy?\u201d \u201cDonno nothing \u2019bout love; I loves candy and sich, that\u2019s all,\u201d said Topsy. \u201cBut you love your father and mother?\u201d \u201cNever had none, ye know. I telled ye that, Miss Eva.\u201d \u201cO, I know,\u201d said Eva, sadly; \u201cbut hadn\u2019t you any brother, or sister, or aunt, or--\u201d \u201cNo, none on \u2019em,--never had nothing nor nobody.\u201d \u201cBut, Topsy, if you\u2019d only try to be good, you might--\u201d \u201cCouldn\u2019t never be nothin\u2019 but a nigger, if I was ever so good,\u201d said Topsy. \u201cIf I could be skinned, and come white, I\u2019d try then.\u201d \u201cBut people can love you, if you are black, Topsy. Miss Ophelia would love you, if you were good.\u201d Topsy gave the short, blunt laugh that was her common mode of expressing incredulity. \u201cDon\u2019t you think so?\u201d said Eva. \u201cNo; she can\u2019t bar me, \u2019cause I\u2019m a nigger!--she\u2019d \u2019s soon have a toad touch her! There can\u2019t nobody love niggers, and niggers can\u2019t do nothin\u2019! _I_ don\u2019t care,\u201d said Topsy, beginning to whistle. \u201cO, Topsy, poor child, _I_ love you!\u201d said Eva, with a sudden burst of feeling, and laying her little thin, white hand on Topsy\u2019s shoulder; \u201cI love you, because you haven\u2019t had any father, or mother, or friends;--because you\u2019ve been a poor, abused child!", " Did any of our readers ever do the same, they will appreciate the amount of her self-sacrifice. Miss Ophelia began with Topsy by taking her into her chamber, the first morning, and solemnly commencing a course of instruction in the art and mystery of bed-making. Behold, then, Topsy, washed and shorn of all the little braided tails wherein her heart had delighted, arrayed in a clean gown, with well-starched apron, standing reverently before Miss Ophelia, with an expression of solemnity well befitting a funeral. \u201cNow, Topsy, I\u2019m going to show you just how my bed is to be made. I am very particular about my bed. You must learn exactly how to do it.\u201d \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d says Topsy, with a deep sigh, and a face of woful earnestness. \u201cNow, Topsy, look here;--this is the hem of the sheet,--this is the right side of the sheet, and this is the wrong;--will you remember?\u201d \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d says Topsy, with another sigh. \u201cWell, now, the under sheet you must bring over the bolster,--so--and tuck it clear down under the mattress nice and smooth,--so,--do you see?\u201d \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Topsy, with profound attention. \u201cBut the upper sheet,\u201d said Miss Ophelia, \u201cmust be brought down in this way, and tucked under firm and smooth at the foot,--so,--the narrow hem at the foot.\u201d \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Topsy, as before;--but we will add, what Miss Ophelia did not see, that, during the time when the good lady\u2019s back was turned in the zeal of her manipulations, the young disciple had contrived to snatch a pair of gloves and a ribbon, which she had adroitly slipped into her sleeves, and stood with her hands dutifully folded, as before.", " \u201cNow, Topsy, let\u2019s see _you_ do this,\u201d said Miss Ophelia, pulling off the clothes, and seating herself. Topsy, with great gravity and adroitness, went through the exercise completely to Miss Ophelia\u2019s satisfaction; smoothing the sheets, patting out every wrinkle, and exhibiting, through the whole process, a gravity and seriousness with which her instructress was greatly edified. By an unlucky slip, however, a fluttering fragment of the ribbon hung out of one of her sleeves, just as she was finishing, and caught Miss Ophelia\u2019s attention. Instantly, she pounced upon it. \u201cWhat\u2019s this? You naughty, wicked child,--you\u2019ve been stealing this!\u201d The ribbon was pulled out of Topsy\u2019s own sleeve, yet was she not in the least disconcerted; she only looked at it with an air of the most surprised and unconscious innocence. \u201cLaws! why, that ar\u2019s Miss Feely\u2019s ribbon, an\u2019t it? How could it a got caught in my sleeve? \u201cTopsy, you naughty girl, don\u2019t you tell me a lie,--you stole that ribbon!\u201d \u201cMissis, I declar for \u2019t, I didn\u2019t;--never seed it till dis yer blessed minnit.\u201d \u201cTopsy,\u201d said Miss Ophelia, \u201cdon\u2019t you know it\u2019s wicked to tell lies?\u201d \u201cI never tell no lies, Miss Feely,\u201d said Topsy, with virtuous gravity; \u201cit\u2019s jist the truth I\u2019ve been a tellin now, and an\u2019t nothin else.\u201d \u201cTopsy, I shall have to whip you, if you tell lies so.\u201d \u201cLaws, Missis, if you\u2019s to whip all day, couldn\u2019t say no other way,\u201d said Topsy, beginning to blubber."], "What does Topsy steal?": [" In a moment, laying his finger on his lips, he made a silent gesture to Miss Ophelia to come and look.

There can\u2019t nobody love niggers, and niggers can\u2019t do nothin\u2019! _I_ don\u2019t care,\u201d said Topsy, beginning to whistle. \u201cO, Topsy, poor child, _I_ love you!\u201d said Eva, with a sudden burst of feeling, and laying her little thin, white hand on Topsy\u2019s shoulder; \u201cI love you, because you haven\u2019t had any father, or mother, or friends;--because you\u2019ve been a poor, abused child!", " \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful bouquet!\u201d said Eva, looking at it. It was rather a singular one,--a brilliant scarlet geranium, and one single white japonica, with its glossy leaves. It was tied up with an evident eye to the contrast of color, and the arrangement of every leaf had carefully been studied. Topsy looked pleased, as Eva said,--\u201cTopsy, you arrange flowers very prettily. Here,\u201d she said, \u201cis this vase I haven\u2019t any flowers for. I wish you\u2019d arrange something every day for it.\u201d \u201cWell, that\u2019s odd!\u201d said Marie. \u201cWhat in the world do you want that for?\u201d \u201cNever mind, mamma; you\u2019d as lief as not Topsy should do it,--had you not?\u201d \u201cOf course, anything you please, dear! Topsy, you hear your young mistress;--see that you mind.\u201d Topsy made a short courtesy, and looked down; and, as she turned away, Eva saw a tear roll down her dark cheek. \u201cYou see, mamma, I knew poor Topsy wanted to do something for me,\u201d said Eva to her mother. \u201cO, nonsense! it\u2019s only because she likes to do mischief. She knows she mustn\u2019t pick flowers,--so she does it; that\u2019s all there is to it. But, if you fancy to have her pluck them, so be it.\u201d \u201cMamma, I think Topsy is different from what she used to be; she\u2019s trying to be a good girl.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019ll have to try a good while before _she_ gets to be good,\u201d said Marie, with a careless laugh. \u201cWell, you know, mamma, poor Topsy! everything has always been against her.\u201d \u201cNot since she\u2019s been here, I\u2019m sure.", " Did any of our readers ever do the same, they will appreciate the amount of her self-sacrifice. Miss Ophelia began with Topsy by taking her into her chamber, the first morning, and solemnly commencing a course of instruction in the art and mystery of bed-making. Behold, then, Topsy, washed and shorn of all the little braided tails wherein her heart had delighted, arrayed in a clean gown, with well-starched apron, standing reverently before Miss Ophelia, with an expression of solemnity well befitting a funeral. \u201cNow, Topsy, I\u2019m going to show you just how my bed is to be made. I am very particular about my bed. You must learn exactly how to do it.\u201d \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d says Topsy, with a deep sigh, and a face of woful earnestness. \u201cNow, Topsy, look here;--this is the hem of the sheet,--this is the right side of the sheet, and this is the wrong;--will you remember?\u201d \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d says Topsy, with another sigh. \u201cWell, now, the under sheet you must bring over the bolster,--so--and tuck it clear down under the mattress nice and smooth,--so,--do you see?\u201d \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Topsy, with profound attention. \u201cBut the upper sheet,\u201d said Miss Ophelia, \u201cmust be brought down in this way, and tucked under firm and smooth at the foot,--so,--the narrow hem at the foot.\u201d \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Topsy, as before;--but we will add, what Miss Ophelia did not see, that, during the time when the good lady\u2019s back was turned in the zeal of her manipulations, the young disciple had contrived to snatch a pair of gloves and a ribbon, which she had adroitly slipped into her sleeves, and stood with her hands dutifully folded, as before.", " \u201cNow, Topsy, let\u2019s see _you_ do this,\u201d said Miss Ophelia, pulling off the clothes, and seating herself. Topsy, with great gravity and adroitness, went through the exercise completely to Miss Ophelia\u2019s satisfaction; smoothing the sheets, patting out every wrinkle, and exhibiting, through the whole process, a gravity and seriousness with which her instructress was greatly edified. By an unlucky slip, however, a fluttering fragment of the ribbon hung out of one of her sleeves, just as she was finishing, and caught Miss Ophelia\u2019s attention. Instantly, she pounced upon it. \u201cWhat\u2019s this? You naughty, wicked child,--you\u2019ve been stealing this!\u201d The ribbon was pulled out of Topsy\u2019s own sleeve, yet was she not in the least disconcerted; she only looked at it with an air of the most surprised and unconscious innocence. \u201cLaws! why, that ar\u2019s Miss Feely\u2019s ribbon, an\u2019t it? How could it a got caught in my sleeve? \u201cTopsy, you naughty girl, don\u2019t you tell me a lie,--you stole that ribbon!\u201d \u201cMissis, I declar for \u2019t, I didn\u2019t;--never seed it till dis yer blessed minnit.\u201d \u201cTopsy,\u201d said Miss Ophelia, \u201cdon\u2019t you know it\u2019s wicked to tell lies?\u201d \u201cI never tell no lies, Miss Feely,\u201d said Topsy, with virtuous gravity; \u201cit\u2019s jist the truth I\u2019ve been a tellin now, and an\u2019t nothin else.\u201d \u201cTopsy, I shall have to whip you, if you tell lies so.\u201d \u201cLaws, Missis, if you\u2019s to whip all day, couldn\u2019t say no other way,\u201d said Topsy, beginning to blubber."], "In order to raise money to buy back Uncle Tom, what service does Aunt Chloe offer Mrs. Shelby?": [" Her heart was set on performing her promise to Tom and Aunt Chloe, and she sighed as discouragements thickened around her. \u201cDon\u2019t you think we might in some way contrive to raise that money? Poor Aunt Chloe! her heart is so set on it!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry, if it is. I think I was premature in promising. I\u2019m not sure, now, but it\u2019s the best way to tell Chloe, and let her make up her mind to it. Tom\u2019ll have another wife, in a year or two; and she had better take up with somebody else.\u201d \u201cMr. Shelby, I have taught my people that their marriages are as sacred as ours. I never could think of giving Chloe such advice.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a pity, wife, that you have burdened them with a morality above their condition and prospects.

I tell you, my dear, _I_ cannot absolve myself from the promises I make to these helpless creatures. If I can get the money no other way I will take music-scholars;--I could get enough, I know, and earn the money myself.\u201d \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t degrade yourself that way, Emily? I never could consent to it.\u201d \u201cDegrade! would it degrade me as much as to break my faith with the helpless? No, indeed!\u201d \u201cWell, you are always heroic and transcendental,\u201d said Mr. Shelby, \u201cbut I think you had better think before you undertake such a piece of Quixotism.\u201d Here the conversation was interrupted by the appearance of Aunt Chloe, at the end of the verandah.", " \u201cMissis has got dem bills?\u201d said Chloe, anxiously. \u201cYes, Chloe.\u201d \u201c\u2018Cause I wants to show my old man dem very bills de _perfectioner_ gave me. \u2018And,\u2019 say he, \u2018Chloe, I wish you\u2019d stay longer.\u2019 \u2018Thank you, Mas\u2019r,\u2019 says I, \u2018I would, only my old man\u2019s coming home, and Missis,--she can\u2019t do without me no longer.\u2019 There\u2019s jist what I telled him.

Mrs. Shelby ran to the entry door, and was folded in the arms of her son. Aunt Chloe stood anxiously straining her eyes out into the darkness. \u201cO, _poor_ Aunt Chloe!\u201d said George, stopping compassionately, and taking her hard, black hand between both his; \u201cI\u2019d have given all my fortune to have brought him with me, but he\u2019s gone to a better country.\u201d There was a passionate exclamation from Mrs. Shelby, but Aunt Chloe said nothing. The party entered the supper-room.", " Mrs. Shelby entered. Aunt Chloe set a chair for her in a manner decidedly gruff and crusty. She did not seem to notice either the action or the manner. She looked pale and anxious. \u201cTom,\u201d she said, \u201cI come to--\u201d and stopping suddenly, and regarding the silent group, she sat down in the chair, and, covering her face with her handkerchief, began to sob. \u201cLor, now, Missis, don\u2019t--don\u2019t!\u201d said Aunt Chloe, bursting out in her turn; and for a few moments they all wept in company. And in those tears they all shed together, the high and the lowly, melted away all the heart-burnings and anger of the oppressed. O, ye who visit the distressed, do ye know that everything your money can buy, given with a cold, averted face, is not worth one honest tear shed in real sympathy? \u201cMy good fellow,\u201d said Mrs. Shelby, \u201cI can\u2019t give you anything to do you any good.

Tom, sing about \u2019spirits bright.\u2019\u201d Tom sung the words of a well-known Methodist hymn, \u201cI see a band of spirits bright, That taste the glories there; They all are robed in spotless white, And conquering palms they bear.\u201d \u201cUncle Tom, I\u2019ve seen _them_,\u201d said Eva. Tom had no doubt of it at all; it did not surprise him in the least. If Eva had told him she had been to heaven, he would have thought it entirely probable. \u201cThey come to me sometimes in my sleep, those spirits;\u201d and Eva\u2019s eyes grew dreamy, and she hummed, in a low voice, \u201cThey are all robed in spotless white, And conquering palms they bear.\u201d \u201cUncle Tom,\u201d said Eva, \u201cI\u2019m going there.\u201d \u201cWhere, Miss Eva?\u201d The child rose, and pointed her little hand to the sky; the glow of evening lit her golden hair and flushed cheek with a kind of unearthly radiance, and her eyes were bent earnestly on the skies. \u201cI\u2019m going _there_,\u201d she said, \u201cto the spirits bright, Tom; _I\u2019m going, before long_.\u201d The faithful old heart felt a sudden thrust; and Tom thought how often he had noticed, within six months, that Eva\u2019s little hands had grown thinner, and her skin more transparent, and her breath shorter; and how, when she ran or played in the garden, as she once could for hours, she became soon so tired and languid.", " \u201cO, Uncle Tom! what funny things you _are_ making, there!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m trying to write to my poor old woman, Miss Eva, and my little chil\u2019en,\u201d said Tom, drawing the back of his hand over his eyes; \u201cbut, some how, I\u2019m feard I shan\u2019t make it out.\u201d \u201cI wish I could help you, Tom! I\u2019ve learnt to write some. Last year I could make all the letters, but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve forgotten.\u201d So Eva put her golden head close to his, and the two commenced a grave and anxious discussion, each one equally earnest, and about equally ignorant; and, with a deal of consulting and advising over every word, the composition began, as they both felt very sanguine, to look quite like writing. \u201cYes, Uncle Tom, it really begins to look beautiful,\u201d said Eva, gazing delightedly on it. \u201cHow pleased your wife\u2019ll be, and the poor little children! O, it\u2019s a shame you ever had to go away from them!

The boat here stopped at a small landing to take in wood, and Eva, hearing her father\u2019s voice, bounded nimbly away. Tom rose up, and went forward to offer his service in wooding, and soon was busy among the hands. Eva and her father were standing together by the railings to see the boat start from the landing-place, the wheel had made two or three revolutions in the water, when, by some sudden movement, the little one suddenly lost her balance and fell sheer over the side of the boat into the water. Her father, scarce knowing what he did, was plunging in after her, but was held back by some behind him, who saw that more efficient aid had followed his child. Tom was standing just under her on the lower deck, as she fell. He saw her strike the water, and sink, and was after her in a moment. A broad-chested, strong-armed fellow, it was nothing for him to keep afloat in the water, till, in a moment or two the child rose to the surface, and he caught her in his arms, and, swimming with her to the boat-side, handed her up, all dripping, to the grasp of hundreds of hands, which, as if they had all belonged to one man, were stretched eagerly out to receive her.", " Some dim ideas of imprudence or impropriety in the measure seemed to embarrass him considerably; for he often stopped, as Eliza glided forward, and looked wistfully, first at her and then at the house, and then, as if reassured by reflection, he pattered along after her again. A few minutes brought them to the window of Uncle Tom\u2019s cottage, and Eliza stopping, tapped lightly on the window-pane. The prayer-meeting at Uncle Tom\u2019s had, in the order of hymn-singing, been protracted to a very late hour; and, as Uncle Tom had indulged himself in a few lengthy solos afterwards, the consequence was, that, although it was now between twelve and one o\u2019clock, he and his worthy helpmeet were not yet asleep. \u201cGood Lord! what\u2019s that?\u201d said Aunt Chloe, starting up and hastily drawing the curtain. \u201cMy sakes alive, if it an\u2019t Lizy! Get on your clothes, old man, quick!--there\u2019s old Bruno, too, a pawin round; what on airth! I\u2019m gwine to open the door.\u201d And suiting the action to the word, the door flew open, and the light of the tallow candle, which Tom had hastily lighted, fell on the haggard face and dark, wild eyes of the fugitive. \u201cLord bless you!--I\u2019m skeered to look at ye, Lizy! Are ye tuck sick, or what\u2019s come over ye?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m running away--Uncle Tom and Aunt Chloe--carrying off my child--Master sold him!\u201d \u201cSold him?\u201d echoed both, lifting up their hands in dismay. \u201cYes, sold him!\u201d said Eliza, firmly; \u201cI crept into the closet by Mistress\u2019 door tonight, and I heard Master tell Missis that he had sold my Harry, and you, Uncle Tom, both, to a trader; and that he was going off this morning on his horse, and that the man was to take possession today.\u201d Tom had stood, during this speech, with his hands raised, and his eyes dilated, like a man in a dream."], "When Eva reprimands Henrique for striking his slave Dodo, what does Henrique offer Dodo?": [" \u201cDear Cousin, you don\u2019t know Dodo; it\u2019s the only way to manage him, he\u2019s so full of lies and excuses.

A few cuts never come amiss with Dodo,--he\u2019s a regular spirit, I can tell you; but I won\u2019t beat him again before you, if it troubles you.\u201d Eva was not satisfied, but found it in vain to try to make her handsome cousin understand her feelings. Dodo soon appeared, with the horses. \u201cWell, Dodo, you\u2019ve done pretty well, this time,\u201d said his young master, with a more gracious air. \u201cCome, now, and hold Miss Eva\u2019s horse while I put her on to the saddle.\u201d Dodo came and stood by Eva\u2019s pony. His face was troubled; his eyes looked as if he had been crying. Henrique, who valued himself on his gentlemanly adroitness in all matters of gallantry, soon had his fair cousin in the saddle, and, gathering the reins, placed them in her hands. But Eva bent to the other side of the horse, where Dodo was standing, and said, as he relinquished the reins,--\u201cThat\u2019s a good boy, Dodo;--thank you!\u201d Dodo looked up in amazement into the sweet young face; the blood rushed to his cheeks, and the tears to his eyes.", " \u201cHere, Dodo,\u201d said his master, imperiously. Dodo sprang and held the horse, while his master mounted. \u201cThere\u2019s a picayune for you to buy candy with, Dodo,\u201d said Henrique; \u201cgo get some.\u201d And Henrique cantered down the walk after Eva. Dodo stood looking after the two children. One had given him money; and one had given him what he wanted far more,--a kind word, kindly spoken. Dodo had been only a few months away from his mother. His master had bought him at a slave warehouse, for his handsome face, to be a match to the handsome pony; and he was now getting his breaking in, at the hands of his young master. The scene of the beating had been witnessed by the two brothers St. Clare, from another part of the garden. Augustine\u2019s cheek flushed; but he only observed, with his usual sarcastic carelessness. \u201cI suppose that\u2019s what we may call republican education, Alfred?\u201d \u201cHenrique is a devil of a fellow, when his blood\u2019s up,\u201d said Alfred, carelessly. \u201cI suppose you consider this an instructive practice for him,\u201d said Augustine, drily. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help it, if I didn\u2019t. Henrique is a regular little tempest;--his mother and I have given him up, long ago. But, then, that Dodo is a perfect sprite,--no amount of whipping can hurt him.\u201d \u201cAnd this by way of teaching Henrique the first verse of a republican\u2019s catechism, \u2019All men are born free and equal!\u2019\u201d \u201cPoh!\u201d said Alfred; \u201cone of Tom Jefferson\u2019s pieces of French sentiment and humbug.", " \u201cGood heavens! what perfectly dazzling beauty!\u201d said Alfred. \u201cI tell you, Auguste, won\u2019t she make some hearts ache, one of these days?\u201d \u201cShe will, too truly,--God knows I\u2019m afraid so!\u201d said St. Clare, in a tone of sudden bitterness, as he hurried down to take her off her horse. \u201cEva darling! you\u2019re not much tired?\u201d he said, as he clasped her in his arms. \u201cNo, papa,\u201d said the child; but her short, hard breathing alarmed her father. \u201cHow could you ride so fast, dear?--you know it\u2019s bad for you.\u201d \u201cI felt so well, papa, and liked it so much, I forgot.\u201d St. Clare carried her in his arms into the parlor, and laid her on the sofa. \u201cHenrique, you must be careful of Eva,\u201d said he; \u201cyou mustn\u2019t ride fast with her.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll take her under my care,\u201d said Henrique, seating himself by the sofa, and taking Eva\u2019s hand. Eva soon found herself much better. Her father and uncle resumed their game, and the children were left together. \u201cDo you know, Eva, I\u2019m sorry papa is only going to stay two days here, and then I shan\u2019t see you again for ever so long! If I stay with you, I\u2019d try to be good, and not be cross to Dodo, and so on. I don\u2019t mean to treat Dodo ill; but, you know, I\u2019ve got such a quick temper. I\u2019m not really bad to him, though. I give him a picayune, now and then; and you see he dresses well. I think, on the whole, Dodo \u2019s pretty well off.\u201d \u201cWould you think you were well off, if there were not one creature in the world near you to love you?\u201d \u201cI?--Well, of course not.\u201d \u201cAnd you have taken Dodo away from all the friends he ever had, and now he has not a creature to love him;--nobody can be good that way.\u201d \u201cWell, I can\u2019t help it, as I know of.", " They used to saunter, arm in arm, up and down the alleys and walks of the garden. Augustine, with his blue eyes and golden hair, his ethereally flexible form and vivacious features; and Alfred, dark-eyed, with haughty Roman profile, firmly-knit limbs, and decided bearing. They were always abusing each other\u2019s opinions and practices, and yet never a whit the less absorbed in each other\u2019s society; in fact, the very contrariety seemed to unite them, like the attraction between opposite poles of the magnet. Henrique, the eldest son of Alfred, was a noble, dark-eyed, princely boy, full of vivacity and spirit; and, from the first moment of introduction, seemed to be perfectly fascinated by the spirituelle graces of his cousin Evangeline. Eva had a little pet pony, of a snowy whiteness. It was easy as a cradle, and as gentle as its little mistress; and this pony was now brought up to the back verandah by Tom, while a little mulatto boy of about thirteen led along a small black Arabian, which had just been imported, at a great expense, for Henrique. Henrique had a boy\u2019s pride in his new possession; and, as he advanced and took the reins out of the hands of his little groom, he looked carefully over him, and his brow darkened. \u201cWhat\u2019s this, Dodo, you little lazy dog! you haven\u2019t rubbed my horse down, this morning.\u201d \u201cYes, Mas\u2019r,\u201d said Dodo, submissively; \u201che got that dust on his own self.\u201d \u201cYou rascal, shut your mouth!\u201d said Henrique, violently raising his riding-whip."], "What does Eva tell Tom she would do for the slaves of the South if it would alleviate their suffering?": [" \u201cThere\u2019s a \u2019sea of glass, mingled with fire.\u2019\u201d \u201cTrue enough, Miss Eva,\u201d said Tom; and Tom sang-- \u201cO, had I the wings of the morning, I\u2019d fly away to Canaan\u2019s shore; Bright angels should convey me home, To the new Jerusalem.\u201d \u201cWhere do you suppose new Jerusalem is, Uncle Tom?\u201d said Eva. \u201cO, up in the clouds, Miss Eva.\u201d \u201cThen I think I see it,\u201d said Eva. \u201cLook in those clouds!--they look like great gates of pearl; and you can see beyond them--far, far off--it\u2019s all gold. Tom, sing about \u2019spirits bright.\u2019\u201d Tom sung the words of a well-known Methodist hymn, \u201cI see a band of spirits bright, That taste the glories there; They all are robed in spotless white, And conquering palms they bear.\u201d \u201cUncle Tom, I\u2019ve seen _them_,\u201d said Eva. Tom had no doubt of it at all; it did not surprise him in the least. If Eva had told him she had been to heaven, he would have thought it entirely probable. \u201cThey come to me sometimes in my sleep, those spirits;\u201d and Eva\u2019s eyes grew dreamy, and she hummed, in a low voice, \u201cThey are all robed in spotless white, And conquering palms they bear.\u201d \u201cUncle Tom,\u201d said Eva, \u201cI\u2019m going there.\u201d \u201cWhere, Miss Eva?\u201d The child rose, and pointed her little hand to the sky; the glow of evening lit her golden hair and flushed cheek with a kind of unearthly radiance, and her eyes were bent earnestly on the skies. \u201cI\u2019m going _there_,\u201d she said, \u201cto the spirits bright, Tom; _I\u2019m going, before long_.\u201d The faithful old heart felt a sudden thrust; and Tom thought how often he had noticed, within six months, that Eva\u2019s little hands had grown thinner, and her skin more transparent, and her breath shorter; and how, when she ran or played in the garden, as she once could for hours, she became soon so tired and languid.", " And say, mothers of America, is this a thing to be defended, sympathized with, passed over in silence? Do you say that the people of the free state have nothing to do with it, and can do nothing? Would to God this were true! But it is not true. The people of the free states have defended, encouraged, and participated; and are more guilty for it, before God, than the South, in that they have not the apology of education or custom. If the mothers of the free states had all felt as they should, in times past, the sons of the free states would not have been the holders, and, proverbially, the hardest masters of slaves; the sons of the free states would not have connived at the extension of slavery, in our national body; the sons of the free states would not, as they do, trade the souls and bodies of men as an equivalent to money, in their mercantile dealings. There are multitudes of slaves temporarily owned, and sold again, by merchants in northern cities; and shall the whole guilt or obloquy of slavery fall only on the South? Northern men, northern mothers, northern Christians, have something more to do than denounce their brethren at the South; they have to look to the evil among themselves. But, what can any individual do? Of that, every individual can judge. There is one thing that every individual can do,--they can see to it that _they feel right_. An atmosphere of sympathetic influence encircles every human being; and the man or woman who _feels_ strongly, healthily and justly, on the great interests of humanity, is a constant benefactor to the human race.", " Tom and Eva both started. \u201cWhat\u2019s here?\u201d said St. Clare, coming up and looking at the slate. \u201cO, it\u2019s Tom\u2019s letter. I\u2019m helping him to write it,\u201d said Eva; \u201cisn\u2019t it nice?\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t discourage either of you,\u201d said St. Clare, \u201cbut I rather think, Tom, you\u2019d better get me to write your letter for you. I\u2019ll do it, when I come home from my ride.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very important he should write,\u201d said Eva, \u201cbecause his mistress is going to send down money to redeem him, you know, papa; he told me they told him so.\u201d St. Clare thought, in his heart, that this was probably only one of those things which good-natured owners say to their servants, to alleviate their horror of being sold, without any intention of fulfilling the expectation thus excited. But he did not make any audible comment upon it,--only ordered Tom to get the horses out for a ride. Tom\u2019s letter was written in due form for him that evening, and safely lodged in the post-office. Miss Ophelia still persevered in her labors in the housekeeping line. It was universally agreed, among all the household, from Dinah down to the youngest urchin, that Miss Ophelia was decidedly \u201ccuris,\u201d--a term by which a southern servant implies that his or her betters don\u2019t exactly suit them. The higher circle in the family--to wit, Adolph, Jane and Rosa--agreed that she was no lady; ladies never keep working about as she did,--that she had no _air_ at all; and they were surprised that she should be any relation of the St. Clares.", " But he was no man,\u201d he added, suddenly. \u201cNo man ever had such long and living power!

I wish Mas\u2019r\u2019d be so good as read it. Don\u2019t get no readin\u2019, hardly, now Miss Eva\u2019s gone.\u201d The chapter was the eleventh of John,--the touching account of the raising of Lazarus, St. Clare read it aloud, often pausing to wrestle down feelings which were roused by the pathos of the story. Tom knelt before him, with clasped hands, and with an absorbed expression of love, trust, adoration, on his quiet face. \u201cTom,\u201d said his Master, \u201cthis is all _real_ to you!\u201d \u201cI can jest fairly _see_ it Mas\u2019r,\u201d said Tom. \u201cI wish I had your eyes, Tom.\u201d \u201cI wish, to the dear Lord, Mas\u2019r had!\u201d \u201cBut, Tom, you know that I have a great deal more knowledge than you; what if I should tell you that I don\u2019t believe this Bible?\u201d \u201cO, Mas\u2019r!\u201d said Tom, holding up his hands, with a deprecating gesture. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it shake your faith some, Tom?\u201d \u201cNot a grain,\u201d said Tom. \u201cWhy, Tom, you must know I know the most.\u201d \u201cO, Mas\u2019r, haven\u2019t you jest read how he hides from the wise and prudent, and reveals unto babes?

It\u2019s a troublesome bad habit I\u2019ve got, Tom.\u201d \u201cIf Mas\u2019r would only pray!\u201d \u201cHow do you know I don\u2019t, Tom?\u201d \u201cDoes Mas\u2019r?\u201d \u201cI would, Tom, if there was anybody there when I pray; but it\u2019s all speaking unto nothing, when I do."], "What is Eva willing to do to Topsy that Ophelia is not, making apparent Ophelia's secret prejudice?": [" In a moment, laying his finger on his lips, he made a silent gesture to Miss Ophelia to come and look. There sat the two children on the floor, with their side faces towards them. Topsy, with her usual air of careless drollery and unconcern; but, opposite to her, Eva, her whole face fervent with feeling, and tears in her large eyes. \u201cWhat does make you so bad, Topsy? Why won\u2019t you try and be good? Don\u2019t you love _anybody_, Topsy?\u201d \u201cDonno nothing \u2019bout love; I loves candy and sich, that\u2019s all,\u201d said Topsy. \u201cBut you love your father and mother?\u201d \u201cNever had none, ye know. I telled ye that, Miss Eva.\u201d \u201cO, I know,\u201d said Eva, sadly; \u201cbut hadn\u2019t you any brother, or sister, or aunt, or--\u201d \u201cNo, none on \u2019em,--never had nothing nor nobody.\u201d \u201cBut, Topsy, if you\u2019d only try to be good, you might--\u201d \u201cCouldn\u2019t never be nothin\u2019 but a nigger, if I was ever so good,\u201d said Topsy. \u201cIf I could be skinned, and come white, I\u2019d try then.\u201d \u201cBut people can love you, if you are black, Topsy. Miss Ophelia would love you, if you were good.\u201d Topsy gave the short, blunt laugh that was her common mode of expressing incredulity. \u201cDon\u2019t you think so?\u201d said Eva. \u201cNo; she can\u2019t bar me, \u2019cause I\u2019m a nigger!--she\u2019d \u2019s soon have a toad touch her! There can\u2019t nobody love niggers, and niggers can\u2019t do nothin\u2019! _I_ don\u2019t care,\u201d said Topsy, beginning to whistle. \u201cO, Topsy, poor child, _I_ love you!\u201d said Eva, with a sudden burst of feeling, and laying her little thin, white hand on Topsy\u2019s shoulder; \u201cI love you, because you haven\u2019t had any father, or mother, or friends;--because you\u2019ve been a poor, abused child!", " I love you, and I want you to be good. I am very unwell, Topsy, and I think I shan\u2019t live a great while; and it really grieves me, to have you be so naughty. I wish you would try to be good, for my sake;--it\u2019s only a little while I shall be with you.\u201d The round, keen eyes of the black child were overcast with tears;--large, bright drops rolled heavily down, one by one, and fell on the little white hand. Yes, in that moment, a ray of real belief, a ray of heavenly love, had penetrated the darkness of her heathen soul! She laid her head down between her knees, and wept and sobbed,--while the beautiful child, bending over her, looked like the picture of some bright angel stooping to reclaim a sinner. \u201cPoor Topsy!\u201d said Eva, \u201cdon\u2019t you know that Jesus loves all alike? He is just as willing to love you, as me. He loves you just as I do,--only more, because he is better. He will help you to be good; and you can go to Heaven at last, and be an angel forever, just as much as if you were white. Only think of it, Topsy!--_you_ can be one of those spirits bright, Uncle Tom sings about.\u201d \u201cO, dear Miss Eva, dear Miss Eva!\u201d said the child; \u201cI will try, I will try; I never did care nothin\u2019 about it before.\u201d St. Clare, at this instant, dropped the curtain. \u201cIt puts me in mind of mother,\u201d he said to Miss Ophelia. \u201cIt is true what she told me; if we want to give sight to the blind, we must be willing to do as Christ did,--call them to us, and _put our hands on them_.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve always had a prejudice against negroes,\u201d said Miss Ophelia, \u201cand it\u2019s a fact, I never could bear to have that child touch me; but, I don\u2019t think she knew it.\u201d \u201cTrust any child to find that out,\u201d said St. Clare; \u201cthere\u2019s no keeping it from them.", " \u201c\u2018Pears like it\u2019s just taking everything off the place to oncet!\u201d and Mammy gave way to a passion of grief. Miss Ophelia pushed her and Tom gently from the apartment, and thought they were all gone; but, as she turned, Topsy was standing there. \u201cWhere did you start up from?\u201d she said, suddenly. \u201cI was here,\u201d said Topsy, wiping the tears from her eyes. \u201cO, Miss Eva, I\u2019ve been a bad girl; but won\u2019t you give _me_ one, too?\u201d \u201cYes, poor Topsy! to be sure, I will. There--every time you look at that, think that I love you, and wanted you to be a good girl!\u201d \u201cO, Miss Eva, I _is_ tryin!\u201d said Topsy, earnestly; \u201cbut, Lor, it\u2019s so hard to be good! \u2019Pears like I an\u2019t used to it, no ways!\u201d \u201cJesus knows it, Topsy; he is sorry for you; he will help you.\u201d Topsy, with her eyes hid in her apron, was silently passed from the apartment by Miss Ophelia; but, as she went, she hid the precious curl in her bosom. All being gone, Miss Ophelia shut the door. That worthy lady had wiped away many tears of her own, during the scene; but concern for the consequence of such an excitement to her young charge was uppermost in her mind. St. Clare had been sitting, during the whole time, with his hand shading his eyes, in the same attitude. When they were all gone, he sat so still. \u201cPapa!\u201d said Eva, gently, laying her hand on his. He gave a sudden start and shiver; but made no answer. \u201cDear papa!\u201d said Eva. \u201c_I cannot_,\u201d said St. Clare, rising, \u201cI _cannot_ have it so!", " Did any of our readers ever do the same, they will appreciate the amount of her self-sacrifice. Miss Ophelia began with Topsy by taking her into her chamber, the first morning, and solemnly commencing a course of instruction in the art and mystery of bed-making. Behold, then, Topsy, washed and shorn of all the little braided tails wherein her heart had delighted, arrayed in a clean gown, with well-starched apron, standing reverently before Miss Ophelia, with an expression of solemnity well befitting a funeral. \u201cNow, Topsy, I\u2019m going to show you just how my bed is to be made. I am very particular about my bed. You must learn exactly how to do it.\u201d \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d says Topsy, with a deep sigh, and a face of woful earnestness. \u201cNow, Topsy, look here;--this is the hem of the sheet,--this is the right side of the sheet, and this is the wrong;--will you remember?\u201d \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d says Topsy, with another sigh. \u201cWell, now, the under sheet you must bring over the bolster,--so--and tuck it clear down under the mattress nice and smooth,--so,--do you see?\u201d \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Topsy, with profound attention. \u201cBut the upper sheet,\u201d said Miss Ophelia, \u201cmust be brought down in this way, and tucked under firm and smooth at the foot,--so,--the narrow hem at the foot.\u201d \u201cYes, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Topsy, as before;--but we will add, what Miss Ophelia did not see, that, during the time when the good lady\u2019s back was turned in the zeal of her manipulations, the young disciple had contrived to snatch a pair of gloves and a ribbon, which she had adroitly slipped into her sleeves, and stood with her hands dutifully folded, as before."], "What does Eva reply when, in her dying moments, her father asks her what she sees?": [" \u201cShe\u2019s got the Lord\u2019s mark in her forehead.\u201d \u201cAh, yes, yes,\u201d said Mammy, raising her hands; \u201cI\u2019ve allers said so. She wasn\u2019t never like a child that\u2019s to live--there was allers something deep in her eyes. I\u2019ve told Missis so, many the time; it\u2019s a comin\u2019 true,--we all sees it,--dear, little, blessed lamb!\u201d Eva came tripping up the verandah steps to her father. It was late in the afternoon, and the rays of the sun formed a kind of glory behind her, as she came forward in her white dress, with her golden hair and glowing cheeks, her eyes unnaturally bright with the slow fever that burned in her veins. St. Clare had called her to show a statuette that he had been buying for her; but her appearance, as she came on, impressed him suddenly and painfully. There is a kind of beauty so intense, yet so fragile, that we cannot bear to look at it. Her father folded her suddenly in his arms, and almost forgot what he was going to tell her. \u201cEva, dear, you are better now-a-days,--are you not?\u201d \u201cPapa,\u201d said Eva, with sudden firmness \u201cI\u2019ve had things I wanted to say to you, a great while. I want to say them now, before I get weaker.\u201d St. Clare trembled as Eva seated herself in his lap. She laid her head on his bosom, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s all no use, papa, to keep it to myself any longer. The time is coming that I am going to leave you. I am going, and never to come back!\u201d and Eva sobbed. \u201cO, now, my dear little Eva!\u201d said St. Clare, trembling as he spoke, but speaking cheerfully, \u201cyou\u2019ve got nervous and low-spirited; you mustn\u2019t indulge such gloomy thoughts.", " It isn\u2019t so very tiresome after all.\u201d \u201cYou sweet, little obliging soul!\u201d said St. Clare, kissing her; \u201cgo along, that\u2019s a good girl, and pray for me.\u201d \u201cCertainly, I always do,\u201d said the child, as she sprang after her mother into the carriage. St. Clare stood on the steps and kissed his hand to her, as the carriage drove away; large tears were in his eyes. \u201cO, Evangeline! rightly named,\u201d he said; \u201chath not God made thee an evangel to me?\u201d So he felt a moment; and then he smoked a cigar, and read the Picayune, and forgot his little gospel. Was he much unlike other folks? \u201cYou see, Evangeline,\u201d said her mother, \u201cit\u2019s always right and proper to be kind to servants, but it isn\u2019t proper to treat them _just_ as we would our relations, or people in our own class of life. Now, if Mammy was sick, you wouldn\u2019t want to put her in your own bed.\u201d \u201cI should feel just like it, mamma,\u201d said Eva, \u201cbecause then it would be handier to take care of her, and because, you know, my bed is better than hers.\u201d Marie was in utter despair at the entire want of moral perception evinced in this reply. \u201cWhat can I do to make this child understand me?\u201d she said. \u201cNothing,\u201d said Miss Ophelia, significantly. Eva looked sorry and disconcerted for a moment; but children, luckily, do not keep to one impression long, and in a few moments she was merrily laughing at various things which she saw from the coach-windows, as it rattled along.", " I can\u2019t get his mother and I can\u2019t love him myself, nor anybody else, as I know of.\u201d \u201cWhy can\u2019t you?\u201d said Eva. \u201c_Love_ Dodo! Why, Eva, you wouldn\u2019t have me! I may _like_ him well enough; but you don\u2019t _love_ your servants.\u201d \u201cI do, indeed.\u201d \u201cHow odd!\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t the Bible say we must love everybody?\u201d \u201cO, the Bible! To be sure, it says a great many such things; but, then, nobody ever thinks of doing them,--you know, Eva, nobody does.\u201d Eva did not speak; her eyes were fixed and thoughtful for a few moments. \u201cAt any rate,\u201d she said, \u201cdear Cousin, do love poor Dodo, and be kind to him, for my sake!\u201d \u201cI could love anything, for your sake, dear Cousin; for I really think you are the loveliest creature that I ever saw!\u201d And Henrique spoke with an earnestness that flushed his handsome face. Eva received it with perfect simplicity, without even a change of feature; merely saying, \u201cI\u2019m glad you feel so, dear Henrique! I hope you will remember.\u201d The dinner-bell put an end to the interview. CHAPTER XXIV Foreshadowings Two days after this, Alfred St. Clare and Augustine parted; and Eva, who had been stimulated, by the society of her young cousin, to exertions beyond her strength, began to fail rapidly. St. Clare was at last willing to call in medical advice,--a thing from which he had always shrunk, because it was the admission of an unwelcome truth. But, for a day or two, Eva was so unwell as to be confined to the house; and the doctor was called.", " \u201cGo for the doctor, Tom! lose not a moment,\u201d said Miss Ophelia; and, stepping across the room, she rapped at St. Clare\u2019s door. \u201cCousin,\u201d she said, \u201cI wish you would come.\u201d Those words fell on his heart like clods upon a coffin. Why did they? He was up and in the room in an instant, and bending over Eva, who still slept. What was it he saw that made his heart stand still? Why was no word spoken between the two? Thou canst say, who hast seen that same expression on the face dearest to thee;--that look indescribable, hopeless, unmistakable, that says to thee that thy beloved is no longer thine. On the face of the child, however, there was no ghastly imprint,--only a high and almost sublime expression,--the overshadowing presence of spiritual natures, the dawning of immortal life in that childish soul. They stood there so still, gazing upon her, that even the ticking of the watch seemed too loud. In a few moments, Tom returned, with the doctor. He entered, gave one look, and stood silent as the rest. \u201cWhen did this change take place?\u201d said he, in a low whisper, to Miss Ophelia. \u201cAbout the turn of the night,\u201d was the reply. Marie, roused by the entrance of the doctor, appeared, hurriedly, from the next room. \u201cAugustine! Cousin!--O!--what!\u201d she hurriedly began. \u201cHush!\u201d said St. Clare, hoarsely; _\u201cshe is dying!\u201d_ Mammy heard the words, and flew to awaken the servants. The house was soon roused,--lights were seen, footsteps heard, anxious faces thronged the verandah, and looked tearfully through the glass doors; but St. Clare heard and said nothing,--he saw only _that look_ on the face of the little sleeper."], "After Eva's funeral, what does Tom do when Augustine tells him that he is unable to pray?": [" But he was no man,\u201d he added, suddenly. \u201cNo man ever had such long and living power! O, that I could believe what my mother taught me, and pray as I did when I was a boy!\u201d \u201cIf Mas\u2019r pleases,\u201d said Tom, \u201cMiss Eva used to read this so beautifully. I wish Mas\u2019r\u2019d be so good as read it. Don\u2019t get no readin\u2019, hardly, now Miss Eva\u2019s gone.\u201d The chapter was the eleventh of John,--the touching account of the raising of Lazarus, St. Clare read it aloud, often pausing to wrestle down feelings which were roused by the pathos of the story. Tom knelt before him, with clasped hands, and with an absorbed expression of love, trust, adoration, on his quiet face. \u201cTom,\u201d said his Master, \u201cthis is all _real_ to you!\u201d \u201cI can jest fairly _see_ it Mas\u2019r,\u201d said Tom. \u201cI wish I had your eyes, Tom.\u201d \u201cI wish, to the dear Lord, Mas\u2019r had!\u201d \u201cBut, Tom, you know that I have a great deal more knowledge than you; what if I should tell you that I don\u2019t believe this Bible?\u201d \u201cO, Mas\u2019r!\u201d said Tom, holding up his hands, with a deprecating gesture. \u201cWouldn\u2019t it shake your faith some, Tom?\u201d \u201cNot a grain,\u201d said Tom. \u201cWhy, Tom, you must know I know the most.\u201d \u201cO, Mas\u2019r, haven\u2019t you jest read how he hides from the wise and prudent, and reveals unto babes? But Mas\u2019r wasn\u2019t in earnest, for sartin, now?\u201d said Tom, anxiously. \u201cNo, Tom, I was not. I don\u2019t disbelieve, and I think there is reason to believe; and still I don\u2019t. It\u2019s a troublesome bad habit I\u2019ve got, Tom.\u201d \u201cIf Mas\u2019r would only pray!\u201d \u201cHow do you know I don\u2019t, Tom?\u201d \u201cDoes Mas\u2019r?\u201d \u201cI would, Tom, if there was anybody there when I pray; but it\u2019s all speaking unto nothing, when I do.", " \u201cThere\u2019s a \u2019sea of glass, mingled with fire.\u2019\u201d \u201cTrue enough, Miss Eva,\u201d said Tom; and Tom sang-- \u201cO, had I the wings of the morning, I\u2019d fly away to Canaan\u2019s shore; Bright angels should convey me home, To the new Jerusalem.\u201d \u201cWhere do you suppose new Jerusalem is, Uncle Tom?\u201d said Eva. \u201cO, up in the clouds, Miss Eva.\u201d \u201cThen I think I see it,\u201d said Eva. \u201cLook in those clouds!--they look like great gates of pearl; and you can see beyond them--far, far off--it\u2019s all gold. Tom, sing about \u2019spirits bright.\u2019\u201d Tom sung the words of a well-known Methodist hymn, \u201cI see a band of spirits bright, That taste the glories there; They all are robed in spotless white, And conquering palms they bear.\u201d \u201cUncle Tom, I\u2019ve seen _them_,\u201d said Eva. Tom had no doubt of it at all; it did not surprise him in the least. If Eva had told him she had been to heaven, he would have thought it entirely probable. \u201cThey come to me sometimes in my sleep, those spirits;\u201d and Eva\u2019s eyes grew dreamy, and she hummed, in a low voice, \u201cThey are all robed in spotless white, And conquering palms they bear.\u201d \u201cUncle Tom,\u201d said Eva, \u201cI\u2019m going there.\u201d \u201cWhere, Miss Eva?\u201d The child rose, and pointed her little hand to the sky; the glow of evening lit her golden hair and flushed cheek with a kind of unearthly radiance, and her eyes were bent earnestly on the skies. \u201cI\u2019m going _there_,\u201d she said, \u201cto the spirits bright, Tom; _I\u2019m going, before long_.\u201d The faithful old heart felt a sudden thrust; and Tom thought how often he had noticed, within six months, that Eva\u2019s little hands had grown thinner, and her skin more transparent, and her breath shorter; and how, when she ran or played in the garden, as she once could for hours, she became soon so tired and languid.", " And this, oh Africa! latest called of nations,--called to the crown of thorns, the scourge, the bloody sweat, the cross of agony,--this is to be _thy_ victory; by this shalt thou reign with Christ when his kingdom shall come on earth. The deep fervor of Tom\u2019s feelings, the softness of his voice, his tears, fell like dew on the wild, unsettled spirit of the poor woman. A softness gathered over the lurid fires of her eye; she looked down, and Tom could feel the relaxing muscles of her hands, as she said, \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you that evil spirits followed me? O! Father Tom, I can\u2019t pray,--I wish I could. I never have prayed since my children were sold! What you say must be right, I know it must; but when I try to pray, I can only hate and curse. I can\u2019t pray!\u201d \u201cPoor soul!\u201d said Tom, compassionately. \u201cSatan desires to have ye, and sift ye as wheat. I pray the Lord for ye. O! Misse Cassy, turn to the dear Lord Jesus. He came to bind up the broken-hearted, and comfort all that mourn.\u201d Cassy stood silent, while large, heavy tears dropped from her downcast eyes. \u201cMisse Cassy,\u201d said Tom, in a hesitating tone, after surveying her in silence, \u201cif ye only could get away from here,--if the thing was possible,--I\u2019d \u2019vise ye and Emmeline to do it; that is, if ye could go without blood-guiltiness,--not otherwise.\u201d \u201cWould you try it with us, Father Tom?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Tom; \u201ctime was when I would; but the Lord\u2019s given me a work among these yer poor souls, and I\u2019ll stay with \u2019em and bear my cross with \u2019em till the end.", " What\u2019s your name? Tom? Quite as likely to do it for your asking as mine, from all accounts. Can you drive horses, Tom?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been allays used to horses,\u201d said Tom. \u201cMas\u2019r Shelby raised heaps of \u2019em.\u201d \u201cWell, I think I shall put you in coachy, on condition that you won\u2019t be drunk more than once a week, unless in cases of emergency, Tom.\u201d Tom looked surprised, and rather hurt, and said, \u201cI never drink, Mas\u2019r.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve heard that story before, Tom; but then we\u2019ll see. It will be a special accommodation to all concerned, if you don\u2019t. Never mind, my boy,\u201d he added, good-humoredly, seeing Tom still looked grave; \u201cI don\u2019t doubt you mean to do well.\u201d \u201cI sartin do, Mas\u2019r,\u201d said Tom. \u201cAnd you shall have good times,\u201d said Eva. \u201cPapa is very good to everybody, only he always will laugh at them.\u201d \u201cPapa is much obliged to you for his recommendation,\u201d said St. Clare, laughing, as he turned on his heel and walked away. CHAPTER XV Of Tom\u2019s New Master, and Various Other Matters Since the thread of our humble hero\u2019s life has now become interwoven with that of higher ones, it is necessary to give some brief introduction to them. Augustine St. Clare was the son of a wealthy planter of Louisiana. The family had its origin in Canada. Of two brothers, very similar in temperament and character, one had settled on a flourishing farm in Vermont, and the other became an opulent planter in Louisiana. The mother of Augustine was a Huguenot French lady, whose family had emigrated to Louisiana during the days of its early settlement."], "What are Augustine's joyful last words?": [" The \u201cEmperor\u201d Dessalines, come to power in 1804, massacred all the whites on the island. Haitian bloodshed became an argument to show the barbarous nature of the Negro, a doctrine Wendell Phillips sought to combat in his celebrated lecture on Toussaint L\u2019Ouverture. \u201cWell, there is a pretty fair infusion of Anglo Saxon blood among our slaves, now,\u201d said Augustine. \u201cThere are plenty among them who have only enough of the African to give a sort of tropical warmth and fervor to our calculating firmness and foresight. If ever the San Domingo hour comes, Anglo Saxon blood will lead on the day. Sons of white fathers, with all our haughty feelings burning in their veins, will not always be bought and sold and traded. They will rise, and raise with them their mother\u2019s race.\u201d \u201cStuff!--nonsense!\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Augustine, \u201cthere goes an old saying to this effect, \u2019As it was in the days of Noah so shall it be;--they ate, they drank, they planted, they builded, and knew not till the flood came and took them.\u2019\u201d \u201cOn the whole, Augustine, I think your talents might do for a circuit rider,\u201d said Alfred, laughing. \u201cNever you fear for us; possession is our nine points. We\u2019ve got the power. This subject race,\u201d said he, stamping firmly, \u201cis down and shall _stay_ down! We have energy enough to manage our own powder.\u201d \u201cSons trained like your Henrique will be grand guardians of your powder-magazines,\u201d said Augustine,--\u201cso cool and self-possessed!", " I\u2019m not afraid to sit on the escape-valve, as long as the boilers are strong, and the machinery works well.\u201d \u201cThe nobles in Louis XVI.\u2019s time thought just so; and Austria and Pius IX. think so now; and, some pleasant morning, you may all be caught up to meet each other in the air, _when the boilers burst_.\u201d \u201c_Dies declarabit_,\u201d said Alfred, laughing. \u201cI tell you,\u201d said Augustine, \u201cif there is anything that is revealed with the strength of a divine law in our times, it is that the masses are to rise, and the under class become the upper one.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s one of your red republican humbugs, Augustine! Why didn\u2019t you ever take to the stump;--you\u2019d make a famous stump orator! Well, I hope I shall be dead before this millennium of your greasy masses comes on.\u201d \u201cGreasy or not greasy, they will govern _you_, when their time comes,\u201d said Augustine; \u201cand they will be just such rulers as you make them. The French noblesse chose to have the people \u2018_sans culottes_,\u2019 and they had \u2018_sans culotte_\u2019 governors to their hearts\u2019 content. The people of Hayti--\u201d \u201cO, come, Augustine! as if we hadn\u2019t had enough of that abominable, contemptible Hayti! * The Haytiens were not Anglo Saxons; if they had been there would have been another story. The Anglo Saxon is the dominant race of the world, and _is to be so_.\u201d * In August 1791, as a consequence of the French Revolution, the black slaves and mulattoes on Haiti rose in revolt against the whites, and in the period of turmoil that followed enormous cruelties were practised by both sides.", " But, how in the world can Miss Ophelia get along with Augustine St. Clare,--gay, easy, unpunctual, unpractical, sceptical,--in short,--walking with impudent and nonchalant freedom over every one of her most cherished habits and opinions? To tell the truth, then, Miss Ophelia loved him. When a boy, it had been hers to teach him his catechism, mend his clothes, comb his hair, and bring him up generally in the way he should go; and her heart having a warm side to it, Augustine had, as he usually did with most people, monopolized a large share of it for himself, and therefore it was that he succeeded very easily in persuading her that the \u201cpath of duty\u201d lay in the direction of New Orleans, and that she must go with him to take care of Eva, and keep everything from going to wreck and ruin during the frequent illnesses of his wife. The idea of a house without anybody to take care of it went to her heart; then she loved the lovely little girl, as few could help doing; and though she regarded Augustine as very much of a heathen, yet she loved him, laughed at his jokes, and forbore with his failings, to an extent which those who knew him thought perfectly incredible. But what more or other is to be known of Miss Ophelia our reader must discover by a personal acquaintance. There she is, sitting now in her state-room, surrounded by a mixed multitude of little and big carpet-bags, boxes, baskets, each containing some separate responsibility which she is tying, binding up, packing, or fastening, with a face of great earnestness.", " The proverb says, \u2019They that cannot govern themselves cannot govern others.\u2019\u201d \u201cThere is a trouble there\u201d said Alfred, thoughtfully; \u201cthere\u2019s no doubt that our system is a difficult one to train children under. It gives too free scope to the passions, altogether, which, in our climate, are hot enough. I find trouble with Henrique. The boy is generous and warm-hearted, but a perfect fire-cracker when excited. I believe I shall send him North for his education, where obedience is more fashionable, and where he will associate more with equals, and less with dependents.\u201d \u201cSince training children is the staple work of the human race,\u201d said Augustine, \u201cI should think it something of a consideration that our system does not work well there.\u201d \u201cIt does not for some things,\u201d said Alfred; \u201cfor others, again, it does. It makes boys manly and courageous; and the very vices of an abject race tend to strengthen in them the opposite virtues. I think Henrique, now, has a keener sense of the beauty of truth, from seeing lying and deception the universal badge of slavery.\u201d \u201cA Christian-like view of the subject, certainly!\u201d said Augustine. \u201cIt\u2019s true, Christian-like or not; and is about as Christian-like as most other things in the world,\u201d said Alfred. \u201cThat may be,\u201d said St. Clare. \u201cWell, there\u2019s no use in talking, Augustine. I believe we\u2019ve been round and round this old track five hundred times, more or less."], "What promise did Augustine's sudden death prevent him from fulfilling?": [" When Augustine, pale as death, was found lying on the sofa, and pleaded sudden sick-headache as the cause of his distress, she recommended to him to smell of hartshorn; and when the paleness and headache came on week after week, she only said that she never thought Mr. St. Clare was sickly; but it seems he was very liable to sick-headaches, and that it was a very unfortunate thing for her, because he didn\u2019t enjoy going into company with her, and it seemed odd to go so much alone, when they were just married. Augustine was glad in his heart that he had married so undiscerning a woman; but as the glosses and civilities of the honeymoon wore away, he discovered that a beautiful young woman, who has lived all her life to be caressed and waited on, might prove quite a hard mistress in domestic life. Marie never had possessed much capability of affection, or much sensibility, and the little that she had, had been merged into a most intense and unconscious selfishness; a selfishness the more hopeless, from its quiet obtuseness, its utter ignorance of any claims but her own. From her infancy, she had been surrounded with servants, who lived only to study her caprices; the idea that they had either feelings or rights had never dawned upon her, even in distant perspective. Her father, whose only child she had been, had never denied her anything that lay within the compass of human possibility; and when she entered life, beautiful, accomplished, and an heiress, she had, of course, all the eligibles and non-eligibles of the other sex sighing at her feet, and she had no doubt that Augustine was a most fortunate man in having obtained her.", " \u201cAugustine,\u201d she said, suddenly, as she sat knitting, \u201chave you ever made any provision for your servants, in case of your death?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said St. Clare, as he read on. \u201cThen all your indulgence to them may prove a great cruelty, by and by.\u201d St. Clare had often thought the same thing himself; but he answered, negligently. \u201cWell, I mean to make a provision, by and by.\u201d \u201cWhen?\u201d said Miss Ophelia. \u201cO, one of these days.\u201d \u201cWhat if you should die first?\u201d \u201cCousin, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d said St. Clare, laying down his paper and looking at her. \u201cDo you think I show symptoms of yellow fever or cholera, that you are making post mortem arrangements with such zeal?\u201d \u201c\u2018In the midst of life we are in death,\u2019\u201d said Miss Ophelia. St. Clare rose up, and laying the paper down, carelessly, walked to the door that stood open on the verandah, to put an end to a conversation that was not agreeable to him. Mechanically, he repeated the last word again,--_\u201cDeath!\u201d_--and, as he leaned against the railings, and watched the sparkling water as it rose and fell in the fountain; and, as in a dim and dizzy haze, saw flowers and trees and vases of the courts, he repeated, again the mystic word so common in every mouth, yet of such fearful power,--\u201cDEATH!\u201d \u201cStrange that there should be such a word,\u201d he said, \u201cand such a thing, and we ever forget it; that one should be living, warm and beautiful, full of hopes, desires and wants, one day, and the next be gone, utterly gone, and forever!\u201d It was a warm, golden evening; and, as he walked to the other end of the verandah, he saw Tom busily intent on his Bible, pointing, as he did so, with his finger to each successive word, and whispering them to himself with an earnest air.", " The \u201cEmperor\u201d Dessalines, come to power in 1804, massacred all the whites on the island.

Both are weeping, but each quietly, that the other may not hear. \u201cMother, just lay your head on my lap, and see if you can\u2019t sleep a little,\u201d says the girl, trying to appear calm. \u201cI haven\u2019t any heart to sleep, Em; I can\u2019t; it\u2019s the last night we may be together!\u201d \u201cO, mother, don\u2019t say so! perhaps we shall get sold together,--who knows?\u201d \u201cIf \u2019t was anybody\u2019s else case, I should say so, too, Em,\u201d said the woman; \u201cbut I\u2019m so feard of losin\u2019 you that I don\u2019t see anything but the danger.\u201d \u201cWhy, mother, the man said we were both likely, and would sell well.\u201d Susan remembered the man\u2019s looks and words. With a deadly sickness at her heart, she remembered how he had looked at Emmeline\u2019s hands, and lifted up her curly hair, and pronounced her a first-rate article. Susan had been trained as a Christian, brought up in the daily reading of the Bible, and had the same horror of her child\u2019s being sold to a life of shame that any other Christian mother might have; but she had no hope,--no protection. \u201cMother, I think we might do first rate, if you could get a place as cook, and I as chambermaid or seamstress, in some family.", " I dare say we shall. Let\u2019s both look as bright and lively as we can, and tell all we can do, and perhaps we shall,\u201d said Emmeline. \u201cI want you to brush your hair all back straight, tomorrow,\u201d said Susan. \u201cWhat for, mother? I don\u2019t look near so well, that way.\u201d \u201cYes, but you\u2019ll sell better so.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t see why!\u201d said the child. \u201cRespectable families would be more apt to buy you, if they saw you looked plain and decent, as if you wasn\u2019t trying to look handsome. I know their ways better \u2019n you do,\u201d said Susan. \u201cWell, mother, then I will.\u201d \u201cAnd, Emmeline, if we shouldn\u2019t ever see each other again, after tomorrow,--if I\u2019m sold way up on a plantation somewhere, and you somewhere else,--always remember how you\u2019ve been brought up, and all Missis has told you; take your Bible with you, and your hymn-book; and if you\u2019re faithful to the Lord, he\u2019ll be faithful to you.\u201d So speaks the poor soul, in sore discouragement; for she knows that tomorrow any man, however vile and brutal, however godless and merciless, if he only has money to pay for her, may become owner of her daughter, body and soul; and then, how is the child to be faithful? She thinks of all this, as she holds her daughter in her arms, and wishes that she were not handsome and attractive. It seems almost an aggravation to her to remember how purely and piously, how much above the ordinary lot, she has been brought up. But she has no resort but to _pray_; and many such prayers to God have gone up from those same trim, neatly-arranged, respectable slave-prisons,--prayers which God has not forgotten, as a coming day shall show; for it is written, \u201cWho causeth one of these little ones to offend, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depths of the sea.\u201d The soft, earnest, quiet moonbeam looks in fixedly, marking the bars of the grated windows on the prostrate, sleeping forms.", " The establishment was, of a consequence, wholly deserted, when Cassy and Emmeline glided into it the back way. The whooping and shouts of their pursuers were still filling the air; and, looking from the sitting-room windows, Cassy and Emmeline could see the troop, with their flambeaux, just dispersing themselves along the edge of the swamp. \u201cSee there!\u201d said Emmeline, pointing to Cassy; \u201cthe hunt is begun! Look how those lights dance about! Hark! the dogs! Don\u2019t you hear? If we were only _there_, our chances wouldn\u2019t be worth a picayune. O, for pity\u2019s sake, do let\u2019s hide ourselves. Quick!\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no occasion for hurry,\u201d said Cassy, coolly; \u201cthey are all out after the hunt,--that\u2019s the amusement of the evening! We\u2019ll go up stairs, by and by. Meanwhile,\u201d said she, deliberately taking a key from the pocket of a coat that Legree had thrown down in his hurry, \u201cmeanwhile I shall take something to pay our passage.\u201d She unlocked the desk, took from it a roll of bills, which she counted over rapidly. \u201cO, don\u2019t let\u2019s do that!\u201d said Emmeline. \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d said Cassy; \u201cwhy not? Would you have us starve in the swamps, or have that that will pay our way to the free states. Money will do anything, girl.\u201d And, as she spoke, she put the money in her bosom. \u201cIt would be stealing,\u201d said Emmeline, in a distressed whisper. \u201cStealing!\u201d said Cassy, with a scornful laugh. \u201cThey who steal body and soul needn\u2019t talk to us.", " One must have something;--things don\u2019t look so dreadful, when you take that.\u201d \u201cMother used to tell me never to touch any such thing,\u201d said Emmeline. \u201c_Mother_ told you!\u201d said Cassy, with a thrilling and bitter emphasis on the word mother. \u201cWhat use is it for mothers to say anything? You are all to be bought and paid for, and your souls belong to whoever gets you. That\u2019s the way it goes. I say, _drink_ brandy; drink all you can, and it\u2019ll make things come easier.\u201d \u201cO, Cassy! do pity me!\u201d \u201cPity you!--don\u2019t I? Haven\u2019t I a daughter,--Lord knows where she is, and whose she is, now,--going the way her mother went, before her, I suppose, and that her children must go, after her! There\u2019s no end to the curse--forever!\u201d \u201cI wish I\u2019d never been born!\u201d said Emmeline, wringing her hands. \u201cThat\u2019s an old wish with me,\u201d said Cassy. \u201cI\u2019ve got used to wishing that. I\u2019d die, if I dared to,\u201d she said, looking out into the darkness, with that still, fixed despair which was the habitual expression of her face when at rest. \u201cIt would be wicked to kill one\u2019s self,\u201d said Emmeline. \u201cI don\u2019t know why,--no wickeder than things we live and do, day after day. But the sisters told me things, when I was in the convent, that make me afraid to die. If it would only be the end of us, why, then--\u201d Emmeline turned away, and hid her face in her hands. While this conversation was passing in the chamber, Legree, overcome with his carouse, had sunk to sleep in the room below."], "When Simon Legree confiscates Uncle Tom's possessions, what does Tom hide in his pocket?": [" \u201cTake off your boots,\u201d said Mr. Legree. Tom did so. \u201cThere,\u201d said the former, throwing him a pair of coarse, stout shoes, such as were common among the slaves, \u201cput these on.\u201d In Tom\u2019s hurried exchange, he had not forgotten to transfer his cherished Bible to his pocket. It was well he did so; for Mr. Legree, having refitted Tom\u2019s handcuffs, proceeded deliberately to investigate the contents of his pockets. He drew out a silk handkerchief, and put it into his own pocket. Several little trifles, which Tom had treasured, chiefly because they had amused Eva, he looked upon with a contemptuous grunt, and tossed them over his shoulder into the river. Tom\u2019s Methodist hymn-book, which, in his hurry, he had forgotten, he now held up and turned over. Humph! pious, to be sure. So, what\u2019s yer name,--you belong to the church, eh?\u201d \u201cYes, Mas\u2019r,\u201d said Tom, firmly. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll soon have _that_ out of you. I have none o\u2019 yer bawling, praying, singing niggers on my place; so remember. Now, mind yourself,\u201d he said, with a stamp and a fierce glance of his gray eye, directed at Tom, \u201c_I\u2019m_ your church now! You understand,--you\u2019ve got to be as _I_ say.\u201d Something within the silent black man answered _No!_ and, as if repeated by an invisible voice, came the words of an old prophetic scroll, as Eva had often read them to him,--\u201cFear not! for I have redeemed thee. I have called thee by name. Thou art MINE!\u201d But Simon Legree heard no voice.", " The great difference is, that the table and chair cannot feel, and the _man_ can; for even a legal enactment that he shall be \u201ctaken, reputed, adjudged in law, to be a chattel personal,\u201d cannot blot out his soul, with its own private little world of memories, hopes, loves, fears, and desires. Mr. Simon Legree, Tom\u2019s master, had purchased slaves at one place and another, in New Orleans, to the number of eight, and driven them, handcuffed, in couples of two and two, down to the good steamer Pirate, which lay at the levee, ready for a trip up the Red River. Having got them fairly on board, and the boat being off, he came round, with that air of efficiency which ever characterized him, to take a review of them. Stopping opposite to Tom, who had been attired for sale in his best broadcloth suit, with well-starched linen and shining boots, he briefly expressed himself as follows: \u201cStand up.\u201d Tom stood up. \u201cTake off that stock!\u201d and, as Tom, encumbered by his fetters, proceeded to do it, he assisted him, by pulling it, with no gentle hand, from his neck, and putting it in his pocket. Legree now turned to Tom\u2019s trunk, which, previous to this, he had been ransacking, and, taking from it a pair of old pantaloons and dilapidated coat, which Tom had been wont to put on about his stable-work, he said, liberating Tom\u2019s hands from the handcuffs, and pointing to a recess in among the boxes, \u201cYou go there, and put these on.\u201d Tom obeyed, and in a few moments returned.", " And, therefore, without shuddering or trembling, he heard the voice of his persecutor, as he drew near. \u201cWell, my boy,\u201d said Legree, with a contemptuous kick, \u201chow do you find yourself? Didn\u2019t I tell yer I could larn yer a thing or two? How do yer like it--eh? How did yer whaling agree with yer, Tom? An\u2019t quite so crank as ye was last night. Ye couldn\u2019t treat a poor sinner, now, to a bit of sermon, could ye,--eh?\u201d Tom answered nothing. \u201cGet up, you beast!\u201d said Legree, kicking him again. This was a difficult matter for one so bruised and faint; and, as Tom made efforts to do so, Legree laughed brutally. \u201cWhat makes ye so spry, this morning, Tom? Cotched cold, may be, last night.\u201d Tom by this time had gained his feet, and was confronting his master with a steady, unmoved front. \u201cThe devil, you can!\u201d said Legree, looking him over. \u201cI believe you haven\u2019t got enough yet. Now, Tom, get right down on yer knees and beg my pardon, for yer shines last night.\u201d Tom did not move. \u201cDown, you dog!\u201d said Legree, striking him with his riding-whip. \u201cMas\u2019r Legree,\u201d said Tom, \u201cI can\u2019t do it. I did only what I thought was right. I shall do just so again, if ever the time comes. I never will do a cruel thing, come what may.\u201d \u201cYes, but ye don\u2019t know what may come, Master Tom. Ye think what you\u2019ve got is something. I tell you \u2019tan\u2019t anything,--nothing \u2019t all. How would ye like to be tied to a tree, and have a slow fire lit up around ye;--wouldn\u2019t that be pleasant,--eh, Tom?\u201d \u201cMas\u2019r,\u201d said Tom, \u201cI know ye can do dreadful things; but,\u201d--he stretched himself upward and clasped his hands,--\u201cbut, after ye\u2019ve killed the body, there an\u2019t no more ye can do.", " Some dim ideas of imprudence or impropriety in the measure seemed to embarrass him considerably; for he often stopped, as Eliza glided forward, and looked wistfully, first at her and then at the house, and then, as if reassured by reflection, he pattered along after her again. A few minutes brought them to the window of Uncle Tom\u2019s cottage, and Eliza stopping, tapped lightly on the window-pane. The prayer-meeting at Uncle Tom\u2019s had, in the order of hymn-singing, been protracted to a very late hour; and, as Uncle Tom had indulged himself in a few lengthy solos afterwards, the consequence was, that, although it was now between twelve and one o\u2019clock, he and his worthy helpmeet were not yet asleep. \u201cGood Lord! what\u2019s that?\u201d said Aunt Chloe, starting up and hastily drawing the curtain. \u201cMy sakes alive, if it an\u2019t Lizy! Get on your clothes, old man, quick!--there\u2019s old Bruno, too, a pawin round; what on airth! I\u2019m gwine to open the door.\u201d And suiting the action to the word, the door flew open, and the light of the tallow candle, which Tom had hastily lighted, fell on the haggard face and dark, wild eyes of the fugitive. \u201cLord bless you!--I\u2019m skeered to look at ye, Lizy! Are ye tuck sick, or what\u2019s come over ye?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m running away--Uncle Tom and Aunt Chloe--carrying off my child--Master sold him!\u201d \u201cSold him?\u201d echoed both, lifting up their hands in dismay. \u201cYes, sold him!\u201d said Eliza, firmly; \u201cI crept into the closet by Mistress\u2019 door tonight, and I heard Master tell Missis that he had sold my Harry, and you, Uncle Tom, both, to a trader; and that he was going off this morning on his horse, and that the man was to take possession today.\u201d Tom had stood, during this speech, with his hands raised, and his eyes dilated, like a man in a dream."], "What do Uncle Tom and Cassy help one another with in Simon Legree's cotton fields until they are punished for cooperation?": [" This hint was enough to repress talking, though, of course, it did not disturb the credit of the story in the least. Gradually, the staircase that led to the garret, and even the passage-way to the staircase, were avoided by every one in the house, from every one fearing to speak of it, and the legend was gradually falling into desuetude. It had suddenly occurred to Cassy to make use of the superstitious excitability, which was so great in Legree, for the purpose of her liberation, and that of her fellow-sufferer. The sleeping-room of Cassy was directly under the garret. One day, without consulting Legree, she suddenly took it upon her, with some considerable ostentation, to change all the furniture and appurtenances of the room to one at some considerable distance. The under-servants, who were called on to effect this movement, were running and bustling about with great zeal and confusion, when Legree returned from a ride. \u201cHallo! you Cass!\u201d said Legree, \u201cwhat\u2019s in the wind now?\u201d \u201cNothing; only I choose to have another room,\u201d said Cassy, doggedly. \u201cAnd what for, pray?\u201d said Legree. \u201cI choose to,\u201d said Cassy. \u201cThe devil you do! and what for?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to get some sleep, now and then.\u201d \u201cSleep! well, what hinders your sleeping?\u201d \u201cI could tell, I suppose, if you want to hear,\u201d said Cassy, dryly. \u201cSpeak out, you minx!\u201d said Legree. \u201cO! nothing.

I used to hear \u2019em sometimes down in the hold of the ship; and wind,--Lord\u2019s sake! ye can make anything out o\u2019 wind.\u201d Cassy knew Legree was uneasy under her eyes, and, therefore, she made no answer, but sat fixing them on him, with that strange, unearthly expression, as before. \u201cCome, speak out, woman,--don\u2019t you think so?\u201d said Legree. \u201cCan rats walk down stairs, and come walking through the entry, and open a door when you\u2019ve locked it and set a chair against it?\u201d said Cassy; \u201cand come walk, walk, walking right up to your bed, and put out their hand, so?\u201d Cassy kept her glittering eyes fixed on Legree, as she spoke, and he stared at her like a man in the nightmare, till, when she finished by laying her hand, icy cold, on his, he sprung back, with an oath. \u201cWoman! what do you mean? Nobody did?\u201d \u201cO, no,--of course not,--did I say they did?\u201d said Cassy, with a smile of chilling derision. \u201cBut--did--have you really seen?--Come, Cass, what is it, now,--speak out!\u201d \u201cYou may sleep there, yourself,\u201d said Cassy, \u201cif you want to know.\u201d \u201cDid it come from the garret, Cassy?\u201d \u201c_It_,--what?\u201d said Cassy. \u201cWhy, what you told of--\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you anything,\u201d said Cassy, with dogged sullenness.

You shan\u2019t go!\u201d But Cassy laughed wildly, and fled on. He heard her open the entry doors that led to the garret. A wild gust of wind swept down, extinguishing the candle he held in his hand, and with it the fearful, unearthly screams; they seemed to be shrieked in his very ear. Legree fled frantically into the parlor, whither, in a few moments, he was followed by Cassy, pale, calm, cold as an avenging spirit, and with that same fearful light in her eye. \u201cI hope you are satisfied,\u201d said she. \u201cBlast you, Cass!\u201d said Legree. \u201cWhat for?\u201d said Cassy. \u201cI only went up and shut the doors. _What\u2019s the matter with that garret_, Simon, do you suppose?\u201d said she. \u201cNone of your business!\u201d said Legree. \u201cO, it an\u2019t?

Of course, the moment the doors were opened, the wind had drafted down, and extinguished the light. This may serve as a specimen of the game that Cassy played with Legree, until he would sooner have put his head into a lion\u2019s mouth than to have explored that garret. Meanwhile, in the night, when everybody else was asleep, Cassy slowly and carefully accumulated there a stock of provisions sufficient to afford subsistence for some time; she transferred, article by article, a greater part of her own and Emmeline\u2019s wardrobe."], "What act of defiance causes Simon Legree to order Tom's flogging?": [" \u201cI\u2019ll have this yer thing examined.

I used to hear \u2019em sometimes down in the hold of the ship; and wind,--Lord\u2019s sake! ye can make anything out o\u2019 wind.\u201d Cassy knew Legree was uneasy under her eyes, and, therefore, she made no answer, but sat fixing them on him, with that strange, unearthly expression, as before. \u201cCome, speak out, woman,--don\u2019t you think so?\u201d said Legree. \u201cCan rats walk down stairs, and come walking through the entry, and open a door when you\u2019ve locked it and set a chair against it?\u201d said Cassy; \u201cand come walk, walk, walking right up to your bed, and put out their hand, so?\u201d Cassy kept her glittering eyes fixed on Legree, as she spoke, and he stared at her like a man in the nightmare, till, when she finished by laying her hand, icy cold, on his, he sprung back, with an oath. \u201cWoman! what do you mean? Nobody did?\u201d \u201cO, no,--of course not,--did I say they did?\u201d said Cassy, with a smile of chilling derision. \u201cBut--did--have you really seen?--Come, Cass, what is it, now,--speak out!\u201d \u201cYou may sleep there, yourself,\u201d said Cassy, \u201cif you want to know.\u201d \u201cDid it come from the garret, Cassy?\u201d \u201c_It_,--what?\u201d said Cassy. \u201cWhy, what you told of--\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you anything,\u201d said Cassy, with dogged sullenness. Legree walked up and down the room, uneasily.", " \u201cO, Em!\u201d said Cassy, \u201cI\u2019ve hungered for my children, and thirsted for them, and my eyes fail with longing for them! Here! here!\u201d she said, striking her breast, \u201cit\u2019s all desolate, all empty! If God would give me back my children, then I could pray.\u201d \u201cYou must trust him, Cassy,\u201d said Emmeline; \u201che is our Father!\u201d \u201cHis wrath is upon us,\u201d said Cassy; \u201che has turned away in anger.\u201d \u201cNo, Cassy! He will be good to us! Let us hope in Him,\u201d said Emmeline,--\u201cI always have had hope.\u201d The hunt was long, animated, and thorough, but unsuccessful; and, with grave, ironic exultation, Cassy looked down on Legree, as, weary and dispirited, he alighted from his horse. \u201cNow, Quimbo,\u201d said Legree, as he stretched himself down in the sitting-room, \u201cyou jest go and walk that Tom up here, right away! The old cuss is at the bottom of this yer whole matter; and I\u2019ll have it out of his old black hide, or I\u2019ll know the reason why!\u201d Sambo and Quimbo, both, though hating each other, were joined in one mind by a no less cordial hatred of Tom. Legree had told them, at first, that he had bought him for a general overseer, in his absence; and this had begun an ill will, on their part, which had increased, in their debased and servile natures, as they saw him becoming obnoxious to their master\u2019s displeasure. Quimbo, therefore, departed, with a will, to execute his orders. Tom heard the message with a forewarning heart; for he knew all the plan of the fugitives\u2019 escape, and the place of their present concealment;--he knew the deadly character of the man he had to deal with, and his despotic power.", " She came up on the verandah steps, and looked in. Legree and both the drivers, in a state of furious intoxication, were singing, whooping, upsetting chairs, and making all manner of ludicrous and horrid grimaces at each other. She rested her small, slender hand on the window-blind, and looked fixedly at them;--there was a world of anguish, scorn, and fierce bitterness, in her black eyes, as she did so. \u201cWould it be a sin to rid the world of such a wretch?\u201d she said to herself. She turned hurriedly away, and, passing round to a back door, glided up stairs, and tapped at Emmeline\u2019s door. CHAPTER XXXVI Emmeline and Cassy Cassy entered the room, and found Emmeline sitting, pale with fear, in the furthest corner of it. As she came in, the girl started up nervously; but, on seeing who it was, rushed forward, and catching her arm, said, \u201cO Cassy, is it you? I\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve come! I was afraid it was--. O, you don\u2019t know what a horrid noise there has been, down stairs, all this evening!\u201d \u201cI ought to know,\u201d said Cassy, dryly. \u201cI\u2019ve heard it often enough.\u201d \u201cO Cassy! do tell me,--couldn\u2019t we get away from this place? I don\u2019t care where,--into the swamp among the snakes,--anywhere! _Couldn\u2019t_ we get _somewhere_ away from here?\u201d \u201cNowhere, but into our graves,\u201d said Cassy. \u201cDid you ever try?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve seen enough of trying and what comes of it,\u201d said Cassy. \u201cI\u2019d be willing to live in the swamps, and gnaw the bark from trees.", " That he got him in love with another woman; and that I might know, after all that, that he should not give up for a few airs and tears, and things of that sort. \u201cI gave up, for my hands were tied. He had my children;--whenever I resisted his will anywhere, he would talk about selling them, and he made me as submissive as he desired. O, what a life it was! to live with my heart breaking, every day,--to keep on, on, on, loving, when it was only misery; and to be bound, body and soul, to one I hated. I used to love to read to Henry, to play to him, to waltz with him, and sing to him; but everything I did for this one was a perfect drag,--yet I was afraid to refuse anything. He was very imperious, and harsh to the children. Elise was a timid little thing; but Henry was bold and high-spirited, like his father, and he had never been brought under, in the least, by any one. He was always finding fault, and quarrelling with him; and I used to live in daily fear and dread. I tried to make the child respectful;--I tried to keep them apart, for I held on to those children like death; but it did no good. _He sold both those children_. He took me to ride, one day, and when I came home, they were nowhere to be found! He told me he had sold them; he showed me the money, the price of their blood. Then it seemed as if all good forsook me. I raved and cursed,--cursed God and man; and, for a while, I believe, he really was afraid of me."], "What item, confiscated from Tom, does Simon Legree throw into a fire in terror?": [" \u201cI\u2019ll have this yer thing examined. I\u2019ll look into it, this very night. I\u2019ll take my pistols--\u201d \u201cDo,\u201d said Cassy; \u201csleep in that room. I\u2019d like to see you doing it. Fire your pistols,--do!\u201d Legree stamped his foot, and swore violently. \u201cDon\u2019t swear,\u201d said Cassy; \u201cnobody knows who may be hearing you. Hark! What was that?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d said Legree, starting. A heavy old Dutch clock, that stood in the corner of the room, began, and slowly struck twelve. For some reason or other, Legree neither spoke nor moved; a vague horror fell on him; while Cassy, with a keen, sneering glitter in her eyes, stood looking at him, counting the strokes. \u201cTwelve o\u2019clock; well _now_ we\u2019ll see,\u201d said she, turning, and opening the door into the passage-way, and standing as if listening. \u201cHark! What\u2019s that?\u201d said she, raising her finger. \u201cIt\u2019s only the wind,\u201d said Legree. \u201cDon\u2019t you hear how cursedly it blows?\u201d \u201cSimon, come here,\u201d said Cassy, in a whisper, laying her hand on his, and leading him to the foot of the stairs: \u201cdo you know what _that_ is? Hark!\u201d A wild shriek came pealing down the stairway. It came from the garret. Legree\u2019s knees knocked together; his face grew white with fear. \u201cHadn\u2019t you better get your pistols?\u201d said Cassy, with a sneer that froze Legree\u2019s blood. \u201cIt\u2019s time this thing was looked into, you know. I\u2019d like to have you go up now; _they\u2019re at it_.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t go!\u201d said Legree, with an oath.", " And, therefore, without shuddering or trembling, he heard the voice of his persecutor, as he drew near. \u201cWell, my boy,\u201d said Legree, with a contemptuous kick, \u201chow do you find yourself? Didn\u2019t I tell yer I could larn yer a thing or two? How do yer like it--eh? How did yer whaling agree with yer, Tom? An\u2019t quite so crank as ye was last night. Ye couldn\u2019t treat a poor sinner, now, to a bit of sermon, could ye,--eh?\u201d Tom answered nothing. \u201cGet up, you beast!\u201d said Legree, kicking him again. This was a difficult matter for one so bruised and faint; and, as Tom made efforts to do so, Legree laughed brutally. \u201cWhat makes ye so spry, this morning, Tom? Cotched cold, may be, last night.\u201d Tom by this time had gained his feet, and was confronting his master with a steady, unmoved front. \u201cThe devil, you can!\u201d said Legree, looking him over. \u201cI believe you haven\u2019t got enough yet. Now, Tom, get right down on yer knees and beg my pardon, for yer shines last night.\u201d Tom did not move. \u201cDown, you dog!\u201d said Legree, striking him with his riding-whip. \u201cMas\u2019r Legree,\u201d said Tom, \u201cI can\u2019t do it. I did only what I thought was right. I shall do just so again, if ever the time comes. I never will do a cruel thing, come what may.\u201d \u201cYes, but ye don\u2019t know what may come, Master Tom. Ye think what you\u2019ve got is something. I tell you \u2019tan\u2019t anything,--nothing \u2019t all. How would ye like to be tied to a tree, and have a slow fire lit up around ye;--wouldn\u2019t that be pleasant,--eh, Tom?\u201d \u201cMas\u2019r,\u201d said Tom, \u201cI know ye can do dreadful things; but,\u201d--he stretched himself upward and clasped his hands,--\u201cbut, after ye\u2019ve killed the body, there an\u2019t no more ye can do.", " This hint was enough to repress talking, though, of course, it did not disturb the credit of the story in the least. Gradually, the staircase that led to the garret, and even the passage-way to the staircase, were avoided by every one in the house, from every one fearing to speak of it, and the legend was gradually falling into desuetude. It had suddenly occurred to Cassy to make use of the superstitious excitability, which was so great in Legree, for the purpose of her liberation, and that of her fellow-sufferer. The sleeping-room of Cassy was directly under the garret. One day, without consulting Legree, she suddenly took it upon her, with some considerable ostentation, to change all the furniture and appurtenances of the room to one at some considerable distance. The under-servants, who were called on to effect this movement, were running and bustling about with great zeal and confusion, when Legree returned from a ride. \u201cHallo! you Cass!\u201d said Legree, \u201cwhat\u2019s in the wind now?\u201d \u201cNothing; only I choose to have another room,\u201d said Cassy, doggedly. \u201cAnd what for, pray?\u201d said Legree. \u201cI choose to,\u201d said Cassy. \u201cThe devil you do! and what for?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to get some sleep, now and then.\u201d \u201cSleep! well, what hinders your sleeping?\u201d \u201cI could tell, I suppose, if you want to hear,\u201d said Cassy, dryly. \u201cSpeak out, you minx!\u201d said Legree. \u201cO! nothing.

Legree gnashed on him with his teeth, but rage kept him silent; and Tom, like a man disenthralled, spoke, in a clear and cheerful voice, \u201cMas\u2019r Legree, as ye bought me, I\u2019ll be a true and faithful servant to ye.

Born of a hard-tempered sire, on whom that gentle woman had wasted a world of unvalued love, Legree had followed in the steps of his father. Boisterous, unruly, and tyrannical, he despised all her counsel, and would none of her reproof; and, at an early age, broke from her, to seek his fortunes at sea. He never came home but once, after; and then, his mother, with the yearning of a heart that must love something, and has nothing else to love, clung to him, and sought, with passionate prayers and entreaties, to win him from a life of sin, to his soul\u2019s eternal good. That was Legree\u2019s day of grace; then good angels called him; then he was almost persuaded, and mercy held him by the hand. His heart inly relented,--there was a conflict,--but sin got the victory, and he set all the force of his rough nature against the conviction of his conscience. He drank and swore,--was wilder and more brutal than ever. And, one night, when his mother, in the last agony of her despair, knelt at his feet, he spurned her from him,--threw her senseless on the floor, and, with brutal curses, fled to his ship. The next Legree heard of his mother was, when, one night, as he was carousing among drunken companions, a letter was put into his hand. He opened it, and a lock of long, curling hair fell from it, and twined about his fingers."], "After his recovery, what does Tom Loker decide to do out of gratitude and admiration toward the Quakers?": [" \u201cCome, now, young un,\u201d said the auctioneer, giving the boy a touch with his hammer, \u201cbe up and show your springs, now.\u201d \u201cPut us two up togedder, togedder,--do please, Mas\u2019r,\u201d said the old woman, holding fast to her boy. \u201cBe off,\u201d said the man, gruffly, pushing her hands away; \u201cyou come last.

The boy paused, and looked back; but there was no time to stay, and, dashing the tears from his large, bright eyes, he was up in a moment. His fine figure, alert limbs, and bright face, raised an instant competition, and half a dozen bids simultaneously met the ear of the auctioneer. Anxious, half-frightened, he looked from side to side, as he heard the clatter of contending bids,--now here, now there,--till the hammer fell. Haley had got him.

A while we must leave Tom in the hands of his persecutors, while we turn to pursue the fortunes of George and his wife, whom we left in friendly hands, in a farmhouse on the road-side. Tom Loker we left groaning and touzling in a most immaculately clean Quaker bed, under the motherly supervision of Aunt Dorcas, who found him to the full as tractable a patient as a sick bison. Imagine a tall, dignified, spiritual woman, whose clear muslin cap shades waves of silvery hair, parted on a broad, clear forehead, which overarches thoughtful gray eyes. A snowy handkerchief of lisse crape is folded neatly across her bosom; her glossy brown silk dress rustles peacefully, as she glides up and down the chamber. \u201cThe devil!\u201d says Tom Loker, giving a great throw to the bedclothes. \u201cI must request thee, Thomas, not to use such language,\u201d says Aunt Dorcas, as she quietly rearranged the bed. \u201cWell, I won\u2019t, granny, if I can help it,\u201d says Tom; \u201cbut it is enough to make a fellow swear,--so cursedly hot!\u201d Dorcas removed a comforter from the bed, straightened the clothes again, and tucked them in till Tom looked something like a chrysalis; remarking, as she did so, \u201cI wish, friend, thee would leave off cursing and swearing, and think upon thy ways.\u201d \u201cWhat the devil,\u201d said Tom, \u201cshould I think of _them_ for?"], "When Cassy approaches Tom to explain her plan to kill Simon Legree, what does he plead that she do instead?": [" This hint was enough to repress talking, though, of course, it did not disturb the credit of the story in the least. Gradually, the staircase that led to the garret, and even the passage-way to the staircase, were avoided by every one in the house, from every one fearing to speak of it, and the legend was gradually falling into desuetude. It had suddenly occurred to Cassy to make use of the superstitious excitability, which was so great in Legree, for the purpose of her liberation, and that of her fellow-sufferer. The sleeping-room of Cassy was directly under the garret. One day, without consulting Legree, she suddenly took it upon her, with some considerable ostentation, to change all the furniture and appurtenances of the room to one at some considerable distance. The under-servants, who were called on to effect this movement, were running and bustling about with great zeal and confusion, when Legree returned from a ride. \u201cHallo! you Cass!\u201d said Legree, \u201cwhat\u2019s in the wind now?\u201d \u201cNothing; only I choose to have another room,\u201d said Cassy, doggedly. \u201cAnd what for, pray?\u201d said Legree. \u201cI choose to,\u201d said Cassy. \u201cThe devil you do! and what for?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to get some sleep, now and then.\u201d \u201cSleep! well, what hinders your sleeping?\u201d \u201cI could tell, I suppose, if you want to hear,\u201d said Cassy, dryly. \u201cSpeak out, you minx!\u201d said Legree. \u201cO! nothing. I suppose it wouldn\u2019t disturb _you!_ Only groans, and people scuffing, and rolling round on the garret floor, half the night, from twelve to morning!\u201d \u201cPeople up garret!\u201d said Legree, uneasily, but forcing a laugh; \u201cwho are they, Cassy?\u201d Cassy raised her sharp, black eyes, and looked in the face of Legree, with an expression that went through his bones, as she said, \u201cTo be sure, Simon, who are they?", " \u201cI\u2019ll have this yer thing examined. I\u2019ll look into it, this very night. I\u2019ll take my pistols--\u201d \u201cDo,\u201d said Cassy; \u201csleep in that room. I\u2019d like to see you doing it. Fire your pistols,--do!\u201d Legree stamped his foot, and swore violently. \u201cDon\u2019t swear,\u201d said Cassy; \u201cnobody knows who may be hearing you. Hark! What was that?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d said Legree, starting. A heavy old Dutch clock, that stood in the corner of the room, began, and slowly struck twelve. For some reason or other, Legree neither spoke nor moved; a vague horror fell on him; while Cassy, with a keen, sneering glitter in her eyes, stood looking at him, counting the strokes. \u201cTwelve o\u2019clock; well _now_ we\u2019ll see,\u201d said she, turning, and opening the door into the passage-way, and standing as if listening. \u201cHark! What\u2019s that?\u201d said she, raising her finger. \u201cIt\u2019s only the wind,\u201d said Legree. \u201cDon\u2019t you hear how cursedly it blows?\u201d \u201cSimon, come here,\u201d said Cassy, in a whisper, laying her hand on his, and leading him to the foot of the stairs: \u201cdo you know what _that_ is? Hark!\u201d A wild shriek came pealing down the stairway. It came from the garret. Legree\u2019s knees knocked together; his face grew white with fear. \u201cHadn\u2019t you better get your pistols?\u201d said Cassy, with a sneer that froze Legree\u2019s blood. \u201cIt\u2019s time this thing was looked into, you know. I\u2019d like to have you go up now; _they\u2019re at it_.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t go!\u201d said Legree, with an oath.", " There was that strange light in her eyes that always impressed Legree with uneasiness. \u201cThem noises was nothing but rats and the wind,\u201d said Legree. \u201cRats will make a devil of a noise. I used to hear \u2019em sometimes down in the hold of the ship; and wind,--Lord\u2019s sake! ye can make anything out o\u2019 wind.\u201d Cassy knew Legree was uneasy under her eyes, and, therefore, she made no answer, but sat fixing them on him, with that strange, unearthly expression, as before. \u201cCome, speak out, woman,--don\u2019t you think so?\u201d said Legree. \u201cCan rats walk down stairs, and come walking through the entry, and open a door when you\u2019ve locked it and set a chair against it?\u201d said Cassy; \u201cand come walk, walk, walking right up to your bed, and put out their hand, so?\u201d Cassy kept her glittering eyes fixed on Legree, as she spoke, and he stared at her like a man in the nightmare, till, when she finished by laying her hand, icy cold, on his, he sprung back, with an oath. \u201cWoman! what do you mean? Nobody did?\u201d \u201cO, no,--of course not,--did I say they did?\u201d said Cassy, with a smile of chilling derision. \u201cBut--did--have you really seen?--Come, Cass, what is it, now,--speak out!\u201d \u201cYou may sleep there, yourself,\u201d said Cassy, \u201cif you want to know.\u201d \u201cDid it come from the garret, Cassy?\u201d \u201c_It_,--what?\u201d said Cassy. \u201cWhy, what you told of--\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t tell you anything,\u201d said Cassy, with dogged sullenness. Legree walked up and down the room, uneasily.", " \u201cWhy not? There an\u2019t any such thing as ghosts, you know! Come!\u201d and Cassy flitted up the winding stairway, laughing, and looking back after him. \u201cCome on.\u201d \u201cI believe you _are_ the devil!\u201d said Legree. \u201cCome back you hag,--come back, Cass! You shan\u2019t go!\u201d But Cassy laughed wildly, and fled on. He heard her open the entry doors that led to the garret. A wild gust of wind swept down, extinguishing the candle he held in his hand, and with it the fearful, unearthly screams; they seemed to be shrieked in his very ear. Legree fled frantically into the parlor, whither, in a few moments, he was followed by Cassy, pale, calm, cold as an avenging spirit, and with that same fearful light in her eye. \u201cI hope you are satisfied,\u201d said she. \u201cBlast you, Cass!\u201d said Legree. \u201cWhat for?\u201d said Cassy. \u201cI only went up and shut the doors. _What\u2019s the matter with that garret_, Simon, do you suppose?\u201d said she. \u201cNone of your business!\u201d said Legree. \u201cO, it an\u2019t? Well,\u201d said Cassy, \u201cat any rate, I\u2019m glad _I_ don\u2019t sleep under it.\u201d Anticipating the rising of the wind, that very evening, Cassy had been up and opened the garret window. Of course, the moment the doors were opened, the wind had drafted down, and extinguished the light. This may serve as a specimen of the game that Cassy played with Legree, until he would sooner have put his head into a lion\u2019s mouth than to have explored that garret. Meanwhile, in the night, when everybody else was asleep, Cassy slowly and carefully accumulated there a stock of provisions sufficient to afford subsistence for some time; she transferred, article by article, a greater part of her own and Emmeline\u2019s wardrobe."], "Where do Cassy and Emmeline hide overnight after escaping Legree's house and running through the nearby swamp?": [" The establishment was, of a consequence, wholly deserted, when Cassy and Emmeline glided into it the back way. The whooping and shouts of their pursuers were still filling the air; and, looking from the sitting-room windows, Cassy and Emmeline could see the troop, with their flambeaux, just dispersing themselves along the edge of the swamp. \u201cSee there!\u201d said Emmeline, pointing to Cassy; \u201cthe hunt is begun! Look how those lights dance about! Hark! the dogs! Don\u2019t you hear? If we were only _there_, our chances wouldn\u2019t be worth a picayune. O, for pity\u2019s sake, do let\u2019s hide ourselves. Quick!\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no occasion for hurry,\u201d said Cassy, coolly; \u201cthey are all out after the hunt,--that\u2019s the amusement of the evening! We\u2019ll go up stairs, by and by. Meanwhile,\u201d said she, deliberately taking a key from the pocket of a coat that Legree had thrown down in his hurry, \u201cmeanwhile I shall take something to pay our passage.\u201d She unlocked the desk, took from it a roll of bills, which she counted over rapidly. \u201cO, don\u2019t let\u2019s do that!\u201d said Emmeline. \u201cDon\u2019t!\u201d said Cassy; \u201cwhy not? Would you have us starve in the swamps, or have that that will pay our way to the free states. Money will do anything, girl.\u201d And, as she spoke, she put the money in her bosom. \u201cIt would be stealing,\u201d said Emmeline, in a distressed whisper. \u201cStealing!\u201d said Cassy, with a scornful laugh. \u201cThey who steal body and soul needn\u2019t talk to us.", " That will put the dogs all at fault; for scent won\u2019t lie in the water. Every one will run out of the house to look after us, and then we\u2019ll whip in at the back door, and up into the garret, where I\u2019ve got a nice bed made up in one of the great boxes. We must stay in that garret a good while, for, I tell you, he will raise heaven and earth after us. He\u2019ll muster some of those old overseers on the other plantations, and have a great hunt; and they\u2019ll go over every inch of ground in that swamp. He makes it his boast that nobody ever got away from him. So let him hunt at his leisure.\u201d \u201cCassy, how well you have planned it!\u201d said Emmeline. \u201cWho ever would have thought of it, but you?\u201d There was neither pleasure nor exultation in Cassy\u2019s eyes,--only a despairing firmness. \u201cCome,\u201d she said, reaching her hand to Emmeline. The two fugitives glided noiselessly from the house, and flitted, through the gathering shadows of evening, along by the quarters. The crescent moon, set like a silver signet in the western sky, delayed a little the approach of night. As Cassy expected, when quite near the verge of the swamps that encircled the plantation, they heard a voice calling to them to stop. It was not Sambo, however, but Legree, who was pursuing them with violent execrations. At the sound, the feebler spirit of Emmeline gave way; and, laying hold of Cassy\u2019s arm, she said, \u201cO, Cassy, I\u2019m going to faint!\u201d \u201cIf you do, I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d said Cassy, drawing a small, glittering stiletto, and flashing it before the eyes of the girl.", " \u201cWhat did you mean, Cassy, by saying you would kill me?\u201d she said, simply. \u201cI meant to stop your fainting,\u201d said Cassy, \u201cand I did do it. And now I tell you, Emmeline, you must make up your mind _not_ to faint, let what will come; there\u2019s no sort of need of it. If I had not stopped you, that wretch might have had his hands on you now.\u201d Emmeline shuddered. The two remained some time in silence. Cassy busied herself with a French book; Emmeline, overcome with the exhaustion, fell into a doze, and slept some time. She was awakened by loud shouts and outcries, the tramp of horses\u2019 feet, and the baying of dogs. She started up, with a faint shriek. \u201cOnly the hunt coming back,\u201d said Cassy, coolly; \u201cnever fear. Look out of this knot-hole. Don\u2019t you see \u2019em all down there? Simon has to give up, for this night. Look, how muddy his horse is, flouncing about in the swamp; the dogs, too, look rather crestfallen. Ah, my good sir, you\u2019ll have to try the race again and again,--the game isn\u2019t there.\u201d \u201cO, don\u2019t speak a word!\u201d said Emmeline; \u201cwhat if they should hear you?\u201d \u201cIf they do hear anything, it will make them very particular to keep away,\u201d said Cassy. \u201cNo danger; we may make any noise we please, and it will only add to the effect.\u201d At length the stillness of midnight settled down over the house. Legree, cursing his ill luck, and vowing dire vengeance on the morrow, went to bed. CHAPTER XL The Martyr \u201cDeem not the just by Heaven forgot!", " She came up on the verandah steps, and looked in. Legree and both the drivers, in a state of furious intoxication, were singing, whooping, upsetting chairs, and making all manner of ludicrous and horrid grimaces at each other. She rested her small, slender hand on the window-blind, and looked fixedly at them;--there was a world of anguish, scorn, and fierce bitterness, in her black eyes, as she did so. \u201cWould it be a sin to rid the world of such a wretch?\u201d she said to herself. She turned hurriedly away, and, passing round to a back door, glided up stairs, and tapped at Emmeline\u2019s door. CHAPTER XXXVI Emmeline and Cassy Cassy entered the room, and found Emmeline sitting, pale with fear, in the furthest corner of it. As she came in, the girl started up nervously; but, on seeing who it was, rushed forward, and catching her arm, said, \u201cO Cassy, is it you? I\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve come! I was afraid it was--. O, you don\u2019t know what a horrid noise there has been, down stairs, all this evening!\u201d \u201cI ought to know,\u201d said Cassy, dryly. \u201cI\u2019ve heard it often enough.\u201d \u201cO Cassy! do tell me,--couldn\u2019t we get away from this place? I don\u2019t care where,--into the swamp among the snakes,--anywhere! _Couldn\u2019t_ we get _somewhere_ away from here?\u201d \u201cNowhere, but into our graves,\u201d said Cassy. \u201cDid you ever try?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve seen enough of trying and what comes of it,\u201d said Cassy. \u201cI\u2019d be willing to live in the swamps, and gnaw the bark from trees."], "What are the relationships of Madame de Thoux to George Harris, and Cassy to Eliza, respectively?": [" \u201cThank God!\u201d George looked a surprised inquiry, but said nothing. Madame de Thoux leaned her head on her hand, and burst into tears. \u201cHe is my brother,\u201d she said. \u201cMadame!\u201d said George, with a strong accent of surprise. \u201cYes,\u201d said Madame de Thoux, lifting her head, proudly, and wiping her tears, \u201cMr. Shelby, George Harris is my brother!\u201d \u201cI am perfectly astonished,\u201d said George, pushing back his chair a pace or two, and looking at Madame de Thoux. \u201cI was sold to the South when he was a boy,\u201d said she. \u201cI was bought by a good and generous man. He took me with him to the West Indies, set me free, and married me. It is but lately that he died; and I was going up to Kentucky, to see if I could find and redeem my brother.\u201d \u201cI heard him speak of a sister Emily, that was sold South,\u201d said George. \u201cYes, indeed! I am the one,\u201d said Madame de Thoux;--\u201ctell me what sort of a--\u201d \u201cA very fine young man,\u201d said George, \u201cnotwithstanding the curse of slavery that lay on him. He sustained a first rate character, both for intelligence and principle. I know, you see,\u201d he said; \u201cbecause he married in our family.\u201d \u201cWhat sort of a girl?\u201d said Madame de Thoux, eagerly. \u201cA treasure,\u201d said George; \u201ca beautiful, intelligent, amiable girl. Very pious. My mother had brought her up, and trained her as carefully, almost, as a daughter. She could read and write, embroider and sew, beautifully; and was a beautiful singer.\u201d \u201cWas she born in your house?\u201d said Madame de Thoux.", " This lady, having gathered, from George\u2019s conversation, that he was from Kentucky, seemed evidently disposed to cultivate his acquaintance; in which design she was seconded by the graces of her little girl, who was about as pretty a plaything as ever diverted the weariness of a fortnight\u2019s trip on a steamboat. George\u2019s chair was often placed at her state-room door; and Cassy, as she sat upon the guards, could hear their conversation. Madame de Thoux was very minute in her inquiries as to Kentucky, where she said she had resided in a former period of her life. George discovered, to his surprise, that her former residence must have been in his own vicinity; and her inquiries showed a knowledge of people and things in his vicinity, that was perfectly surprising to him. \u201cDo you know,\u201d said Madame de Thoux to him, one day, \u201cof any man, in your neighborhood, of the name of Harris?\u201d \u201cThere is an old fellow, of that name, lives not far from my father\u2019s place,\u201d said George. \u201cWe never have had much intercourse with him, though.\u201d \u201cHe is a large slave-owner, I believe,\u201d said Madame de Thoux, with a manner which seemed to betray more interest than she was exactly willing to show. \u201cHe is,\u201d said George, looking rather surprised at her manner. \u201cDid you ever know of his having--perhaps, you may have heard of his having a mulatto boy, named George?\u201d \u201cO, certainly,--George Harris,--I know him well; he married a servant of my mother\u2019s, but has escaped, now, to Canada.\u201d \u201cHe has?\u201d said Madame de Thoux, quickly.", " I\u2019m for going right up. They can\u2019t jump down in a hurry, and it won\u2019t take long to ferret \u2019em out.\u201d \u201cBut, Tom, they might fire at us from behind the rocks,\u201d said Marks. \u201cThat would be ugly, you know.\u201d \u201cUgh!\u201d said Tom, with a sneer. \u201cAlways for saving your skin, Marks! No danger! niggers are too plaguy scared!\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know why I _shouldn\u2019t_ save my skin,\u201d said Marks. \u201cIt\u2019s the best I\u2019ve got; and niggers _do_ fight like the devil, sometimes.\u201d At this moment, George appeared on the top of a rock above them, and, speaking in a calm, clear voice, said, \u201cGentlemen, who are you, down there, and what do you want?\u201d \u201cWe want a party of runaway niggers,\u201d said Tom Loker. \u201cOne George Harris, and Eliza Harris, and their son, and Jim Selden, and an old woman. We\u2019ve got the officers, here, and a warrant to take \u2019em; and we\u2019re going to have \u2019em, too. D\u2019ye hear? An\u2019t you George Harris, that belongs to Mr. Harris, of Shelby county, Kentucky?\u201d \u201cI am George Harris. A Mr. Harris, of Kentucky, did call me his property. But now I\u2019m a free man, standing on God\u2019s free soil; and my wife and my child I claim as mine. Jim and his mother are here. We have arms to defend ourselves, and we mean to do it. You can come up, if you like; but the first one of you that comes within the range of our bullets is a dead man, and the next, and the next; and so on till the last.\u201d \u201cO, come! come!\u201d said a short, puffy man, stepping forward, and blowing his nose as he did so.", " \u201cNo. Father bought her once, in one of his trips to New Orleans, and brought her up as a present to mother. She was about eight or nine years old, then. Father would never tell mother what he gave for her; but, the other day, in looking over his old papers, we came across the bill of sale. He paid an extravagant sum for her, to be sure. I suppose, on account of her extraordinary beauty.\u201d George sat with his back to Cassy, and did not see the absorbed expression of her countenance, as he was giving these details. At this point in the story, she touched his arm, and, with a face perfectly white with interest, said, \u201cDo you know the names of the people he bought her of?\u201d \u201cA man of the name of Simmons, I think, was the principal in the transaction. At least, I think that was the name on the bill of sale.\u201d \u201cO, my God!\u201d said Cassy, and fell insensible on the floor of the cabin. George was wide awake now, and so was Madame de Thoux. Though neither of them could conjecture what was the cause of Cassy\u2019s fainting, still they made all the tumult which is proper in such cases;--George upsetting a wash-pitcher, and breaking two tumblers, in the warmth of his humanity; and various ladies in the cabin, hearing that somebody had fainted, crowded the state-room door, and kept out all the air they possibly could, so that, on the whole, everything was done that could be expected.

But now I\u2019m a free man, standing on God\u2019s free soil; and my wife and my child I claim as mine. Jim and his mother are here. We have arms to defend ourselves, and we mean to do it. You can come up, if you like; but the first one of you that comes within the range of our bullets is a dead man, and the next, and the next; and so on till the last.\u201d \u201cO, come! come!\u201d said a short, puffy man, stepping forward, and blowing his nose as he did so.", " This lady, having gathered, from George\u2019s conversation, that he was from Kentucky, seemed evidently disposed to cultivate his acquaintance; in which design she was seconded by the graces of her little girl, who was about as pretty a plaything as ever diverted the weariness of a fortnight\u2019s trip on a steamboat. George\u2019s chair was often placed at her state-room door; and Cassy, as she sat upon the guards, could hear their conversation. Madame de Thoux was very minute in her inquiries as to Kentucky, where she said she had resided in a former period of her life. George discovered, to his surprise, that her former residence must have been in his own vicinity; and her inquiries showed a knowledge of people and things in his vicinity, that was perfectly surprising to him. \u201cDo you know,\u201d said Madame de Thoux to him, one day, \u201cof any man, in your neighborhood, of the name of Harris?\u201d \u201cThere is an old fellow, of that name, lives not far from my father\u2019s place,\u201d said George. \u201cWe never have had much intercourse with him, though.\u201d \u201cHe is a large slave-owner, I believe,\u201d said Madame de Thoux, with a manner which seemed to betray more interest than she was exactly willing to show. \u201cHe is,\u201d said George, looking rather surprised at her manner. \u201cDid you ever know of his having--perhaps, you may have heard of his having a mulatto boy, named George?\u201d \u201cO, certainly,--George Harris,--I know him well; he married a servant of my mother\u2019s, but has escaped, now, to Canada.\u201d \u201cHe has?\u201d said Madame de Thoux, quickly.", " \u201cGeorge!\u201d said Mr. Wilson. \u201cYes, George,\u201d said the young man. \u201cI couldn\u2019t have thought it!\u201d \u201cI am pretty well disguised, I fancy,\u201d said the young man, with a smile. \u201cA little walnut bark has made my yellow skin a genteel brown, and I\u2019ve dyed my hair black; so you see I don\u2019t answer to the advertisement at all.\u201d \u201cO, George! but this is a dangerous game you are playing. I could not have advised you to it.\u201d \u201cI can do it on my own responsibility,\u201d said George, with the same proud smile. We remark, _en passant_, that George was, by his father\u2019s side, of white descent. His mother was one of those unfortunates of her race, marked out by personal beauty to be the slave of the passions of her possessor, and the mother of children who may never know a father. From one of the proudest families in Kentucky he had inherited a set of fine European features, and a high, indomitable spirit. From his mother he had received only a slight mulatto tinge, amply compensated by its accompanying rich, dark eye. A slight change in the tint of the skin and the color of his hair had metamorphosed him into the Spanish-looking fellow he then appeared; and as gracefulness of movement and gentlemanly manners had always been perfectly natural to him, he found no difficulty in playing the bold part he had adopted--that of a gentleman travelling with his domestic. Mr. Wilson, a good-natured but extremely fidgety and cautious old gentleman, ambled up and down the room, appearing, as John Bunyan hath it, \u201cmuch tumbled up and down in his mind,\u201d and divided between his wish to help George, and a certain confused notion of maintaining law and order: so, as he shambled about, he delivered himself as follows: \u201cWell, George, I s\u2019pose you\u2019re running away--leaving your lawful master, George--(I don\u2019t wonder at it)--at the same time, I\u2019m sorry, George,--yes, decidedly--I think I must say that, George--it\u2019s my duty to tell you so.\u201d \u201cWhy are you sorry, sir?\u201d said George, calmly.", " Where is your wife, George?\u201d he added, as he nervously rose, and began walking the room. \u201cGone, sir gone, with her child in her arms, the Lord only knows where;--gone after the north star; and when we ever meet, or whether we meet at all in this world, no creature can tell.\u201d \u201cIs it possible! astonishing! from such a kind family?\u201d \u201cKind families get in debt, and the laws of _our_ country allow them to sell the child out of its mother\u2019s bosom to pay its master\u2019s debts,\u201d said George, bitterly. \u201cWell, well,\u201d said the honest old man, fumbling in his pocket: \u201cI s\u2019pose, perhaps, I an\u2019t following my judgment,--hang it, I _won\u2019t_ follow my judgment!\u201d he added, suddenly; \u201cso here, George,\u201d and, taking out a roll of bills from his pocket-book, he offered them to George. \u201cNo, my kind, good sir!\u201d said George, \u201cyou\u2019ve done a great deal for me, and this might get you into trouble. I have money enough, I hope, to take me as far as I need it.\u201d \u201cNo; but you must, George. Money is a great help everywhere;--can\u2019t have too much, if you get it honestly. Take it,--_do_ take it, _now_,--do, my boy!\u201d \u201cOn condition, sir, that I may repay it at some future time, I will,\u201d said George, taking up the money. \u201cAnd now, George, how long are you going to travel in this way?--not long or far, I hope. It\u2019s well carried on, but too bold. And this black fellow,--who is he?\u201d \u201cA true fellow, who went to Canada more than a year ago."], "What circumstance does Simon Legree claim will protect him from trial for Tom's murder?": [" Fixing his keen dark eyes on Legree, he simply said, pointing to the dead, \u201cYou have got all you ever can of him. What shall I pay you for the body? I will take it away, and bury it decently.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t sell dead niggers,\u201d said Legree, doggedly. \u201cYou are welcome to bury him where and when you like.\u201d \u201cBoys,\u201d said George, in an authoritative tone, to two or three negroes, who were looking at the body, \u201chelp me lift him up, and carry him to my wagon; and get me a spade.\u201d One of them ran for a spade; the other two assisted George to carry the body to the wagon. George neither spoke to nor looked at Legree, who did not countermand his orders, but stood, whistling, with an air of forced unconcern. He sulkily followed them to where the wagon stood at the door. George spread his cloak in the wagon, and had the body carefully disposed of in it,--moving the seat, so as to give it room. Then he turned, fixed his eyes on Legree, and said, with forced composure, \u201cI have not, as yet, said to you what I think of this most atrocious affair;--this is not the time and place. But, sir, this innocent blood shall have justice. I will proclaim this murder. I will go to the very first magistrate, and expose you.\u201d \u201cDo!\u201d said Legree, snapping his fingers, scornfully. \u201cI\u2019d like to see you doing it. Where you going to get witnesses?--how you going to prove it?--Come, now!\u201d George saw, at once, the force of this defiance.", " \u201cI\u2019ll have this yer thing examined. I\u2019ll look into it, this very night. I\u2019ll take my pistols--\u201d \u201cDo,\u201d said Cassy; \u201csleep in that room. I\u2019d like to see you doing it. Fire your pistols,--do!\u201d Legree stamped his foot, and swore violently. \u201cDon\u2019t swear,\u201d said Cassy; \u201cnobody knows who may be hearing you. Hark! What was that?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d said Legree, starting. A heavy old Dutch clock, that stood in the corner of the room, began, and slowly struck twelve. For some reason or other, Legree neither spoke nor moved; a vague horror fell on him; while Cassy, with a keen, sneering glitter in her eyes, stood looking at him, counting the strokes. \u201cTwelve o\u2019clock; well _now_ we\u2019ll see,\u201d said she, turning, and opening the door into the passage-way, and standing as if listening. \u201cHark!

Hark!\u201d A wild shriek came pealing down the stairway. It came from the garret. Legree\u2019s knees knocked together; his face grew white with fear. \u201cHadn\u2019t you better get your pistols?\u201d said Cassy, with a sneer that froze Legree\u2019s blood. \u201cIt\u2019s time this thing was looked into, you know. I\u2019d like to have you go up now; _they\u2019re at it_.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t go!\u201d said Legree, with an oath.", " And, therefore, without shuddering or trembling, he heard the voice of his persecutor, as he drew near. \u201cWell, my boy,\u201d said Legree, with a contemptuous kick, \u201chow do you find yourself? Didn\u2019t I tell yer I could larn yer a thing or two? How do yer like it--eh? How did yer whaling agree with yer, Tom? An\u2019t quite so crank as ye was last night. Ye couldn\u2019t treat a poor sinner, now, to a bit of sermon, could ye,--eh?\u201d Tom answered nothing. \u201cGet up, you beast!\u201d said Legree, kicking him again. This was a difficult matter for one so bruised and faint; and, as Tom made efforts to do so, Legree laughed brutally. \u201cWhat makes ye so spry, this morning, Tom? Cotched cold, may be, last night.\u201d Tom by this time had gained his feet, and was confronting his master with a steady, unmoved front. \u201cThe devil, you can!\u201d said Legree, looking him over. \u201cI believe you haven\u2019t got enough yet. Now, Tom, get right down on yer knees and beg my pardon, for yer shines last night.\u201d Tom did not move. \u201cDown, you dog!\u201d said Legree, striking him with his riding-whip. \u201cMas\u2019r Legree,\u201d said Tom, \u201cI can\u2019t do it. I did only what I thought was right. I shall do just so again, if ever the time comes. I never will do a cruel thing, come what may.\u201d \u201cYes, but ye don\u2019t know what may come, Master Tom. Ye think what you\u2019ve got is something. I tell you \u2019tan\u2019t anything,--nothing \u2019t all.

Gradually, the staircase that led to the garret, and even the passage-way to the staircase, were avoided by every one in the house, from every one fearing to speak of it, and the legend was gradually falling into desuetude. It had suddenly occurred to Cassy to make use of the superstitious excitability, which was so great in Legree, for the purpose of her liberation, and that of her fellow-sufferer. The sleeping-room of Cassy was directly under the garret. One day, without consulting Legree, she suddenly took it upon her, with some considerable ostentation, to change all the furniture and appurtenances of the room to one at some considerable distance. The under-servants, who were called on to effect this movement, were running and bustling about with great zeal and confusion, when Legree returned from a ride. \u201cHallo! you Cass!\u201d said Legree, \u201cwhat\u2019s in the wind now?\u201d \u201cNothing; only I choose to have another room,\u201d said Cassy, doggedly. \u201cAnd what for, pray?\u201d said Legree. \u201cI choose to,\u201d said Cassy. \u201cThe devil you do! and what for?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to get some sleep, now and then.\u201d \u201cSleep! well, what hinders your sleeping?\u201d \u201cI could tell, I suppose, if you want to hear,\u201d said Cassy, dryly. \u201cSpeak out, you minx!\u201d said Legree. \u201cO! nothing.

It was late in the summer afternoon, and the doors and windows of the large parlor all stood open, to invite any stray breeze, that might feel in a good humor, to enter. Mr. Shelby sat in a large hall opening into the room, and running through the whole length of the house, to a balcony on either end. Leisurely tipped back on one chair, with his heels in another, he was enjoying his after-dinner cigar. Mrs. Shelby sat in the door, busy about some fine sewing; she seemed like one who had something on her mind, which she was seeking an opportunity to introduce. \u201cDo you know,\u201d she said, \u201cthat Chloe has had a letter from Tom?\u201d \u201cAh! has she?
