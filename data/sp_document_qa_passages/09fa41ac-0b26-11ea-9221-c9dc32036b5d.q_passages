All through the wheat season, she told us, Ambrosch hired his sister out like a man, and she went from farm to farm, binding sheaves or working with the threshers. The farmers liked her and were kind to her; said they would rather have her for a hand than Ambrosch. When fall came she was to husk corn for the neighbours until Christmas, as she had done the year before; but grandmother saved her from this by getting her a place to work with our neighbours, the Harlings. II GRANDMOTHER OFTEN SAID THAT if she had to live in town, she thanked God she lived next the Harlings. They had been farming people, like ourselves, and their place was like a little farm, with a big barn and a garden, and an orchard and grazing lots--even a windmill.", " She is going to teach me to sew.

But I wouldn\u2019t run down the farm, if I were you,\u2019 said Mrs. Harling rather severely. \u2018How is your mother?\u2019 \u2018Oh, mother\u2019s never very well; she has too much to do. She\u2019d get away from the farm, too, if she could. She was willing for me to come. After I learn to do sewing, I can make money and help her.\u2019 \u2018See that you don\u2019t forget to,\u2019 said Mrs. Harling sceptically, as she took up her crocheting again and sent the hook in and out with nimble fingers. \u2018No, \u2018m, I won\u2019t,\u2019 said Lena blandly. She took a few grains of the popcorn we pressed upon her, eating them discreetly and taking care not to get her fingers sticky.

It was impossible not to admire his frank, manly faith. \u2018I am always glad to meet a young man who thinks seriously about these things,\u2019 said grandfather, \u2018and I would never be the one to say you were not in God\u2019s care when you were among the soldiers.\u2019 After dinner it was decided that young Jelinek should hook our two strong black farm-horses to the scraper and break a road through to the Shimerdas\u2019, so that a wagon could go when it was necessary. Fuchs, who was the only cabinetmaker in the neighbourhood was set to work on a coffin. Jelinek put on his long wolfskin coat, and when we admired it, he told us that he had shot and skinned the coyotes, and the young man who \u2018batched\u2019 with him, Jan Bouska, who had been a fur-worker in Vienna, made the coat.", " Anna knew the whisper was going about that I was a sly one. People said there must be something queer about a boy who showed no interest in girls of his own age, but who could be lively enough when he was with Tony and Lena or the three Marys. The enthusiasm for the dance, which the Vannis had kindled, did not at once die out. After the tent left town, the Euchre Club became the Owl Club, and gave dances in the Masonic Hall once a week. I was invited to join, but declined. I was moody and restless that winter, and tired of the people I saw every day. Charley Harling was already at Annapolis, while I was still sitting in Black Hawk, answering to my name at roll-call every morning, rising from my desk at the sound of a bell and marching out like the grammar-school children.

Pavel was very bad, he said, and wanted to talk to Mr. Shimerda and his daughter; he had come to fetch them. When Antonia and her father got into the wagon, I entreated grandmother to let me go with them: I would gladly go without my supper, I would sleep in the Shimerdas\u2019 barn and run home in the morning. My plan must have seemed very foolish to her, but she was often large-minded about humouring the desires of other people. She asked Peter to wait a moment, and when she came back from the kitchen she brought a bag of sandwiches and doughnuts for us. Mr. Shimerda and Peter were on the front seat; Antonia and I sat in the straw behind and ate our lunch as we bumped along. After the sun sank, a cold wind sprang up and moaned over the prairie.

Jake paid his fine with a ten-dollar bill grandfather had given him for that purpose. But when the Shimerdas found that Jake sold his pig in town that day, Ambrosch worked it out in his shrewd head that Jake had to sell his pig to pay his fine. This theory afforded the Shimerdas great satisfaction, apparently. For weeks afterward, whenever Jake and I met Antonia on her way to the post-office, or going along the road with her work-team, she would clap her hands and call to us in a spiteful, crowing voice: \u2018Jake-y, Jake-y, sell the pig and pay the slap!\u2019 Otto pretended not to be surprised at Antonia\u2019s behaviour.

She cornered Ambrosch the next time he came to town, and pointed out to him that any connection with Christian Harling would strengthen his credit and be of advantage to him. One Sunday Mrs. Harling took the long ride out to the Shimerdas\u2019 with Frances. She said she wanted to see \u2018what the girl came from\u2019 and to have a clear understanding with her mother. I was in our yard when they came driving home, just before sunset. They laughed and waved to me as they passed, and I could see they were in great good humour.

Grandmother thought Antonia needed shoes more than Mr. Shimerda needed prayers, but grandfather said tolerantly, \u2018If he can spare six dollars, pinched as he is, it shows he believes what he professes.\u2019 It was grandfather who brought about a reconciliation with the Shimerdas.

We were to move to Black Hawk in March, and as soon as grandfather had fixed the date he let Jake and Otto know of his intention.

We did our best to dissuade Jake. He was so handicapped by illiteracy and by his trusting disposition that he would be an easy prey to sharpers.

Our instructors were oddly assorted; wandering pioneer school-teachers, stranded ministers of the Gospel, a few enthusiastic young men just out of graduate schools. There was an atmosphere of endeavour, of expectancy and bright hopefulness about the young college that had lifted its head from the prairie only a few years before. Our personal life was as free as that of our instructors. There were no college dormitories; we lived where we could and as we could. I took rooms with an old couple, early settlers in Lincoln, who had married off their children and now lived quietly in their house at the edge of town, near the open country. The house was inconveniently situated for students, and on that account I got two rooms for the price of one.", " He paid no heed to my remark, but began to do rapid finger-exercises on his shirt-sleeves, as he stood with tightly folded arms. \u2018Kindness of heart,\u2019 he went on, staring at the ceiling, \u2018sentiment, are not understood in a place like this.

He heard them get up from the piano, talk a little while, and then leave the room. He heard the door close after them. He crept up to the front windows and stuck his head in: there was no one there. He could always detect the presence of anyone in a room. He put one foot over the window-sill and straddled it. His mother had told him over and over how his master would give him to the big mastiff if he ever found him \u2018meddling.\u2019 Samson had got too near the mastiff\u2019s kennel once, and had felt his terrible breath in his face.

She\u2019s the only person I know who never gets any older. It\u2019s fine for me to have her there; somebody who enjoys things like that. She keeps an eye on me and won\u2019t let me be shabby.

They contemplated the photographs with pleased recognition; looked at some admiringly, as if these characters in their mother\u2019s girlhood had been remarkable people. The little children, who could not speak English, murmured comments to each other in their rich old language. Antonia held out a photograph of Lena that had come from San Francisco last Christmas. \u2018Does she still look like that? She hasn\u2019t been home for six years now.\u2019 Yes, it was exactly like Lena, I told her; a comely woman, a trifle too plump, in a hat a trifle too large, but with the old lazy eyes, and the old dimpled ingenuousness still lurking at the corners of her mouth. There was a picture of Frances Harling in a befrogged riding costume that I remembered well. \u2018Isn\u2019t she fine!\u2019 the girls murmured. They all assented. One could see that Frances had come down as a heroine in the family legend.", " Perhaps it was cowardice that kept me away so long. My business took me West several times every year, and it was always in the back of my mind that I would stop in Nebraska some day and go to see Antonia. But I kept putting it off until the next trip. I did not want to find her aged and broken; I really dreaded it. In the course of twenty crowded years one parts with many illusions. I did not wish to lose the early ones. Some memories are realities, and are better than anything that can ever happen to one again. I owe it to Lena Lingard that I went to see Antonia at last. I was in San Francisco two summers ago when both Lena and Tiny Soderball were in town. Tiny lives in a house of her own, and Lena\u2019s shop is in an apartment house just around the corner. It interested me, after so many years, to see the two women together. Tiny audits Lena\u2019s accounts occasionally, and invests her money for her; and Lena, apparently, takes care that Tiny doesn\u2019t grow too miserly.", " Tiny sold her hotel, invested half her money in Dawson building lots, and with the rest she developed her claim. She went off into the wilds and lived on the claim. She bought other claims from discouraged miners, traded or sold them on percentages. After nearly ten years in the Klondike, Tiny returned, with a considerable fortune, to live in San Francisco. I met her in Salt Lake City in 1908. She was a thin, hard-faced woman, very well-dressed, very reserved in manner. Curiously enough, she reminded me of Mrs. Gardener, for whom she had worked in Black Hawk so long ago. She told me about some of the desperate chances she had taken in the gold country, but the thrill of them was quite gone. She said frankly that nothing interested her much now but making money. The only two human beings of whom she spoke with any feeling were the Swede, Johnson, who had given her his claim, and Lena Lingard."], "To whom does \u00c1ntoniafirst become engaged?": [" She works for Mrs. Gardener at the hotel now. She\u2019s housekeeper. Mrs. Gardener\u2019s health isn\u2019t what it was, and she can\u2019t see after everything like she used to. She has great confidence in Tony. Tony\u2019s made it up with the Harlings, too. Little Nina is so fond of her that Mrs. Harling kind of overlooked things.\u2019 \u2018Is she still going with Larry Donovan?\u2019 \u2018Oh, that\u2019s on, worse than ever! I guess they\u2019re engaged. Tony talks about him like he was president of the railroad. Everybody laughs about it, because she was never a girl to be soft. She won\u2019t hear a word against him. She\u2019s so sort of innocent.\u2019 I said I didn\u2019t like Larry, and never would. Lena\u2019s face dimpled. \u2018Some of us could tell her things, but it wouldn\u2019t do any good. She\u2019d always believe him. That\u2019s Antonia\u2019s failing, you know; if she once likes people, she won\u2019t hear anything against them.\u2019 \u2018I think I\u2019d better go home and look after Antonia,\u2019 I said.", " But he always loved her like she was his own.\u2019 \u2018I didn\u2019t even know Martha wasn\u2019t my full sister until after she was engaged to Joe,\u2019 Anna told me. Toward the middle of the afternoon, the wagon drove in, with the father and the eldest son. I was smoking in the orchard, and as I went out to meet them, Antonia came running down from the house and hugged the two men as if they had been away for months. \u2018Papa,\u2019 interested me, from my first glimpse of him. He was shorter than his older sons; a crumpled little man, with run-over boot-heels, and he carried one shoulder higher than the other. But he moved very quickly, and there was an air of jaunty liveliness about him. He had a strong, ruddy colour, thick black hair, a little grizzled, a curly moustache, and red lips. His smile showed the strong teeth of which his wife was so proud, and as he saw me his lively, quizzical eyes told me that he knew all about me.", " From the windmill I watched Jelinek come out of the barn with the blacks, and work his way up the hillside toward the cornfield. Sometimes he was completely hidden by the clouds of snow that rose about him; then he and the horses would emerge black and shining. Our heavy carpenter\u2019s bench had to be brought from the barn and carried down into the kitchen. Fuchs selected boards from a pile of planks grandfather had hauled out from town in the fall to make a new floor for the oats-bin. When at last the lumber and tools were assembled, and the doors were closed again and the cold draughts shut out, grandfather rode away to meet the coroner at the Shimerdas\u2019, and Fuchs took off his coat and settled down to work. I sat on his worktable and watched him. He did not touch his tools at first, but figured for a long while on a piece of paper, and measured the planks and made marks on them. While he was thus engaged, he whistled softly to himself, or teasingly pulled at his half-ear.", " He was six foot two, and had a chest like a young blacksmith. \u2018We went to the big dance in the hall behind the saloon last night, mother, and I danced with all the girls, and so did father. I never saw so many pretty girls. It was a Bohunk crowd, for sure. We didn\u2019t hear a word of English on the street, except from the show people, did we, papa?\u2019 Cuzak nodded. \u2018And very many send word to you, Antonia. You will excuse\u2019--turning to me--\u2018if I tell her.\u2019 While we walked toward the house he related incidents and delivered messages in the tongue he spoke fluently, and I dropped a little behind, curious to know what their relations had become--or remained. The two seemed to be on terms of easy friendliness, touched with humour. Clearly, she was the impulse, and he the corrective. As they went up the hill he kept glancing at her sidewise, to see whether she got his point, or how she received it."], "Where does \u00c1ntoniawork after leaving the Harlings?": [" If we ran out and questioned him as he was slipping through the yard, he would merely work his shoulders about in his coat and say, \u2018They all right, I guess.\u2019 Mrs. Steavens, who now lived on our farm, grew as fond of Antonia as we had been, and always brought us news of her. All through the wheat season, she told us, Ambrosch hired his sister out like a man, and she went from farm to farm, binding sheaves or working with the threshers. The farmers liked her and were kind to her; said they would rather have her for a hand than Ambrosch. When fall came she was to husk corn for the neighbours until Christmas, as she had done the year before; but grandmother saved her from this by getting her a place to work with our neighbours, the Harlings. II GRANDMOTHER OFTEN SAID THAT if she had to live in town, she thanked God she lived next the Harlings. They had been farming people, like ourselves, and their place was like a little farm, with a big barn and a garden, and an orchard and grazing lots--even a windmill.", " They ridiculed conceited people and were quick to help unfortunate ones. Deep down in each of them there was a kind of hearty joviality, a relish of life, not over-delicate, but very invigorating. I never tried to define it, but I was distinctly conscious of it. I could not imagine Antonia\u2019s living for a week in any other house in Black Hawk than the Harlings\u2019. VII WINTER LIES TOO LONG in country towns; hangs on until it is stale and shabby, old and sullen. On the farm the weather was the great fact, and men\u2019s affairs went on underneath it, as the streams creep under the ice. But in Black Hawk the scene of human life was spread out shrunken and pinched, frozen down to the bare stalk. Through January and February I went to the river with the Harlings on clear nights, and we skated up to the big island and made bonfires on the frozen sand. But by March the ice was rough and choppy, and the snow on the river bluffs was grey and mournful-looking.", " Presently she drew on her cotton gloves. \u2018I guess I must be leaving,\u2019 she said irresolutely. Frances told her to come again, whenever she was lonesome or wanted advice about anything. Lena replied that she didn\u2019t believe she would ever get lonesome in Black Hawk. She lingered at the kitchen door and begged Antonia to come and see her often. \u2018I\u2019ve got a room of my own at Mrs. Thomas\u2019s, with a carpet.\u2019 Tony shuffled uneasily in her cloth slippers. \u2018I\u2019ll come sometime, but Mrs. Harling don\u2019t like to have me run much,\u2019 she said evasively. \u2018You can do what you please when you go out, can\u2019t you?\u2019 Lena asked in a guarded whisper. \u2018Ain\u2019t you crazy about town, Tony? I don\u2019t care what anybody says, I\u2019m done with the farm!\u2019 She glanced back over her shoulder toward the dining-room, where Mrs. Harling sat. When Lena was gone, Frances asked Antonia why she hadn\u2019t been a little more cordial to her. \u2018I didn\u2019t know if your mother would like her coming here,\u2019 said Antonia, looking troubled.", " When the smoky clouds hung low in the west and the red sun went down behind them, leaving a pink flush on the snowy roofs and the blue drifts, then the wind sprang up afresh, with a kind of bitter song, as if it said: \u2018This is reality, whether you like it or not. All those frivolities of summer, the light and shadow, the living mask of green that trembled over everything, they were lies, and this is what was underneath. This is the truth.\u2019 It was as if we were being punished for loving the loveliness of summer. If I loitered on the playground after school, or went to the post-office for the mail and lingered to hear the gossip about the cigar-stand, it would be growing dark by the time I came home. The sun was gone; the frozen streets stretched long and blue before me; the lights were shining pale in kitchen windows, and I could smell the suppers cooking as I passed. Few people were abroad, and each one of them was hurrying toward a fire."], "To whom doesJim dedicate his commencement oration?": [" \u2018Mama is as broad-minded as mothers ever are, I guess. But you know she was hurt about Antonia, and she can\u2019t understand why you like to be with Tiny and Lena better than with the girls of your own set.\u2019 \u2018Can you?\u2019 I asked bluntly. Frances laughed. \u2018Yes, I think I can. You knew them in the country, and you like to take sides. In some ways you\u2019re older than boys of your age. It will be all right with mama after you pass your college examinations and she sees you\u2019re in earnest.\u2019 \u2018If you were a boy,\u2019 I persisted, \u2018you wouldn\u2019t belong to the Owl Club, either. You\u2019d be just like me.\u2019 She shook her head. \u2018I would and I wouldn\u2019t. I expect I know the country girls better than you do. You always put a kind of glamour over them. The trouble with you, Jim, is that you\u2019re romantic. Mama\u2019s going to your Commencement. She asked me the other day if I knew what your oration is to be about. She wants you to do well.\u2019 I thought my oration very good.", " I have had no other success that pulled at my heartstrings like that one. XIV THE DAY AFTER COMMENCEMENT I moved my books and desk upstairs, to an empty room where I should be undisturbed, and I fell to studying in earnest. I worked off a year\u2019s trigonometry that summer, and began Virgil alone. Morning after morning I used to pace up and down my sunny little room, looking off at the distant river bluffs and the roll of the blond pastures between, scanning the \u2018Aeneid\u2019 aloud and committing long passages to memory. Sometimes in the evening Mrs. Harling called to me as I passed her gate, and asked me to come in and let her play for me. She was lonely for Charley, she said, and liked to have a boy about. Whenever my grandparents had misgivings, and began to wonder whether I was not too young to go off to college alone, Mrs. Harling took up my cause vigorously. Grandfather had such respect for her judgment that I knew he would not go against her.", " One knew at a glance how it was with her. When Armand, with the terrible words, \u2018Look, all of you, I owe this woman nothing!\u2019 flung the gold and bank-notes at the half-swooning Marguerite, Lena cowered beside me and covered her face with her hands. The curtain rose on the bedroom scene. By this time there wasn\u2019t a nerve in me that hadn\u2019t been twisted. Nanine alone could have made me cry. I loved Nanine tenderly; and Gaston, how one clung to that good fellow! The New Year\u2019s presents were not too much; nothing could be too much now. I wept unrestrainedly. Even the handkerchief in my breast-pocket, worn for elegance and not at all for use, was wet through by the time that moribund woman sank for the last time into the arms of her lover. When we reached the door of the theatre, the streets were shining with rain. I had prudently brought along Mrs. Harling\u2019s useful Commencement present, and I took Lena home under its shelter.", " It stated with fervour a great many things I had lately discovered. Mrs. Harling came to the Opera House to hear the Commencement exercises, and I looked at her most of the time while I made my speech. Her keen, intelligent eyes never left my face. Afterward she came back to the dressing-room where we stood, with our diplomas in our hands, walked up to me, and said heartily: \u2018You surprised me, Jim. I didn\u2019t believe you could do as well as that. You didn\u2019t get that speech out of books.\u2019 Among my graduation presents there was a silk umbrella from Mrs. Harling, with my name on the handle. I walked home from the Opera House alone. As I passed the Methodist Church, I saw three white figures ahead of me, pacing up and down under the arching maple trees, where the moonlight filtered through the lush June foliage. They hurried toward me; they were waiting for me--Lena and Tony and Anna Hansen. \u2018Oh, Jim, it was splendid!\u2019 Tony was breathing hard, as she always did when her feelings outran her language."], "What does Lenado in Black Hawk?": [" Yet people saw no difference between her and the three Marys; they were all Bohemians, all \u2018hired girls.\u2019 I always knew I should live long enough to see my country girls come into their own, and I have. To-day the best that a harassed Black Hawk merchant can hope for is to sell provisions and farm machinery and automobiles to the rich farms where that first crop of stalwart Bohemian and Scandinavian girls are now the mistresses. The Black Hawk boys looked forward to marrying Black Hawk girls, and living in a brand-new little house with best chairs that must not be sat upon, and hand-painted china that must not be used. But sometimes a young fellow would look up from his ledger, or out through the grating of his father\u2019s bank, and let his eyes follow Lena Lingard, as she passed the window with her slow, undulating walk, or Tiny Soderball, tripping by in her short skirt and striped stockings.", " \u2018I like your grandmother, and all things here,\u2019 she sighed. \u2018I wish my papa live to see this summer. I wish no winter ever come again.\u2019 \u2018It will be summer a long while yet,\u2019 I reassured her. \u2018Why aren\u2019t you always nice like this, Tony?\u2019 \u2018How nice?\u2019 \u2018Why, just like this; like yourself. Why do you all the time try to be like Ambrosch?\u2019 She put her arms under her head and lay back, looking up at the sky. \u2018If I live here, like you, that is different. Things will be easy for you. But they will be hard for us.\u2019 BOOK II. The Hired Girls I I HAD BEEN LIVING with my grandfather for nearly three years when he decided to move to Black Hawk. He and grandmother were getting old for the heavy work of a farm, and as I was now thirteen they thought I ought to be going to school. Accordingly our homestead was rented to \u2018that good woman, the Widow Steavens,\u2019 and her bachelor brother, and we bought Preacher White\u2019s house, at the north end of Black Hawk.", " They was blown up there by gunshot, no question.\u2019 Grandmother told grandfather she meant to go over to the Shimerdas\u2019 with him. \u2018There is nothing you can do,\u2019 he said doubtfully. \u2018The body can\u2019t be touched until we get the coroner here from Black Hawk, and that will be a matter of several days, this weather.\u2019 \u2018Well, I can take them some victuals, anyway, and say a word of comfort to them poor little girls. The oldest one was his darling, and was like a right hand to him. He might have thought of her. He\u2019s left her alone in a hard world.\u2019 She glanced distrustfully at Ambrosch, who was now eating his breakfast at the kitchen table. Fuchs, although he had been up in the cold nearly all night, was going to make the long ride to Black Hawk to fetch the priest and the coroner. On the grey gelding, our best horse, he would try to pick his way across the country with no roads to guide him. \u2018Don\u2019t you worry about me, Mrs. Burden,\u2019 he said cheerfully, as he put on a second pair of socks.", " But the younger brothers and sisters, for whom they made such sacrifices and who have had \u2018advantages,\u2019 never seem to me, when I meet them now, half as interesting or as well educated. The older girls, who helped to break up the wild sod, learned so much from life, from poverty, from their mothers and grandmothers; they had all, like Antonia, been early awakened and made observant by coming at a tender age from an old country to a new. I can remember a score of these country girls who were in service in Black Hawk during the few years I lived there, and I can remember something unusual and engaging about each of them. Physically they were almost a race apart, and out-of-door work had given them a vigour which, when they got over their first shyness on coming to town, developed into a positive carriage and freedom of movement, and made them conspicuous among Black Hawk women. That was before the day of high-school athletics."], "Who plays thepiano at the Boys' Home dance?": [" There were never girls enough to go round at those dances, but everyone wanted a turn with Tony and Lena. Lena moved without exertion, rather indolently, and her hand often accented the rhythm softly on her partner\u2019s shoulder. She smiled if one spoke to her, but seldom answered. The music seemed to put her into a soft, waking dream, and her violet-coloured eyes looked sleepily and confidingly at one from under her long lashes. When she sighed she exhaled a heavy perfume of sachet powder. To dance \u2018Home, Sweet Home,\u2019 with Lena was like coming in with the tide. She danced every dance like a waltz, and it was always the same waltz--the waltz of coming home to something, of inevitable, fated return. After a while one got restless under it, as one does under the heat of a soft, sultry summer day. When you spun out into the floor with Tony, you didn\u2019t return to anything. You set out every time upon a new adventure.", " \u2018My papa sad for the old country. He not look good. He never make music any more. At home he play violin all the time; for weddings and for dance. Here never. When I beg him for play, he shake his head no. Some days he take his violin out of his box and make with his fingers on the strings, like this, but never he make the music. He don\u2019t like this kawntree.\u2019 \u2018People who don\u2019t like this country ought to stay at home,\u2019 I said severely. \u2018We don\u2019t make them come here.\u2019 \u2018He not want to come, never!\u2019 she burst out. \u2018My mamenka make him come. All the time she say: \u201cAmerica big country; much money, much land for my boys, much husband for my girls.\u201d My papa, he cry for leave his old friends what make music with him. He love very much the man what play the long horn like this\u2019--she indicated a slide trombone. \u201cThey go to school together and are friends from boys. But my mama, she want Ambrosch for be rich, with many cattle.\u201d\u2019 \u2018Your mama,\u2019 I said angrily, \u2018wants other people\u2019s things.\u2019 \u201cYour grandfather is rich,\u201d she retorted fiercely.", " Some ragged little boys from the depot sold pop and iced lemonade under a white umbrella at the corner, and made faces at the spruce youngsters who came to dance. That vacant lot soon became the most cheerful place in town. Even on the hottest afternoons the cottonwoods made a rustling shade, and the air smelled of popcorn and melted butter, and Bouncing Bets wilting in the sun. Those hardy flowers had run away from the laundryman\u2019s garden, and the grass in the middle of the lot was pink with them. The Vannis kept exemplary order, and closed every evening at the hour suggested by the city council. When Mrs. Vanni gave the signal, and the harp struck up \u2018Home, Sweet Home,\u2019 all Black Hawk knew it was ten o\u2019clock. You could set your watch by that tune as confidently as by the roundhouse whistle. At last there was something to do in those long, empty summer evenings, when the married people sat like images on their front porches, and the boys and girls tramped and tramped the board sidewalks--northward to the edge of the open prairie, south to the depot, then back again to the post-office, the ice-cream parlour, the butcher shop.", " Another is that I do not like his wife. When Jim was still an obscure young lawyer, struggling to make his way in New York, his career was suddenly advanced by a brilliant marriage. Genevieve Whitney was the only daughter of a distinguished man. Her marriage with young Burden was the subject of sharp comment at the time. It was said she had been brutally jilted by her cousin, Rutland Whitney, and that she married this unknown man from the West out of bravado. She was a restless, headstrong girl, even then, who liked to astonish her friends. Later, when I knew her, she was always doing something unexpected. She gave one of her town houses for a Suffrage headquarters, produced one of her own plays at the Princess Theater, was arrested for picketing during a garment-makers\u2019 strike, etc. I am never able to believe that she has much feeling for the causes to which she lends her name and her fleeting interest."], "Who begins thedancing in Black Hawk?": [" Yet people saw no difference between her and the three Marys; they were all Bohemians, all \u2018hired girls.\u2019 I always knew I should live long enough to see my country girls come into their own, and I have.

I don\u2019t want that Jake get more done in one day than me. I want we have very much corn this fall.\u2019 While the horses drew in the water, and nosed each other, and then drank again, Antonia sat down on the windmill step and rested her head on her hand. \u2018You see the big prairie fire from your place last night? I hope your grandpa ain\u2019t lose no stacks?\u2019 \u2018No, we didn\u2019t. I came to ask you something, Tony. Grandmother wants to know if you can\u2019t go to the term of school that begins next week over at the sod schoolhouse. She says there\u2019s a good teacher, and you\u2019d learn a lot.\u2019 Antonia stood up, lifting and dropping her shoulders as if they were stiff. \u2018I ain\u2019t got time to learn. I can work like mans now. My mother can\u2019t say no more how Ambrosch do all and nobody to help him. I can work as much as him. School is all right for little boys. I help make this land one good farm.\u2019 She clucked to her team and started for the barn.", " One day it was just awful hot. When we got back to the field from dinner, we took things kind of easy. The men put in the horses and got the machine going, and Ole Iverson was up on the deck, cutting bands. I was sitting against a straw-stack, trying to get some shade. My wagon wasn\u2019t going out first, and somehow I felt the heat awful that day. The sun was so hot like it was going to burn the world up. After a while I see a man coming across the stubble, and when he got close I see it was a tramp. His toes stuck out of his shoes, and he hadn\u2019t shaved for a long while, and his eyes was awful red and wild, like he had some sickness.

How come you to have a weepon?\u2019 \u2018We\u2019d been up to Russian Peter\u2019s, to borrow a spade for Ambrosch.\u2019 Otto shook the ashes out of his pipe and squatted down to count the rattles. \u2018It was just luck you had a tool,\u2019 he said cautiously. \u2018Gosh! I wouldn\u2019t want to do any business with that fellow myself, unless I had a fence-post along. Your grandmother\u2019s snake-cane wouldn\u2019t more than tickle him.

I didn\u2019t make any.\u201d He drank his tea all at once and put down the cup. \u201cI didn\u2019t arrange or rearrange.

But we have no sickness, we have no fear, because we carry that blood and that body of Christ, and it preserve us.\u2019 He paused, looking at grandfather. \u2018That I know, Mr. Burden, for it happened to myself. All the soldiers know, too. When we walk along the road, the old priest and me, we meet all the time soldiers marching and officers on horse. All those officers, when they see what I carry under the cloth, pull up their horses and kneel down on the ground in the road until we pass.", " Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim. If you\u2019re going to be a preacher, I want you to marry me. You must promise to marry us all, and then baptize the babies.\u2019 Norwegian Anna, always dignified, looked at her reprovingly. \u2018Baptists don\u2019t believe in christening babies, do they, Jim?\u2019 I told her I didn\u2019t know what they believed, and didn\u2019t care, and that I certainly wasn\u2019t going to be a preacher. \u2018That\u2019s too bad,\u2019 Tiny simpered. She was in a teasing mood. \u2018You\u2019d make such a good one. You\u2019re so studious. Maybe you\u2019d like to be a professor. You used to teach Tony, didn\u2019t you?\u2019 Antonia broke in. \u2018I\u2019ve set my heart on Jim being a doctor. You\u2019d be good with sick people, Jim.

I used to think I\u2019d like to be your first sweetheart. You were such a funny kid!\u2019 She always kissed one as if she were sadly and wisely sending one away forever. We said many good-byes before I left Lincoln, but she never tried to hinder me or hold me back. \u2018You are going, but you haven\u2019t gone yet, have you?\u2019 she used to say. My Lincoln chapter closed abruptly. I went home to my grandparents for a few weeks, and afterward visited my relatives in Virginia until I joined Cleric in Boston. I was then nineteen years old. BOOK IV. The Pioneer Woman\u2019s Story I TWO YEARS AFTER I left Lincoln, I completed my academic course at Harvard. Before I entered the Law School I went home for the summer vacation. On the night of my arrival, Mrs. Harling and Frances and Sally came over to greet me.", " Before I had got far with my reading, I was disturbed by a knock. I hurried to the door and when I opened it saw a woman standing in the dark hall. \u2018I expect you hardly know me, Jim.\u2019 The voice seemed familiar, but I did not recognize her until she stepped into the light of my doorway and I beheld--Lena Lingard! She was so quietly conventionalized by city clothes that I might have passed her on the street without seeing her. Her black suit fitted her figure smoothly, and a black lace hat, with pale-blue forget-me-nots, sat demurely on her yellow hair. I led her toward Cleric\u2019s chair, the only comfortable one I had, questioning her confusedly. She was not disconcerted by my embarrassment. She looked about her with the naive curiosity I remembered so well. \u2018You are quite comfortable here, aren\u2019t you? I live in Lincoln now, too, Jim. I\u2019m in business for myself. I have a dressmaking shop in the Raleigh Block, out on O Street.", " When I took my entrance examinations, he was my examiner, and my course was arranged under his supervision. I did not go home for my first summer vacation, but stayed in Lincoln, working off a year\u2019s Greek, which had been my only condition on entering the freshman class. Cleric\u2019s doctor advised against his going back to New England, and, except for a few weeks in Colorado, he, too, was in Lincoln all that summer. We played tennis, read, and took long walks together. I shall always look back on that time of mental awakening as one of the happiest in my life. Gaston Cleric introduced me to the world of ideas; when one first enters that world everything else fades for a time, and all that went before is as if it had not been. Yet I found curious survivals; some of the figures of my old life seemed to be waiting for me in the new. In those days there were many serious young men among the students who had come up to the university from the farms and the little towns scattered over the thinly settled state.", " Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim.

My business took me West several times every year, and it was always in the back of my mind that I would stop in Nebraska some day and go to see Antonia. But I kept putting it off until the next trip. I did not want to find her aged and broken; I really dreaded it. In the course of twenty crowded years one parts with many illusions. I did not wish to lose the early ones. Some memories are realities, and are better than anything that can ever happen to one again. I owe it to Lena Lingard that I went to see Antonia at last. I was in San Francisco two summers ago when both Lena and Tiny Soderball were in town. Tiny lives in a house of her own, and Lena\u2019s shop is in an apartment house just around the corner. It interested me, after so many years, to see the two women together. Tiny audits Lena\u2019s accounts occasionally, and invests her money for her; and Lena, apparently, takes care that Tiny doesn\u2019t grow too miserly.", " This revelation seemed to me inestimably precious. I clung to it as if it might suddenly vanish. As I sat down to my book at last, my old dream about Lena coming across the harvest-field in her short skirt seemed to me like the memory of an actual experience. It floated before me on the page like a picture, and underneath it stood the mournful line: \u2018Optima dies... prima fugit.\u2019 III IN LINCOLN THE BEST part of the theatrical season came late, when the good companies stopped off there for one-night stands, after their long runs in New York and Chicago. That spring Lena went with me to see Joseph Jefferson in \u2018Rip Van Winkle,\u2019 and to a war play called \u2018Shenandoah.\u2019 She was inflexible about paying for her own seat; said she was in business now, and she wouldn\u2019t have a schoolboy spending his money on her. I liked to watch a play with Lena; everything was wonderful to her, and everything was true.", " To my astonishment, grandfather replied that I might go if I wished. I was both glad and sorry on the day when the letter came. I stayed in my room all evening and thought things over. I even tried to persuade myself that I was standing in Lena\u2019s way--it is so necessary to be a little noble!--and that if she had not me to play with, she would probably marry and secure her future. The next evening I went to call on Lena. I found her propped up on the couch in her bay-window, with her foot in a big slipper. An awkward little Russian girl whom she had taken into her work-room had dropped a flat-iron on Lena\u2019s toe. On the table beside her there was a basket of early summer flowers which the Pole had left after he heard of the accident. He always managed to know what went on in Lena\u2019s apartment. Lena was telling me some amusing piece of gossip about one of her clients, when I interrupted her and picked up the flower basket.", " We had neither of us read the play, and we did not know what it was about--though I seemed to remember having heard it was a piece in which great actresses shone. \u2018The Count of Monte Cristo,\u2019 which I had seen James O\u2019Neill play that winter, was by the only Alexandre Dumas I knew. This play, I saw, was by his son, and I expected a family resemblance. A couple of jack-rabbits, run in off the prairie, could not have been more innocent of what awaited them than were Lena and I. Our excitement began with the rise of the curtain, when the moody Varville, seated before the fire, interrogated Nanine. Decidedly, there was a new tang about this dialogue. I had never heard in the theatre lines that were alive, that presupposed and took for granted, like those which passed between Varville and Marguerite in the brief encounter before her friends entered. This introduced the most brilliant, worldly, the most enchantingly gay scene I had ever looked upon."], "Where did WillaCather live before moving to Nebraska?": [" Don\u2019t you want to go ahead and see her, Jimmy? She\u2019s got the pretty brown eyes, too!\u2019 This last remark made me bashful, and I shook my head and settled down to \u2018Jesse James.\u2019 Jake nodded at me approvingly and said you were likely to get diseases from foreigners. I do not remember crossing the Missouri River, or anything about the long day\u2019s journey through Nebraska. Probably by that time I had crossed so many rivers that I was dull to them. The only thing very noticeable about Nebraska was that it was still, all day long, Nebraska. I had been sleeping, curled up in a red plush seat, for a long while when we reached Black Hawk. Jake roused me and took me by the hand. We stumbled down from the train to a wooden siding, where men were running about with lanterns. I couldn\u2019t see any town, or even distant lights; we were surrounded by utter darkness. The engine was panting heavily after its long run.", " It was a sudden transfiguration, a lifting-up of day. How many an afternoon Antonia and I have trailed along the prairie under that magnificence! And always two long black shadows flitted before us or followed after, dark spots on the ruddy grass. We had been silent a long time, and the edge of the sun sank nearer and nearer the prairie floor, when we saw a figure moving on the edge of the upland, a gun over his shoulder. He was walking slowly, dragging his feet along as if he had no purpose. We broke into a run to overtake him. \u2018My papa sick all the time,\u2019 Tony panted as we flew. \u2018He not look good, Jim.\u2019 As we neared Mr. Shimerda she shouted, and he lifted his head and peered about. Tony ran up to him, caught his hand and pressed it against her cheek. She was the only one of his family who could rouse the old man from the torpor in which he seemed to live. He took the bag from his belt and showed us three rabbits he had shot, looked at Antonia with a wintry flicker of a smile and began to tell her something.", " \u2018I like your grandmother, and all things here,\u2019 she sighed. \u2018I wish my papa live to see this summer. I wish no winter ever come again.\u2019 \u2018It will be summer a long while yet,\u2019 I reassured her. \u2018Why aren\u2019t you always nice like this, Tony?\u2019 \u2018How nice?\u2019 \u2018Why, just like this; like yourself. Why do you all the time try to be like Ambrosch?\u2019 She put her arms under her head and lay back, looking up at the sky. \u2018If I live here, like you, that is different. Things will be easy for you. But they will be hard for us.\u2019 BOOK II. The Hired Girls I I HAD BEEN LIVING with my grandfather for nearly three years when he decided to move to Black Hawk. He and grandmother were getting old for the heavy work of a farm, and as I was now thirteen they thought I ought to be going to school. Accordingly our homestead was rented to \u2018that good woman, the Widow Steavens,\u2019 and her bachelor brother, and we bought Preacher White\u2019s house, at the north end of Black Hawk.", " They talked about their school and the new teacher, told me about the crops and the harvest, and how many steers they would feed that winter. They were easy and confidential with me, as if I were an old friend of the family--and not too old. I felt like a boy in their company, and all manner of forgotten interests revived in me. It seemed, after all, so natural to be walking along a barbed-wire fence beside the sunset, toward a red pond, and to see my shadow moving along at my right, over the close-cropped grass. \u2018Has mother shown you the pictures you sent her from the old country?\u2019 Ambrosch asked. \u2018We\u2019ve had them framed and they\u2019re hung up in the parlour. She was so glad to get them. I don\u2019t believe I ever saw her so pleased about anything.\u2019 There was a note of simple gratitude in his voice that made me wish I had given more occasion for it. I put my hand on his shoulder. \u2018Your mother, you know, was very much loved by all of us."], "What is Jim'sprofession when he writes the memoir?": [" Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim.

I declare, Jim, I loved you children almost as much as I love my own. These children know all about you and Charley and Sally, like as if they\u2019d grown up with you. I can\u2019t think of what I want to say, you\u2019ve got me so stirred up. And then, I\u2019ve forgot my English so. I don\u2019t often talk it any more. I tell the children I used to speak real well.\u2019 She said they always spoke Bohemian at home. The little ones could not speak English at all--didn\u2019t learn it until they went to school. \u2018I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s you, sitting here, in my own kitchen. You wouldn\u2019t have known me, would you, Jim? You\u2019ve kept so young, yourself. But it\u2019s easier for a man. I can\u2019t see how my Anton looks any older than the day I married him. His teeth have kept so nice. I haven\u2019t got many left. But I feel just as young as I used to, and I can do as much work.", " XIII I NOTICED ONE AFTERNOON that grandmother had been crying. Her feet seemed to drag as she moved about the house, and I got up from the table where I was studying and went to her, asking if she didn\u2019t feel well, and if I couldn\u2019t help her with her work. \u2018No, thank you, Jim. I\u2019m troubled, but I guess I\u2019m well enough. Getting a little rusty in the bones, maybe,\u2019 she added bitterly. I stood hesitating. \u2018What are you fretting about, grandmother? Has grandfather lost any money?\u2019 \u2018No, it ain\u2019t money. I wish it was. But I\u2019ve heard things.

The dresser, and the great walnut wardrobe which held all my clothes, even my hats and shoes, I had pushed out of the way, and I considered them non-existent, as children eliminate incongruous objects when they are playing house. I worked at a commodious green-topped table placed directly in front of the west window which looked out over the prairie. In the corner at my right were all my books, in shelves I had made and painted myself. On the blank wall at my left the dark, old-fashioned wall-paper was covered by a large map of ancient Rome, the work of some German scholar. Cleric had ordered it for me when he was sending for books from abroad. Over the bookcase hung a photograph of the Tragic Theatre at Pompeii, which he had given me from his collection.", " Last night he take me for see, and I can understand very much talk. Nice mans, Mrs. Burden. One is fat and all the time laugh. Everybody laugh. The first time I see my papa laugh in this kawntree. Oh, very nice!\u2019 I asked her if she meant the two Russians who lived up by the big dog-town. I had often been tempted to go to see them when I was riding in that direction, but one of them was a wild-looking fellow and I was a little afraid of him. Russia seemed to me more remote than any other country--farther away than China, almost as far as the North Pole. Of all the strange, uprooted people among the first settlers, those two men were the strangest and the most aloof. Their last names were unpronounceable, so they were called Pavel and Peter. They went about making signs to people, and until the Shimerdas came they had no friends. Krajiek could understand them a little, but he had cheated them in a trade, so they avoided him."], "Who abandons\u00c1ntonia before their wedding?": [" I did not see him do it, but this I know: after all his furniture and his cookstove and pots and pans had been hauled off by the purchasers, when his house was stripped and bare, he sat down on the floor with his clasp-knife and ate all the melons that he had put away for winter. When Mr. Shimerda and Krajiek drove up in their wagon to take Peter to the train, they found him with a dripping beard, surrounded by heaps of melon rinds. The loss of his two friends had a depressing effect upon old Mr. Shimerda. When he was out hunting, he used to go into the empty log house and sit there, brooding. This cabin was his hermitage until the winter snows penned him in his cave. For Antonia and me, the story of the wedding party was never at an end. We did not tell Pavel\u2019s secret to anyone, but guarded it jealously--as if the wolves of the Ukraine had gathered that night long ago, and the wedding party been sacrificed, to give us a painful and peculiar pleasure.", " She went to country funerals and weddings in all weathers. A farmer\u2019s daughter who was to be married could count on a wedding present from Frances Harling. In August the Harlings\u2019 Danish cook had to leave them. Grandmother entreated them to try Antonia. She cornered Ambrosch the next time he came to town, and pointed out to him that any connection with Christian Harling would strengthen his credit and be of advantage to him. One Sunday Mrs. Harling took the long ride out to the Shimerdas\u2019 with Frances. She said she wanted to see \u2018what the girl came from\u2019 and to have a clear understanding with her mother. I was in our yard when they came driving home, just before sunset. They laughed and waved to me as they passed, and I could see they were in great good humour.

My own father couldn\u2019t make me stop! Mr. Harling ain\u2019t my boss outside my work. I won\u2019t give up my friends, either. The boys I go with are nice fellows. I thought Mr. Paine was all right, too, because he used to come here. I guess I gave him a red face for his wedding, all right!\u2019 she blazed out indignantly. \u2018You\u2019ll have to do one thing or the other, Antonia,\u2019 Mrs. Harling told her decidedly. \u2018I can\u2019t go back on what Mr. Harling has said. This is his house.\u2019 \u2018Then I\u2019ll just leave, Mrs. Harling. Lena\u2019s been wanting me to get a place closer to her for a long while. Mary Svoboda\u2019s going away from the Cutters\u2019 to work at the hotel, and I can have her place.\u2019 Mrs. Harling rose from her chair.", " After the concert was over, Antonia brought out a big boxful of photographs: she and Anton in their wedding clothes, holding hands; her brother Ambrosch and his very fat wife, who had a farm of her own, and who bossed her husband, I was delighted to hear; the three Bohemian Marys and their large families. \u2018You wouldn\u2019t believe how steady those girls have turned out,\u2019 Antonia remarked. \u2018Mary Svoboda\u2019s the best butter-maker in all this country, and a fine manager. Her children will have a grand chance.\u2019 As Antonia turned over the pictures the young Cuzaks stood behind her chair, looking over her shoulder with interested faces. Nina and Jan, after trying to see round the taller ones, quietly brought a chair, climbed up on it, and stood close together, looking. The little boy forgot his shyness and grinned delightedly when familiar faces came into view. In the group about Antonia I was conscious of a kind of physical harmony."], "From whom doesJim seek information about \u00c1ntonia when he visits Black Hawk beforestarting law school?": [" They did not take the path around the pond, but plunged through the muddy water, without even lifting their skirts. They came on, screaming and clawing the air. By this time Ambrosch had come to his senses and was sputtering with nosebleed. Jake sprang into his saddle. \u2018Let\u2019s get out of this, Jim,\u2019 he called. Mrs. Shimerda threw her hands over her head and clutched as if she were going to pull down lightning. \u2018Law, law!\u2019 she shrieked after us. \u2018Law for knock my Ambrosch down!\u2019 \u2018I never like you no more, Jake and Jim Burden,\u2019 Antonia panted. \u2018No friends any more!\u2019 Jake stopped and turned his horse for a second. \u2018Well, you\u2019re a damned ungrateful lot, the whole pack of you,\u2019 he shouted back. \u2018I guess the Burdens can get along without you. You\u2019ve been a sight of trouble to them, anyhow!\u2019 We rode away, feeling so outraged that the fine morning was spoiled for us.

We sat down outside the sagging wire fence that shut Mr. Shimerda\u2019s plot off from the rest of the world. The tall red grass had never been cut there. It had died down in winter and come up again in the spring until it was as thick and shrubby as some tropical garden-grass. I found myself telling her everything: why I had decided to study law and to go into the law office of one of my mother\u2019s relatives in New York City; about Gaston Cleric\u2019s death from pneumonia last winter, and the difference it had made in my life. She wanted to know about my friends, and my way of living, and my dearest hopes. \u2018Of course it means you are going away from us for good,\u2019 she said with a sigh. \u2018But that don\u2019t mean I\u2019ll lose you. Look at my papa here; he\u2019s been dead all these years, and yet he is more real to me than almost anybody else.", " Sometimes she came over to see grandfather after supper, and her visits flattered him. More than once they put their wits together to rescue some unfortunate farmer from the clutches of Wick Cutter, the Black Hawk money-lender. Grandfather said Frances Harling was as good a judge of credits as any banker in the county. The two or three men who had tried to take advantage of her in a deal acquired celebrity by their defeat. She knew every farmer for miles about: how much land he had under cultivation, how many cattle he was feeding, what his liabilities were. Her interest in these people was more than a business interest. She carried them all in her mind as if they were characters in a book or a play. When Frances drove out into the country on business, she would go miles out of her way to call on some of the old people, or to see the women who seldom got to town. She was quick at understanding the grandmothers who spoke no English, and the most reticent and distrustful of them would tell her their story without realizing they were doing so.", " During those first months the Shimerdas never went to town. Krajiek encouraged them in the belief that in Black Hawk they would somehow be mysteriously separated from their money. They hated Krajiek, but they clung to him because he was the only human being with whom they could talk or from whom they could get information. He slept with the old man and the two boys in the dugout barn, along with the oxen. They kept him in their hole and fed him for the same reason that the prairie-dogs and the brown owls house the rattlesnakes--because they did not know how to get rid of him. V WE KNEW THAT THINGS were hard for our Bohemian neighbours, but the two girls were lighthearted and never complained. They were always ready to forget their troubles at home, and to run away with me over the prairie, scaring rabbits or starting up flocks of quail. I remember Antonia\u2019s excitement when she came into our kitchen one afternoon and announced: \u2018My papa find friends up north, with Russian mans."], "Why does Jim move to his grandparents in Nebraska?": [" Don\u2019t you want to go ahead and see her, Jimmy? She\u2019s got the pretty brown eyes, too!\u2019 This last remark made me bashful, and I shook my head and settled down to \u2018Jesse James.\u2019 Jake nodded at me approvingly and said you were likely to get diseases from foreigners. I do not remember crossing the Missouri River, or anything about the long day\u2019s journey through Nebraska. Probably by that time I had crossed so many rivers that I was dull to them. The only thing very noticeable about Nebraska was that it was still, all day long, Nebraska. I had been sleeping, curled up in a red plush seat, for a long while when we reached Black Hawk. Jake roused me and took me by the hand. We stumbled down from the train to a wooden siding, where men were running about with lanterns. I couldn\u2019t see any town, or even distant lights; we were surrounded by utter darkness. The engine was panting heavily after its long run.", " The name is pronounced An\u2019-ton-ee-ah. BOOK I. The Shimerdas I I FIRST HEARD OF Antonia on what seemed to me an interminable journey across the great midland plain of North America. I was ten years old then; I had lost both my father and mother within a year, and my Virginia relatives were sending me out to my grandparents, who lived in Nebraska. I travelled in the care of a mountain boy, Jake Marpole, one of the \u2018hands\u2019 on my father\u2019s old farm under the Blue Ridge, who was now going West to work for my grandfather. Jake\u2019s experience of the world was not much wider than mine. He had never been in a railway train until the morning when we set out together to try our fortunes in a new world. We went all the way in day-coaches, becoming more sticky and grimy with each stage of the journey. Jake bought everything the newsboys offered him: candy, oranges, brass collar buttons, a watch-charm, and for me a \u2018Life of Jesse James,\u2019 which I remember as one of the most satisfactory books I have ever read.", " Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim. If you\u2019re going to be a preacher, I want you to marry me. You must promise to marry us all, and then baptize the babies.\u2019 Norwegian Anna, always dignified, looked at her reprovingly. \u2018Baptists don\u2019t believe in christening babies, do they, Jim?\u2019 I told her I didn\u2019t know what they believed, and didn\u2019t care, and that I certainly wasn\u2019t going to be a preacher. \u2018That\u2019s too bad,\u2019 Tiny simpered. She was in a teasing mood. \u2018You\u2019d make such a good one. You\u2019re so studious. Maybe you\u2019d like to be a professor. You used to teach Tony, didn\u2019t you?\u2019 Antonia broke in. \u2018I\u2019ve set my heart on Jim being a doctor. You\u2019d be good with sick people, Jim. Your grandmother\u2019s trained you up so nice. My papa always said you were an awful smart boy.\u2019 I said I was going to be whatever I pleased. \u2018Won\u2019t you be surprised, Miss Tiny, if I turn out to be a regular devil of a fellow?\u2019 They laughed until a glance from Norwegian Anna checked them; the high-school principal had just come into the front part of the shop to buy bread for supper.", " \u2018I like your grandmother, and all things here,\u2019 she sighed. \u2018I wish my papa live to see this summer. I wish no winter ever come again.\u2019 \u2018It will be summer a long while yet,\u2019 I reassured her. \u2018Why aren\u2019t you always nice like this, Tony?\u2019 \u2018How nice?\u2019 \u2018Why, just like this; like yourself. Why do you all the time try to be like Ambrosch?\u2019 She put her arms under her head and lay back, looking up at the sky. \u2018If I live here, like you, that is different. Things will be easy for you. But they will be hard for us.\u2019 BOOK II. The Hired Girls I I HAD BEEN LIVING with my grandfather for nearly three years when he decided to move to Black Hawk. He and grandmother were getting old for the heavy work of a farm, and as I was now thirteen they thought I ought to be going to school. Accordingly our homestead was rented to \u2018that good woman, the Widow Steavens,\u2019 and her bachelor brother, and we bought Preacher White\u2019s house, at the north end of Black Hawk."], "What description best describes the Shimerdas?": [" Yet people saw no difference between her and the three Marys; they were all Bohemians, all \u2018hired girls.\u2019 I always knew I should live long enough to see my country girls come into their own, and I have. To-day the best that a harassed Black Hawk merchant can hope for is to sell provisions and farm machinery and automobiles to the rich farms where that first crop of stalwart Bohemian and Scandinavian girls are now the mistresses. The Black Hawk boys looked forward to marrying Black Hawk girls, and living in a brand-new little house with best chairs that must not be sat upon, and hand-painted china that must not be used. But sometimes a young fellow would look up from his ledger, or out through the grating of his father\u2019s bank, and let his eyes follow Lena Lingard, as she passed the window with her slow, undulating walk, or Tiny Soderball, tripping by in her short skirt and striped stockings.", " A coal stove glowed at either end of the room, and the grand piano in the middle stood open. There was an atmosphere of unusual freedom about the house that night, for Mrs. Gardener had gone to Omaha for a week. Johnnie had been having drinks with the guests until he was rather absent-minded. It was Mrs. Gardener who ran the business and looked after everything. Her husband stood at the desk and welcomed incoming travellers. He was a popular fellow, but no manager. Mrs. Gardener was admittedly the best-dressed woman in Black Hawk, drove the best horse, and had a smart trap and a little white-and-gold sleigh. She seemed indifferent to her possessions, was not half so solicitous about them as her friends were. She was tall, dark, severe, with something Indian-like in the rigid immobility of her face. Her manner was cold, and she talked little. Guests felt that they were receiving, not conferring, a favour when they stayed at her house.", " \u2018I\u2019ve got a good nose for directions, and I never did need much sleep. It\u2019s the grey I\u2019m worried about.

Stop at the Widow Steavens\u2019s for dinner. She\u2019s a good woman, and she\u2019ll do well by you.\u2019 After Fuchs rode away, I was left with Ambrosch. I saw a side of him I had not seen before. He was deeply, even slavishly, devout. He did not say a word all morning, but sat with his rosary in his hands, praying, now silently, now aloud. He never looked away from his beads, nor lifted his hands except to cross himself. Several times the poor boy fell asleep where he sat, wakened with a start, and began to pray again. No wagon could be got to the Shimerdas\u2019 until a road was broken, and that would be a day\u2019s job. Grandfather came from the barn on one of our big black horses, and Jake lifted grandmother up behind him.", " They was blown up there by gunshot, no question.\u2019 Grandmother told grandfather she meant to go over to the Shimerdas\u2019 with him. \u2018There is nothing you can do,\u2019 he said doubtfully. \u2018The body can\u2019t be touched until we get the coroner here from Black Hawk, and that will be a matter of several days, this weather.\u2019 \u2018Well, I can take them some victuals, anyway, and say a word of comfort to them poor little girls. The oldest one was his darling, and was like a right hand to him. He might have thought of her. He\u2019s left her alone in a hard world.\u2019 She glanced distrustfully at Ambrosch, who was now eating his breakfast at the kitchen table. Fuchs, although he had been up in the cold nearly all night, was going to make the long ride to Black Hawk to fetch the priest and the coroner. On the grey gelding, our best horse, he would try to pick his way across the country with no roads to guide him. \u2018Don\u2019t you worry about me, Mrs. Burden,\u2019 he said cheerfully, as he put on a second pair of socks."], "What university does Jim attend?": [" Antonia was frightened, and was going home to stay for a while, she told Mrs. Cutter; it would be useless to interrogate the girl, for she knew nothing of what had happened. Then Mrs. Cutter told her story. She and her husband had started home from Omaha together the morning before. They had to stop over several hours at Waymore Junction to catch the Black Hawk train. During the wait, Cutter left her at the depot and went to the Waymore bank to attend to some business. When he returned, he told her that he would have to stay overnight there, but she could go on home. He bought her ticket and put her on the train. She saw him slip a twenty-dollar bill into her handbag with her ticket. That bill, she said, should have aroused her suspicions at once--but did not. The trains are never called at little junction towns; everybody knows when they come in. Mr. Cutter showed his wife\u2019s ticket to the conductor, and settled her in her seat before the train moved off.", " Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim.

Is it the Firemen\u2019s dances?\u2019 She nodded. \u2018I\u2019m sorry I sneaked off like that. But there\u2019s nothing wrong about the dances, and I haven\u2019t done anything wrong. I like all those country girls, and I like to dance with them. That\u2019s all there is to it.\u2019 \u2018But it ain\u2019t right to deceive us, son, and it brings blame on us. People say you are growing up to be a bad boy, and that ain\u2019t just to us.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t care what they say about me, but if it hurts you, that settles it. I won\u2019t go to the Firemen\u2019s Hall again.\u2019 I kept my promise, of course, but I found the spring months dull enough. I sat at home with the old people in the evenings now, reading Latin that was not in our high-school course. I had made up my mind to do a lot of college requirement work in the summer, and to enter the freshman class at the university without conditions in the fall. I wanted to get away as soon as possible.", " When I took my entrance examinations, he was my examiner, and my course was arranged under his supervision. I did not go home for my first summer vacation, but stayed in Lincoln, working off a year\u2019s Greek, which had been my only condition on entering the freshman class. Cleric\u2019s doctor advised against his going back to New England, and, except for a few weeks in Colorado, he, too, was in Lincoln all that summer. We played tennis, read, and took long walks together. I shall always look back on that time of mental awakening as one of the happiest in my life. Gaston Cleric introduced me to the world of ideas; when one first enters that world everything else fades for a time, and all that went before is as if it had not been. Yet I found curious survivals; some of the figures of my old life seemed to be waiting for me in the new. In those days there were many serious young men among the students who had come up to the university from the farms and the little towns scattered over the thinly settled state."], "What does \u00c1ntonia cover up?": [" Lena\u2019s success puzzled me. She was so easygoing; had none of the push and self-assertiveness that get people ahead in business. She had come to Lincoln, a country girl, with no introductions except to some cousins of Mrs. Thomas who lived there, and she was already making clothes for the women of \u2018the young married set.\u2019 Evidently she had great natural aptitude for her work. She knew, as she said, \u2018what people looked well in.\u2019 She never tired of poring over fashion-books. Sometimes in the evening I would find her alone in her work-room, draping folds of satin on a wire figure, with a quite blissful expression of countenance. I couldn\u2019t help thinking that the years when Lena literally hadn\u2019t enough clothes to cover herself might have something to do with her untiring interest in dressing the human figure. Her clients said that Lena \u2018had style,\u2019 and overlooked her habitual inaccuracies. She never, I discovered, finished anything by the time she had promised, and she frequently spent more money on materials than her customer had authorized."], "What profession does Jim take up?": [" Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim.

I\u2019d make up my bed nice and fresh for you. It\u2019s a real cool room, and the bed\u2019s right next the window. I was afraid to leave the window open last night.\u2019 I liked my own room, and I didn\u2019t like the Cutters\u2019 house under any circumstances; but Tony looked so troubled that I consented to try this arrangement. I found that I slept there as well as anywhere, and when I got home in the morning, Tony had a good breakfast waiting for me. After prayers she sat down at the table with us, and it was like old times in the country. The third night I spent at the Cutters\u2019, I awoke suddenly with the impression that I had heard a door open and shut. Everything was still, however, and I must have gone to sleep again immediately. The next thing I knew, I felt someone sit down on the edge of the bed.", " \u2018The girl will be happy here, and she\u2019ll forget those things,\u2019 said Mrs. Harling confidently, as we rose to take our leave. III ON SATURDAY AMBROSCH drove up to the back gate, and Antonia jumped down from the wagon and ran into our kitchen just as she used to do. She was wearing shoes and stockings, and was breathless and excited. She gave me a playful shake by the shoulders. \u2018You ain\u2019t forget about me, Jim?\u2019 Grandmother kissed her. \u2018God bless you, child! Now you\u2019ve come, you must try to do right and be a credit to us.\u2019 Antonia looked eagerly about the house and admired everything. \u2018Maybe I be the kind of girl you like better; now I come to town,\u2019 she suggested hopefully. How good it was to have Antonia near us again; to see her every day and almost every night! Her greatest fault, Mrs. Harling found, was that she so often stopped her work and fell to playing with the children. She would race about the orchard with us, or take sides in our hay-fights in the barn, or be the old bear that came down from the mountain and carried off Nina.", " \u2018It wasn\u2019t mother\u2019s fault. She would have made us comfortable if she could. But that was no life for a girl! After I began to herd and milk, I could never get the smell of the cattle off me. The few underclothes I had I kept in a cracker-box. On Saturday nights, after everybody was in bed, then I could take a bath if I wasn\u2019t too tired. I could make two trips to the windmill to carry water, and heat it in the wash-boiler on the stove. While the water was heating, I could bring in a washtub out of the cave, and take my bath in the kitchen. Then I could put on a clean night-gown and get into bed with two others, who likely hadn\u2019t had a bath unless I\u2019d given it to them. You can\u2019t tell me anything about family life. I\u2019ve had plenty to last me.\u2019 \u2018But it\u2019s not all like that,\u2019 I objected. \u2018Near enough. It\u2019s all being under somebody\u2019s thumb. What\u2019s on your mind, Jim? Are you afraid I\u2019ll want you to marry me some day?\u2019 Then I told her I was going away."], "Who is Jim and \u00c1ntonia\u2019s mutual friend?": [" The young Queen of Italy said the same thing once, to a friend of mine.

She told me how she and her husband had come out to this new country when the farm-land was cheap and could be had on easy payments. The first ten years were a hard struggle. Her husband knew very little about farming and often grew discouraged. \u2018We\u2019d never have got through if I hadn\u2019t been so strong. I\u2019ve always had good health, thank God, and I was able to help him in the fields until right up to the time before my babies came. Our children were good about taking care of each other. Martha, the one you saw when she was a baby, was such a help to me, and she trained Anna to be just like her. My Martha\u2019s married now, and has a baby of her own.

In summer, when they were in bloom, he used to sit there with his friend that played the trombone. When I was little I used to go down there to hear them talk--beautiful talk, like what I never hear in this country.\u2019 \u2018What did they talk about?\u2019 I asked her. She sighed and shook her head. \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t know! About music, and the woods, and about God, and when they were young.\u2019 She turned to me suddenly and looked into my eyes. \u2018You think, Jimmy, that maybe my father\u2019s spirit can go back to those old places?\u2019 I told her about the feeling of her father\u2019s presence I had on that winter day when my grandparents had gone over to see his dead body and I was left alone in the house. I said I felt sure then that he was on his way back to his own country, and that even now, when I passed his grave, I always thought of him as being among the woods and fields that were so dear to him.", " They talked about their school and the new teacher, told me about the crops and the harvest, and how many steers they would feed that winter. They were easy and confidential with me, as if I were an old friend of the family--and not too old. I felt like a boy in their company, and all manner of forgotten interests revived in me. It seemed, after all, so natural to be walking along a barbed-wire fence beside the sunset, toward a red pond, and to see my shadow moving along at my right, over the close-cropped grass. \u2018Has mother shown you the pictures you sent her from the old country?\u2019 Ambrosch asked. \u2018We\u2019ve had them framed and they\u2019re hung up in the parlour. She was so glad to get them. I don\u2019t believe I ever saw her so pleased about anything.\u2019 There was a note of simple gratitude in his voice that made me wish I had given more occasion for it. I put my hand on his shoulder. \u2018Your mother, you know, was very much loved by all of us."], "Who eventually marries \u00c1ntonia?": [" The quiet was delightful, and the ticking clock was the most pleasant of companions. I got \u2018Robinson Crusoe\u2019 and tried to read, but his life on the island seemed dull compared with ours. Presently, as I looked with satisfaction about our comfortable sitting-room, it flashed upon me that if Mr. Shimerda\u2019s soul were lingering about in this world at all, it would be here, in our house, which had been more to his liking than any other in the neighbourhood. I remembered his contented face when he was with us on Christmas Day. If he could have lived with us, this terrible thing would never have happened. I knew it was homesickness that had killed Mr. Shimerda, and I wondered whether his released spirit would not eventually find its way back to his own country. I thought of how far it was to Chicago, and then to Virginia, to Baltimore--and then the great wintry ocean. No, he would not at once set out upon that long journey.", " \u2018This old chap will be proposing to you some day, Lena.\u2019 \u2018Oh, he has--often!\u2019 she murmured. \u2018What! After you\u2019ve refused him?\u2019 \u2018He doesn\u2019t mind that. It seems to cheer him to mention the subject. Old men are like that, you know. It makes them feel important to think they\u2019re in love with somebody.\u2019 \u2018The colonel would marry you in a minute. I hope you won\u2019t marry some old fellow; not even a rich one.\u2019 Lena shifted her pillows and looked up at me in surprise. \u2018Why, I\u2019m not going to marry anybody. Didn\u2019t you know that?\u2019 \u2018Nonsense, Lena. That\u2019s what girls say, but you know better. Every handsome girl like you marries, of course.\u2019 She shook her head. \u2018Not me.\u2019 \u2018But why not? What makes you say that?\u2019 I persisted. Lena laughed. \u2018Well, it\u2019s mainly because I don\u2019t want a husband. Men are all right for friends, but as soon as you marry them they turn into cranky old fathers, even the wild ones. They begin to tell you what\u2019s sensible and what\u2019s foolish, and want you to stick at home all the time.", " Mrs. Cutter remained flushed and wild-eyed as we had known her, but as the years passed she became afflicted with a shaking palsy which made her nervous nod continuous instead of occasional. Her hands were so uncertain that she could no longer disfigure china, poor woman! As the couple grew older, they quarrelled more and more often about the ultimate disposition of their \u2018property.\u2019 A new law was passed in the state, securing the surviving wife a third of her husband\u2019s estate under all conditions. Cutter was tormented by the fear that Mrs. Cutter would live longer than he, and that eventually her \u2018people,\u2019 whom he had always hated so violently, would inherit. Their quarrels on this subject passed the boundary of the close-growing cedars, and were heard in the street by whoever wished to loiter and listen. One morning, two years ago, Cutter went into the hardware store and bought a pistol, saying he was going to shoot a dog, and adding that he \u2018thought he would take a shot at an old cat while he was about it.\u2019 (Here the children interrupted Rudolph\u2019s narrative by smothered giggles.)"], "Whose depression eventually leads him / her to suicide?": [" When the characters all spoke at once and I missed some of the phrases they flashed at each other, I was in misery. I strained my ears and eyes to catch every exclamation. The actress who played Marguerite was even then old-fashioned, though historic. She had been a member of Daly\u2019s famous New York company, and afterward a \u2018star\u2019 under his direction. She was a woman who could not be taught, it is said, though she had a crude natural force which carried with people whose feelings were accessible and whose taste was not squeamish. She was already old, with a ravaged countenance and a physique curiously hard and stiff. She moved with difficulty--I think she was lame--I seem to remember some story about a malady of the spine. Her Armand was disproportionately young and slight, a handsome youth, perplexed in the extreme. But what did it matter? I believed devoutly in her power to fascinate him, in her dazzling loveliness.", " The quiet was delightful, and the ticking clock was the most pleasant of companions. I got \u2018Robinson Crusoe\u2019 and tried to read, but his life on the island seemed dull compared with ours. Presently, as I looked with satisfaction about our comfortable sitting-room, it flashed upon me that if Mr. Shimerda\u2019s soul were lingering about in this world at all, it would be here, in our house, which had been more to his liking than any other in the neighbourhood. I remembered his contented face when he was with us on Christmas Day. If he could have lived with us, this terrible thing would never have happened. I knew it was homesickness that had killed Mr. Shimerda, and I wondered whether his released spirit would not eventually find its way back to his own country. I thought of how far it was to Chicago, and then to Virginia, to Baltimore--and then the great wintry ocean. No, he would not at once set out upon that long journey.", " After that, I scarcely knew how to put in the time until the night express was due. I took a long walk north of the town, out into the pastures where the land was so rough that it had never been ploughed up, and the long red grass of early times still grew shaggy over the draws and hillocks. Out there I felt at home again. Overhead the sky was that indescribable blue of autumn; bright and shadowless, hard as enamel. To the south I could see the dun-shaded river bluffs that used to look so big to me, and all about stretched drying cornfields, of the pale-gold colour, I remembered so well. Russian thistles were blowing across the uplands and piling against the wire fences like barricades. Along the cattle-paths the plumes of goldenrod were already fading into sun-warmed velvet, grey with gold threads in it. I had escaped from the curious depression that hangs over little towns, and my mind was full of pleasant things; trips I meant to take with the Cuzak boys, in the Bad Lands and up on the Stinking Water.", " They were all eager for any details about the suicide, and they were greatly concerned as to where Mr. Shimerda would be buried. The nearest Catholic cemetery was at Black Hawk, and it might be weeks before a wagon could get so far. Besides, Mr. Bushy and grandmother were sure that a man who had killed himself could not be buried in a Catholic graveyard. There was a burying-ground over by the Norwegian church, west of Squaw Creek; perhaps the Norwegians would take Mr. Shimerda in. After our visitors rode away in single file over the hill, we returned to the kitchen. Grandmother began to make the icing for a chocolate cake, and Otto again filled the house with the exciting, expectant song of the plane. One pleasant thing about this time was that everybody talked more than usual. I had never heard the postmaster say anything but \u2018Only papers, to-day,\u2019 or, \u2018I\u2019ve got a sackful of mail for ye,\u2019 until this afternoon."], "Who is Jim\u2019s tutor at Lincoln?": [" At last she sent me away with her soft, slow, renunciatory kiss. \u2018You aren\u2019t sorry I came to see you that time?\u2019 she whispered. \u2018It seemed so natural. I used to think I\u2019d like to be your first sweetheart. You were such a funny kid!\u2019 She always kissed one as if she were sadly and wisely sending one away forever. We said many good-byes before I left Lincoln, but she never tried to hinder me or hold me back. \u2018You are going, but you haven\u2019t gone yet, have you?\u2019 she used to say. My Lincoln chapter closed abruptly. I went home to my grandparents for a few weeks, and afterward visited my relatives in Virginia until I joined Cleric in Boston. I was then nineteen years old. BOOK IV. The Pioneer Woman\u2019s Story I TWO YEARS AFTER I left Lincoln, I completed my academic course at Harvard. Before I entered the Law School I went home for the summer vacation. On the night of my arrival, Mrs. Harling and Frances and Sally came over to greet me.", " Before I had got far with my reading, I was disturbed by a knock. I hurried to the door and when I opened it saw a woman standing in the dark hall. \u2018I expect you hardly know me, Jim.\u2019 The voice seemed familiar, but I did not recognize her until she stepped into the light of my doorway and I beheld--Lena Lingard! She was so quietly conventionalized by city clothes that I might have passed her on the street without seeing her. Her black suit fitted her figure smoothly, and a black lace hat, with pale-blue forget-me-nots, sat demurely on her yellow hair. I led her toward Cleric\u2019s chair, the only comfortable one I had, questioning her confusedly. She was not disconcerted by my embarrassment. She looked about her with the naive curiosity I remembered so well. \u2018You are quite comfortable here, aren\u2019t you? I live in Lincoln now, too, Jim. I\u2019m in business for myself. I have a dressmaking shop in the Raleigh Block, out on O Street.", " When I took my entrance examinations, he was my examiner, and my course was arranged under his supervision. I did not go home for my first summer vacation, but stayed in Lincoln, working off a year\u2019s Greek, which had been my only condition on entering the freshman class. Cleric\u2019s doctor advised against his going back to New England, and, except for a few weeks in Colorado, he, too, was in Lincoln all that summer. We played tennis, read, and took long walks together. I shall always look back on that time of mental awakening as one of the happiest in my life. Gaston Cleric introduced me to the world of ideas; when one first enters that world everything else fades for a time, and all that went before is as if it had not been. Yet I found curious survivals; some of the figures of my old life seemed to be waiting for me in the new. In those days there were many serious young men among the students who had come up to the university from the farms and the little towns scattered over the thinly settled state.", " Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim. If you\u2019re going to be a preacher, I want you to marry me. You must promise to marry us all, and then baptize the babies.\u2019 Norwegian Anna, always dignified, looked at her reprovingly. \u2018Baptists don\u2019t believe in christening babies, do they, Jim?\u2019 I told her I didn\u2019t know what they believed, and didn\u2019t care, and that I certainly wasn\u2019t going to be a preacher. \u2018That\u2019s too bad,\u2019 Tiny simpered. She was in a teasing mood. \u2018You\u2019d make such a good one. You\u2019re so studious. Maybe you\u2019d like to be a professor. You used to teach Tony, didn\u2019t you?\u2019 Antonia broke in. \u2018I\u2019ve set my heart on Jim being a doctor. You\u2019d be good with sick people, Jim. Your grandmother\u2019s trained you up so nice. My papa always said you were an awful smart boy.\u2019 I said I was going to be whatever I pleased. \u2018Won\u2019t you be surprised, Miss Tiny, if I turn out to be a regular devil of a fellow?\u2019 They laughed until a glance from Norwegian Anna checked them; the high-school principal had just come into the front part of the shop to buy bread for supper."], "Who is Larry Donovan?": [" She works for Mrs. Gardener at the hotel now. She\u2019s housekeeper. Mrs. Gardener\u2019s health isn\u2019t what it was, and she can\u2019t see after everything like she used to. She has great confidence in Tony. Tony\u2019s made it up with the Harlings, too. Little Nina is so fond of her that Mrs. Harling kind of overlooked things.\u2019 \u2018Is she still going with Larry Donovan?\u2019 \u2018Oh, that\u2019s on, worse than ever! I guess they\u2019re engaged. Tony talks about him like he was president of the railroad. Everybody laughs about it, because she was never a girl to be soft. She won\u2019t hear a word against him. She\u2019s so sort of innocent.\u2019 I said I didn\u2019t like Larry, and never would. Lena\u2019s face dimpled. \u2018Some of us could tell her things, but it wouldn\u2019t do any good. She\u2019d always believe him. That\u2019s Antonia\u2019s failing, you know; if she once likes people, she won\u2019t hear anything against them.\u2019 \u2018I think I\u2019d better go home and look after Antonia,\u2019 I said.", " I liked to schottische with her; she had so much spring and variety, and was always putting in new steps and slides. She taught me to dance against and around the hard-and-fast beat of the music. If, instead of going to the end of the railroad, old Mr. Shimerda had stayed in New York and picked up a living with his fiddle, how different Antonia\u2019s life might have been! Antonia often went to the dances with Larry Donovan, a passenger conductor who was a kind of professional ladies\u2019 man, as we said. I remember how admiringly all the boys looked at her the night she first wore her velveteen dress, made like Mrs. Gardener\u2019s black velvet. She was lovely to see, with her eyes shining, and her lips always a little parted when she danced. That constant, dark colour in her cheeks never changed. One evening when Donovan was out on his run, Antonia came to the hall with Norwegian Anna and her young man, and that night I took her home.", " Too bad! She seems proud of the baby, though; wouldn\u2019t hear to a cheap frame for the picture. I expect her brother will be in for it Saturday.\u2019 I went away feeling that I must see Antonia again. Another girl would have kept her baby out of sight, but Tony, of course, must have its picture on exhibition at the town photographer\u2019s, in a great gilt frame. How like her! I could forgive her, I told myself, if she hadn\u2019t thrown herself away on such a cheap sort of fellow. Larry Donovan was a passenger conductor, one of those train-crew aristocrats who are always afraid that someone may ask them to put up a car-window, and who, if requested to perform such a menial service, silently point to the button that calls the porter. Larry wore this air of official aloofness even on the street, where there were no car-windows to compromise his dignity. At the end of his run he stepped indifferently from the train along with the passengers, his street hat on his head and his conductor\u2019s cap in an alligator-skin bag, went directly into the station and changed his clothes.", " Everything seemed just as it used to be. My grandparents looked very little older. Frances Harling was married now, and she and her husband managed the Harling interests in Black Hawk. When we gathered in grandmother\u2019s parlour, I could hardly believe that I had been away at all. One subject, however, we avoided all evening. When I was walking home with Frances, after we had left Mrs. Harling at her gate, she said simply, \u2018You know, of course, about poor Antonia.\u2019 Poor Antonia! Everyone would be saying that now, I thought bitterly. I replied that grandmother had written me how Antonia went away to marry Larry Donovan at some place where he was working; that he had deserted her, and that there was now a baby. This was all I knew. \u2018He never married her,\u2019 Frances said. \u2018I haven\u2019t seen her since she came back. She lives at home, on the farm, and almost never comes to town. She brought the baby in to show it to mama once."], "What word would best describe the overall tone of the novel?": [" \u2018I\u2019ve got a good nose for directions, and I never did need much sleep. It\u2019s the grey I\u2019m worried about. I\u2019ll save him what I can, but it\u2019ll strain him, as sure as I\u2019m telling you!\u2019 \u2018This is no time to be over-considerate of animals, Otto; do the best you can for yourself. Stop at the Widow Steavens\u2019s for dinner. She\u2019s a good woman, and she\u2019ll do well by you.\u2019 After Fuchs rode away, I was left with Ambrosch. I saw a side of him I had not seen before. He was deeply, even slavishly, devout. He did not say a word all morning, but sat with his rosary in his hands, praying, now silently, now aloud. He never looked away from his beads, nor lifted his hands except to cross himself. Several times the poor boy fell asleep where he sat, wakened with a start, and began to pray again. No wagon could be got to the Shimerdas\u2019 until a road was broken, and that would be a day\u2019s job. Grandfather came from the barn on one of our big black horses, and Jake lifted grandmother up behind him.", " They was blown up there by gunshot, no question.\u2019 Grandmother told grandfather she meant to go over to the Shimerdas\u2019 with him. \u2018There is nothing you can do,\u2019 he said doubtfully. \u2018The body can\u2019t be touched until we get the coroner here from Black Hawk, and that will be a matter of several days, this weather.\u2019 \u2018Well, I can take them some victuals, anyway, and say a word of comfort to them poor little girls. The oldest one was his darling, and was like a right hand to him. He might have thought of her. He\u2019s left her alone in a hard world.\u2019 She glanced distrustfully at Ambrosch, who was now eating his breakfast at the kitchen table. Fuchs, although he had been up in the cold nearly all night, was going to make the long ride to Black Hawk to fetch the priest and the coroner. On the grey gelding, our best horse, he would try to pick his way across the country with no roads to guide him. \u2018Don\u2019t you worry about me, Mrs. Burden,\u2019 he said cheerfully, as he put on a second pair of socks.", " Jake was not at all disconcerted. \u2018Have the last word ma\u2019m,\u2019 he said cheerfully. \u2018It\u2019s a lady\u2019s privilege.\u2019 XIX JULY CAME ON with that breathless, brilliant heat which makes the plains of Kansas and Nebraska the best corn country in the world. It seemed as if we could hear the corn growing in the night; under the stars one caught a faint crackling in the dewy, heavy-odoured cornfields where the feathered stalks stood so juicy and green. If all the great plain from the Missouri to the Rocky Mountains had been under glass, and the heat regulated by a thermometer, it could not have been better for the yellow tassels that were ripening and fertilizing the silk day by day. The cornfields were far apart in those times, with miles of wild grazing land between. It took a clear, meditative eye like my grandfather\u2019s to foresee that they would enlarge and multiply until they would be, not the Shimerdas\u2019 cornfields, or Mr. Bushy\u2019s, but the world\u2019s cornfields; that their yield would be one of the great economic facts, like the wheat crop of Russia, which underlie all the activities of men, in peace or war.", " Yet people saw no difference between her and the three Marys; they were all Bohemians, all \u2018hired girls.\u2019 I always knew I should live long enough to see my country girls come into their own, and I have. To-day the best that a harassed Black Hawk merchant can hope for is to sell provisions and farm machinery and automobiles to the rich farms where that first crop of stalwart Bohemian and Scandinavian girls are now the mistresses. The Black Hawk boys looked forward to marrying Black Hawk girls, and living in a brand-new little house with best chairs that must not be sat upon, and hand-painted china that must not be used. But sometimes a young fellow would look up from his ledger, or out through the grating of his father\u2019s bank, and let his eyes follow Lena Lingard, as she passed the window with her slow, undulating walk, or Tiny Soderball, tripping by in her short skirt and striped stockings."], "How are immigrants portrayed in the novel?": [" The immigrants rumbled off into the empty darkness, and we followed them. I tried to go to sleep, but the jolting made me bite my tongue, and I soon began to ache all over. When the straw settled down, I had a hard bed. Cautiously I slipped from under the buffalo hide, got up on my knees and peered over the side of the wagon. There seemed to be nothing to see; no fences, no creeks or trees, no hills or fields. If there was a road, I could not make it out in the faint starlight. There was nothing but land: not a country at all, but the material out of which countries are made. No, there was nothing but land--slightly undulating, I knew, because often our wheels ground against the brake as we went down into a hollow and lurched up again on the other side. I had the feeling that the world was left behind, that we had got over the edge of it, and were outside man\u2019s jurisdiction. I had never before looked up at the sky when there was not a familiar mountain ridge against it."], "How does Jim begin to incorporate his past into his present?": [" Had they not been dehorned, they would have torn each other to pieces. Pretty soon the fat steers took it up and began butting and horning each other. Clearly, the affair had to be stopped. We all stood by and watched admiringly while Fuchs rode into the corral with a pitchfork and prodded the bulls again and again, finally driving them apart. The big storm of the winter began on my eleventh birthday, the twentieth of January. When I went down to breakfast that morning, Jake and Otto came in white as snow-men, beating their hands and stamping their feet. They began to laugh boisterously when they saw me, calling: \u2018You\u2019ve got a birthday present this time, Jim, and no mistake. They was a full-grown blizzard ordered for you.\u2019 All day the storm went on. The snow did not fall this time, it simply spilled out of heaven, like thousands of featherbeds being emptied. That afternoon the kitchen was a carpenter-shop; the men brought in their tools and made two great wooden shovels with long handles.", " She went to country funerals and weddings in all weathers.

I caught a faint odour of violet sachet. \u2018So that\u2019s Latin, is it? It looks hard. You do go to the theatre sometimes, though, for I\u2019ve seen you there. Don\u2019t you just love a good play, Jim? I can\u2019t stay at home in the evening if there\u2019s one in town.

You are going to let me come to see you, aren\u2019t you?\u2019 \u2018Would you like to? I\u2019d be ever so pleased. I\u2019m never busy after six o\u2019clock, and I let my sewing girls go at half-past five.

Lena gave me a cheerful account of Antonia and urged me to make her a visit. \u2018You really ought to go, Jim. It would be such a satisfaction to her. Never mind what Tiny says. There\u2019s nothing the matter with Cuzak. You\u2019d like him. He isn\u2019t a hustler, but a rough man would never have suited Tony. Tony has nice children--ten or eleven of them by this time, I guess. I shouldn\u2019t care for a family of that size myself, but somehow it\u2019s just right for Tony. She\u2019d love to show them to you.\u2019 On my way East I broke my journey at Hastings, in Nebraska, and set off with an open buggy and a fairly good livery team to find the Cuzak farm.

As she helped me to my room, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. My lip was cut and stood out like a snout. My nose looked like a big blue plum, and one eye was swollen shut and hideously discoloured. Grandmother said we must have the doctor at once, but I implored her, as I had never begged for anything before, not to send for him. I could stand anything, I told her, so long as nobody saw me or knew what had happened to me. I entreated her not to let grandfather, even, come into my room. She seemed to understand, though I was too faint and miserable to go into explanations. When she took off my night-shirt, she found such bruises on my chest and shoulders that she began to cry.

I was bitterly disappointed in her. I could not forgive her for becoming an object of pity, while Lena Lingard, for whom people had always foretold trouble, was now the leading dressmaker of Lincoln, much respected in Black Hawk. Lena gave her heart away when she felt like it, but she kept her head for her business and had got on in the world. Just then it was the fashion to speak indulgently of Lena and severely of Tiny Soderball, who had quietly gone West to try her fortune the year before. A Black Hawk boy, just back from Seattle, brought the news that Tiny had not gone to the coast on a venture, as she had allowed people to think, but with very definite plans. One of the roving promoters that used to stop at Mrs. Gardener\u2019s hotel owned idle property along the waterfront in Seattle, and he had offered to set Tiny up in business in one of his empty buildings.", " It was like this: When Otto left Austria to come to America, he was asked by one of his relatives to look after a woman who was crossing on the same boat, to join her husband in Chicago. The woman started off with two children, but it was clear that her family might grow larger on the journey. Fuchs said he \u2018got on fine with the kids,\u2019 and liked the mother, though she played a sorry trick on him. In mid-ocean she proceeded to have not one baby, but three! This event made Fuchs the object of undeserved notoriety, since he was travelling with her. The steerage stewardess was indignant with him, the doctor regarded him with suspicion. The first-cabin passengers, who made up a purse for the woman, took an embarrassing interest in Otto, and often enquired of him about his charge. When the triplets were taken ashore at New York, he had, as he said, \u2018to carry some of them.\u2019 The trip to Chicago was even worse than the ocean voyage."], "What does Jim initially title his memoir?": [" \u201cNow, what about yours?\u201d I had to confess that mine had not gone beyond a few straggling notes. \u201cNotes?

He was usually cold and distant with men, but with all women he had a silent, grave familiarity, a special handshake, accompanied by a significant, deliberate look. He took women, married or single, into his confidence; walked them up and down in the moonlight, telling them what a mistake he had made by not entering the office branch of the service, and how much better fitted he was to fill the post of General Passenger Agent in Denver than the rough-shod man who then bore that title. His unappreciated worth was the tender secret Larry shared with his sweethearts, and he was always able to make some foolish heart ache over it. As I drew near home that morning, I saw Mrs. Harling out in her yard, digging round her mountain-ash tree. It was a dry summer, and she had now no boy to help her.", " II ONE MARCH EVENING in my sophomore year I was sitting alone in my room after supper. There had been a warm thaw all day, with mushy yards and little streams of dark water gurgling cheerfully into the streets out of old snow-banks. My window was open, and the earthy wind blowing through made me indolent. On the edge of the prairie, where the sun had gone down, the sky was turquoise blue, like a lake, with gold light throbbing in it. Higher up, in the utter clarity of the western slope, the evening star hung like a lamp suspended by silver chains--like the lamp engraved upon the title-page of old Latin texts, which is always appearing in new heavens, and waking new desires in men. It reminded me, at any rate, to shut my window and light my wick in answer. I did so regretfully, and the dim objects in the room emerged from the shadows and took their place about me with the helpfulness which custom breeds."], "Who does Jim first encounter on his train ride from Virginia to Black Hawk, Nebraska?": [" Don\u2019t you want to go ahead and see her, Jimmy? She\u2019s got the pretty brown eyes, too!\u2019 This last remark made me bashful, and I shook my head and settled down to \u2018Jesse James.\u2019 Jake nodded at me approvingly and said you were likely to get diseases from foreigners. I do not remember crossing the Missouri River, or anything about the long day\u2019s journey through Nebraska. Probably by that time I had crossed so many rivers that I was dull to them. The only thing very noticeable about Nebraska was that it was still, all day long, Nebraska. I had been sleeping, curled up in a red plush seat, for a long while when we reached Black Hawk. Jake roused me and took me by the hand. We stumbled down from the train to a wooden siding, where men were running about with lanterns. I couldn\u2019t see any town, or even distant lights; we were surrounded by utter darkness. The engine was panting heavily after its long run.", " It was not until nearly nightfall that she discovered she was on the express bound for Kansas City, that her ticket was made out to that point, and that Cutter must have planned it so. The conductor told her the Black Hawk train was due at Waymore twelve minutes after the Kansas City train left. She saw at once that her husband had played this trick in order to get back to Black Hawk without her. She had no choice but to go on to Kansas City and take the first fast train for home. Cutter could have got home a day earlier than his wife by any one of a dozen simpler devices; he could have left her in the Omaha hotel, and said he was going on to Chicago for a few days. But apparently it was part of his fun to outrage her feelings as much as possible. \u2018Mr. Cutter will pay for this, Mrs. Burden. He will pay!\u2019 Mrs. Cutter avouched, nodding her horse-like head and rolling her eyes. Grandmother said she hadn\u2019t a doubt of it.", " At night, before I went to sleep, I often found myself in a sledge drawn by three horses, dashing through a country that looked something like Nebraska and something like Virginia. IX THE FIRST SNOWFALL came early in December. I remember how the world looked from our sitting-room window as I dressed behind the stove that morning: the low sky was like a sheet of metal; the blond cornfields had faded out into ghostliness at last; the little pond was frozen under its stiff willow bushes. Big white flakes were whirling over everything and disappearing in the red grass. Beyond the pond, on the slope that climbed to the cornfield, there was, faintly marked in the grass, a great circle where the Indians used to ride. Jake and Otto were sure that when they galloped round that ring the Indians tortured prisoners, bound to a stake in the centre; but grandfather thought they merely ran races or trained horses there.", " The name is pronounced An\u2019-ton-ee-ah. BOOK I. The Shimerdas I I FIRST HEARD OF Antonia on what seemed to me an interminable journey across the great midland plain of North America. I was ten years old then; I had lost both my father and mother within a year, and my Virginia relatives were sending me out to my grandparents, who lived in Nebraska. I travelled in the care of a mountain boy, Jake Marpole, one of the \u2018hands\u2019 on my father\u2019s old farm under the Blue Ridge, who was now going West to work for my grandfather. Jake\u2019s experience of the world was not much wider than mine. He had never been in a railway train until the morning when we set out together to try our fortunes in a new world. We went all the way in day-coaches, becoming more sticky and grimy with each stage of the journey. Jake bought everything the newsboys offered him: candy, oranges, brass collar buttons, a watch-charm, and for me a \u2018Life of Jesse James,\u2019 which I remember as one of the most satisfactory books I have ever read."], "What does Mr. Shimerda promise to give Jim when he is older?": [" Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim. If you\u2019re going to be a preacher, I want you to marry me. You must promise to marry us all, and then baptize the babies.\u2019 Norwegian Anna, always dignified, looked at her reprovingly. \u2018Baptists don\u2019t believe in christening babies, do they, Jim?\u2019 I told her I didn\u2019t know what they believed, and didn\u2019t care, and that I certainly wasn\u2019t going to be a preacher. \u2018That\u2019s too bad,\u2019 Tiny simpered. She was in a teasing mood. \u2018You\u2019d make such a good one. You\u2019re so studious. Maybe you\u2019d like to be a professor. You used to teach Tony, didn\u2019t you?\u2019 Antonia broke in. \u2018I\u2019ve set my heart on Jim being a doctor. You\u2019d be good with sick people, Jim. Your grandmother\u2019s trained you up so nice. My papa always said you were an awful smart boy.\u2019 I said I was going to be whatever I pleased. \u2018Won\u2019t you be surprised, Miss Tiny, if I turn out to be a regular devil of a fellow?\u2019 They laughed until a glance from Norwegian Anna checked them; the high-school principal had just come into the front part of the shop to buy bread for supper.", " \u2018Mrs. Shimerda is made up her mind,\u2019 he added. \u2018I try to persuade her, and say it looks bad for her to all the neighbours; but she say so it must be. \u201cThere I will bury him, if I dig the grave myself,\u201d she say. I have to promise her I help Ambrosch make the grave tomorrow.\u2019 Grandfather smoothed his beard and looked judicial. \u2018I don\u2019t know whose wish should decide the matter, if not hers. But if she thinks she will live to see the people of this country ride over that old man\u2019s head, she is mistaken.\u2019 XVI MR. SHIMERDA LAY DEAD in the barn four days, and on the fifth they buried him. All day Friday Jelinek was off with Ambrosch digging the grave, chopping out the frozen earth with old axes. On Saturday we breakfasted before daylight and got into the wagon with the coffin. Jake and Jelinek went ahead on horseback to cut the body loose from the pool of blood in which it was frozen fast to the ground.", " Grandfather and Jelinek came to tell Mrs. Shimerda that it was time to start. After bundling her mother up in clothes the neighbours had brought, Antonia put on an old cape from our house and the rabbit-skin hat her father had made for her. Four men carried Mr. Shimerda\u2019s box up the hill; Krajiek slunk along behind them. The coffin was too wide for the door, so it was put down on the slope outside. I slipped out from the cave and looked at Mr. Shimerda. He was lying on his side, with his knees drawn up. His body was draped in a black shawl, and his head was bandaged in white muslin, like a mummy\u2019s; one of his long, shapely hands lay out on the black cloth; that was all one could see of him. Mrs. Shimerda came out and placed an open prayer-book against the body, making the sign of the cross on the bandaged head with her fingers. Ambrosch knelt down and made the same gesture, and after him Antonia and Marek.", " That snake hung on our corral fence for several days; some of the neighbours came to see it and agreed that it was the biggest rattler ever killed in those parts. This was enough for Antonia. She liked me better from that time on, and she never took a supercilious air with me again. I had killed a big snake--I was now a big fellow. VIII WHILE THE AUTUMN COLOUR was growing pale on the grass and cornfields, things went badly with our friends the Russians. Peter told his troubles to Mr. Shimerda: he was unable to meet a note which fell due on the first of November; had to pay an exorbitant bonus on renewing it, and to give a mortgage on his pigs and horses and even his milk cow. His creditor was Wick Cutter, the merciless Black Hawk money-lender, a man of evil name throughout the county, of whom I shall have more to say later. Peter could give no very clear account of his transactions with Cutter."], "What does the novel\u2019s epigraph, from Virgil\u2019s Georgics, translate to?": [" I propped my book open and stared listlessly at the page of the \u2018Georgics\u2019 where tomorrow\u2019s lesson began. It opened with the melancholy reflection that, in the lives of mortals the best days are the first to flee. \u2018Optima dies... prima fugit.\u2019 I turned back to the beginning of the third book, which we had read in class that morning. \u2018Primus ego in patriam mecum... deducam Musas\u2019; \u2018for I shall be the first, if I live, to bring the Muse into my country.\u2019 Cleric had explained to us that \u2018patria\u2019 here meant, not a nation or even a province, but the little rural neighbourhood on the Mincio where the poet was born. This was not a boast, but a hope, at once bold and devoutly humble, that he might bring the Muse (but lately come to Italy from her cloudy Grecian mountains), not to the capital, the palatia Romana, but to his own little I country\u2019; to his father\u2019s fields, \u2018sloping down to the river and to the old beech trees with broken tops.\u2019 Cleric said he thought Virgil, when he was dying at Brindisi, must have remembered that passage.", " After he had faced the bitter fact that he was to leave the \u2018Aeneid\u2019 unfinished, and had decreed that the great canvas, crowded with figures of gods and men, should be burned rather than survive him unperfected, then his mind must have gone back to the perfect utterance of the \u2018Georgics,\u2019 where the pen was fitted to the matter as the plough is to the furrow; and he must have said to himself, with the thankfulness of a good man, \u2018I was the first to bring the Muse into my country.\u2019 We left the classroom quietly, conscious that we had been brushed by the wing of a great feeling, though perhaps I alone knew Cleric intimately enough to guess what that feeling was. In the evening, as I sat staring at my book, the fervour of his voice stirred through the quantities on the page before me. I was wondering whether that particular rocky strip of New England coast about which he had so often told me was Cleric\u2019s patria.", " I walked with her to the door. \u2018Come and see me sometimes when you\u2019re lonesome. But maybe you have all the friends you want. Have you?\u2019 She turned her soft cheek to me. \u2018Have you?\u2019 she whispered teasingly in my ear. In a moment I watched her fade down the dusky stairway. When I turned back to my room the place seemed much pleasanter than before. Lena had left something warm and friendly in the lamplight. How I loved to hear her laugh again! It was so soft and unexcited and appreciative gave a favourable interpretation to everything. When I closed my eyes I could hear them all laughing--the Danish laundry girls and the three Bohemian Marys. Lena had brought them all back to me. It came over me, as it had never done before, the relation between girls like those and the poetry of Virgil. If there were no girls like them in the world, there would be no poetry. I understood that clearly, for the first time.", " I have had no other success that pulled at my heartstrings like that one. XIV THE DAY AFTER COMMENCEMENT I moved my books and desk upstairs, to an empty room where I should be undisturbed, and I fell to studying in earnest. I worked off a year\u2019s trigonometry that summer, and began Virgil alone. Morning after morning I used to pace up and down my sunny little room, looking off at the distant river bluffs and the roll of the blond pastures between, scanning the \u2018Aeneid\u2019 aloud and committing long passages to memory. Sometimes in the evening Mrs. Harling called to me as I passed her gate, and asked me to come in and let her play for me. She was lonely for Charley, she said, and liked to have a boy about. Whenever my grandparents had misgivings, and began to wonder whether I was not too young to go off to college alone, Mrs. Harling took up my cause vigorously. Grandfather had such respect for her judgment that I knew he would not go against her."], "How does the frame narrative temper the intense nostalgia of the novel?": [" Too bad! She seems proud of the baby, though; wouldn\u2019t hear to a cheap frame for the picture. I expect her brother will be in for it Saturday.\u2019 I went away feeling that I must see Antonia again. Another girl would have kept her baby out of sight, but Tony, of course, must have its picture on exhibition at the town photographer\u2019s, in a great gilt frame. How like her! I could forgive her, I told myself, if she hadn\u2019t thrown herself away on such a cheap sort of fellow. Larry Donovan was a passenger conductor, one of those train-crew aristocrats who are always afraid that someone may ask them to put up a car-window, and who, if requested to perform such a menial service, silently point to the button that calls the porter. Larry wore this air of official aloofness even on the street, where there were no car-windows to compromise his dignity. At the end of his run he stepped indifferently from the train along with the passengers, his street hat on his head and his conductor\u2019s cap in an alligator-skin bag, went directly into the station and changed his clothes.", " I can still see those two men sitting on the bench; Otto\u2019s close-clipped head and Jake\u2019s shaggy hair slicked flat in front by a wet comb. I can see the sag of their tired shoulders against the whitewashed wall. What good fellows they were, how much they knew, and how many things they had kept faith with! Fuchs had been a cowboy, a stage-driver, a bartender, a miner; had wandered all over that great Western country and done hard work everywhere, though, as grandmother said, he had nothing to show for it. Jake was duller than Otto. He could scarcely read, wrote even his name with difficulty, and he had a violent temper which sometimes made him behave like a crazy man--tore him all to pieces and actually made him ill. But he was so soft-hearted that anyone could impose upon him. If he, as he said, \u2018forgot himself\u2019 and swore before grandmother, he went about depressed and shamefaced all day.", " \u201cNow, what about yours?\u201d I had to confess that mine had not gone beyond a few straggling notes. \u201cNotes? I didn\u2019t make any.\u201d He drank his tea all at once and put down the cup. \u201cI didn\u2019t arrange or rearrange. I simply wrote down what of herself and myself and other people Antonia\u2019s name recalls to me. I suppose it hasn\u2019t any form. It hasn\u2019t any title, either.\u201d He went into the next room, sat down at my desk and wrote on the pinkish face of the portfolio the word, \u201cAntonia.\u201d He frowned at this a moment, then prefixed another word, making it \u201cMy Antonia.\u201d That seemed to satisfy him. \u201cRead it as soon as you can,\u201d he said, rising, \u201cbut don\u2019t let it influence your own story.\u201d My own story was never written, but the following narrative is Jim\u2019s manuscript, substantially as he brought it to me. NOTE: The Bohemian name Antonia is strongly accented on the first syllable, like the English name Anthony, and the \u2018i\u2019 is, of course, given the sound of long \u2018e\u2019.", " He was so fastidious and prim about his place that a boy would go to a good deal of trouble to throw a dead cat into his back yard, or to dump a sackful of tin cans in his alley. It was a peculiar combination of old-maidishness and licentiousness that made Cutter seem so despicable. He had certainly met his match when he married Mrs. Cutter. She was a terrifying-looking person; almost a giantess in height, raw-boned, with iron-grey hair, a face always flushed, and prominent, hysterical eyes. When she meant to be entertaining and agreeable, she nodded her head incessantly and snapped her eyes at one. Her teeth were long and curved, like a horse\u2019s; people said babies always cried if she smiled at them. Her face had a kind of fascination for me: it was the very colour and shape of anger. There was a gleam of something akin to insanity in her full, intense eyes. She was formal in manner, and made calls in rustling, steel-grey brocades and a tall bonnet with bristling aigrettes."], "What incident drove Pavel and Peter to leave Russia for America?": [" Wherever they went, the story followed them. It took them five years to save money enough to come to America. They worked in Chicago, Des Moines, Fort Wayne, but they were always unfortunate. When Pavel\u2019s health grew so bad, they decided to try farming. Pavel died a few days after he unburdened his mind to Mr. Shimerda, and was buried in the Norwegian graveyard. Peter sold off everything, and left the country--went to be cook in a railway construction camp where gangs of Russians were employed. At his sale we bought Peter\u2019s wheelbarrow and some of his harness. During the auction he went about with his head down, and never lifted his eyes. He seemed not to care about anything. The Black Hawk money-lender who held mortgages on Peter\u2019s livestock was there, and he bought in the sale notes at about fifty cents on the dollar. Everyone said Peter kissed the cow before she was led away by her new owner.", " Peter and Pavel drove in the groom\u2019s sledge, and six sledges followed with all his relatives and friends. After the ceremony at the church, the party went to a dinner given by the parents of the bride. The dinner lasted all afternoon; then it became a supper and continued far into the night. There was much dancing and drinking. At midnight the parents of the bride said good-bye to her and blessed her. The groom took her up in his arms and carried her out to his sledge and tucked her under the blankets. He sprang in beside her, and Pavel and Peter (our Pavel and Peter!) took the front seat. Pavel drove. The party set out with singing and the jingle of sleigh-bells, the groom\u2019s sledge going first. All the drivers were more or less the worse for merry-making, and the groom was absorbed in his bride. The wolves were bad that winter, and everyone knew it, yet when they heard the first wolf-cry, the drivers were not much alarmed.", " He called to the groom that they must lighten--and pointed to the bride. The young man cursed him and held her tighter. Pavel tried to drag her away. In the struggle, the groom rose. Pavel knocked him over the side of the sledge and threw the girl after him. He said he never remembered exactly how he did it, or what happened afterward. Peter, crouching in the front seat, saw nothing. The first thing either of them noticed was a new sound that broke into the clear air, louder than they had ever heard it before--the bell of the monastery of their own village, ringing for early prayers. Pavel and Peter drove into the village alone, and they had been alone ever since. They were run out of their village. Pavel\u2019s own mother would not look at him. They went away to strange towns, but when people learned where they came from, they were always asked if they knew the two men who had fed the bride to the wolves.", " It was even then too late. The black ground-shadows were already crowding over the heap in the road, and one horse ran out across the fields, his harness hanging to him, wolves at his heels. But the groom\u2019s movement had given Pavel an idea. They were within a few miles of their village now. The only sledge left out of six was not very far behind them, and Pavel\u2019s middle horse was failing. Beside a frozen pond something happened to the other sledge; Peter saw it plainly. Three big wolves got abreast of the horses, and the horses went crazy. They tried to jump over each other, got tangled up in the harness, and overturned the sledge. When the shrieking behind them died away, Pavel realized that he was alone upon the familiar road. \u2018They still come?\u2019 he asked Peter. \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018How many?\u2019 \u2018Twenty, thirty--enough.\u2019 Now his middle horse was being almost dragged by the other two. Pavel gave Peter the reins and stepped carefully into the back of the sledge."], "What convention does Cather challenge with the friendship between Jim and \u00c1ntonia?": [" To speak her name was to call up pictures of people and places, to set a quiet drama going in one\u2019s brain. I had lost sight of her altogether, but Jim had found her again after long years, had renewed a friendship that meant a great deal to him, and out of his busy life had set apart time enough to enjoy that friendship. His mind was full of her that day. He made me see her again, feel her presence, revived all my old affection for her. \u201cI can\u2019t see,\u201d he said impetuously, \u201cwhy you have never written anything about Antonia.\u201d I told him I had always felt that other people--he himself, for one knew her much better than I. I was ready, however, to make an agreement with him; I would set down on paper all that I remembered of Antonia if he would do the same. We might, in this way, get a picture of her. He rumpled his hair with a quick, excited gesture, which with him often announces a new determination, and I could see that my suggestion took hold of him.", " *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MY ANTONIA *** Produced by Judith Boss, and Martin Robb MY ANTONIA By Willa Cather CONTENTS Introduction BOOK I.

He and I are old friends--we grew up together in the same Nebraska town--and we had much to say to each other. While the train flashed through never-ending miles of ripe wheat, by country towns and bright-flowered pastures and oak groves wilting in the sun, we sat in the observation car, where the woodwork was hot to the touch and red dust lay deep over everything.", " Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim. If you\u2019re going to be a preacher, I want you to marry me. You must promise to marry us all, and then baptize the babies.\u2019 Norwegian Anna, always dignified, looked at her reprovingly. \u2018Baptists don\u2019t believe in christening babies, do they, Jim?\u2019 I told her I didn\u2019t know what they believed, and didn\u2019t care, and that I certainly wasn\u2019t going to be a preacher. \u2018That\u2019s too bad,\u2019 Tiny simpered.

You used to teach Tony, didn\u2019t you?\u2019 Antonia broke in. \u2018I\u2019ve set my heart on Jim being a doctor. You\u2019d be good with sick people, Jim. Your grandmother\u2019s trained you up so nice. My papa always said you were an awful smart boy.\u2019 I said I was going to be whatever I pleased. \u2018Won\u2019t you be surprised, Miss Tiny, if I turn out to be a regular devil of a fellow?\u2019 They laughed until a glance from Norwegian Anna checked them; the high-school principal had just come into the front part of the shop to buy bread for supper.", " Suddenly her eyes widened, her whole face seemed to grow broader. She caught her breath and put out two hard-worked hands. \u2018Why, it\u2019s Jim! Anna, Yulka, it\u2019s Jim Burden!\u2019 She had no sooner caught my hands than she looked alarmed. \u2018What\u2019s happened? Is anybody dead?\u2019 I patted her arm. \u2018No. I didn\u2019t come to a funeral this time. I got off the train at Hastings and drove down to see you and your family.\u2019 She dropped my hand and began rushing about. \u2018Anton, Yulka, Nina, where are you all? Run, Anna, and hunt for the boys. They\u2019re off looking for that dog, somewhere. And call Leo. Where is that Leo!\u2019 She pulled them out of corners and came bringing them like a mother cat bringing in her kittens. \u2018You don\u2019t have to go right off, Jim? My oldest boy\u2019s not here. He\u2019s gone with papa to the street fair at Wilber. I won\u2019t let you go! You\u2019ve got to stay and see Rudolph and our papa.\u2019 She looked at me imploringly, panting with excitement."], "What animal attacks Jim and \u00c1ntonia on their walk home from Peter\u2019s?": [" He was usually called \u2018Curly Peter,\u2019 or \u2018Rooshian Peter.\u2019 The two Russians made good farm-hands, and in summer they worked out together. I had heard our neighbours laughing when they told how Peter always had to go home at night to milk his cow. Other bachelor homesteaders used canned milk, to save trouble. Sometimes Peter came to church at the sod schoolhouse. It was there I first saw him, sitting on a low bench by the door, his plush cap in his hands, his bare feet tucked apologetically under the seat. After Mr. Shimerda discovered the Russians, he went to see them almost every evening, and sometimes took Antonia with him. She said they came from a part of Russia where the language was not very different from Bohemian, and if I wanted to go to their place, she could talk to them for me. One afternoon, before the heavy frosts began, we rode up there together on my pony. The Russians had a neat log house built on a grassy slope, with a windlass well beside the door.", " Wherever they went, the story followed them. It took them five years to save money enough to come to America. They worked in Chicago, Des Moines, Fort Wayne, but they were always unfortunate. When Pavel\u2019s health grew so bad, they decided to try farming. Pavel died a few days after he unburdened his mind to Mr. Shimerda, and was buried in the Norwegian graveyard.

Everyone said Peter kissed the cow before she was led away by her new owner.", " Just as they were leaving, Russian Peter drove up. Pavel was very bad, he said, and wanted to talk to Mr. Shimerda and his daughter; he had come to fetch them. When Antonia and her father got into the wagon, I entreated grandmother to let me go with them: I would gladly go without my supper, I would sleep in the Shimerdas\u2019 barn and run home in the morning. My plan must have seemed very foolish to her, but she was often large-minded about humouring the desires of other people. She asked Peter to wait a moment, and when she came back from the kitchen she brought a bag of sandwiches and doughnuts for us. Mr. Shimerda and Peter were on the front seat; Antonia and I sat in the straw behind and ate our lunch as we bumped along. After the sun sank, a cold wind sprang up and moaned over the prairie. If this turn in the weather had come sooner, I should not have got away. We burrowed down in the straw and curled up close together, watching the angry red die out of the west and the stars begin to shine in the clear, windy sky.", " His spine and shoulder-blades stood out like the bones under the hide of a dead steer left in the fields. That sharp backbone must have hurt him when he lay on it. Gradually, relief came to all of us. Whatever it was, the worst was over. Mr. Shimerda signed to us that Pavel was asleep. Without a word Peter got up and lit his lantern. He was going out to get his team to drive us home. Mr. Shimerda went with him. We sat and watched the long bowed back under the blue sheet, scarcely daring to breathe. On the way home, when we were lying in the straw, under the jolting and rattling Antonia told me as much of the story as she could. What she did not tell me then, she told later; we talked of nothing else for days afterward. When Pavel and Peter were young men, living at home in Russia, they were asked to be groomsmen for a friend who was to marry the belle of another village. It was in the dead of winter and the groom\u2019s party went over to the wedding in sledges."], "When speaking to \u00c1ntonia, what does Jim refer to Virginia as?": [" Antonia came in and stood before me; a stalwart, brown woman, flat-chested, her curly brown hair a little grizzled. It was a shock, of course. It always is, to meet people after long years, especially if they have lived as much and as hard as this woman had. We stood looking at each other. The eyes that peered anxiously at me were--simply Antonia\u2019s eyes. I had seen no others like them since I looked into them last, though I had looked at so many thousands of human faces. As I confronted her, the changes grew less apparent to me, her identity stronger. She was there, in the full vigour of her personality, battered but not diminished, looking at me, speaking to me in the husky, breathy voice I remembered so well. \u2018My husband\u2019s not at home, sir. Can I do anything?\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t you remember me, Antonia? Have I changed so much?\u2019 She frowned into the slanting sunlight that made her brown hair look redder than it was.", " Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim. If you\u2019re going to be a preacher, I want you to marry me. You must promise to marry us all, and then baptize the babies.\u2019 Norwegian Anna, always dignified, looked at her reprovingly. \u2018Baptists don\u2019t believe in christening babies, do they, Jim?\u2019 I told her I didn\u2019t know what they believed, and didn\u2019t care, and that I certainly wasn\u2019t going to be a preacher. \u2018That\u2019s too bad,\u2019 Tiny simpered. She was in a teasing mood. \u2018You\u2019d make such a good one. You\u2019re so studious. Maybe you\u2019d like to be a professor. You used to teach Tony, didn\u2019t you?\u2019 Antonia broke in. \u2018I\u2019ve set my heart on Jim being a doctor. You\u2019d be good with sick people, Jim. Your grandmother\u2019s trained you up so nice. My papa always said you were an awful smart boy.\u2019 I said I was going to be whatever I pleased. \u2018Won\u2019t you be surprised, Miss Tiny, if I turn out to be a regular devil of a fellow?\u2019 They laughed until a glance from Norwegian Anna checked them; the high-school principal had just come into the front part of the shop to buy bread for supper.", " He had wilfully stayed the short summer night there, wrapped in his coat and rug, watching the constellations on their path down the sky until \u2018the bride of old Tithonus\u2019 rose out of the sea, and the mountains stood sharp in the dawn. It was there he caught the fever which held him back on the eve of his departure for Greece and of which he lay ill so long in Naples. He was still, indeed, doing penance for it. I remember vividly another evening, when something led us to talk of Dante\u2019s veneration for Virgil. Cleric went through canto after canto of the \u2018Commedia,\u2019 repeating the discourse between Dante and his \u2018sweet teacher,\u2019 while his cigarette burned itself out unheeded between his long fingers. I can hear him now, speaking the lines of the poet Statius, who spoke for Dante: \u2018I was famous on earth with the name which endures longest and honours most. The seeds of my ardour were the sparks from that divine flame whereby more than a thousand have kindled; I speak of the \u201cAeneid,\u201d mother to me and nurse to me in poetry.\u2019 Although I admired scholarship so much in Cleric, I was not deceived about myself; I knew that I should never be a scholar.", " Suddenly her eyes widened, her whole face seemed to grow broader. She caught her breath and put out two hard-worked hands. \u2018Why, it\u2019s Jim! Anna, Yulka, it\u2019s Jim Burden!\u2019 She had no sooner caught my hands than she looked alarmed. \u2018What\u2019s happened? Is anybody dead?\u2019 I patted her arm. \u2018No. I didn\u2019t come to a funeral this time. I got off the train at Hastings and drove down to see you and your family.\u2019 She dropped my hand and began rushing about. \u2018Anton, Yulka, Nina, where are you all? Run, Anna, and hunt for the boys. They\u2019re off looking for that dog, somewhere. And call Leo. Where is that Leo!\u2019 She pulled them out of corners and came bringing them like a mother cat bringing in her kittens. \u2018You don\u2019t have to go right off, Jim? My oldest boy\u2019s not here. He\u2019s gone with papa to the street fair at Wilber. I won\u2019t let you go! You\u2019ve got to stay and see Rudolph and our papa.\u2019 She looked at me imploringly, panting with excitement."], "While reading from the Book of Matthew, how does the story of Jesus seem to Jim?": [" *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MY ANTONIA *** Produced by Judith Boss, and Martin Robb MY ANTONIA By Willa Cather CONTENTS Introduction BOOK I.

Cuzak\u2019s Boys TO CARRIE AND IRENE MINER In memory of affections old and true Optima dies... prima fugit VIRGIL INTRODUCTION LAST summer I happened to be crossing the plains of Iowa in a season of intense heat, and it was my good fortune to have for a traveling companion James Quayle Burden--Jim Burden, as we still call him in the West. He and I are old friends--we grew up together in the same Nebraska town--and we had much to say to each other. While the train flashed through never-ending miles of ripe wheat, by country towns and bright-flowered pastures and oak groves wilting in the sun, we sat in the observation car, where the woodwork was hot to the touch and red dust lay deep over everything.", " \u2018I\u2019ve come to town to work, too, Tony.\u2019 \u2018Have you, now? Well, ain\u2019t that funny!\u2019 Antonia stood ill at ease, and didn\u2019t seem to know just what to do with her visitor. The door was open into the dining-room, where Mrs. Harling sat crocheting and Frances was reading. Frances asked Lena to come in and join them. \u2018You are Lena Lingard, aren\u2019t you? I\u2019ve been to see your mother, but you were off herding cattle that day. Mama, this is Chris Lingard\u2019s oldest girl.\u2019 Mrs. Harling dropped her worsted and examined the visitor with quick, keen eyes. Lena was not at all disconcerted. She sat down in the chair Frances pointed out, carefully arranging her pocket-book and grey cotton gloves on her lap. We followed with our popcorn, but Antonia hung back--said she had to get her cake into the oven. \u2018So you have come to town,\u2019 said Mrs. Harling, her eyes still fixed on Lena. \u2018Where are you working?\u2019 \u2018For Mrs. Thomas, the dressmaker.", " She turned to Otto and whispered, \u2018Can\u2019t you start a hymn, Fuchs? It would seem less heathenish.\u2019 Fuchs glanced about to see if there was general approval of her suggestion, then began, \u2018Jesus, Lover of my Soul,\u2019 and all the men and women took it up after him. Whenever I have heard the hymn since, it has made me remember that white waste and the little group of people; and the bluish air, full of fine, eddying snow, like long veils flying: \u2018While the nearer waters roll, While the tempest still is high.\u2019 Years afterward, when the open-grazing days were over, and the red grass had been ploughed under and under until it had almost disappeared from the prairie; when all the fields were under fence, and the roads no longer ran about like wild things, but followed the surveyed section-lines, Mr. Shimerda\u2019s grave was still there, with a sagging wire fence around it, and an unpainted wooden cross.", " She seemed to think that my elders withheld helpful information, and that from me she might get valuable secrets. On this occasion she asked me very craftily when grandfather expected to begin planting corn. I told her, adding that he thought we should have a dry spring and that the corn would not be held back by too much rain, as it had been last year. She gave me a shrewd glance. \u2018He not Jesus,\u2019 she blustered; \u2018he not know about the wet and the dry. I did not answer her; what was the use? As I sat waiting for the hour when Ambrosch and Antonia would return from the fields, I watched Mrs. Shimerda at her work. She took from the oven a coffee-cake which she wanted to keep warm for supper, and wrapped it in a quilt stuffed with feathers. I have seen her put even a roast goose in this quilt to keep it hot. When the neighbours were there building the new house, they saw her do this, and the story got abroad that the Shimerdas kept their food in their featherbeds."], "What news does Jim wake up to after the second blizzard?": [" A tall woman, with wrinkled brown skin and black hair, stood looking down at me; I knew that she must be my grandmother. She had been crying, I could see, but when I opened my eyes she smiled, peered at me anxiously, and sat down on the foot of my bed. \u2018Had a good sleep, Jimmy?\u2019 she asked briskly. Then in a very different tone she said, as if to herself, \u2018My, how you do look like your father!\u2019 I remembered that my father had been her little boy; she must often have come to wake him like this when he overslept. \u2018Here are your clean clothes,\u2019 she went on, stroking my coverlid with her brown hand as she talked. \u2018But first you come down to the kitchen with me, and have a nice warm bath behind the stove. Bring your things; there\u2019s nobody about.\u2019 \u2018Down to the kitchen\u2019 struck me as curious; it was always \u2018out in the kitchen\u2019 at home. I picked up my shoes and stockings and followed her through the living-room and down a flight of stairs into a basement.", " Had they not been dehorned, they would have torn each other to pieces. Pretty soon the fat steers took it up and began butting and horning each other. Clearly, the affair had to be stopped. We all stood by and watched admiringly while Fuchs rode into the corral with a pitchfork and prodded the bulls again and again, finally driving them apart. The big storm of the winter began on my eleventh birthday, the twentieth of January. When I went down to breakfast that morning, Jake and Otto came in white as snow-men, beating their hands and stamping their feet. They began to laugh boisterously when they saw me, calling: \u2018You\u2019ve got a birthday present this time, Jim, and no mistake. They was a full-grown blizzard ordered for you.\u2019 All day the storm went on. The snow did not fall this time, it simply spilled out of heaven, like thousands of featherbeds being emptied. That afternoon the kitchen was a carpenter-shop; the men brought in their tools and made two great wooden shovels with long handles.", " They did not take the path around the pond, but plunged through the muddy water, without even lifting their skirts. They came on, screaming and clawing the air. By this time Ambrosch had come to his senses and was sputtering with nosebleed. Jake sprang into his saddle. \u2018Let\u2019s get out of this, Jim,\u2019 he called. Mrs. Shimerda threw her hands over her head and clutched as if she were going to pull down lightning. \u2018Law, law!\u2019 she shrieked after us. \u2018Law for knock my Ambrosch down!\u2019 \u2018I never like you no more, Jake and Jim Burden,\u2019 Antonia panted. \u2018No friends any more!\u2019 Jake stopped and turned his horse for a second. \u2018Well, you\u2019re a damned ungrateful lot, the whole pack of you,\u2019 he shouted back. \u2018I guess the Burdens can get along without you. You\u2019ve been a sight of trouble to them, anyhow!\u2019 We rode away, feeling so outraged that the fine morning was spoiled for us. I hadn\u2019t a word to say, and poor Jake was white as paper and trembling all over.", " His iron constitution was somewhat broken by mountain pneumonia, and he had drifted back to live in a milder country for a while. He had relatives in Bismarck, a German settlement to the north of us, but for a year now he had been working for grandfather. The minute supper was over, Otto took me into the kitchen to whisper to me about a pony down in the barn that had been bought for me at a sale; he had been riding him to find out whether he had any bad tricks, but he was a \u2018perfect gentleman,\u2019 and his name was Dude. Fuchs told me everything I wanted to know: how he had lost his ear in a Wyoming blizzard when he was a stage-driver, and how to throw a lasso. He promised to rope a steer for me before sundown next day. He got out his \u2018chaps\u2019 and silver spurs to show them to Jake and me, and his best cowboy boots, with tops stitched in bold design--roses, and true-lover\u2019s knots, and undraped female figures."], "What does Jim identify as the cause of Mr. Shimerda\u2019s death?": [" Grandfather and Jelinek came to tell Mrs. Shimerda that it was time to start. After bundling her mother up in clothes the neighbours had brought, Antonia put on an old cape from our house and the rabbit-skin hat her father had made for her. Four men carried Mr. Shimerda\u2019s box up the hill; Krajiek slunk along behind them. The coffin was too wide for the door, so it was put down on the slope outside. I slipped out from the cave and looked at Mr. Shimerda. He was lying on his side, with his knees drawn up. His body was draped in a black shawl, and his head was bandaged in white muslin, like a mummy\u2019s; one of his long, shapely hands lay out on the black cloth; that was all one could see of him. Mrs. Shimerda came out and placed an open prayer-book against the body, making the sign of the cross on the bandaged head with her fingers. Ambrosch knelt down and made the same gesture, and after him Antonia and Marek.", " \u2018Oh, I\u2019m not worrying, Mrs. Burden! I can bring something out of that girl. She\u2019s barely seventeen, not too old to learn new ways. She\u2019s good-looking, too!\u2019 she added warmly. Frances turned to grandmother. \u2018Oh, yes, Mrs. Burden, you didn\u2019t tell us that! She was working in the garden when we got there, barefoot and ragged. But she has such fine brown legs and arms, and splendid colour in her cheeks--like those big dark red plums.\u2019 We were pleased at this praise. Grandmother spoke feelingly. \u2018When she first came to this country, Frances, and had that genteel old man to watch over her, she was as pretty a girl as ever I saw. But, dear me, what a life she\u2019s led, out in the fields with those rough threshers! Things would have been very different with poor Antonia if her father had lived.\u2019 The Harlings begged us to tell them about Mr. Shimerda\u2019s death and the big snowstorm. By the time we saw grandfather coming home from church, we had told them pretty much all we knew of the Shimerdas.", " Antonia stuck her fork in the ground, and instinctively we walked toward that unploughed patch at the crossing of the roads as the fittest place to talk to each other. We sat down outside the sagging wire fence that shut Mr. Shimerda\u2019s plot off from the rest of the world. The tall red grass had never been cut there. It had died down in winter and come up again in the spring until it was as thick and shrubby as some tropical garden-grass. I found myself telling her everything: why I had decided to study law and to go into the law office of one of my mother\u2019s relatives in New York City; about Gaston Cleric\u2019s death from pneumonia last winter, and the difference it had made in my life. She wanted to know about my friends, and my way of living, and my dearest hopes. \u2018Of course it means you are going away from us for good,\u2019 she said with a sigh. \u2018But that don\u2019t mean I\u2019ll lose you. Look at my papa here; he\u2019s been dead all these years, and yet he is more real to me than almost anybody else.", " I looked forward to any new crisis with delight. What could it be, I wondered, as I hurried into my clothes. Perhaps the barn had burned; perhaps the cattle had frozen to death; perhaps a neighbour was lost in the storm. Down in the kitchen grandfather was standing before the stove with his hands behind him. Jake and Otto had taken off their boots and were rubbing their woollen socks. Their clothes and boots were steaming, and they both looked exhausted. On the bench behind the stove lay a man, covered up with a blanket. Grandmother motioned me to the dining-room. I obeyed reluctantly. I watched her as she came and went, carrying dishes. Her lips were tightly compressed and she kept whispering to herself: \u2018Oh, dear Saviour!\u2019 \u2018Lord, Thou knowest!\u2019 Presently grandfather came in and spoke to me: \u2018Jimmy, we will not have prayers this morning, because we have a great deal to do. Old Mr. Shimerda is dead, and his family are in great distress."], "Why will none of the graveyards accept Mr. Shimerda?": [" Grandfather and Jelinek came to tell Mrs. Shimerda that it was time to start. After bundling her mother up in clothes the neighbours had brought, Antonia put on an old cape from our house and the rabbit-skin hat her father had made for her.

Ambrosch knelt down and made the same gesture, and after him Antonia and Marek.", " Even Nina played the Swedish Wedding March. Mrs. Harling had studied the piano under a good teacher, and somehow she managed to practise every day. I soon learned that if I were sent over on an errand and found Mrs. Harling at the piano, I must sit down and wait quietly until she turned to me. I can see her at this moment: her short, square person planted firmly on the stool, her little fat hands moving quickly and neatly over the keys, her eyes fixed on the music with intelligent concentration. IV \u2018I won\u2019t have none of your weevily wheat, and I won\u2019t have none of your barley, But I\u2019ll take a measure of fine white flour, to make a cake for Charley.\u2019 WE WERE SINGING rhymes to tease Antonia while she was beating up one of Charley\u2019s favourite cakes in her big mixing-bowl. It was a crisp autumn evening, just cold enough to make one glad to quit playing tag in the yard, and retreat into the kitchen.", " Only Leo was unmoved. \u2018And there\u2019s Mr. Harling, in his grand fur coat. He was awfully rich, wasn\u2019t he, mother?\u2019 \u2018He wasn\u2019t any Rockefeller,\u2019 put in Master Leo, in a very low tone, which reminded me of the way in which Mrs. Shimerda had once said that my grandfather \u2018wasn\u2019t Jesus.\u2019 His habitual scepticism was like a direct inheritance from that old woman. \u2018None of your smart speeches,\u2019 said Ambrosch severely. Leo poked out a supple red tongue at him, but a moment later broke into a giggle at a tintype of two men, uncomfortably seated, with an awkward-looking boy in baggy clothes standing between them: Jake and Otto and I! We had it taken, I remembered, when we went to Black Hawk on the first Fourth of July I spent in Nebraska. I was glad to see Jake\u2019s grin again, and Otto\u2019s ferocious moustaches. The young Cuzaks knew all about them. \u2018He made grandfather\u2019s coffin, didn\u2019t he?\u2019 Anton asked. \u2018Wasn\u2019t they good fellows, Jim?\u2019 Antonia\u2019s eyes filled.", " They were all eager for any details about the suicide, and they were greatly concerned as to where Mr. Shimerda would be buried. The nearest Catholic cemetery was at Black Hawk, and it might be weeks before a wagon could get so far. Besides, Mr. Bushy and grandmother were sure that a man who had killed himself could not be buried in a Catholic graveyard. There was a burying-ground over by the Norwegian church, west of Squaw Creek; perhaps the Norwegians would take Mr. Shimerda in. After our visitors rode away in single file over the hill, we returned to the kitchen. Grandmother began to make the icing for a chocolate cake, and Otto again filled the house with the exciting, expectant song of the plane. One pleasant thing about this time was that everybody talked more than usual. I had never heard the postmaster say anything but \u2018Only papers, to-day,\u2019 or, \u2018I\u2019ve got a sackful of mail for ye,\u2019 until this afternoon."], "Where does Ambrosch believe his father has been sent after his death?": [" He told me he had a nice \u2018lady-teacher\u2019 and that he liked to go to school. At dinner grandfather talked to Jelinek more than he usually did to strangers. \u2018Will they be much disappointed because we cannot get a priest?\u2019 he asked. Jelinek looked serious. \u2018Yes, sir, that is very bad for them. Their father has done a great sin\u2019--he looked straight at grandfather. \u2018Our Lord has said that.\u2019 Grandfather seemed to like his frankness. \u2018We believe that, too, Jelinek. But we believe that Mr. Shimerda\u2019s soul will come to its Creator as well off without a priest. We believe that Christ is our only intercessor.\u2019 The young man shook his head. \u2018I know how you think. My teacher at the school has explain. But I have seen too much. I believe in prayer for the dead. I have seen too much.\u2019 We asked him what he meant. He glanced around the table. \u2018You want I shall tell you? When I was a little boy like this one, I begin to help the priest at the altar.", " My schoolmates were none of them very interesting, but I somehow felt that, by making comrades of them, I was getting even with Antonia for her indifference. Since the father\u2019s death, Ambrosch was more than ever the head of the house, and he seemed to direct the feelings as well as the fortunes of his womenfolk. Antonia often quoted his opinions to me, and she let me see that she admired him, while she thought of me only as a little boy. Before the spring was over, there was a distinct coldness between us and the Shimerdas. It came about in this way. One Sunday I rode over there with Jake to get a horse-collar which Ambrosch had borrowed from him and had not returned. It was a beautiful blue morning. The buffalo-peas were blooming in pink and purple masses along the roadside, and the larks, perched on last year\u2019s dried sunflower stalks, were singing straight at the sun, their heads thrown back and their yellow breasts a-quiver.", " \u2018Why he not help my papa? Ambrosch be rich, too, after while, and he pay back. He is very smart boy. For Ambrosch my mama come here.\u2019 Ambrosch was considered the important person in the family. Mrs. Shimerda and Antonia always deferred to him, though he was often surly with them and contemptuous toward his father. Ambrosch and his mother had everything their own way. Though Antonia loved her father more than she did anyone else, she stood in awe of her elder brother. After I watched Antonia and her mother go over the hill on their miserable horse, carrying our iron pot with them, I turned to grandmother, who had taken up her darning, and said I hoped that snooping old woman wouldn\u2019t come to see us any more. Grandmother chuckled and drove her bright needle across a hole in Otto\u2019s sock. \u2018She\u2019s not old, Jim, though I expect she seems old to you. No, I wouldn\u2019t mourn if she never came again.", " They talked about their school and the new teacher, told me about the crops and the harvest, and how many steers they would feed that winter. They were easy and confidential with me, as if I were an old friend of the family--and not too old. I felt like a boy in their company, and all manner of forgotten interests revived in me. It seemed, after all, so natural to be walking along a barbed-wire fence beside the sunset, toward a red pond, and to see my shadow moving along at my right, over the close-cropped grass. \u2018Has mother shown you the pictures you sent her from the old country?\u2019 Ambrosch asked. \u2018We\u2019ve had them framed and they\u2019re hung up in the parlour. She was so glad to get them. I don\u2019t believe I ever saw her so pleased about anything.\u2019 There was a note of simple gratitude in his voice that made me wish I had given more occasion for it. I put my hand on his shoulder. \u2018Your mother, you know, was very much loved by all of us."], "What role does \u00c1ntonia take in relation to Jim\u2019s leisured thinker?": [" I walked with her to the door. \u2018Come and see me sometimes when you\u2019re lonesome. But maybe you have all the friends you want. Have you?\u2019 She turned her soft cheek to me. \u2018Have you?\u2019 she whispered teasingly in my ear. In a moment I watched her fade down the dusky stairway. When I turned back to my room the place seemed much pleasanter than before. Lena had left something warm and friendly in the lamplight. How I loved to hear her laugh again! It was so soft and unexcited and appreciative gave a favourable interpretation to everything. When I closed my eyes I could hear them all laughing--the Danish laundry girls and the three Bohemian Marys. Lena had brought them all back to me. It came over me, as it had never done before, the relation between girls like those and the poetry of Virgil. If there were no girls like them in the world, there would be no poetry. I understood that clearly, for the first time.", " Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim. If you\u2019re going to be a preacher, I want you to marry me. You must promise to marry us all, and then baptize the babies.\u2019 Norwegian Anna, always dignified, looked at her reprovingly. \u2018Baptists don\u2019t believe in christening babies, do they, Jim?\u2019 I told her I didn\u2019t know what they believed, and didn\u2019t care, and that I certainly wasn\u2019t going to be a preacher. \u2018That\u2019s too bad,\u2019 Tiny simpered. She was in a teasing mood. \u2018You\u2019d make such a good one. You\u2019re so studious. Maybe you\u2019d like to be a professor. You used to teach Tony, didn\u2019t you?\u2019 Antonia broke in. \u2018I\u2019ve set my heart on Jim being a doctor. You\u2019d be good with sick people, Jim. Your grandmother\u2019s trained you up so nice. My papa always said you were an awful smart boy.\u2019 I said I was going to be whatever I pleased. \u2018Won\u2019t you be surprised, Miss Tiny, if I turn out to be a regular devil of a fellow?\u2019 They laughed until a glance from Norwegian Anna checked them; the high-school principal had just come into the front part of the shop to buy bread for supper.", " I guess Jim could take care of their silver and old usury notes as well as you could.\u2019 Antonia turned to me eagerly. \u2018Oh, would you, Jim? I\u2019d make up my bed nice and fresh for you. It\u2019s a real cool room, and the bed\u2019s right next the window. I was afraid to leave the window open last night.\u2019 I liked my own room, and I didn\u2019t like the Cutters\u2019 house under any circumstances; but Tony looked so troubled that I consented to try this arrangement. I found that I slept there as well as anywhere, and when I got home in the morning, Tony had a good breakfast waiting for me. After prayers she sat down at the table with us, and it was like old times in the country. The third night I spent at the Cutters\u2019, I awoke suddenly with the impression that I had heard a door open and shut. Everything was still, however, and I must have gone to sleep again immediately. The next thing I knew, I felt someone sit down on the edge of the bed.", " \u2018The girl will be happy here, and she\u2019ll forget those things,\u2019 said Mrs. Harling confidently, as we rose to take our leave. III ON SATURDAY AMBROSCH drove up to the back gate, and Antonia jumped down from the wagon and ran into our kitchen just as she used to do. She was wearing shoes and stockings, and was breathless and excited. She gave me a playful shake by the shoulders. \u2018You ain\u2019t forget about me, Jim?\u2019 Grandmother kissed her. \u2018God bless you, child! Now you\u2019ve come, you must try to do right and be a credit to us.\u2019 Antonia looked eagerly about the house and admired everything. \u2018Maybe I be the kind of girl you like better; now I come to town,\u2019 she suggested hopefully. How good it was to have Antonia near us again; to see her every day and almost every night! Her greatest fault, Mrs. Harling found, was that she so often stopped her work and fell to playing with the children. She would race about the orchard with us, or take sides in our hay-fights in the barn, or be the old bear that came down from the mountain and carried off Nina."], "Whom does Mrs. Burden convince the Harlings to hire?": [" We found Mrs. Harling with Charley and Sally on the front porch, resting after her hard drive. Julia was in the hammock--she was fond of repose--and Frances was at the piano, playing without a light and talking to her mother through the open window. Mrs. Harling laughed when she saw us coming. \u2018I expect you left your dishes on the table tonight, Mrs. Burden,\u2019 she called. Frances shut the piano and came out to join us. They had liked Antonia from their first glimpse of her; felt they knew exactly what kind of girl she was. As for Mrs. Shimerda, they found her very amusing. Mrs. Harling chuckled whenever she spoke of her. \u2018I expect I am more at home with that sort of bird than you are, Mrs. Burden. They\u2019re a pair, Ambrosch and that old woman!\u2019 They had had a long argument with Ambrosch about Antonia\u2019s allowance for clothes and pocket-money. It was his plan that every cent of his sister\u2019s wages should be paid over to him each month, and he would provide her with such clothing as he thought necessary.", " \u2018Oh, I\u2019m not worrying, Mrs. Burden! I can bring something out of that girl. She\u2019s barely seventeen, not too old to learn new ways. She\u2019s good-looking, too!\u2019 she added warmly. Frances turned to grandmother. \u2018Oh, yes, Mrs. Burden, you didn\u2019t tell us that! She was working in the garden when we got there, barefoot and ragged. But she has such fine brown legs and arms, and splendid colour in her cheeks--like those big dark red plums.\u2019 We were pleased at this praise. Grandmother spoke feelingly. \u2018When she first came to this country, Frances, and had that genteel old man to watch over her, she was as pretty a girl as ever I saw. But, dear me, what a life she\u2019s led, out in the fields with those rough threshers! Things would have been very different with poor Antonia if her father had lived.\u2019 The Harlings begged us to tell them about Mr. Shimerda\u2019s death and the big snowstorm. By the time we saw grandfather coming home from church, we had told them pretty much all we knew of the Shimerdas.", " If we ran out and questioned him as he was slipping through the yard, he would merely work his shoulders about in his coat and say, \u2018They all right, I guess.\u2019 Mrs. Steavens, who now lived on our farm, grew as fond of Antonia as we had been, and always brought us news of her. All through the wheat season, she told us, Ambrosch hired his sister out like a man, and she went from farm to farm, binding sheaves or working with the threshers. The farmers liked her and were kind to her; said they would rather have her for a hand than Ambrosch. When fall came she was to husk corn for the neighbours until Christmas, as she had done the year before; but grandmother saved her from this by getting her a place to work with our neighbours, the Harlings.

She\u2019s housekeeper. Mrs. Gardener\u2019s health isn\u2019t what it was, and she can\u2019t see after everything like she used to. She has great confidence in Tony. Tony\u2019s made it up with the Harlings, too. Little Nina is so fond of her that Mrs. Harling kind of overlooked things.\u2019 \u2018Is she still going with Larry Donovan?\u2019 \u2018Oh, that\u2019s on, worse than ever! I guess they\u2019re engaged. Tony talks about him like he was president of the railroad. Everybody laughs about it, because she was never a girl to be soft. She won\u2019t hear a word against him. She\u2019s so sort of innocent.\u2019 I said I didn\u2019t like Larry, and never would. Lena\u2019s face dimpled. \u2018Some of us could tell her things, but it wouldn\u2019t do any good. She\u2019d always believe him. That\u2019s Antonia\u2019s failing, you know; if she once likes people, she won\u2019t hear anything against them.\u2019 \u2018I think I\u2019d better go home and look after Antonia,\u2019 I said."], "What is the title of Book II?": [" *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MY ANTONIA *** Produced by Judith Boss, and Martin Robb MY ANTONIA By Willa Cather CONTENTS Introduction BOOK I.

There had been a warm thaw all day, with mushy yards and little streams of dark water gurgling cheerfully into the streets out of old snow-banks. My window was open, and the earthy wind blowing through made me indolent. On the edge of the prairie, where the sun had gone down, the sky was turquoise blue, like a lake, with gold light throbbing in it. Higher up, in the utter clarity of the western slope, the evening star hung like a lamp suspended by silver chains--like the lamp engraved upon the title-page of old Latin texts, which is always appearing in new heavens, and waking new desires in men. It reminded me, at any rate, to shut my window and light my wick in answer. I did so regretfully, and the dim objects in the room emerged from the shadows and took their place about me with the helpfulness which custom breeds.", " \u2018I like your grandmother, and all things here,\u2019 she sighed. \u2018I wish my papa live to see this summer.

Why do you all the time try to be like Ambrosch?\u2019 She put her arms under her head and lay back, looking up at the sky. \u2018If I live here, like you, that is different.

He was usually cold and distant with men, but with all women he had a silent, grave familiarity, a special handshake, accompanied by a significant, deliberate look. He took women, married or single, into his confidence; walked them up and down in the moonlight, telling them what a mistake he had made by not entering the office branch of the service, and how much better fitted he was to fill the post of General Passenger Agent in Denver than the rough-shod man who then bore that title. His unappreciated worth was the tender secret Larry shared with his sweethearts, and he was always able to make some foolish heart ache over it. As I drew near home that morning, I saw Mrs. Harling out in her yard, digging round her mountain-ash tree.

The old figure stirred me as it had never done before and seemed a good omen for the winter. As soon as the snow had packed hard, I began to drive about the country in a clumsy sleigh that Otto Fuchs made for me by fastening a wooden goods-box on bobs. Fuchs had been apprenticed to a cabinetmaker in the old country and was very handy with tools. He would have done a better job if I hadn\u2019t hurried him. My first trip was to the post-office, and the next day I went over to take Yulka and Antonia for a sleigh-ride. It was a bright, cold day. I piled straw and buffalo robes into the box, and took two hot bricks wrapped in old blankets. When I got to the Shimerdas\u2019, I did not go up to the house, but sat in my sleigh at the bottom of the draw and called.", " While we were disputing \u2018about the ring, I heard a mournful voice calling, \u2018Antonia, Antonia!\u2019 She sprang up like a hare. \u2018Tatinek! Tatinek!\u2019 she shouted, and we ran to meet the old man who was coming toward us. Antonia reached him first, took his hand and kissed it. When I came up, he touched my shoulder and looked searchingly down into my face for several seconds. I became somewhat embarrassed, for I was used to being taken for granted by my elders. We went with Mr. Shimerda back to the dugout, where grandmother was waiting for me. Before I got into the wagon, he took a book out of his pocket, opened it, and showed me a page with two alphabets, one English and the other Bohemian. He placed this book in my grandmother\u2019s hands, looked at her entreatingly, and said, with an earnestness which I shall never forget, \u2018Te-e-ach, te-e-ach my Antonia!\u2019 IV ON THE AFTERNOON of that same Sunday I took my first long ride on my pony, under Otto\u2019s direction."], "What character\u2019s insensitive characterization makes him / her offensive to modern readers?": [" Her conception of the character was as heavy and uncompromising as her diction; she bore hard on the idea and on the consonants. At all times she was highly tragic, devoured by remorse. Lightness of stress or behaviour was far from her. Her voice was heavy and deep: \u2018Ar-r-r-mond!\u2019 she would begin, as if she were summoning him to the bar of Judgment. But the lines were enough. She had only to utter them. They created the character in spite of her. The heartless world which Marguerite re-entered with Varville had never been so glittering and reckless as on the night when it gathered in Olympe\u2019s salon for the fourth act. There were chandeliers hung from the ceiling, I remember, many servants in livery, gaming-tables where the men played with piles of gold, and a staircase down which the guests made their entrance. After all the others had gathered round the card-tables and young Duval had been warned by Prudence, Marguerite descended the staircase with Varville; such a cloak, such a fan, such jewels--and her face!", " When I sat at work I half-faced a deep, upholstered chair which stood at the end of my table, its high back against the wall.

He was, I had discovered, parsimonious about small expenditures--a trait absolutely inconsistent with his general character. Sometimes when he came he was silent and moody, and after a few sarcastic remarks went away again, to tramp the streets of Lincoln, which were almost as quiet and oppressively domestic as those of Black Hawk. Again, he would sit until nearly midnight, talking about Latin and English poetry, or telling me about his long stay in Italy.", " \u2018This old chap will be proposing to you some day, Lena.\u2019 \u2018Oh, he has--often!\u2019 she murmured. \u2018What! After you\u2019ve refused him?\u2019 \u2018He doesn\u2019t mind that. It seems to cheer him to mention the subject. Old men are like that, you know.

I hope you won\u2019t marry some old fellow; not even a rich one.\u2019 Lena shifted her pillows and looked up at me in surprise. \u2018Why, I\u2019m not going to marry anybody.

Every handsome girl like you marries, of course.\u2019 She shook her head. \u2018Not me.\u2019 \u2018But why not? What makes you say that?\u2019 I persisted. Lena laughed. \u2018Well, it\u2019s mainly because I don\u2019t want a husband. Men are all right for friends, but as soon as you marry them they turn into cranky old fathers, even the wild ones. They begin to tell you what\u2019s sensible and what\u2019s foolish, and want you to stick at home all the time.", " Antonia had the most trusting, responsive eyes in the world; love and credulousness seemed to look out of them with open faces. \u2018Why didn\u2019t you ever tell me that before? It makes me feel more sure for him.\u2019 After a while she said: \u2018You know, Jim, my father was different from my mother. He did not have to marry my mother, and all his brothers quarrelled with him because he did. I used to hear the old people at home whisper about it. They said he could have paid my mother money, and not married her. But he was older than she was, and he was too kind to treat her like that. He lived in his mother\u2019s house, and she was a poor girl come in to do the work. After my father married her, my grandmother never let my mother come into her house again. When I went to my grandmother\u2019s funeral was the only time I was ever in my grandmother\u2019s house.

The nearest Catholic cemetery was at Black Hawk, and it might be weeks before a wagon could get so far. Besides, Mr. Bushy and grandmother were sure that a man who had killed himself could not be buried in a Catholic graveyard. There was a burying-ground over by the Norwegian church, west of Squaw Creek; perhaps the Norwegians would take Mr. Shimerda in. After our visitors rode away in single file over the hill, we returned to the kitchen. Grandmother began to make the icing for a chocolate cake, and Otto again filled the house with the exciting, expectant song of the plane. One pleasant thing about this time was that everybody talked more than usual. I had never heard the postmaster say anything but \u2018Only papers, to-day,\u2019 or, \u2018I\u2019ve got a sackful of mail for ye,\u2019 until this afternoon.", " At supper the men ate like vikings, and the chocolate cake, which I had hoped would linger on until tomorrow in a mutilated condition, disappeared on the second round. They talked excitedly about where they should bury Mr. Shimerda; I gathered that the neighbours were all disturbed and shocked about something. It developed that Mrs. Shimerda and Ambrosch wanted the old man buried on the southwest corner of their own land; indeed, under the very stake that marked the corner. Grandfather had explained to Ambrosch that some day, when the country was put under fence and the roads were confined to section lines, two roads would cross exactly on that corner. But Ambrosch only said, \u2018It makes no matter.\u2019 Grandfather asked Jelinek whether in the old country there was some superstition to the effect that a suicide must be buried at the cross-roads. Jelinek said he didn\u2019t know; he seemed to remember hearing there had once been such a custom in Bohemia."], "What relationship(s) does Jim carry out despite community disapproval?": [" I make my first communion very young; what the Church teach seem plain to me.

All day long our priest go about there to give the Sacrament to dying men, and I go with him to carry the vessels with the Holy Sacrament. Everybody that go near that camp catch the sickness but me and the priest. But we have no sickness, we have no fear, because we carry that blood and that body of Christ, and it preserve us.\u2019 He paused, looking at grandfather. \u2018That I know, Mr. Burden, for it happened to myself. All the soldiers know, too. When we walk along the road, the old priest and me, we meet all the time soldiers marching and officers on horse. All those officers, when they see what I carry under the cloth, pull up their horses and kneel down on the ground in the road until we pass.", " Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim. If you\u2019re going to be a preacher, I want you to marry me. You must promise to marry us all, and then baptize the babies.\u2019 Norwegian Anna, always dignified, looked at her reprovingly. \u2018Baptists don\u2019t believe in christening babies, do they, Jim?\u2019 I told her I didn\u2019t know what they believed, and didn\u2019t care, and that I certainly wasn\u2019t going to be a preacher. \u2018That\u2019s too bad,\u2019 Tiny simpered.

She would have made us comfortable if she could. But that was no life for a girl! After I began to herd and milk, I could never get the smell of the cattle off me. The few underclothes I had I kept in a cracker-box. On Saturday nights, after everybody was in bed, then I could take a bath if I wasn\u2019t too tired. I could make two trips to the windmill to carry water, and heat it in the wash-boiler on the stove. While the water was heating, I could bring in a washtub out of the cave, and take my bath in the kitchen. Then I could put on a clean night-gown and get into bed with two others, who likely hadn\u2019t had a bath unless I\u2019d given it to them. You can\u2019t tell me anything about family life.

A farmer\u2019s daughter who was to be married could count on a wedding present from Frances Harling. In August the Harlings\u2019 Danish cook had to leave them. Grandmother entreated them to try Antonia. She cornered Ambrosch the next time he came to town, and pointed out to him that any connection with Christian Harling would strengthen his credit and be of advantage to him. One Sunday Mrs. Harling took the long ride out to the Shimerdas\u2019 with Frances. She said she wanted to see \u2018what the girl came from\u2019 and to have a clear understanding with her mother. I was in our yard when they came driving home, just before sunset. They laughed and waved to me as they passed, and I could see they were in great good humour. After supper, when grandfather set off to church, grandmother and I took my short cut through the willow hedge and went over to hear about the visit to the Shimerdas\u2019.", " If we ran out and questioned him as he was slipping through the yard, he would merely work his shoulders about in his coat and say, \u2018They all right, I guess.\u2019 Mrs. Steavens, who now lived on our farm, grew as fond of Antonia as we had been, and always brought us news of her.

Deep down in each of them there was a kind of hearty joviality, a relish of life, not over-delicate, but very invigorating. I never tried to define it, but I was distinctly conscious of it. I could not imagine Antonia\u2019s living for a week in any other house in Black Hawk than the Harlings\u2019. VII WINTER LIES TOO LONG in country towns; hangs on until it is stale and shabby, old and sullen. On the farm the weather was the great fact, and men\u2019s affairs went on underneath it, as the streams creep under the ice. But in Black Hawk the scene of human life was spread out shrunken and pinched, frozen down to the bare stalk. Through January and February I went to the river with the Harlings on clear nights, and we skated up to the big island and made bonfires on the frozen sand. But by March the ice was rough and choppy, and the snow on the river bluffs was grey and mournful-looking.", " She was a beautiful girl.\u2019 \u2018Oh, we know!\u2019 They both spoke together; seemed a little surprised that I should think it necessary to mention this. \u2018Everybody liked her, didn\u2019t they? The Harlings and your grandmother, and all the town people.\u2019 \u2018Sometimes,\u2019 I ventured, \u2018it doesn\u2019t occur to boys that their mother was ever young and pretty.\u2019 \u2018Oh, we know!\u2019 they said again, warmly. \u2018She\u2019s not very old now,\u2019 Ambrosch added. \u2018Not much older than you.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 I said, \u2018if you weren\u2019t nice to her, I think I\u2019d take a club and go for the whole lot of you. I couldn\u2019t stand it if you boys were inconsiderate, or thought of her as if she were just somebody who looked after you. You see I was very much in love with your mother once, and I know there\u2019s nobody like her.\u2019 The boys laughed and seemed pleased and embarrassed. \u2018She never told us that,\u2019 said Anton. \u2018But she\u2019s always talked lots about you, and about what good times you used to have."], "Whom does Jim dedicate his oration to during his school commencement?": [" \u2018Mama is as broad-minded as mothers ever are, I guess. But you know she was hurt about Antonia, and she can\u2019t understand why you like to be with Tiny and Lena better than with the girls of your own set.\u2019 \u2018Can you?\u2019 I asked bluntly. Frances laughed. \u2018Yes, I think I can. You knew them in the country, and you like to take sides. In some ways you\u2019re older than boys of your age. It will be all right with mama after you pass your college examinations and she sees you\u2019re in earnest.\u2019 \u2018If you were a boy,\u2019 I persisted, \u2018you wouldn\u2019t belong to the Owl Club, either. You\u2019d be just like me.\u2019 She shook her head. \u2018I would and I wouldn\u2019t. I expect I know the country girls better than you do. You always put a kind of glamour over them. The trouble with you, Jim, is that you\u2019re romantic. Mama\u2019s going to your Commencement. She asked me the other day if I knew what your oration is to be about. She wants you to do well.\u2019 I thought my oration very good.", " Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim. If you\u2019re going to be a preacher, I want you to marry me. You must promise to marry us all, and then baptize the babies.\u2019 Norwegian Anna, always dignified, looked at her reprovingly. \u2018Baptists don\u2019t believe in christening babies, do they, Jim?\u2019 I told her I didn\u2019t know what they believed, and didn\u2019t care, and that I certainly wasn\u2019t going to be a preacher. \u2018That\u2019s too bad,\u2019 Tiny simpered. She was in a teasing mood. \u2018You\u2019d make such a good one. You\u2019re so studious. Maybe you\u2019d like to be a professor. You used to teach Tony, didn\u2019t you?\u2019 Antonia broke in. \u2018I\u2019ve set my heart on Jim being a doctor. You\u2019d be good with sick people, Jim. Your grandmother\u2019s trained you up so nice. My papa always said you were an awful smart boy.\u2019 I said I was going to be whatever I pleased. \u2018Won\u2019t you be surprised, Miss Tiny, if I turn out to be a regular devil of a fellow?\u2019 They laughed until a glance from Norwegian Anna checked them; the high-school principal had just come into the front part of the shop to buy bread for supper.", " It stated with fervour a great many things I had lately discovered. Mrs. Harling came to the Opera House to hear the Commencement exercises, and I looked at her most of the time while I made my speech. Her keen, intelligent eyes never left my face. Afterward she came back to the dressing-room where we stood, with our diplomas in our hands, walked up to me, and said heartily: \u2018You surprised me, Jim. I didn\u2019t believe you could do as well as that. You didn\u2019t get that speech out of books.\u2019 Among my graduation presents there was a silk umbrella from Mrs. Harling, with my name on the handle. I walked home from the Opera House alone. As I passed the Methodist Church, I saw three white figures ahead of me, pacing up and down under the arching maple trees, where the moonlight filtered through the lush June foliage. They hurried toward me; they were waiting for me--Lena and Tony and Anna Hansen. \u2018Oh, Jim, it was splendid!\u2019 Tony was breathing hard, as she always did when her feelings outran her language.", " \u2018Jim, you ask Jake how much he ploughed to-day. I don\u2019t want that Jake get more done in one day than me. I want we have very much corn this fall.\u2019 While the horses drew in the water, and nosed each other, and then drank again, Antonia sat down on the windmill step and rested her head on her hand. \u2018You see the big prairie fire from your place last night? I hope your grandpa ain\u2019t lose no stacks?\u2019 \u2018No, we didn\u2019t. I came to ask you something, Tony. Grandmother wants to know if you can\u2019t go to the term of school that begins next week over at the sod schoolhouse. She says there\u2019s a good teacher, and you\u2019d learn a lot.\u2019 Antonia stood up, lifting and dropping her shoulders as if they were stiff. \u2018I ain\u2019t got time to learn. I can work like mans now. My mother can\u2019t say no more how Ambrosch do all and nobody to help him. I can work as much as him. School is all right for little boys. I help make this land one good farm.\u2019 She clucked to her team and started for the barn."], "What about \u00c1ntonia most impresses Jim?": [" Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim.

She caught her breath and put out two hard-worked hands. \u2018Why, it\u2019s Jim! Anna, Yulka, it\u2019s Jim Burden!\u2019 She had no sooner caught my hands than she looked alarmed. \u2018What\u2019s happened? Is anybody dead?\u2019 I patted her arm. \u2018No. I didn\u2019t come to a funeral this time. I got off the train at Hastings and drove down to see you and your family.\u2019 She dropped my hand and began rushing about. \u2018Anton, Yulka, Nina, where are you all? Run, Anna, and hunt for the boys. They\u2019re off looking for that dog, somewhere. And call Leo. Where is that Leo!\u2019 She pulled them out of corners and came bringing them like a mother cat bringing in her kittens. \u2018You don\u2019t have to go right off, Jim? My oldest boy\u2019s not here. He\u2019s gone with papa to the street fair at Wilber. I won\u2019t let you go! You\u2019ve got to stay and see Rudolph and our papa.\u2019 She looked at me imploringly, panting with excitement.", " \u2018She\u2019s Nina, after Nina Harling,\u2019 Antonia explained. \u2018Ain\u2019t her eyes like Nina\u2019s? I declare, Jim, I loved you children almost as much as I love my own. These children know all about you and Charley and Sally, like as if they\u2019d grown up with you. I can\u2019t think of what I want to say, you\u2019ve got me so stirred up. And then, I\u2019ve forgot my English so. I don\u2019t often talk it any more. I tell the children I used to speak real well.\u2019 She said they always spoke Bohemian at home. The little ones could not speak English at all--didn\u2019t learn it until they went to school. \u2018I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s you, sitting here, in my own kitchen. You wouldn\u2019t have known me, would you, Jim? You\u2019ve kept so young, yourself. But it\u2019s easier for a man. I can\u2019t see how my Anton looks any older than the day I married him. His teeth have kept so nice. I haven\u2019t got many left. But I feel just as young as I used to, and I can do as much work.", " XIII I NOTICED ONE AFTERNOON that grandmother had been crying. Her feet seemed to drag as she moved about the house, and I got up from the table where I was studying and went to her, asking if she didn\u2019t feel well, and if I couldn\u2019t help her with her work. \u2018No, thank you, Jim. I\u2019m troubled, but I guess I\u2019m well enough. Getting a little rusty in the bones, maybe,\u2019 she added bitterly. I stood hesitating. \u2018What are you fretting about, grandmother? Has grandfather lost any money?\u2019 \u2018No, it ain\u2019t money. I wish it was. But I\u2019ve heard things. You must \u2018a\u2019 known it would come back to me sometime.\u2019 She dropped into a chair, and, covering her face with her apron, began to cry. \u2018Jim,\u2019 she said, \u2018I was never one that claimed old folks could bring up their grandchildren. But it came about so; there wasn\u2019t any other way for you, it seemed like.\u2019 I put my arms around her. I couldn\u2019t bear to see her cry."], "What does Cather use to symbolize the helplessness of humankind in the face of greater forces?": [" The crude reds and greens and blues of that coloured glass held us there. On winter nights, the lights in the Harlings\u2019 windows drew me like the painted glass. Inside that warm, roomy house there was colour, too. After supper I used to catch up my cap, stick my hands in my pockets, and dive through the willow hedge as if witches were after me. Of course, if Mr. Harling was at home, if his shadow stood out on the blind of the west room, I did not go in, but turned and walked home by the long way, through the street, wondering what book I should read as I sat down with the two old people. Such disappointments only gave greater zest to the nights when we acted charades, or had a costume ball in the back parlour, with Sally always dressed like a boy. Frances taught us to dance that winter, and she said, from the first lesson, that Antonia would make the best dancer among us. On Saturday nights, Mrs. Harling used to play the old operas for us--\u2018Martha,\u2019 \u2018Norma,\u2019 \u2018Rigoletto\u2019--telling us the story while she played.", " *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MY ANTONIA *** Produced by Judith Boss, and Martin Robb MY ANTONIA By Willa Cather CONTENTS Introduction BOOK I.

Cuzak\u2019s Boys TO CARRIE AND IRENE MINER In memory of affections old and true Optima dies... prima fugit VIRGIL INTRODUCTION LAST summer I happened to be crossing the plains of Iowa in a season of intense heat, and it was my good fortune to have for a traveling companion James Quayle Burden--Jim Burden, as we still call him in the West. He and I are old friends--we grew up together in the same Nebraska town--and we had much to say to each other. While the train flashed through never-ending miles of ripe wheat, by country towns and bright-flowered pastures and oak groves wilting in the sun, we sat in the observation car, where the woodwork was hot to the touch and red dust lay deep over everything.", " One knew at a glance how it was with her. When Armand, with the terrible words, \u2018Look, all of you, I owe this woman nothing!\u2019 flung the gold and bank-notes at the half-swooning Marguerite, Lena cowered beside me and covered her face with her hands. The curtain rose on the bedroom scene. By this time there wasn\u2019t a nerve in me that hadn\u2019t been twisted. Nanine alone could have made me cry. I loved Nanine tenderly; and Gaston, how one clung to that good fellow! The New Year\u2019s presents were not too much; nothing could be too much now. I wept unrestrainedly. Even the handkerchief in my breast-pocket, worn for elegance and not at all for use, was wet through by the time that moribund woman sank for the last time into the arms of her lover. When we reached the door of the theatre, the streets were shining with rain. I had prudently brought along Mrs. Harling\u2019s useful Commencement present, and I took Lena home under its shelter.", " The door from the office opened, and Johnnie Gardener came in, directing Blind d\u2019Arnault--he would never consent to be led. He was a heavy, bulky mulatto, on short legs, and he came tapping the floor in front of him with his gold-headed cane. His yellow face was lifted in the light, with a show of white teeth, all grinning, and his shrunken, papery eyelids lay motionless over his blind eyes. \u2018Good evening, gentlemen. No ladies here? Good evening, gentlemen. We going to have a little music? Some of you gentlemen going to play for me this evening?\u2019 It was the soft, amiable Negro voice, like those I remembered from early childhood, with the note of docile subservience in it. He had the Negro head, too; almost no head at all; nothing behind the ears but folds of neck under close-clipped wool. He would have been repulsive if his face had not been so kindly and happy. It was the happiest face I had seen since I left Virginia."], "What does Jim study at Lincoln?": [" At last she sent me away with her soft, slow, renunciatory kiss. \u2018You aren\u2019t sorry I came to see you that time?\u2019 she whispered. \u2018It seemed so natural. I used to think I\u2019d like to be your first sweetheart. You were such a funny kid!\u2019 She always kissed one as if she were sadly and wisely sending one away forever. We said many good-byes before I left Lincoln, but she never tried to hinder me or hold me back. \u2018You are going, but you haven\u2019t gone yet, have you?\u2019 she used to say. My Lincoln chapter closed abruptly. I went home to my grandparents for a few weeks, and afterward visited my relatives in Virginia until I joined Cleric in Boston. I was then nineteen years old. BOOK IV. The Pioneer Woman\u2019s Story I TWO YEARS AFTER I left Lincoln, I completed my academic course at Harvard. Before I entered the Law School I went home for the summer vacation. On the night of my arrival, Mrs. Harling and Frances and Sally came over to greet me.", " Before I had got far with my reading, I was disturbed by a knock. I hurried to the door and when I opened it saw a woman standing in the dark hall. \u2018I expect you hardly know me, Jim.\u2019 The voice seemed familiar, but I did not recognize her until she stepped into the light of my doorway and I beheld--Lena Lingard! She was so quietly conventionalized by city clothes that I might have passed her on the street without seeing her. Her black suit fitted her figure smoothly, and a black lace hat, with pale-blue forget-me-nots, sat demurely on her yellow hair. I led her toward Cleric\u2019s chair, the only comfortable one I had, questioning her confusedly. She was not disconcerted by my embarrassment. She looked about her with the naive curiosity I remembered so well. \u2018You are quite comfortable here, aren\u2019t you? I live in Lincoln now, too, Jim. I\u2019m in business for myself. I have a dressmaking shop in the Raleigh Block, out on O Street.", " Antonia stuck her fork in the ground, and instinctively we walked toward that unploughed patch at the crossing of the roads as the fittest place to talk to each other. We sat down outside the sagging wire fence that shut Mr. Shimerda\u2019s plot off from the rest of the world. The tall red grass had never been cut there. It had died down in winter and come up again in the spring until it was as thick and shrubby as some tropical garden-grass. I found myself telling her everything: why I had decided to study law and to go into the law office of one of my mother\u2019s relatives in New York City; about Gaston Cleric\u2019s death from pneumonia last winter, and the difference it had made in my life. She wanted to know about my friends, and my way of living, and my dearest hopes. \u2018Of course it means you are going away from us for good,\u2019 she said with a sigh. \u2018But that don\u2019t mean I\u2019ll lose you. Look at my papa here; he\u2019s been dead all these years, and yet he is more real to me than almost anybody else.", " When I took my entrance examinations, he was my examiner, and my course was arranged under his supervision. I did not go home for my first summer vacation, but stayed in Lincoln, working off a year\u2019s Greek, which had been my only condition on entering the freshman class. Cleric\u2019s doctor advised against his going back to New England, and, except for a few weeks in Colorado, he, too, was in Lincoln all that summer. We played tennis, read, and took long walks together. I shall always look back on that time of mental awakening as one of the happiest in my life. Gaston Cleric introduced me to the world of ideas; when one first enters that world everything else fades for a time, and all that went before is as if it had not been. Yet I found curious survivals; some of the figures of my old life seemed to be waiting for me in the new. In those days there were many serious young men among the students who had come up to the university from the farms and the little towns scattered over the thinly settled state."], "What play deeply affects Jim and Lena?": [" To my astonishment, grandfather replied that I might go if I wished. I was both glad and sorry on the day when the letter came. I stayed in my room all evening and thought things over. I even tried to persuade myself that I was standing in Lena\u2019s way--it is so necessary to be a little noble!--and that if she had not me to play with, she would probably marry and secure her future. The next evening I went to call on Lena. I found her propped up on the couch in her bay-window, with her foot in a big slipper. An awkward little Russian girl whom she had taken into her work-room had dropped a flat-iron on Lena\u2019s toe. On the table beside her there was a basket of early summer flowers which the Pole had left after he heard of the accident. He always managed to know what went on in Lena\u2019s apartment. Lena was telling me some amusing piece of gossip about one of her clients, when I interrupted her and picked up the flower basket.", " This revelation seemed to me inestimably precious. I clung to it as if it might suddenly vanish. As I sat down to my book at last, my old dream about Lena coming across the harvest-field in her short skirt seemed to me like the memory of an actual experience. It floated before me on the page like a picture, and underneath it stood the mournful line: \u2018Optima dies... prima fugit.\u2019 III IN LINCOLN THE BEST part of the theatrical season came late, when the good companies stopped off there for one-night stands, after their long runs in New York and Chicago. That spring Lena went with me to see Joseph Jefferson in \u2018Rip Van Winkle,\u2019 and to a war play called \u2018Shenandoah.\u2019 She was inflexible about paying for her own seat; said she was in business now, and she wouldn\u2019t have a schoolboy spending his money on her. I liked to watch a play with Lena; everything was wonderful to her, and everything was true.", " We had neither of us read the play, and we did not know what it was about--though I seemed to remember having heard it was a piece in which great actresses shone. \u2018The Count of Monte Cristo,\u2019 which I had seen James O\u2019Neill play that winter, was by the only Alexandre Dumas I knew. This play, I saw, was by his son, and I expected a family resemblance. A couple of jack-rabbits, run in off the prairie, could not have been more innocent of what awaited them than were Lena and I. Our excitement began with the rise of the curtain, when the moody Varville, seated before the fire, interrogated Nanine. Decidedly, there was a new tang about this dialogue. I had never heard in the theatre lines that were alive, that presupposed and took for granted, like those which passed between Varville and Marguerite in the brief encounter before her friends entered. This introduced the most brilliant, worldly, the most enchantingly gay scene I had ever looked upon.", " \u2018I\u2019ve got a good nose for directions, and I never did need much sleep. It\u2019s the grey I\u2019m worried about. I\u2019ll save him what I can, but it\u2019ll strain him, as sure as I\u2019m telling you!\u2019 \u2018This is no time to be over-considerate of animals, Otto; do the best you can for yourself. Stop at the Widow Steavens\u2019s for dinner. She\u2019s a good woman, and she\u2019ll do well by you.\u2019 After Fuchs rode away, I was left with Ambrosch. I saw a side of him I had not seen before. He was deeply, even slavishly, devout. He did not say a word all morning, but sat with his rosary in his hands, praying, now silently, now aloud. He never looked away from his beads, nor lifted his hands except to cross himself. Several times the poor boy fell asleep where he sat, wakened with a start, and began to pray again. No wagon could be got to the Shimerdas\u2019 until a road was broken, and that would be a day\u2019s job. Grandfather came from the barn on one of our big black horses, and Jake lifted grandmother up behind him."], "What concept most affects Jim during his studies?": [" Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim. If you\u2019re going to be a preacher, I want you to marry me. You must promise to marry us all, and then baptize the babies.\u2019 Norwegian Anna, always dignified, looked at her reprovingly. \u2018Baptists don\u2019t believe in christening babies, do they, Jim?\u2019 I told her I didn\u2019t know what they believed, and didn\u2019t care, and that I certainly wasn\u2019t going to be a preacher. \u2018That\u2019s too bad,\u2019 Tiny simpered. She was in a teasing mood. \u2018You\u2019d make such a good one. You\u2019re so studious. Maybe you\u2019d like to be a professor. You used to teach Tony, didn\u2019t you?\u2019 Antonia broke in. \u2018I\u2019ve set my heart on Jim being a doctor. You\u2019d be good with sick people, Jim.

I couldn\u2019t bear to see her cry."], "Who acts as a link between Jim\u2019s past and present in Lincoln?": [" At last she sent me away with her soft, slow, renunciatory kiss. \u2018You aren\u2019t sorry I came to see you that time?\u2019 she whispered. \u2018It seemed so natural. I used to think I\u2019d like to be your first sweetheart. You were such a funny kid!\u2019 She always kissed one as if she were sadly and wisely sending one away forever. We said many good-byes before I left Lincoln, but she never tried to hinder me or hold me back. \u2018You are going, but you haven\u2019t gone yet, have you?\u2019 she used to say. My Lincoln chapter closed abruptly. I went home to my grandparents for a few weeks, and afterward visited my relatives in Virginia until I joined Cleric in Boston. I was then nineteen years old. BOOK IV. The Pioneer Woman\u2019s Story I TWO YEARS AFTER I left Lincoln, I completed my academic course at Harvard. Before I entered the Law School I went home for the summer vacation. On the night of my arrival, Mrs. Harling and Frances and Sally came over to greet me.", " Between the acts we had no time to forget. The orchestra kept sawing away at the \u2018Traviata\u2019 music, so joyous and sad, so thin and far-away, so clap-trap and yet so heart-breaking. After the second act I left Lena in tearful contemplation of the ceiling, and went out into the lobby to smoke. As I walked about there I congratulated myself that I had not brought some Lincoln girl who would talk during the waits about the junior dances, or whether the cadets would camp at Plattsmouth. Lena was at least a woman, and I was a man. Through the scene between Marguerite and the elder Duval, Lena wept unceasingly, and I sat helpless to prevent the closing of that chapter of idyllic love, dreading the return of the young man whose ineffable happiness was only to be the measure of his fall. I suppose no woman could have been further in person, voice, and temperament from Dumas\u2019 appealing heroine than the veteran actress who first acquainted me with her.", " Had they not been dehorned, they would have torn each other to pieces. Pretty soon the fat steers took it up and began butting and horning each other. Clearly, the affair had to be stopped. We all stood by and watched admiringly while Fuchs rode into the corral with a pitchfork and prodded the bulls again and again, finally driving them apart. The big storm of the winter began on my eleventh birthday, the twentieth of January. When I went down to breakfast that morning, Jake and Otto came in white as snow-men, beating their hands and stamping their feet. They began to laugh boisterously when they saw me, calling: \u2018You\u2019ve got a birthday present this time, Jim, and no mistake. They was a full-grown blizzard ordered for you.\u2019 All day the storm went on. The snow did not fall this time, it simply spilled out of heaven, like thousands of featherbeds being emptied. That afternoon the kitchen was a carpenter-shop; the men brought in their tools and made two great wooden shovels with long handles.", " Before I had got far with my reading, I was disturbed by a knock. I hurried to the door and when I opened it saw a woman standing in the dark hall. \u2018I expect you hardly know me, Jim.\u2019 The voice seemed familiar, but I did not recognize her until she stepped into the light of my doorway and I beheld--Lena Lingard! She was so quietly conventionalized by city clothes that I might have passed her on the street without seeing her. Her black suit fitted her figure smoothly, and a black lace hat, with pale-blue forget-me-nots, sat demurely on her yellow hair. I led her toward Cleric\u2019s chair, the only comfortable one I had, questioning her confusedly. She was not disconcerted by my embarrassment. She looked about her with the naive curiosity I remembered so well. \u2018You are quite comfortable here, aren\u2019t you? I live in Lincoln now, too, Jim. I\u2019m in business for myself.

Cuzak\u2019s Boys TO CARRIE AND IRENE MINER In memory of affections old and true Optima dies... prima fugit VIRGIL INTRODUCTION LAST summer I happened to be crossing the plains of Iowa in a season of intense heat, and it was my good fortune to have for a traveling companion James Quayle Burden--Jim Burden, as we still call him in the West. He and I are old friends--we grew up together in the same Nebraska town--and we had much to say to each other. While the train flashed through never-ending miles of ripe wheat, by country towns and bright-flowered pastures and oak groves wilting in the sun, we sat in the observation car, where the woodwork was hot to the touch and red dust lay deep over everything.", " Whenever one looked at this slope against the setting sun, the circle showed like a pattern in the grass; and this morning, when the first light spray of snow lay over it, it came out with wonderful distinctness, like strokes of Chinese white on canvas. The old figure stirred me as it had never done before and seemed a good omen for the winter. As soon as the snow had packed hard, I began to drive about the country in a clumsy sleigh that Otto Fuchs made for me by fastening a wooden goods-box on bobs. Fuchs had been apprenticed to a cabinetmaker in the old country and was very handy with tools. He would have done a better job if I hadn\u2019t hurried him. My first trip was to the post-office, and the next day I went over to take Yulka and Antonia for a sleigh-ride. It was a bright, cold day. I piled straw and buffalo robes into the box, and took two hot bricks wrapped in old blankets. When I got to the Shimerdas\u2019, I did not go up to the house, but sat in my sleigh at the bottom of the draw and called.", " Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim. If you\u2019re going to be a preacher, I want you to marry me. You must promise to marry us all, and then baptize the babies.\u2019 Norwegian Anna, always dignified, looked at her reprovingly. \u2018Baptists don\u2019t believe in christening babies, do they, Jim?\u2019 I told her I didn\u2019t know what they believed, and didn\u2019t care, and that I certainly wasn\u2019t going to be a preacher. \u2018That\u2019s too bad,\u2019 Tiny simpered. She was in a teasing mood. \u2018You\u2019d make such a good one. You\u2019re so studious. Maybe you\u2019d like to be a professor. You used to teach Tony, didn\u2019t you?\u2019 Antonia broke in. \u2018I\u2019ve set my heart on Jim being a doctor. You\u2019d be good with sick people, Jim. Your grandmother\u2019s trained you up so nice. My papa always said you were an awful smart boy.\u2019 I said I was going to be whatever I pleased. \u2018Won\u2019t you be surprised, Miss Tiny, if I turn out to be a regular devil of a fellow?\u2019 They laughed until a glance from Norwegian Anna checked them; the high-school principal had just come into the front part of the shop to buy bread for supper.", " Suddenly her eyes widened, her whole face seemed to grow broader. She caught her breath and put out two hard-worked hands. \u2018Why, it\u2019s Jim! Anna, Yulka, it\u2019s Jim Burden!\u2019 She had no sooner caught my hands than she looked alarmed. \u2018What\u2019s happened? Is anybody dead?\u2019 I patted her arm. \u2018No. I didn\u2019t come to a funeral this time. I got off the train at Hastings and drove down to see you and your family.\u2019 She dropped my hand and began rushing about. \u2018Anton, Yulka, Nina, where are you all? Run, Anna, and hunt for the boys. They\u2019re off looking for that dog, somewhere. And call Leo. Where is that Leo!\u2019 She pulled them out of corners and came bringing them like a mother cat bringing in her kittens. \u2018You don\u2019t have to go right off, Jim? My oldest boy\u2019s not here. He\u2019s gone with papa to the street fair at Wilber. I won\u2019t let you go! You\u2019ve got to stay and see Rudolph and our papa.\u2019 She looked at me imploringly, panting with excitement."], "Who has taken over the Burden\u2019s old farmland?": [" \u2018Oh, I\u2019m not worrying, Mrs. Burden! I can bring something out of that girl. She\u2019s barely seventeen, not too old to learn new ways. She\u2019s good-looking, too!\u2019 she added warmly. Frances turned to grandmother. \u2018Oh, yes, Mrs. Burden, you didn\u2019t tell us that! She was working in the garden when we got there, barefoot and ragged. But she has such fine brown legs and arms, and splendid colour in her cheeks--like those big dark red plums.\u2019 We were pleased at this praise. Grandmother spoke feelingly. \u2018When she first came to this country, Frances, and had that genteel old man to watch over her, she was as pretty a girl as ever I saw. But, dear me, what a life she\u2019s led, out in the fields with those rough threshers! Things would have been very different with poor Antonia if her father had lived.\u2019 The Harlings begged us to tell them about Mr. Shimerda\u2019s death and the big snowstorm. By the time we saw grandfather coming home from church, we had told them pretty much all we knew of the Shimerdas.", " Nevertheless, after I went to bed, this idea of punishment and Purgatory came back on me crushingly. I remembered the account of Dives in torment, and shuddered. But Mr. Shimerda had not been rich and selfish: he had only been so unhappy that he could not live any longer. XV OTTO FUCHS GOT back from Black Hawk at noon the next day. He reported that the coroner would reach the Shimerdas\u2019 sometime that afternoon, but the missionary priest was at the other end of his parish, a hundred miles away, and the trains were not running. Fuchs had got a few hours\u2019 sleep at the livery barn in town, but he was afraid the grey gelding had strained himself. Indeed, he was never the same horse afterward. That long trip through the deep snow had taken all the endurance out of him. Fuchs brought home with him a stranger, a young Bohemian who had taken a homestead near Black Hawk, and who came on his only horse to help his fellow countrymen in their trouble.", " \u2018Why he not help my papa? Ambrosch be rich, too, after while, and he pay back. He is very smart boy. For Ambrosch my mama come here.\u2019 Ambrosch was considered the important person in the family. Mrs. Shimerda and Antonia always deferred to him, though he was often surly with them and contemptuous toward his father. Ambrosch and his mother had everything their own way. Though Antonia loved her father more than she did anyone else, she stood in awe of her elder brother. After I watched Antonia and her mother go over the hill on their miserable horse, carrying our iron pot with them, I turned to grandmother, who had taken up her darning, and said I hoped that snooping old woman wouldn\u2019t come to see us any more. Grandmother chuckled and drove her bright needle across a hole in Otto\u2019s sock. \u2018She\u2019s not old, Jim, though I expect she seems old to you. No, I wouldn\u2019t mourn if she never came again.", " We found Mrs. Harling with Charley and Sally on the front porch, resting after her hard drive. Julia was in the hammock--she was fond of repose--and Frances was at the piano, playing without a light and talking to her mother through the open window. Mrs. Harling laughed when she saw us coming. \u2018I expect you left your dishes on the table tonight, Mrs. Burden,\u2019 she called. Frances shut the piano and came out to join us. They had liked Antonia from their first glimpse of her; felt they knew exactly what kind of girl she was. As for Mrs. Shimerda, they found her very amusing. Mrs. Harling chuckled whenever she spoke of her. \u2018I expect I am more at home with that sort of bird than you are, Mrs. Burden. They\u2019re a pair, Ambrosch and that old woman!\u2019 They had had a long argument with Ambrosch about Antonia\u2019s allowance for clothes and pocket-money. It was his plan that every cent of his sister\u2019s wages should be paid over to him each month, and he would provide her with such clothing as he thought necessary."], "What does \u00c1ntonia manage to conceal from her family beneath for bulky clothes?": [" I looked forward to any new crisis with delight. What could it be, I wondered, as I hurried into my clothes. Perhaps the barn had burned; perhaps the cattle had frozen to death; perhaps a neighbour was lost in the storm. Down in the kitchen grandfather was standing before the stove with his hands behind him. Jake and Otto had taken off their boots and were rubbing their woollen socks. Their clothes and boots were steaming, and they both looked exhausted. On the bench behind the stove lay a man, covered up with a blanket. Grandmother motioned me to the dining-room. I obeyed reluctantly. I watched her as she came and went, carrying dishes. Her lips were tightly compressed and she kept whispering to herself: \u2018Oh, dear Saviour!\u2019 \u2018Lord, Thou knowest!\u2019 Presently grandfather came in and spoke to me: \u2018Jimmy, we will not have prayers this morning, because we have a great deal to do. Old Mr. Shimerda is dead, and his family are in great distress.", " The door from the office opened, and Johnnie Gardener came in, directing Blind d\u2019Arnault--he would never consent to be led. He was a heavy, bulky mulatto, on short legs, and he came tapping the floor in front of him with his gold-headed cane. His yellow face was lifted in the light, with a show of white teeth, all grinning, and his shrunken, papery eyelids lay motionless over his blind eyes. \u2018Good evening, gentlemen. No ladies here? Good evening, gentlemen. We going to have a little music? Some of you gentlemen going to play for me this evening?\u2019 It was the soft, amiable Negro voice, like those I remembered from early childhood, with the note of docile subservience in it. He had the Negro head, too; almost no head at all; nothing behind the ears but folds of neck under close-clipped wool. He would have been repulsive if his face had not been so kindly and happy. It was the happiest face I had seen since I left Virginia.", " Which field?\u2019 \u2018He with the sod corn.\u2019 She pointed toward the north, still standing in front of the cow as if she hoped to conceal it. \u2018His sod corn will be good for fodder this winter,\u2019 said grandfather encouragingly. \u2018And where is Antonia?\u2019 \u2018She go with.\u2019 Mrs. Shimerda kept wiggling her bare feet about nervously in the dust. \u2018Very well. I will ride up there. I want them to come over and help me cut my oats and wheat next month. I will pay them wages. Good morning. By the way, Mrs. Shimerda,\u2019 he said as he turned up the path, \u2018I think we may as well call it square about the cow.\u2019 She started and clutched the rope tighter. Seeing that she did not understand, grandfather turned back. \u2018You need not pay me anything more; no more money. The cow is yours.\u2019 \u2018Pay no more, keep cow?\u2019 she asked in a bewildered tone, her narrow eyes snapping at us in the sunlight. \u2018Exactly. Pay no more, keep cow.\u2019 He nodded.", " You won\u2019t hasten the day none that way.\u201d \u2018Then she\u2019d laugh and slow down for a little, but she\u2019d soon forget and begin to pedal and sing again. I never saw a girl work harder to go to housekeeping right and well-prepared. Lovely table-linen the Harlings had given her, and Lena Lingard had sent her nice things from Lincoln. We hemstitched all the tablecloths and pillow-cases, and some of the sheets. Old Mrs. Shimerda knit yards and yards of lace for her underclothes. Tony told me just how she meant to have everything in her house. She\u2019d even bought silver spoons and forks, and kept them in her trunk. She was always coaxing brother to go to the post-office. Her young man did write her real often, from the different towns along his run. \u2018The first thing that troubled her was when he wrote that his run had been changed, and they would likely have to live in Denver. \u201cI\u2019m a country girl,\u201d she said, \u201cand I doubt if I\u2019ll be able to manage so well for him in a city."], "Where does Jim go to study law?": [" Antonia stuck her fork in the ground, and instinctively we walked toward that unploughed patch at the crossing of the roads as the fittest place to talk to each other. We sat down outside the sagging wire fence that shut Mr. Shimerda\u2019s plot off from the rest of the world. The tall red grass had never been cut there. It had died down in winter and come up again in the spring until it was as thick and shrubby as some tropical garden-grass. I found myself telling her everything: why I had decided to study law and to go into the law office of one of my mother\u2019s relatives in New York City; about Gaston Cleric\u2019s death from pneumonia last winter, and the difference it had made in my life. She wanted to know about my friends, and my way of living, and my dearest hopes. \u2018Of course it means you are going away from us for good,\u2019 she said with a sigh. \u2018But that don\u2019t mean I\u2019ll lose you. Look at my papa here; he\u2019s been dead all these years, and yet he is more real to me than almost anybody else.", " They did not take the path around the pond, but plunged through the muddy water, without even lifting their skirts. They came on, screaming and clawing the air. By this time Ambrosch had come to his senses and was sputtering with nosebleed. Jake sprang into his saddle. \u2018Let\u2019s get out of this, Jim,\u2019 he called. Mrs. Shimerda threw her hands over her head and clutched as if she were going to pull down lightning. \u2018Law, law!\u2019 she shrieked after us. \u2018Law for knock my Ambrosch down!\u2019 \u2018I never like you no more, Jake and Jim Burden,\u2019 Antonia panted. \u2018No friends any more!\u2019 Jake stopped and turned his horse for a second. \u2018Well, you\u2019re a damned ungrateful lot, the whole pack of you,\u2019 he shouted back. \u2018I guess the Burdens can get along without you. You\u2019ve been a sight of trouble to them, anyhow!\u2019 We rode away, feeling so outraged that the fine morning was spoiled for us. I hadn\u2019t a word to say, and poor Jake was white as paper and trembling all over.", " Suddenly her eyes widened, her whole face seemed to grow broader. She caught her breath and put out two hard-worked hands. \u2018Why, it\u2019s Jim! Anna, Yulka, it\u2019s Jim Burden!\u2019 She had no sooner caught my hands than she looked alarmed. \u2018What\u2019s happened? Is anybody dead?\u2019 I patted her arm. \u2018No. I didn\u2019t come to a funeral this time. I got off the train at Hastings and drove down to see you and your family.\u2019 She dropped my hand and began rushing about. \u2018Anton, Yulka, Nina, where are you all?

My oldest boy\u2019s not here. He\u2019s gone with papa to the street fair at Wilber. I won\u2019t let you go! You\u2019ve got to stay and see Rudolph and our papa.\u2019 She looked at me imploringly, panting with excitement.", " My bedroom, originally a linen-closet, was unheated and was barely large enough to contain my cot-bed, but it enabled me to call the other room my study. The dresser, and the great walnut wardrobe which held all my clothes, even my hats and shoes, I had pushed out of the way, and I considered them non-existent, as children eliminate incongruous objects when they are playing house. I worked at a commodious green-topped table placed directly in front of the west window which looked out over the prairie. In the corner at my right were all my books, in shelves I had made and painted myself. On the blank wall at my left the dark, old-fashioned wall-paper was covered by a large map of ancient Rome, the work of some German scholar. Cleric had ordered it for me when he was sending for books from abroad. Over the bookcase hung a photograph of the Tragic Theatre at Pompeii, which he had given me from his collection."], "What do both \u00c1ntonia and Jim need to come to terms with in order to accept change?": [" Well\u2019--she began to put on her white gloves--\u2018it\u2019s been awful good to see you, Jim.\u2019 \u2018You needn\u2019t hurry, need you? You\u2019ve hardly told me anything yet.\u2019 \u2018We can talk when you come to see me. I expect you don\u2019t often have lady visitors. The old woman downstairs didn\u2019t want to let me come up very much. I told her I was from your home town, and had promised your grandmother to come and see you. How surprised Mrs. Burden would be!\u2019 Lena laughed softly as she rose. When I caught up my hat, she shook her head. \u2018No, I don\u2019t want you to go with me. I\u2019m to meet some Swedes at the drugstore. You wouldn\u2019t care for them. I wanted to see your room so I could write Tony all about it, but I must tell her how I left you right here with your books. She\u2019s always so afraid someone will run off with you!\u2019 Lena slipped her silk sleeves into the jacket I held for her, smoothed it over her person, and buttoned it slowly.", " The country girls were considered a menace to the social order. Their beauty shone out too boldly against a conventional background. But anxious mothers need have felt no alarm. They mistook the mettle of their sons. The respect for respectability was stronger than any desire in Black Hawk youth. Our young man of position was like the son of a royal house; the boy who swept out his office or drove his delivery wagon might frolic with the jolly country girls, but he himself must sit all evening in a plush parlour where conversation dragged so perceptibly that the father often came in and made blundering efforts to warm up the atmosphere. On his way home from his dull call, he would perhaps meet Tony and Lena, coming along the sidewalk whispering to each other, or the three Bohemian Marys in their long plush coats and caps, comporting themselves with a dignity that only made their eventful histories the more piquant.", " Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim. If you\u2019re going to be a preacher, I want you to marry me. You must promise to marry us all, and then baptize the babies.\u2019 Norwegian Anna, always dignified, looked at her reprovingly. \u2018Baptists don\u2019t believe in christening babies, do they, Jim?\u2019 I told her I didn\u2019t know what they believed, and didn\u2019t care, and that I certainly wasn\u2019t going to be a preacher. \u2018That\u2019s too bad,\u2019 Tiny simpered. She was in a teasing mood. \u2018You\u2019d make such a good one. You\u2019re so studious. Maybe you\u2019d like to be a professor. You used to teach Tony, didn\u2019t you?\u2019 Antonia broke in. \u2018I\u2019ve set my heart on Jim being a doctor. You\u2019d be good with sick people, Jim. Your grandmother\u2019s trained you up so nice. My papa always said you were an awful smart boy.\u2019 I said I was going to be whatever I pleased. \u2018Won\u2019t you be surprised, Miss Tiny, if I turn out to be a regular devil of a fellow?\u2019 They laughed until a glance from Norwegian Anna checked them; the high-school principal had just come into the front part of the shop to buy bread for supper.", " He was six foot two, and had a chest like a young blacksmith. \u2018We went to the big dance in the hall behind the saloon last night, mother, and I danced with all the girls, and so did father. I never saw so many pretty girls. It was a Bohunk crowd, for sure. We didn\u2019t hear a word of English on the street, except from the show people, did we, papa?\u2019 Cuzak nodded. \u2018And very many send word to you, Antonia. You will excuse\u2019--turning to me--\u2018if I tell her.\u2019 While we walked toward the house he related incidents and delivered messages in the tongue he spoke fluently, and I dropped a little behind, curious to know what their relations had become--or remained. The two seemed to be on terms of easy friendliness, touched with humour. Clearly, she was the impulse, and he the corrective. As they went up the hill he kept glancing at her sidewise, to see whether she got his point, or how she received it."], "Who stands in contrast to \u00c1ntonia as a successful woman in urban America?": [" It was like this: When Otto left Austria to come to America, he was asked by one of his relatives to look after a woman who was crossing on the same boat, to join her husband in Chicago. The woman started off with two children, but it was clear that her family might grow larger on the journey. Fuchs said he \u2018got on fine with the kids,\u2019 and liked the mother, though she played a sorry trick on him. In mid-ocean she proceeded to have not one baby, but three! This event made Fuchs the object of undeserved notoriety, since he was travelling with her. The steerage stewardess was indignant with him, the doctor regarded him with suspicion. The first-cabin passengers, who made up a purse for the woman, took an embarrassing interest in Otto, and often enquired of him about his charge. When the triplets were taken ashore at New York, he had, as he said, \u2018to carry some of them.\u2019 The trip to Chicago was even worse than the ocean voyage.", " This revelation seemed to me inestimably precious. I clung to it as if it might suddenly vanish. As I sat down to my book at last, my old dream about Lena coming across the harvest-field in her short skirt seemed to me like the memory of an actual experience. It floated before me on the page like a picture, and underneath it stood the mournful line: \u2018Optima dies... prima fugit.\u2019 III IN LINCOLN THE BEST part of the theatrical season came late, when the good companies stopped off there for one-night stands, after their long runs in New York and Chicago. That spring Lena went with me to see Joseph Jefferson in \u2018Rip Van Winkle,\u2019 and to a war play called \u2018Shenandoah.\u2019 She was inflexible about paying for her own seat; said she was in business now, and she wouldn\u2019t have a schoolboy spending his money on her. I liked to watch a play with Lena; everything was wonderful to her, and everything was true.", " Her yellow hair was burned to a ruddy thatch on her head; but her legs and arms, curiously enough, in spite of constant exposure to the sun, kept a miraculous whiteness which somehow made her seem more undressed than other girls who went scantily clad. The first time I stopped to talk to her, I was astonished at her soft voice and easy, gentle ways. The girls out there usually got rough and mannish after they went to herding. But Lena asked Jake and me to get off our horses and stay awhile, and behaved exactly as if she were in a house and were accustomed to having visitors. She was not embarrassed by her ragged clothes, and treated us as if we were old acquaintances. Even then I noticed the unusual colour of her eyes--a shade of deep violet--and their soft, confiding expression. Chris Lingard was not a very successful farmer, and he had a large family. Lena was always knitting stockings for little brothers and sisters, and even the Norwegian women, who disapproved of her, admitted that she was a good daughter to her mother.", " The children were seated according to a system; a little one next an older one, who was to watch over his behaviour and to see that he got his food. Anna and Yulka left their chairs from time to time to bring fresh plates of kolaches and pitchers of milk. After supper we went into the parlour, so that Yulka and Leo could play for me. Antonia went first, carrying the lamp. There were not nearly chairs enough to go round, so the younger children sat down on the bare floor. Little Lucie whispered to me that they were going to have a parlour carpet if they got ninety cents for their wheat. Leo, with a good deal of fussing, got out his violin. It was old Mr. Shimerda\u2019s instrument, which Antonia had always kept, and it was too big for him. But he played very well for a self-taught boy. Poor Yulka\u2019s efforts were not so successful. While they were playing, little Nina got up from her corner, came out into the middle of the floor, and began to do a pretty little dance on the boards with her bare feet."], "At the end of the novel, how long has it been since Jim has visited Nebraska?": [" Don\u2019t you want to go ahead and see her, Jimmy? She\u2019s got the pretty brown eyes, too!\u2019 This last remark made me bashful, and I shook my head and settled down to \u2018Jesse James.\u2019 Jake nodded at me approvingly and said you were likely to get diseases from foreigners. I do not remember crossing the Missouri River, or anything about the long day\u2019s journey through Nebraska. Probably by that time I had crossed so many rivers that I was dull to them. The only thing very noticeable about Nebraska was that it was still, all day long, Nebraska. I had been sleeping, curled up in a red plush seat, for a long while when we reached Black Hawk. Jake roused me and took me by the hand. We stumbled down from the train to a wooden siding, where men were running about with lanterns. I couldn\u2019t see any town, or even distant lights; we were surrounded by utter darkness. The engine was panting heavily after its long run.", " At last she sent me away with her soft, slow, renunciatory kiss. \u2018You aren\u2019t sorry I came to see you that time?\u2019 she whispered. \u2018It seemed so natural. I used to think I\u2019d like to be your first sweetheart. You were such a funny kid!\u2019 She always kissed one as if she were sadly and wisely sending one away forever. We said many good-byes before I left Lincoln, but she never tried to hinder me or hold me back. \u2018You are going, but you haven\u2019t gone yet, have you?\u2019 she used to say. My Lincoln chapter closed abruptly. I went home to my grandparents for a few weeks, and afterward visited my relatives in Virginia until I joined Cleric in Boston. I was then nineteen years old. BOOK IV. The Pioneer Woman\u2019s Story I TWO YEARS AFTER I left Lincoln, I completed my academic course at Harvard. Before I entered the Law School I went home for the summer vacation. On the night of my arrival, Mrs. Harling and Frances and Sally came over to greet me.", " Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim. If you\u2019re going to be a preacher, I want you to marry me. You must promise to marry us all, and then baptize the babies.\u2019 Norwegian Anna, always dignified, looked at her reprovingly. \u2018Baptists don\u2019t believe in christening babies, do they, Jim?\u2019 I told her I didn\u2019t know what they believed, and didn\u2019t care, and that I certainly wasn\u2019t going to be a preacher. \u2018That\u2019s too bad,\u2019 Tiny simpered. She was in a teasing mood. \u2018You\u2019d make such a good one. You\u2019re so studious. Maybe you\u2019d like to be a professor. You used to teach Tony, didn\u2019t you?\u2019 Antonia broke in. \u2018I\u2019ve set my heart on Jim being a doctor. You\u2019d be good with sick people, Jim. Your grandmother\u2019s trained you up so nice. My papa always said you were an awful smart boy.\u2019 I said I was going to be whatever I pleased. \u2018Won\u2019t you be surprised, Miss Tiny, if I turn out to be a regular devil of a fellow?\u2019 They laughed until a glance from Norwegian Anna checked them; the high-school principal had just come into the front part of the shop to buy bread for supper.", " One of them he had taken to Omaha and established in the business for which he had fitted her. He still visited her. Cutter lived in a state of perpetual warfare with his wife, and yet, apparently, they never thought of separating. They dwelt in a fussy, scroll-work house, painted white and buried in thick evergreens, with a fussy white fence and barn. Cutter thought he knew a great deal about horses, and usually had a colt which he was training for the track. On Sunday mornings one could see him out at the fair grounds, speeding around the race-course in his trotting-buggy, wearing yellow gloves and a black-and-white-check travelling cap, his whiskers blowing back in the breeze. If there were any boys about, Cutter would offer one of them a quarter to hold the stop-watch, and then drive off, saying he had no change and would \u2018fix it up next time.\u2019 No one could cut his lawn or wash his buggy to suit him."], "Upon returning, what about Black Hawk disappoints Jim?": [" Yet people saw no difference between her and the three Marys; they were all Bohemians, all \u2018hired girls.\u2019 I always knew I should live long enough to see my country girls come into their own, and I have. To-day the best that a harassed Black Hawk merchant can hope for is to sell provisions and farm machinery and automobiles to the rich farms where that first crop of stalwart Bohemian and Scandinavian girls are now the mistresses. The Black Hawk boys looked forward to marrying Black Hawk girls, and living in a brand-new little house with best chairs that must not be sat upon, and hand-painted china that must not be used. But sometimes a young fellow would look up from his ledger, or out through the grating of his father\u2019s bank, and let his eyes follow Lena Lingard, as she passed the window with her slow, undulating walk, or Tiny Soderball, tripping by in her short skirt and striped stockings.", " If a young man with an idea can once get Jim Burden\u2019s attention, can manage to accompany him when he goes off into the wilds hunting for lost parks or exploring new canyons, then the money which means action is usually forthcoming. Jim is still able to lose himself in those big Western dreams. Though he is over forty now, he meets new people and new enterprises with the impulsiveness by which his boyhood friends remember him. He never seems to me to grow older. His fresh color and sandy hair and quick-changing blue eyes are those of a young man, and his sympathetic, solicitous interest in women is as youthful as it is Western and American. During that burning day when we were crossing Iowa, our talk kept returning to a central figure, a Bohemian girl whom we had known long ago and whom both of us admired. More than any other person we remembered, this girl seemed to mean to us the country, the conditions, the whole adventure of our childhood.", " \u2018I like your grandmother, and all things here,\u2019 she sighed. \u2018I wish my papa live to see this summer. I wish no winter ever come again.\u2019 \u2018It will be summer a long while yet,\u2019 I reassured her. \u2018Why aren\u2019t you always nice like this, Tony?\u2019 \u2018How nice?\u2019 \u2018Why, just like this; like yourself. Why do you all the time try to be like Ambrosch?\u2019 She put her arms under her head and lay back, looking up at the sky. \u2018If I live here, like you, that is different. Things will be easy for you. But they will be hard for us.\u2019 BOOK II. The Hired Girls I I HAD BEEN LIVING with my grandfather for nearly three years when he decided to move to Black Hawk. He and grandmother were getting old for the heavy work of a farm, and as I was now thirteen they thought I ought to be going to school. Accordingly our homestead was rented to \u2018that good woman, the Widow Steavens,\u2019 and her bachelor brother, and we bought Preacher White\u2019s house, at the north end of Black Hawk.", " I may as well ride over this morning and make arrangements. Do you want to go with me, Jim?\u2019 His tone told me that he had already decided for me. After breakfast we set off together. When Mrs. Shimerda saw us coming, she ran from her door down into the draw behind the stable, as if she did not want to meet us. Grandfather smiled to himself while he tied his horse, and we followed her. Behind the barn we came upon a funny sight. The cow had evidently been grazing somewhere in the draw. Mrs. Shimerda had run to the animal, pulled up the lariat pin, and, when we came upon her, she was trying to hide the cow in an old cave in the bank. As the hole was narrow and dark, the cow held back, and the old woman was slapping and pushing at her hind quarters, trying to spank her into the drawside. Grandfather ignored her singular occupation and greeted her politely. \u2018Good morning, Mrs. Shimerda. Can you tell me where I will find Ambrosch?"], "Why is \u00c1ntonia initially unable to recognize Jim?": [" Before I had got far with my reading, I was disturbed by a knock. I hurried to the door and when I opened it saw a woman standing in the dark hall. \u2018I expect you hardly know me, Jim.\u2019 The voice seemed familiar, but I did not recognize her until she stepped into the light of my doorway and I beheld--Lena Lingard! She was so quietly conventionalized by city clothes that I might have passed her on the street without seeing her. Her black suit fitted her figure smoothly, and a black lace hat, with pale-blue forget-me-nots, sat demurely on her yellow hair. I led her toward Cleric\u2019s chair, the only comfortable one I had, questioning her confusedly. She was not disconcerted by my embarrassment. She looked about her with the naive curiosity I remembered so well. \u2018You are quite comfortable here, aren\u2019t you? I live in Lincoln now, too, Jim. I\u2019m in business for myself. I have a dressmaking shop in the Raleigh Block, out on O Street.", " That snake hung on our corral fence for several days; some of the neighbours came to see it and agreed that it was the biggest rattler ever killed in those parts. This was enough for Antonia. She liked me better from that time on, and she never took a supercilious air with me again. I had killed a big snake--I was now a big fellow. VIII WHILE THE AUTUMN COLOUR was growing pale on the grass and cornfields, things went badly with our friends the Russians. Peter told his troubles to Mr. Shimerda: he was unable to meet a note which fell due on the first of November; had to pay an exorbitant bonus on renewing it, and to give a mortgage on his pigs and horses and even his milk cow. His creditor was Wick Cutter, the merciless Black Hawk money-lender, a man of evil name throughout the county, of whom I shall have more to say later. Peter could give no very clear account of his transactions with Cutter.", " Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim. If you\u2019re going to be a preacher, I want you to marry me.

She lent herself to immemorial human attitudes which we recognize by instinct as universal and true. I had not been mistaken. She was a battered woman now, not a lovely girl; but she still had that something which fires the imagination, could still stop one\u2019s breath for a moment by a look or gesture that somehow revealed the meaning in common things. She had only to stand in the orchard, to put her hand on a little crab tree and look up at the apples, to make you feel the goodness of planting and tending and harvesting at last."], "What serves as the icon of the childhood idyll?": [" The dust and heat, the burning wind, reminded us of many things. We were talking about what it is like to spend one\u2019s childhood in little towns like these, buried in wheat and corn, under stimulating extremes of climate: burning summers when the world lies green and billowy beneath a brilliant sky, when one is fairly stifled in vegetation, in the color and smell of strong weeds and heavy harvests; blustery winters with little snow, when the whole country is stripped bare and gray as sheet-iron. We agreed that no one who had not grown up in a little prairie town could know anything about it. It was a kind of freemasonry, we said. Although Jim Burden and I both live in New York, and are old friends, I do not see much of him there. He is legal counsel for one of the great Western railways, and is sometimes away from his New York office for weeks together. That is one reason why we do not often meet.", " If a young man with an idea can once get Jim Burden\u2019s attention, can manage to accompany him when he goes off into the wilds hunting for lost parks or exploring new canyons, then the money which means action is usually forthcoming.

He was a heavy, bulky mulatto, on short legs, and he came tapping the floor in front of him with his gold-headed cane. His yellow face was lifted in the light, with a show of white teeth, all grinning, and his shrunken, papery eyelids lay motionless over his blind eyes. \u2018Good evening, gentlemen. No ladies here? Good evening, gentlemen. We going to have a little music? Some of you gentlemen going to play for me this evening?\u2019 It was the soft, amiable Negro voice, like those I remembered from early childhood, with the note of docile subservience in it. He had the Negro head, too; almost no head at all; nothing behind the ears but folds of neck under close-clipped wool. He would have been repulsive if his face had not been so kindly and happy. It was the happiest face I had seen since I left Virginia."], "What does Jim claim him and \u00c1ntonia hold in common?": [" Tiny sold her hotel, invested half her money in Dawson building lots, and with the rest she developed her claim. She went off into the wilds and lived on the claim. She bought other claims from discouraged miners, traded or sold them on percentages. After nearly ten years in the Klondike, Tiny returned, with a considerable fortune, to live in San Francisco. I met her in Salt Lake City in 1908. She was a thin, hard-faced woman, very well-dressed, very reserved in manner. Curiously enough, she reminded me of Mrs. Gardener, for whom she had worked in Black Hawk so long ago. She told me about some of the desperate chances she had taken in the gold country, but the thrill of them was quite gone. She said frankly that nothing interested her much now but making money. The only two human beings of whom she spoke with any feeling were the Swede, Johnson, who had given her his claim, and Lena Lingard.", " In my memory there was a succession of such pictures, fixed there like the old woodcuts of one\u2019s first primer: Antonia kicking her bare legs against the sides of my pony when we came home in triumph with our snake; Antonia in her black shawl and fur cap, as she stood by her father\u2019s grave in the snowstorm; Antonia coming in with her work-team along the evening sky-line.

I just stopped your grandpa and said so to him. He won\u2019t tell you, but he told us he was awful surprised himself, didn\u2019t he, girls?\u2019 Lena sidled up to me and said teasingly, \u2018What made you so solemn? I thought you were scared. I was sure you\u2019d forget.\u2019 Anna spoke wistfully. \u2018It must make you very happy, Jim, to have fine thoughts like that in your mind all the time, and to have words to put them in. I always wanted to go to school, you know.\u2019 \u2018Oh, I just sat there and wished my papa could hear you! Jim\u2019--Antonia took hold of my coat lapels--\u2018there was something in your speech that made me think so about my papa!\u2019 \u2018I thought about your papa when I wrote my speech, Tony,\u2019 I said. \u2018I dedicated it to him.\u2019 She threw her arms around me, and her dear face was all wet with tears. I stood watching their white dresses glimmer smaller and smaller down the sidewalk as they went away.", " She had persuaded Lena to come to San Francisco and go into business there. \u2018Lincoln was never any place for her,\u2019 Tiny remarked. \u2018In a town of that size Lena would always be gossiped about. Frisco\u2019s the right field for her. She has a fine class of trade. Oh, she\u2019s just the same as she always was! She\u2019s careless, but she\u2019s level-headed. She\u2019s the only person I know who never gets any older. It\u2019s fine for me to have her there; somebody who enjoys things like that. She keeps an eye on me and won\u2019t let me be shabby. When she thinks I need a new dress, she makes it and sends it home with a bill that\u2019s long enough, I can tell you!\u2019 Tiny limped slightly when she walked. The claim on Hunker Creek took toll from its possessors. Tiny had been caught in a sudden turn of weather, like poor Johnson. She lost three toes from one of those pretty little feet that used to trip about Black Hawk in pointed slippers and striped stockings."]}
