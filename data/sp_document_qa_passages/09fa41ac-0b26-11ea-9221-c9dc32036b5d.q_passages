{"What town is nearthe Burdens' farm?": [" We saw more of our country neighbours now than when we lived on the farm. Our house was a convenient stopping-place for them. We had a big barn where the farmers could put up their teams, and their womenfolk more often accompanied them, now that they could stay with us for dinner, and rest and set their bonnets right before they went shopping. The more our house was like a country hotel, the better I liked it. I was glad, when I came home from school at noon, to see a farm-wagon standing in the back yard, and I was always ready to run downtown to get beefsteak or baker\u2019s bread for unexpected company. All through that first spring and summer I kept hoping that Ambrosch would bring Antonia and Yulka to see our new house. I wanted to show them our red plush furniture, and the trumpet-blowing cherubs the German paperhanger had put on our parlour ceiling. When Ambrosch came to town, however, he came alone, and though he put his horses in our barn, he would never stay for dinner, or tell us anything about his mother and sisters. If we ran out and questioned him as he was slipping through the yard, he would merely work his shoulders about in his coat and say, \u2018They all right, I guess.\u2019 Mrs. Steavens, who now lived on our farm, grew as fond of Antonia as we had been, and always brought us news of her. All through the wheat season, she told us, Ambrosch hired his sister out like a man, and she went from farm to farm, binding sheaves or working with the threshers.", " \u2018Where are you working?\u2019 \u2018For Mrs. Thomas, the dressmaker. She is going to teach me to sew. She says I have quite a knack. I\u2019m through with the farm. There ain\u2019t any end to the work on a farm, and always so much trouble happens. I\u2019m going to be a dressmaker.\u2019 \u2018Well, there have to be dressmakers. It\u2019s a good trade. But I wouldn\u2019t run down the farm, if I were you,\u2019 said Mrs. Harling rather severely. \u2018How is your mother?\u2019 \u2018Oh, mother\u2019s never very well; she has too much to do. She\u2019d get away from the farm, too, if she could. She was willing for me to come. After I learn to do sewing, I can make money and help her.\u2019 \u2018See that you don\u2019t forget to,\u2019 said Mrs. Harling sceptically, as she took up her crocheting again and sent the hook in and out with nimble fingers. \u2018No, \u2018m, I won\u2019t,\u2019 said Lena blandly. She took a few grains of the popcorn we pressed upon her, eating them discreetly and taking care not to get her fingers sticky. Frances drew her chair up nearer to the visitor. \u2018I thought you were going to be married, Lena,\u2019 she said teasingly. \u2018Didn\u2019t I hear that Nick Svendsen was rushing you pretty hard?\u2019 Lena looked up with her curiously innocent smile. \u2018He did go with me quite a while. But his father made a fuss about it and said he wouldn\u2019t give Nick any land if he married me, so he\u2019s going to marry Annie Iverson. I wouldn\u2019t like to be her; Nick\u2019s awful sullen, and he\u2019ll take it out on her.", " \u2018Law for knock my Ambrosch down!\u2019 \u2018I never like you no more, Jake and Jim Burden,\u2019 Antonia panted. \u2018No friends any more!\u2019 Jake stopped and turned his horse for a second. \u2018Well, you\u2019re a damned ungrateful lot, the whole pack of you,\u2019 he shouted back. \u2018I guess the Burdens can get along without you. You\u2019ve been a sight of trouble to them, anyhow!\u2019 We rode away, feeling so outraged that the fine morning was spoiled for us. I hadn\u2019t a word to say, and poor Jake was white as paper and trembling all over. It made him sick to get so angry. \u2018They ain\u2019t the same, Jimmy,\u2019 he kept saying in a hurt tone. \u2018These foreigners ain\u2019t the same. You can\u2019t trust \u2018em to be fair. It\u2019s dirty to kick a feller. You heard how the women turned on you--and after all we went through on account of \u2018em last winter! They ain\u2019t to be trusted. I don\u2019t want to see you get too thick with any of \u2018em.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll never be friends with them again, Jake,\u2019 I declared hotly. \u2018I believe they are all like Krajiek and Ambrosch underneath.\u2019 Grandfather heard our story with a twinkle in his eye. He advised Jake to ride to town tomorrow, go to a justice of the peace, tell him he had knocked young Shimerda down, and pay his fine. Then if Mrs. Shimerda was inclined to make trouble--her son was still under age--she would be forestalled. Jake said he might as well take the wagon and haul to market the pig he had been fattening. On Monday, about an hour after Jake had started, we saw Mrs. Shimerda and her Ambrosch proudly driving by, looking neither to the right nor left.", " Presently she drew on her cotton gloves. \u2018I guess I must be leaving,\u2019 she said irresolutely. Frances told her to come again, whenever she was lonesome or wanted advice about anything. Lena replied that she didn\u2019t believe she would ever get lonesome in Black Hawk. She lingered at the kitchen door and begged Antonia to come and see her often. \u2018I\u2019ve got a room of my own at Mrs. Thomas\u2019s, with a carpet.\u2019 Tony shuffled uneasily in her cloth slippers. \u2018I\u2019ll come sometime, but Mrs. Harling don\u2019t like to have me run much,\u2019 she said evasively. \u2018You can do what you please when you go out, can\u2019t you?\u2019 Lena asked in a guarded whisper. \u2018Ain\u2019t you crazy about town, Tony? I don\u2019t care what anybody says, I\u2019m done with the farm!\u2019 She glanced back over her shoulder toward the dining-room, where Mrs. Harling sat. When Lena was gone, Frances asked Antonia why she hadn\u2019t been a little more cordial to her. \u2018I didn\u2019t know if your mother would like her coming here,\u2019 said Antonia, looking troubled. \u2018She was kind of talked about, out there.\u2019 \u2018Yes, I know. But mother won\u2019t hold it against her if she behaves well here. You needn\u2019t say anything about that to the children. I guess Jim has heard all that gossip?\u2019 When I nodded, she pulled my hair and told me I knew too much, anyhow. We were good friends, Frances and I. I ran home to tell grandmother that Lena Lingard had come to town. We were glad of it, for she had a hard life on the farm."], "How does \u00c1ntonia'sfather die?": [" She wanted to know about my friends, and my way of living, and my dearest hopes. \u2018Of course it means you are going away from us for good,\u2019 she said with a sigh. \u2018But that don\u2019t mean I\u2019ll lose you. Look at my papa here; he\u2019s been dead all these years, and yet he is more real to me than almost anybody else. He never goes out of my life. I talk to him and consult him all the time. The older I grow, the better I know him and the more I understand him.\u2019 She asked me whether I had learned to like big cities. \u2018I\u2019d always be miserable in a city. I\u2019d die of lonesomeness. I like to be where I know every stack and tree, and where all the ground is friendly. I want to live and die here. Father Kelly says everybody\u2019s put into this world for something, and I know what I\u2019ve got to do. I\u2019m going to see that my little girl has a better chance than ever I had. I\u2019m going to take care of that girl, Jim.\u2019 I told her I knew she would. \u2018Do you know, Antonia, since I\u2019ve been away, I think of you more often than of anyone else in this part of the world. I\u2019d have liked to have you for a sweetheart, or a wife, or my mother or my sister--anything that a woman can be to a man. The idea of you is a part of my mind; you influence my likes and dislikes, all my tastes, hundreds of times when I don\u2019t realize it. You really are a part of me.\u2019 She turned her bright, believing eyes to me, and the tears came up in them slowly, \u2018How can it be like that, when you know so many people, and when I\u2019ve disappointed you so?", " \u2018That I know, Mr. Burden, for it happened to myself. All the soldiers know, too. When we walk along the road, the old priest and me, we meet all the time soldiers marching and officers on horse. All those officers, when they see what I carry under the cloth, pull up their horses and kneel down on the ground in the road until we pass. So I feel very bad for my kawntree-man to die without the Sacrament, and to die in a bad way for his soul, and I feel sad for his family.\u2019 We had listened attentively. It was impossible not to admire his frank, manly faith. \u2018I am always glad to meet a young man who thinks seriously about these things,\u2019 said grandfather, \u2018and I would never be the one to say you were not in God\u2019s care when you were among the soldiers.\u2019 After dinner it was decided that young Jelinek should hook our two strong black farm-horses to the scraper and break a road through to the Shimerdas\u2019, so that a wagon could go when it was necessary. Fuchs, who was the only cabinetmaker in the neighbourhood was set to work on a coffin. Jelinek put on his long wolfskin coat, and when we admired it, he told us that he had shot and skinned the coyotes, and the young man who \u2018batched\u2019 with him, Jan Bouska, who had been a fur-worker in Vienna, made the coat. From the windmill I watched Jelinek come out of the barn with the blacks, and work his way up the hillside toward the cornfield. Sometimes he was completely hidden by the clouds of snow that rose about him; then he and the horses would emerge black and shining.", " Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim. If you\u2019re going to be a preacher, I want you to marry me. You must promise to marry us all, and then baptize the babies.\u2019 Norwegian Anna, always dignified, looked at her reprovingly. \u2018Baptists don\u2019t believe in christening babies, do they, Jim?\u2019 I told her I didn\u2019t know what they believed, and didn\u2019t care, and that I certainly wasn\u2019t going to be a preacher. \u2018That\u2019s too bad,\u2019 Tiny simpered. She was in a teasing mood. \u2018You\u2019d make such a good one. You\u2019re so studious. Maybe you\u2019d like to be a professor. You used to teach Tony, didn\u2019t you?\u2019 Antonia broke in. \u2018I\u2019ve set my heart on Jim being a doctor. You\u2019d be good with sick people, Jim. Your grandmother\u2019s trained you up so nice. My papa always said you were an awful smart boy.\u2019 I said I was going to be whatever I pleased. \u2018Won\u2019t you be surprised, Miss Tiny, if I turn out to be a regular devil of a fellow?\u2019 They laughed until a glance from Norwegian Anna checked them; the high-school principal had just come into the front part of the shop to buy bread for supper. Anna knew the whisper was going about that I was a sly one. People said there must be something queer about a boy who showed no interest in girls of his own age, but who could be lively enough when he was with Tony and Lena or the three Marys. The enthusiasm for the dance, which the Vannis had kindled, did not at once die out.", " Mr. Shimerda and Peter were on the front seat; Antonia and I sat in the straw behind and ate our lunch as we bumped along. After the sun sank, a cold wind sprang up and moaned over the prairie. If this turn in the weather had come sooner, I should not have got away. We burrowed down in the straw and curled up close together, watching the angry red die out of the west and the stars begin to shine in the clear, windy sky. Peter kept sighing and groaning. Tony whispered to me that he was afraid Pavel would never get well. We lay still and did not talk. Up there the stars grew magnificently bright. Though we had come from such different parts of the world, in both of us there was some dusky superstition that those shining groups have their influence upon what is and what is not to be. Perhaps Russian Peter, come from farther away than any of us, had brought from his land, too, some such belief. The little house on the hillside was so much the colour of the night that we could not see it as we came up the draw. The ruddy windows guided us--the light from the kitchen stove, for there was no lamp burning. We entered softly. The man in the wide bed seemed to be asleep. Tony and I sat down on the bench by the wall and leaned our arms on the table in front of us. The firelight flickered on the hewn logs that supported the thatch overhead. Pavel made a rasping sound when he breathed, and he kept moaning."], "With whom doesJim live for most of the novel?": [" All about us we could hear the felty beat of the raindrops on the soft dust of the farmyard. Grandmother came to the door and said it was late, and we would get wet out there. \u2018In a minute we come,\u2019 Antonia called back to her. \u2018I like your grandmother, and all things here,\u2019 she sighed. \u2018I wish my papa live to see this summer. I wish no winter ever come again.\u2019 \u2018It will be summer a long while yet,\u2019 I reassured her. \u2018Why aren\u2019t you always nice like this, Tony?\u2019 \u2018How nice?\u2019 \u2018Why, just like this; like yourself. Why do you all the time try to be like Ambrosch?\u2019 She put her arms under her head and lay back, looking up at the sky. \u2018If I live here, like you, that is different. Things will be easy for you. But they will be hard for us.\u2019 BOOK II. The Hired Girls I I HAD BEEN LIVING with my grandfather for nearly three years when he decided to move to Black Hawk. He and grandmother were getting old for the heavy work of a farm, and as I was now thirteen they thought I ought to be going to school. Accordingly our homestead was rented to \u2018that good woman, the Widow Steavens,\u2019 and her bachelor brother, and we bought Preacher White\u2019s house, at the north end of Black Hawk. This was the first town house one passed driving in from the farm, a landmark which told country people their long ride was over. We were to move to Black Hawk in March, and as soon as grandfather had fixed the date he let Jake and Otto know of his intention.", " I found Cuzak a most companionable fellow. He asked me a great many questions about my trip through Bohemia, about Vienna and the Ringstrasse and the theatres. \u2018Gee! I like to go back there once, when the boys is big enough to farm the place. Sometimes when I read the papers from the old country, I pretty near run away,\u2019 he confessed with a little laugh. \u2018I never did think how I would be a settled man like this.\u2019 He was still, as Antonia said, a city man. He liked theatres and lighted streets and music and a game of dominoes after the day\u2019s work was over. His sociability was stronger than his acquisitive instinct. He liked to live day by day and night by night, sharing in the excitement of the crowd.--Yet his wife had managed to hold him here on a farm, in one of the loneliest countries in the world. I could see the little chap, sitting here every evening by the windmill, nursing his pipe and listening to the silence; the wheeze of the pump, the grunting of the pigs, an occasional squawking when the hens were disturbed by a rat. It did rather seem to me that Cuzak had been made the instrument of Antonia\u2019s special mission. This was a fine life, certainly, but it wasn\u2019t the kind of life he had wanted to live. I wondered whether the life that was right for one was ever right for two! I asked Cuzak if he didn\u2019t find it hard to do without the gay company he had always been used to. He knocked out his pipe against an upright, sighed, and dropped it into his pocket.", " She wanted to know about my friends, and my way of living, and my dearest hopes. \u2018Of course it means you are going away from us for good,\u2019 she said with a sigh. \u2018But that don\u2019t mean I\u2019ll lose you.

She was so quietly conventionalized by city clothes that I might have passed her on the street without seeing her. Her black suit fitted her figure smoothly, and a black lace hat, with pale-blue forget-me-nots, sat demurely on her yellow hair. I led her toward Cleric\u2019s chair, the only comfortable one I had, questioning her confusedly. She was not disconcerted by my embarrassment. She looked about her with the naive curiosity I remembered so well. \u2018You are quite comfortable here, aren\u2019t you? I live in Lincoln now, too, Jim. I\u2019m in business for myself. I have a dressmaking shop in the Raleigh Block, out on O Street. I\u2019ve made a real good start.\u2019 \u2018But, Lena, when did you come?\u2019 \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve been here all winter. Didn\u2019t your grandmother ever write you? I\u2019ve thought about looking you up lots of times. But we\u2019ve all heard what a studious young man you\u2019ve got to be, and I felt bashful. I didn\u2019t know whether you\u2019d be glad to see me.\u2019 She laughed her mellow, easy laugh, that was either very artless or very comprehending, one never quite knew which. \u2018You seem the same, though--except you\u2019re a young man, now, of course. Do you think I\u2019ve changed?\u2019 \u2018Maybe you\u2019re prettier--though you were always pretty enough."], "What nationalityare the Shimerdas?": [" As they rattled out of sight down the Black Hawk road, grandfather chuckled, saying he had rather expected she would follow the matter up. Jake paid his fine with a ten-dollar bill grandfather had given him for that purpose. But when the Shimerdas found that Jake sold his pig in town that day, Ambrosch worked it out in his shrewd head that Jake had to sell his pig to pay his fine. This theory afforded the Shimerdas great satisfaction, apparently. For weeks afterward, whenever Jake and I met Antonia on her way to the post-office, or going along the road with her work-team, she would clap her hands and call to us in a spiteful, crowing voice: \u2018Jake-y, Jake-y, sell the pig and pay the slap!\u2019 Otto pretended not to be surprised at Antonia\u2019s behaviour. He only lifted his brows and said, \u2018You can\u2019t tell me anything new about a Czech; I\u2019m an Austrian.\u2019 Grandfather was never a party to what Jake called our feud with the Shimerdas. Ambrosch and Antonia always greeted him respectfully, and he asked them about their affairs and gave them advice as usual. He thought the future looked hopeful for them. Ambrosch was a far-seeing fellow; he soon realized that his oxen were too heavy for any work except breaking sod, and he succeeded in selling them to a newly arrived German. With the money he bought another team of horses, which grandfather selected for him. Marek was strong, and Ambrosch worked him hard; but he could never teach him to cultivate corn, I remember.", " If I had been tossed down blindfold on that red prairie, I should have known that it was spring. Everywhere now there was the smell of burning grass. Our neighbours burned off their pasture before the new grass made a start, so that the fresh growth would not be mixed with the dead stand of last year. Those light, swift fires, running about the country, seemed a part of the same kindling that was in the air. The Shimerdas were in their new log house by then. The neighbours had helped them to build it in March. It stood directly in front of their old cave, which they used as a cellar. The family were now fairly equipped to begin their struggle with the soil. They had four comfortable rooms to live in, a new windmill--bought on credit--a chicken-house and poultry. Mrs. Shimerda had paid grandfather ten dollars for a milk cow, and was to give him fifteen more as soon as they harvested their first crop. When I rode up to the Shimerdas\u2019 one bright windy afternoon in April, Yulka ran out to meet me. It was to her, now, that I gave reading lessons; Antonia was busy with other things. I tied my pony and went into the kitchen where Mrs. Shimerda was baking bread, chewing poppy seeds as she worked. By this time she could speak enough English to ask me a great many questions about what our men were doing in the fields. She seemed to think that my elders withheld helpful information, and that from me she might get valuable secrets.", " I go drown myself in the pond before morning.\u2019 When Ambrosch came back from Mr. Bushy\u2019s, we learned that he had given Marek\u2019s wages to the priest at Black Hawk, for Masses for their father\u2019s soul. Grandmother thought Antonia needed shoes more than Mr. Shimerda needed prayers, but grandfather said tolerantly, \u2018If he can spare six dollars, pinched as he is, it shows he believes what he professes.\u2019 It was grandfather who brought about a reconciliation with the Shimerdas. One morning he told us that the small grain was coming on so well, he thought he would begin to cut his wheat on the first of July. He would need more men, and if it were agreeable to everyone he would engage Ambrosch for the reaping and threshing, as the Shimerdas had no small grain of their own. \u2018I think, Emmaline,\u2019 he concluded, \u2018I will ask Antonia to come over and help you in the kitchen. She will be glad to earn something, and it will be a good time to end misunderstandings. I may as well ride over this morning and make arrangements. Do you want to go with me, Jim?\u2019 His tone told me that he had already decided for me. After breakfast we set off together. When Mrs. Shimerda saw us coming, she ran from her door down into the draw behind the stable, as if she did not want to meet us. Grandfather smiled to himself while he tied his horse, and we followed her. Behind the barn we came upon a funny sight. The cow had evidently been grazing somewhere in the draw.", " There never were such people as the Shimerdas for wanting to give away everything they had. Even the mother was always offering me things, though I knew she expected substantial presents in return. We stood there in friendly silence, while the feeble minstrel sheltered in Antonia\u2019s hair went on with its scratchy chirp. The old man\u2019s smile, as he listened, was so full of sadness, of pity for things, that I never afterward forgot it. As the sun sank there came a sudden coolness and the strong smell of earth and drying grass. Antonia and her father went off hand in hand, and I buttoned up my jacket and raced my shadow home. VII MUCH AS I LIKED Antonia, I hated a superior tone that she sometimes took with me. She was four years older than I, to be sure, and had seen more of the world; but I was a boy and she was a girl, and I resented her protecting manner. Before the autumn was over, she began to treat me more like an equal and to defer to me in other things than reading lessons. This change came about from an adventure we had together. One day when I rode over to the Shimerdas\u2019 I found Antonia starting off on foot for Russian Peter\u2019s house, to borrow a spade Ambrosch needed. I offered to take her on the pony, and she got up behind me. There had been another black frost the night before, and the air was clear and heady as wine. Within a week all the blooming roads had been despoiled, hundreds of miles of yellow sunflowers had been transformed into brown, rattling, burry stalks."], "What does Ottodecide to do when the Burdens move into town?": [" All about us we could hear the felty beat of the raindrops on the soft dust of the farmyard.

You\u2019ve been a sight of trouble to them, anyhow!\u2019 We rode away, feeling so outraged that the fine morning was spoiled for us. I hadn\u2019t a word to say, and poor Jake was white as paper and trembling all over. It made him sick to get so angry. \u2018They ain\u2019t the same, Jimmy,\u2019 he kept saying in a hurt tone. \u2018These foreigners ain\u2019t the same. You can\u2019t trust \u2018em to be fair.

He advised Jake to ride to town tomorrow, go to a justice of the peace, tell him he had knocked young Shimerda down, and pay his fine. Then if Mrs. Shimerda was inclined to make trouble--her son was still under age--she would be forestalled. Jake said he might as well take the wagon and haul to market the pig he had been fattening. On Monday, about an hour after Jake had started, we saw Mrs. Shimerda and her Ambrosch proudly driving by, looking neither to the right nor left.", " \u2018But, you know, my weakness is playthings. I like to buy them playthings better than what they need.\u2019 \u2018I know how that is,\u2019 said Anna. \u2018When we first came here, and I was little, we were too poor to buy toys. I never got over the loss of a doll somebody gave me before we left Norway. A boy on the boat broke her and I still hate him for it.\u2019 \u2018I guess after you got here you had plenty of live dolls to nurse, like me!\u2019 Lena remarked cynically. \u2018Yes, the babies came along pretty fast, to be sure. But I never minded. I was fond of them all. The youngest one, that we didn\u2019t any of us want, is the one we love best now.\u2019 Lena sighed. \u2018Oh, the babies are all right; if only they don\u2019t come in winter. Ours nearly always did. I don\u2019t see how mother stood it. I tell you what, girls\u2019--she sat up with sudden energy--\u2018I\u2019m going to get my mother out of that old sod house where she\u2019s lived so many years. The men will never do it. Johnnie, that\u2019s my oldest brother, he\u2019s wanting to get married now, and build a house for his girl instead of his mother. Mrs. Thomas says she thinks I can move to some other town pretty soon, and go into business for myself. If I don\u2019t get into business, I\u2019ll maybe marry a rich gambler.\u2019 \u2018That would be a poor way to get on,\u2019 said Anna sarcastically. \u2018I wish I could teach school, like Selma Kronn. Just think! She\u2019ll be the first Scandinavian girl to get a position in the high school.", " He had always thought he would like to raise oranges! The second year a hard frost killed his young grove, and he fell ill with malaria. He came to Nebraska to visit his cousin, Anton Jelinek, and to look about. When he began to look about, he saw Antonia, and she was exactly the kind of girl he had always been hunting for. They were married at once, though he had to borrow money from his cousin to buy the wedding ring. \u2018It was a pretty hard job, breaking up this place and making the first crops grow,\u2019 he said, pushing back his hat and scratching his grizzled hair. \u2018Sometimes I git awful sore on this place and want to quit, but my wife she always say we better stick it out. The babies come along pretty fast, so it look like it be hard to move, anyhow. I guess she was right, all right. We got this place clear now. We pay only twenty dollars an acre then, and I been offered a hundred. We bought another quarter ten years ago, and we got it most paid for. We got plenty boys; we can work a lot of land. Yes, she is a good wife for a poor man. She ain\u2019t always so strict with me, neither. Sometimes maybe I drink a little too much beer in town, and when I come home she don\u2019t say nothing. She don\u2019t ask me no questions. We always get along fine, her and me, like at first. The children don\u2019t make trouble between us, like sometimes happens.\u2019 He lit another pipe and pulled on it contentedly."], "Where does Jimattend college?": [" In spite of the fact that nobody ever mentioned his article to him after it appeared--full of typographical errors which he thought intentional--he got a certain satisfaction from believing that the citizens of Lincoln had meekly accepted the epithet \u2018coarse barbarians.\u2019 \u2018You see how it is,\u2019 he said to me, \u2018where there is no chivalry, there is no amour-propre.\u2019 When I met him on his rounds now, I thought he carried his head more disdainfully than ever, and strode up the steps of front porches and rang doorbells with more assurance. He told Lena he would never forget how I had stood by him when he was \u2018under fire.\u2019 All this time, of course, I was drifting. Lena had broken up my serious mood. I wasn\u2019t interested in my classes. I played with Lena and Prince, I played with the Pole, I went buggy-riding with the old colonel, who had taken a fancy to me and used to talk to me about Lena and the \u2018great beauties\u2019 he had known in his youth. We were all three in love with Lena. Before the first of June, Gaston Cleric was offered an instructorship at Harvard College, and accepted it. He suggested that I should follow him in the fall, and complete my course at Harvard. He had found out about Lena--not from me--and he talked to me seriously. \u2018You won\u2019t do anything here now. You should either quit school and go to work, or change your college and begin again in earnest. You won\u2019t recover yourself while you are playing about with this handsome Norwegian.", " Our instructors were oddly assorted; wandering pioneer school-teachers, stranded ministers of the Gospel, a few enthusiastic young men just out of graduate schools. There was an atmosphere of endeavour, of expectancy and bright hopefulness about the young college that had lifted its head from the prairie only a few years before. Our personal life was as free as that of our instructors. There were no college dormitories; we lived where we could and as we could. I took rooms with an old couple, early settlers in Lincoln, who had married off their children and now lived quietly in their house at the edge of town, near the open country. The house was inconveniently situated for students, and on that account I got two rooms for the price of one. My bedroom, originally a linen-closet, was unheated and was barely large enough to contain my cot-bed, but it enabled me to call the other room my study. The dresser, and the great walnut wardrobe which held all my clothes, even my hats and shoes, I had pushed out of the way, and I considered them non-existent, as children eliminate incongruous objects when they are playing house. I worked at a commodious green-topped table placed directly in front of the west window which looked out over the prairie. In the corner at my right were all my books, in shelves I had made and painted myself. On the blank wall at my left the dark, old-fashioned wall-paper was covered by a large map of ancient Rome, the work of some German scholar.", " One evening she said she thought Mrs. Harling was not seriously offended with me. \u2018Mama is as broad-minded as mothers ever are, I guess. But you know she was hurt about Antonia, and she can\u2019t understand why you like to be with Tiny and Lena better than with the girls of your own set.\u2019 \u2018Can you?\u2019 I asked bluntly. Frances laughed. \u2018Yes, I think I can. You knew them in the country, and you like to take sides. In some ways you\u2019re older than boys of your age. It will be all right with mama after you pass your college examinations and she sees you\u2019re in earnest.\u2019 \u2018If you were a boy,\u2019 I persisted, \u2018you wouldn\u2019t belong to the Owl Club, either. You\u2019d be just like me.\u2019 She shook her head. \u2018I would and I wouldn\u2019t. I expect I know the country girls better than you do. You always put a kind of glamour over them. The trouble with you, Jim, is that you\u2019re romantic. Mama\u2019s going to your Commencement. She asked me the other day if I knew what your oration is to be about. She wants you to do well.\u2019 I thought my oration very good. It stated with fervour a great many things I had lately discovered. Mrs. Harling came to the Opera House to hear the Commencement exercises, and I looked at her most of the time while I made my speech. Her keen, intelligent eyes never left my face. Afterward she came back to the dressing-room where we stood, with our diplomas in our hands, walked up to me, and said heartily: \u2018You surprised me, Jim.", " \u2018None of your smart speeches,\u2019 said Ambrosch severely. Leo poked out a supple red tongue at him, but a moment later broke into a giggle at a tintype of two men, uncomfortably seated, with an awkward-looking boy in baggy clothes standing between them: Jake and Otto and I! We had it taken, I remembered, when we went to Black Hawk on the first Fourth of July I spent in Nebraska. I was glad to see Jake\u2019s grin again, and Otto\u2019s ferocious moustaches. The young Cuzaks knew all about them. \u2018He made grandfather\u2019s coffin, didn\u2019t he?\u2019 Anton asked. \u2018Wasn\u2019t they good fellows, Jim?\u2019 Antonia\u2019s eyes filled. \u2018To this day I\u2019m ashamed because I quarrelled with Jake that way. I was saucy and impertinent to him, Leo, like you are with people sometimes, and I wish somebody had made me behave.\u2019 \u2018We aren\u2019t through with you, yet,\u2019 they warned me. They produced a photograph taken just before I went away to college: a tall youth in striped trousers and a straw hat, trying to look easy and jaunty. \u2018Tell us, Mr. Burden,\u2019 said Charley, \u2018about the rattler you killed at the dog-town. How long was he? Sometimes mother says six feet and sometimes she says five.\u2019 These children seemed to be upon very much the same terms with Antonia as the Harling children had been so many years before. They seemed to feel the same pride in her, and to look to her for stories and entertainment as we used to do. It was eleven o\u2019clock when I at last took my bag and some blankets and started for the barn with the boys."], "When does theblizzard occur?": [" She was a beautiful girl.\u2019 \u2018Oh, we know!\u2019 They both spoke together; seemed a little surprised that I should think it necessary to mention this. \u2018Everybody liked her, didn\u2019t they? The Harlings and your grandmother, and all the town people.\u2019 \u2018Sometimes,\u2019 I ventured, \u2018it doesn\u2019t occur to boys that their mother was ever young and pretty.\u2019 \u2018Oh, we know!\u2019 they said again, warmly. \u2018She\u2019s not very old now,\u2019 Ambrosch added. \u2018Not much older than you.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 I said, \u2018if you weren\u2019t nice to her, I think I\u2019d take a club and go for the whole lot of you. I couldn\u2019t stand it if you boys were inconsiderate, or thought of her as if she were just somebody who looked after you. You see I was very much in love with your mother once, and I know there\u2019s nobody like her.\u2019 The boys laughed and seemed pleased and embarrassed. \u2018She never told us that,\u2019 said Anton. \u2018But she\u2019s always talked lots about you, and about what good times you used to have. She has a picture of you that she cut out of the Chicago paper once, and Leo says he recognized you when you drove up to the windmill. You can\u2019t tell about Leo, though; sometimes he likes to be smart.\u2019 We brought the cows home to the corner nearest the barn, and the boys milked them while night came on. Everything was as it should be: the strong smell of sunflowers and ironweed in the dew, the clear blue and gold of the sky, the evening star, the purr of the milk into the pails, the grunts and squeals of the pigs fighting over their supper.", " But the next time Samson had a chance, he ran away again. If Miss d\u2019Arnault stopped practising for a moment and went toward the window, she saw this hideous little pickaninny, dressed in an old piece of sacking, standing in the open space between the hollyhock rows, his body rocking automatically, his blind face lifted to the sun and wearing an expression of idiotic rapture. Often she was tempted to tell Martha that the child must be kept at home, but somehow the memory of his foolish, happy face deterred her. She remembered that his sense of hearing was nearly all he had--though it did not occur to her that he might have more of it than other children. One day Samson was standing thus while Miss Nellie was playing her lesson to her music-teacher. The windows were open. He heard them get up from the piano, talk a little while, and then leave the room. He heard the door close after them. He crept up to the front windows and stuck his head in: there was no one there. He could always detect the presence of anyone in a room. He put one foot over the window-sill and straddled it. His mother had told him over and over how his master would give him to the big mastiff if he ever found him \u2018meddling.\u2019 Samson had got too near the mastiff\u2019s kennel once, and had felt his terrible breath in his face. He thought about that, but he pulled in his other foot. Through the dark he found his way to the Thing, to its mouth."], "Which charactermoves to San Fransisco?": [" The poor fellow thought it great good fortune to be cared for by a woman, and a woman who spoke his own tongue. When he was told that his feet must be amputated, he said he hoped he would not get well; what could a working-man do in this hard world without feet? He did, in fact, die from the operation, but not before he had deeded Tiny Soderball his claim on Hunker Creek. Tiny sold her hotel, invested half her money in Dawson building lots, and with the rest she developed her claim. She went off into the wilds and lived on the claim. She bought other claims from discouraged miners, traded or sold them on percentages. After nearly ten years in the Klondike, Tiny returned, with a considerable fortune, to live in San Francisco. I met her in Salt Lake City in 1908. She was a thin, hard-faced woman, very well-dressed, very reserved in manner. Curiously enough, she reminded me of Mrs. Gardener, for whom she had worked in Black Hawk so long ago. She told me about some of the desperate chances she had taken in the gold country, but the thrill of them was quite gone. She said frankly that nothing interested her much now but making money. The only two human beings of whom she spoke with any feeling were the Swede, Johnson, who had given her his claim, and Lena Lingard. She had persuaded Lena to come to San Francisco and go into business there. \u2018Lincoln was never any place for her,\u2019 Tiny remarked.", " Nina and Jan, after trying to see round the taller ones, quietly brought a chair, climbed up on it, and stood close together, looking. The little boy forgot his shyness and grinned delightedly when familiar faces came into view. In the group about Antonia I was conscious of a kind of physical harmony. They leaned this way and that, and were not afraid to touch each other. They contemplated the photographs with pleased recognition; looked at some admiringly, as if these characters in their mother\u2019s girlhood had been remarkable people. The little children, who could not speak English, murmured comments to each other in their rich old language. Antonia held out a photograph of Lena that had come from San Francisco last Christmas. \u2018Does she still look like that? She hasn\u2019t been home for six years now.\u2019 Yes, it was exactly like Lena, I told her; a comely woman, a trifle too plump, in a hat a trifle too large, but with the old lazy eyes, and the old dimpled ingenuousness still lurking at the corners of her mouth. There was a picture of Frances Harling in a befrogged riding costume that I remembered well. \u2018Isn\u2019t she fine!\u2019 the girls murmured. They all assented. One could see that Frances had come down as a heroine in the family legend. Only Leo was unmoved. \u2018And there\u2019s Mr. Harling, in his grand fur coat. He was awfully rich, wasn\u2019t he, mother?\u2019 \u2018He wasn\u2019t any Rockefeller,\u2019 put in Master Leo, in a very low tone, which reminded me of the way in which Mrs. Shimerda had once said that my grandfather \u2018wasn\u2019t Jesus.\u2019 His habitual scepticism was like a direct inheritance from that old woman.", " My business took me West several times every year, and it was always in the back of my mind that I would stop in Nebraska some day and go to see Antonia. But I kept putting it off until the next trip. I did not want to find her aged and broken; I really dreaded it. In the course of twenty crowded years one parts with many illusions. I did not wish to lose the early ones. Some memories are realities, and are better than anything that can ever happen to one again. I owe it to Lena Lingard that I went to see Antonia at last. I was in San Francisco two summers ago when both Lena and Tiny Soderball were in town. Tiny lives in a house of her own, and Lena\u2019s shop is in an apartment house just around the corner. It interested me, after so many years, to see the two women together. Tiny audits Lena\u2019s accounts occasionally, and invests her money for her; and Lena, apparently, takes care that Tiny doesn\u2019t grow too miserly. \u2018If there\u2019s anything I can\u2019t stand,\u2019 she said to me in Tiny\u2019s presence, \u2018it\u2019s a shabby rich woman.\u2019 Tiny smiled grimly and assured me that Lena would never be either shabby or rich. \u2018And I don\u2019t want to be,\u2019 the other agreed complacently. Lena gave me a cheerful account of Antonia and urged me to make her a visit. \u2018You really ought to go, Jim. It would be such a satisfaction to her. Never mind what Tiny says. There\u2019s nothing the matter with Cuzak. You\u2019d like him. He isn\u2019t a hustler, but a rough man would never have suited Tony."], "To whom does \u00c1ntoniafirst become engaged?": [" She looked up at me. \u2018Yes, she did. We were just ashamed of mother. She went round crying, when Martha was so happy, and the rest of us were all glad. Joe certainly was patient with you, mother.\u2019 Antonia nodded and smiled at herself. \u2018I know it was silly, but I couldn\u2019t help it. I wanted her right here. She\u2019d never been away from me a night since she was born. If Anton had made trouble about her when she was a baby, or wanted me to leave her with my mother, I wouldn\u2019t have married him. I couldn\u2019t. But he always loved her like she was his own.\u2019 \u2018I didn\u2019t even know Martha wasn\u2019t my full sister until after she was engaged to Joe,\u2019 Anna told me. Toward the middle of the afternoon, the wagon drove in, with the father and the eldest son. I was smoking in the orchard, and as I went out to meet them, Antonia came running down from the house and hugged the two men as if they had been away for months. \u2018Papa,\u2019 interested me, from my first glimpse of him. He was shorter than his older sons; a crumpled little man, with run-over boot-heels, and he carried one shoulder higher than the other. But he moved very quickly, and there was an air of jaunty liveliness about him. He had a strong, ruddy colour, thick black hair, a little grizzled, a curly moustache, and red lips. His smile showed the strong teeth of which his wife was so proud, and as he saw me his lively, quizzical eyes told me that he knew all about me.", " She has great confidence in Tony. Tony\u2019s made it up with the Harlings, too. Little Nina is so fond of her that Mrs. Harling kind of overlooked things.\u2019 \u2018Is she still going with Larry Donovan?\u2019 \u2018Oh, that\u2019s on, worse than ever! I guess they\u2019re engaged. Tony talks about him like he was president of the railroad. Everybody laughs about it, because she was never a girl to be soft. She won\u2019t hear a word against him. She\u2019s so sort of innocent.\u2019 I said I didn\u2019t like Larry, and never would. Lena\u2019s face dimpled. \u2018Some of us could tell her things, but it wouldn\u2019t do any good. She\u2019d always believe him. That\u2019s Antonia\u2019s failing, you know; if she once likes people, she won\u2019t hear anything against them.\u2019 \u2018I think I\u2019d better go home and look after Antonia,\u2019 I said. \u2018I think you had.\u2019 Lena looked up at me in frank amusement. \u2018It\u2019s a good thing the Harlings are friendly with her again. Larry\u2019s afraid of them. They ship so much grain, they have influence with the railroad people. What are you studying?\u2019 She leaned her elbows on the table and drew my book toward her. I caught a faint odour of violet sachet. \u2018So that\u2019s Latin, is it? It looks hard. You do go to the theatre sometimes, though, for I\u2019ve seen you there. Don\u2019t you just love a good play, Jim? I can\u2019t stay at home in the evening if there\u2019s one in town. I\u2019d be willing to work like a slave, it seems to me, to live in a place where there are theatres.\u2019 \u2018Let\u2019s go to a show together sometime.", " Our heavy carpenter\u2019s bench had to be brought from the barn and carried down into the kitchen. Fuchs selected boards from a pile of planks grandfather had hauled out from town in the fall to make a new floor for the oats-bin. When at last the lumber and tools were assembled, and the doors were closed again and the cold draughts shut out, grandfather rode away to meet the coroner at the Shimerdas\u2019, and Fuchs took off his coat and settled down to work. I sat on his worktable and watched him. He did not touch his tools at first, but figured for a long while on a piece of paper, and measured the planks and made marks on them. While he was thus engaged, he whistled softly to himself, or teasingly pulled at his half-ear. Grandmother moved about quietly, so as not to disturb him. At last he folded his ruler and turned a cheerful face to us. \u2018The hardest part of my job\u2019s done,\u2019 he announced. \u2018It\u2019s the head end of it that comes hard with me, especially when I\u2019m out of practice. The last time I made one of these, Mrs. Burden,\u2019 he continued, as he sorted and tried his chisels, \u2018was for a fellow in the Black Tiger Mine, up above Silverton, Colorado. The mouth of that mine goes right into the face of the cliff, and they used to put us in a bucket and run us over on a trolley and shoot us into the shaft. The bucket travelled across a box canon three hundred feet deep, and about a third full of water.", " Cleric had ordered it for me when he was sending for books from abroad. Over the bookcase hung a photograph of the Tragic Theatre at Pompeii, which he had given me from his collection. When I sat at work I half-faced a deep, upholstered chair which stood at the end of my table, its high back against the wall. I had bought it with great care. My instructor sometimes looked in upon me when he was out for an evening tramp, and I noticed that he was more likely to linger and become talkative if I had a comfortable chair for him to sit in, and if he found a bottle of Benedictine and plenty of the kind of cigarettes he liked, at his elbow. He was, I had discovered, parsimonious about small expenditures--a trait absolutely inconsistent with his general character. Sometimes when he came he was silent and moody, and after a few sarcastic remarks went away again, to tramp the streets of Lincoln, which were almost as quiet and oppressively domestic as those of Black Hawk. Again, he would sit until nearly midnight, talking about Latin and English poetry, or telling me about his long stay in Italy. I can give no idea of the peculiar charm and vividness of his talk. In a crowd he was nearly always silent. Even for his classroom he had no platitudes, no stock of professorial anecdotes. When he was tired, his lectures were clouded, obscure, elliptical; but when he was interested they were wonderful."], "Where does \u00c1ntoniawork after leaving the Harlings?": [" The farmers liked her and were kind to her; said they would rather have her for a hand than Ambrosch. When fall came she was to husk corn for the neighbours until Christmas, as she had done the year before; but grandmother saved her from this by getting her a place to work with our neighbours, the Harlings. II GRANDMOTHER OFTEN SAID THAT if she had to live in town, she thanked God she lived next the Harlings. They had been farming people, like ourselves, and their place was like a little farm, with a big barn and a garden, and an orchard and grazing lots--even a windmill. The Harlings were Norwegians, and Mrs. Harling had lived in Christiania until she was ten years old. Her husband was born in Minnesota. He was a grain merchant and cattle-buyer, and was generally considered the most enterprising business man in our county. He controlled a line of grain elevators in the little towns along the railroad to the west of us, and was away from home a great deal. In his absence his wife was the head of the household. Mrs. Harling was short and square and sturdy-looking, like her house. Every inch of her was charged with an energy that made itself felt the moment she entered a room. Her face was rosy and solid, with bright, twinkling eyes and a stubborn little chin. She was quick to anger, quick to laughter, and jolly from the depths of her soul. How well I remember her laugh; it had in it the same sudden recognition that flashed into her eyes, was a burst of humour, short and intelligent.", " She has great confidence in Tony.

He never looked at Lena again, nor lifted his eyes as he ceremoniously tipped his hat when he happened to meet her on the sidewalk. So that was what they were like, I thought, these white-handed, high-collared clerks and bookkeepers! I used to glare at young Lovett from a distance and only wished I had some way of showing my contempt for him. X IT WAS AT THE Vannis\u2019 tent that Antonia was discovered. Hitherto she had been looked upon more as a ward of the Harlings than as one of the \u2018hired girls.\u2019 She had lived in their house and yard and garden; her thoughts never seemed to stray outside that little kingdom. But after the tent came to town she began to go about with Tiny and Lena and their friends. The Vannis often said that Antonia was the best dancer of them all. I sometimes heard murmurs in the crowd outside the pavilion that Mrs. Harling would soon have her hands full with that girl. The young men began to joke with each other about \u2018the Harlings\u2019 Tony\u2019 as they did about \u2018the Marshalls\u2019 Anna\u2019 or \u2018the Gardeners\u2019 Tiny.\u2019 Antonia talked and thought of nothing but the tent. She hummed the dance tunes all day. When supper was late, she hurried with her dishes, dropped and smashed them in her excitement. At the first call of the music, she became irresponsible. If she hadn\u2019t time to dress, she merely flung off her apron and shot out of the kitchen door.", " I never tried to define it, but I was distinctly conscious of it. I could not imagine Antonia\u2019s living for a week in any other house in Black Hawk than the Harlings\u2019. VII WINTER LIES TOO LONG in country towns; hangs on until it is stale and shabby, old and sullen. On the farm the weather was the great fact, and men\u2019s affairs went on underneath it, as the streams creep under the ice. But in Black Hawk the scene of human life was spread out shrunken and pinched, frozen down to the bare stalk. Through January and February I went to the river with the Harlings on clear nights, and we skated up to the big island and made bonfires on the frozen sand. But by March the ice was rough and choppy, and the snow on the river bluffs was grey and mournful-looking. I was tired of school, tired of winter clothes, of the rutted streets, of the dirty drifts and the piles of cinders that had lain in the yards so long. There was only one break in the dreary monotony of that month: when Blind d\u2019Arnault, the Negro pianist, came to town. He gave a concert at the Opera House on Monday night, and he and his manager spent Saturday and Sunday at our comfortable hotel. Mrs. Harling had known d\u2019Arnault for years. She told Antonia she had better go to see Tiny that Saturday evening, as there would certainly be music at the Boys\u2019 Home. Saturday night after supper I ran downtown to the hotel and slipped quietly into the parlour."], "To whom doesJim dedicate his commencement oration?": [" One evening she said she thought Mrs. Harling was not seriously offended with me. \u2018Mama is as broad-minded as mothers ever are, I guess. But you know she was hurt about Antonia, and she can\u2019t understand why you like to be with Tiny and Lena better than with the girls of your own set.\u2019 \u2018Can you?\u2019 I asked bluntly. Frances laughed. \u2018Yes, I think I can. You knew them in the country, and you like to take sides. In some ways you\u2019re older than boys of your age. It will be all right with mama after you pass your college examinations and she sees you\u2019re in earnest.\u2019 \u2018If you were a boy,\u2019 I persisted, \u2018you wouldn\u2019t belong to the Owl Club, either. You\u2019d be just like me.\u2019 She shook her head. \u2018I would and I wouldn\u2019t. I expect I know the country girls better than you do. You always put a kind of glamour over them. The trouble with you, Jim, is that you\u2019re romantic. Mama\u2019s going to your Commencement. She asked me the other day if I knew what your oration is to be about. She wants you to do well.\u2019 I thought my oration very good. It stated with fervour a great many things I had lately discovered. Mrs. Harling came to the Opera House to hear the Commencement exercises, and I looked at her most of the time while I made my speech. Her keen, intelligent eyes never left my face. Afterward she came back to the dressing-room where we stood, with our diplomas in our hands, walked up to me, and said heartily: \u2018You surprised me, Jim.", " I stood watching their white dresses glimmer smaller and smaller down the sidewalk as they went away. I have had no other success that pulled at my heartstrings like that one. XIV THE DAY AFTER COMMENCEMENT I moved my books and desk upstairs, to an empty room where I should be undisturbed, and I fell to studying in earnest. I worked off a year\u2019s trigonometry that summer, and began Virgil alone. Morning after morning I used to pace up and down my sunny little room, looking off at the distant river bluffs and the roll of the blond pastures between, scanning the \u2018Aeneid\u2019 aloud and committing long passages to memory. Sometimes in the evening Mrs. Harling called to me as I passed her gate, and asked me to come in and let her play for me. She was lonely for Charley, she said, and liked to have a boy about. Whenever my grandparents had misgivings, and began to wonder whether I was not too young to go off to college alone, Mrs. Harling took up my cause vigorously. Grandfather had such respect for her judgment that I knew he would not go against her. I had only one holiday that summer. It was in July. I met Antonia downtown on Saturday afternoon, and learned that she and Tiny and Lena were going to the river next day with Anna Hansen--the elder was all in bloom now, and Anna wanted to make elderblow wine. \u2018Anna\u2019s to drive us down in the Marshalls\u2019 delivery wagon, and we\u2019ll take a nice lunch and have a picnic.", " I wept unrestrainedly. Even the handkerchief in my breast-pocket, worn for elegance and not at all for use, was wet through by the time that moribund woman sank for the last time into the arms of her lover. When we reached the door of the theatre, the streets were shining with rain. I had prudently brought along Mrs. Harling\u2019s useful Commencement present, and I took Lena home under its shelter. After leaving her, I walked slowly out into the country part of the town where I lived. The lilacs were all blooming in the yards, and the smell of them after the rain, of the new leaves and the blossoms together, blew into my face with a sort of bitter sweetness. I tramped through the puddles and under the showery trees, mourning for Marguerite Gauthier as if she had died only yesterday, sighing with the spirit of 1840, which had sighed so much, and which had reached me only that night, across long years and several languages, through the person of an infirm old actress. The idea is one that no circumstances can frustrate. Wherever and whenever that piece is put on, it is April. IV HOW WELL I REMEMBER the stiff little parlour where I used to wait for Lena: the hard horsehair furniture, bought at some auction sale, the long mirror, the fashion-plates on the wall. If I sat down even for a moment, I was sure to find threads and bits of coloured silk clinging to my clothes after I went away.", " \u2018In a town of that size Lena would always be gossiped about. Frisco\u2019s the right field for her. She has a fine class of trade. Oh, she\u2019s just the same as she always was! She\u2019s careless, but she\u2019s level-headed. She\u2019s the only person I know who never gets any older. It\u2019s fine for me to have her there; somebody who enjoys things like that. She keeps an eye on me and won\u2019t let me be shabby. When she thinks I need a new dress, she makes it and sends it home with a bill that\u2019s long enough, I can tell you!\u2019 Tiny limped slightly when she walked. The claim on Hunker Creek took toll from its possessors. Tiny had been caught in a sudden turn of weather, like poor Johnson. She lost three toes from one of those pretty little feet that used to trip about Black Hawk in pointed slippers and striped stockings. Tiny mentioned this mutilation quite casually--didn\u2019t seem sensitive about it. She was satisfied with her success, but not elated. She was like someone in whom the faculty of becoming interested is worn out. II SOON AFTER I GOT home that summer, I persuaded my grandparents to have their photographs taken, and one morning I went into the photographer\u2019s shop to arrange for sittings. While I was waiting for him to come out of his developing-room, I walked about trying to recognize the likenesses on his walls: girls in Commencement dresses, country brides and grooms holding hands, family groups of three generations."], "What does Lenado in Black Hawk?": [" If I told my schoolmates that Lena Lingard\u2019s grandfather was a clergyman, and much respected in Norway, they looked at me blankly. What did it matter? All foreigners were ignorant people who couldn\u2019t speak English. There was not a man in Black Hawk who had the intelligence or cultivation, much less the personal distinction, of Antonia\u2019s father. Yet people saw no difference between her and the three Marys; they were all Bohemians, all \u2018hired girls.\u2019 I always knew I should live long enough to see my country girls come into their own, and I have. To-day the best that a harassed Black Hawk merchant can hope for is to sell provisions and farm machinery and automobiles to the rich farms where that first crop of stalwart Bohemian and Scandinavian girls are now the mistresses. The Black Hawk boys looked forward to marrying Black Hawk girls, and living in a brand-new little house with best chairs that must not be sat upon, and hand-painted china that must not be used. But sometimes a young fellow would look up from his ledger, or out through the grating of his father\u2019s bank, and let his eyes follow Lena Lingard, as she passed the window with her slow, undulating walk, or Tiny Soderball, tripping by in her short skirt and striped stockings. The country girls were considered a menace to the social order. Their beauty shone out too boldly against a conventional background. But anxious mothers need have felt no alarm.", " All about us we could hear the felty beat of the raindrops on the soft dust of the farmyard. Grandmother came to the door and said it was late, and we would get wet out there. \u2018In a minute we come,\u2019 Antonia called back to her. \u2018I like your grandmother, and all things here,\u2019 she sighed. \u2018I wish my papa live to see this summer. I wish no winter ever come again.\u2019 \u2018It will be summer a long while yet,\u2019 I reassured her. \u2018Why aren\u2019t you always nice like this, Tony?\u2019 \u2018How nice?\u2019 \u2018Why, just like this; like yourself. Why do you all the time try to be like Ambrosch?\u2019 She put her arms under her head and lay back, looking up at the sky. \u2018If I live here, like you, that is different. Things will be easy for you. But they will be hard for us.\u2019 BOOK II. The Hired Girls I I HAD BEEN LIVING with my grandfather for nearly three years when he decided to move to Black Hawk. He and grandmother were getting old for the heavy work of a farm, and as I was now thirteen they thought I ought to be going to school. Accordingly our homestead was rented to \u2018that good woman, the Widow Steavens,\u2019 and her bachelor brother, and we bought Preacher White\u2019s house, at the north end of Black Hawk. This was the first town house one passed driving in from the farm, a landmark which told country people their long ride was over. We were to move to Black Hawk in March, and as soon as grandfather had fixed the date he let Jake and Otto know of his intention.", " It ain\u2019t my prairie.\u2019 V AFTER LENA CAME To Black Hawk, I often met her downtown, where she would be matching sewing silk or buying \u2018findings\u2019 for Mrs. Thomas. If I happened to walk home with her, she told me all about the dresses she was helping to make, or about what she saw and heard when she was with Tiny Soderball at the hotel on Saturday nights. The Boys\u2019 Home was the best hotel on our branch of the Burlington, and all the commercial travellers in that territory tried to get into Black Hawk for Sunday. They used to assemble in the parlour after supper on Saturday nights. Marshall Field\u2019s man, Anson Kirkpatrick, played the piano and sang all the latest sentimental songs. After Tiny had helped the cook wash the dishes, she and Lena sat on the other side of the double doors between the parlour and the dining-room, listening to the music and giggling at the jokes and stories. Lena often said she hoped I would be a travelling man when I grew up. They had a gay life of it; nothing to do but ride about on trains all day and go to theatres when they were in big cities. Behind the hotel there was an old store building, where the salesmen opened their big trunks and spread out their samples on the counters. The Black Hawk merchants went to look at these things and order goods, and Mrs. Thomas, though she was I retail trade,\u2019 was permitted to see them and to \u2018get ideas.\u2019 They were all generous, these travelling men; they gave Tiny Soderball handkerchiefs and gloves and ribbons and striped stockings, and so many bottles of perfume and cakes of scented soap that she bestowed some of them on Lena.", " \u2018I seen bunches of hair and stuff sticking to the poles and straw along the roof. They was blown up there by gunshot, no question.\u2019 Grandmother told grandfather she meant to go over to the Shimerdas\u2019 with him. \u2018There is nothing you can do,\u2019 he said doubtfully. \u2018The body can\u2019t be touched until we get the coroner here from Black Hawk, and that will be a matter of several days, this weather.\u2019 \u2018Well, I can take them some victuals, anyway, and say a word of comfort to them poor little girls. The oldest one was his darling, and was like a right hand to him. He might have thought of her. He\u2019s left her alone in a hard world.\u2019 She glanced distrustfully at Ambrosch, who was now eating his breakfast at the kitchen table. Fuchs, although he had been up in the cold nearly all night, was going to make the long ride to Black Hawk to fetch the priest and the coroner. On the grey gelding, our best horse, he would try to pick his way across the country with no roads to guide him. \u2018Don\u2019t you worry about me, Mrs. Burden,\u2019 he said cheerfully, as he put on a second pair of socks. \u2018I\u2019ve got a good nose for directions, and I never did need much sleep. It\u2019s the grey I\u2019m worried about. I\u2019ll save him what I can, but it\u2019ll strain him, as sure as I\u2019m telling you!\u2019 \u2018This is no time to be over-considerate of animals, Otto; do the best you can for yourself. Stop at the Widow Steavens\u2019s for dinner. She\u2019s a good woman, and she\u2019ll do well by you.\u2019 After Fuchs rode away, I was left with Ambrosch."], "Who plays thepiano at the Boys' Home dance?": [" There were never girls enough to go round at those dances, but everyone wanted a turn with Tony and Lena. Lena moved without exertion, rather indolently, and her hand often accented the rhythm softly on her partner\u2019s shoulder. She smiled if one spoke to her, but seldom answered. The music seemed to put her into a soft, waking dream, and her violet-coloured eyes looked sleepily and confidingly at one from under her long lashes. When she sighed she exhaled a heavy perfume of sachet powder. To dance \u2018Home, Sweet Home,\u2019 with Lena was like coming in with the tide. She danced every dance like a waltz, and it was always the same waltz--the waltz of coming home to something, of inevitable, fated return. After a while one got restless under it, as one does under the heat of a soft, sultry summer day. When you spun out into the floor with Tony, you didn\u2019t return to anything. You set out every time upon a new adventure. I liked to schottische with her; she had so much spring and variety, and was always putting in new steps and slides. She taught me to dance against and around the hard-and-fast beat of the music. If, instead of going to the end of the railroad, old Mr. Shimerda had stayed in New York and picked up a living with his fiddle, how different Antonia\u2019s life might have been! Antonia often went to the dances with Larry Donovan, a passenger conductor who was a kind of professional ladies\u2019 man, as we said.", " She was a beautiful girl.\u2019 \u2018Oh, we know!\u2019 They both spoke together; seemed a little surprised that I should think it necessary to mention this. \u2018Everybody liked her, didn\u2019t they? The Harlings and your grandmother, and all the town people.\u2019 \u2018Sometimes,\u2019 I ventured, \u2018it doesn\u2019t occur to boys that their mother was ever young and pretty.\u2019 \u2018Oh, we know!\u2019 they said again, warmly. \u2018She\u2019s not very old now,\u2019 Ambrosch added. \u2018Not much older than you.\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 I said, \u2018if you weren\u2019t nice to her, I think I\u2019d take a club and go for the whole lot of you. I couldn\u2019t stand it if you boys were inconsiderate, or thought of her as if she were just somebody who looked after you. You see I was very much in love with your mother once, and I know there\u2019s nobody like her.\u2019 The boys laughed and seemed pleased and embarrassed. \u2018She never told us that,\u2019 said Anton. \u2018But she\u2019s always talked lots about you, and about what good times you used to have. She has a picture of you that she cut out of the Chicago paper once, and Leo says he recognized you when you drove up to the windmill. You can\u2019t tell about Leo, though; sometimes he likes to be smart.\u2019 We brought the cows home to the corner nearest the barn, and the boys milked them while night came on. Everything was as it should be: the strong smell of sunflowers and ironweed in the dew, the clear blue and gold of the sky, the evening star, the purr of the milk into the pails, the grunts and squeals of the pigs fighting over their supper.", " Sometimes I went with her; the moment the lighted tent came into view she would break into a run, like a boy. There were always partners waiting for her; she began to dance before she got her breath. Antonia\u2019s success at the tent had its consequences. The iceman lingered too long now, when he came into the covered porch to fill the refrigerator. The delivery boys hung about the kitchen when they brought the groceries. Young farmers who were in town for Saturday came tramping through the yard to the back door to engage dances, or to invite Tony to parties and picnics. Lena and Norwegian Anna dropped in to help her with her work, so that she could get away early. The boys who brought her home after the dances sometimes laughed at the back gate and wakened Mr. Harling from his first sleep. A crisis was inevitable. One Saturday night Mr. Harling had gone down to the cellar for beer. As he came up the stairs in the dark, he heard scuffling on the back porch, and then the sound of a vigorous slap. He looked out through the side door in time to see a pair of long legs vaulting over the picket fence. Antonia was standing there, angry and excited. Young Harry Paine, who was to marry his employer\u2019s daughter on Monday, had come to the tent with a crowd of friends and danced all evening. Afterward, he begged Antonia to let him walk home with her. She said she supposed he was a nice young man, as he was one of Miss Frances\u2019s friends, and she didn\u2019t mind.", " But the next night all was dark again. After I refused to join \u2018the Owls,\u2019 as they were called, I made a bold resolve to go to the Saturday night dances at Firemen\u2019s Hall. I knew it would be useless to acquaint my elders with any such plan. Grandfather didn\u2019t approve of dancing, anyway; he would only say that if I wanted to dance I could go to the Masonic Hall, among \u2018the people we knew.\u2019 It was just my point that I saw altogether too much of the people we knew. My bedroom was on the ground floor, and as I studied there, I had a stove in it. I used to retire to my room early on Saturday night, change my shirt and collar and put on my Sunday coat. I waited until all was quiet and the old people were asleep, then raised my window, climbed out, and went softly through the yard. The first time I deceived my grandparents I felt rather shabby, perhaps even the second time, but I soon ceased to think about it. The dance at the Firemen\u2019s Hall was the one thing I looked forward to all the week. There I met the same people I used to see at the Vannis\u2019 tent. Sometimes there were Bohemians from Wilber, or German boys who came down on the afternoon freight from Bismarck. Tony and Lena and Tiny were always there, and the three Bohemian Marys, and the Danish laundry girls. The four Danish girls lived with the laundryman and his wife in their house behind the laundry, with a big garden where the clothes were hung out to dry."], "Who begins thedancing in Black Hawk?": [" If I told my schoolmates that Lena Lingard\u2019s grandfather was a clergyman, and much respected in Norway, they looked at me blankly.

One sees that draught-horse neck among the peasant women in all old countries. She greeted me gaily, and began at once to tell me how much ploughing she had done that day. Ambrosch, she said, was on the north quarter, breaking sod with the oxen. \u2018Jim, you ask Jake how much he ploughed to-day. I don\u2019t want that Jake get more done in one day than me. I want we have very much corn this fall.\u2019 While the horses drew in the water, and nosed each other, and then drank again, Antonia sat down on the windmill step and rested her head on her hand. \u2018You see the big prairie fire from your place last night?

Was she going to grow up boastful like her mother, I wondered?"], "With which ofthe following men does Jim fight?": [" Otto Fuchs was the first one we met. He was sitting on the edge of the cattle-pond, having a quiet pipe before supper. Antonia called him to come quick and look. He did not say anything for a minute, but scratched his head and turned the snake over with his boot. \u2018Where did you run onto that beauty, Jim?\u2019 \u2018Up at the dog-town,\u2019 I answered laconically. \u2018Kill him yourself? How come you to have a weepon?\u2019 \u2018We\u2019d been up to Russian Peter\u2019s, to borrow a spade for Ambrosch.\u2019 Otto shook the ashes out of his pipe and squatted down to count the rattles. \u2018It was just luck you had a tool,\u2019 he said cautiously. \u2018Gosh! I wouldn\u2019t want to do any business with that fellow myself, unless I had a fence-post along. Your grandmother\u2019s snake-cane wouldn\u2019t more than tickle him. He could stand right up and talk to you, he could. Did he fight hard?\u2019 Antonia broke in: \u2018He fight something awful! He is all over Jimmy\u2019s boots. I scream for him to run, but he just hit and hit that snake like he was crazy.\u2019 Otto winked at me. After Antonia rode on he said: \u2018Got him in the head first crack, didn\u2019t you? That was just as well.\u2019 We hung him up to the windmill, and when I went down to the kitchen, I found Antonia standing in the middle of the floor, telling the story with a great deal of colour. Subsequent experiences with rattlesnakes taught me that my first encounter was fortunate in circumstance. My big rattler was old, and had led too easy a life; there was not much fight in him.", " \u201cOf course,\u201d he said, \u201cI should have to do it in a direct way, and say a great deal about myself. It\u2019s through myself that I knew and felt her, and I\u2019ve had no practice in any other form of presentation.\u201d I told him that how he knew her and felt her was exactly what I most wanted to know about Antonia. He had had opportunities that I, as a little girl who watched her come and go, had not. Months afterward Jim Burden arrived at my apartment one stormy winter afternoon, with a bulging legal portfolio sheltered under his fur overcoat. He brought it into the sitting-room with him and tapped it with some pride as he stood warming his hands. \u201cI finished it last night--the thing about Antonia,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, what about yours?\u201d I had to confess that mine had not gone beyond a few straggling notes. \u201cNotes? I didn\u2019t make any.\u201d He drank his tea all at once and put down the cup. \u201cI didn\u2019t arrange or rearrange. I simply wrote down what of herself and myself and other people Antonia\u2019s name recalls to me. I suppose it hasn\u2019t any form. It hasn\u2019t any title, either.\u201d He went into the next room, sat down at my desk and wrote on the pinkish face of the portfolio the word, \u201cAntonia.\u201d He frowned at this a moment, then prefixed another word, making it \u201cMy Antonia.\u201d That seemed to satisfy him. \u201cRead it as soon as you can,\u201d he said, rising, \u201cbut don\u2019t let it influence your own story.\u201d My own story was never written, but the following narrative is Jim\u2019s manuscript, substantially as he brought it to me.", " Grandfather\u2019s prayers were often very interesting. He had the gift of simple and moving expression. Because he talked so little, his words had a peculiar force; they were not worn dull from constant use. His prayers reflected what he was thinking about at the time, and it was chiefly through them that we got to know his feelings and his views about things. After we sat down to our waffles and sausage, Jake told us how pleased the Shimerdas had been with their presents; even Ambrosch was friendly and went to the creek with him to cut the Christmas tree. It was a soft grey day outside, with heavy clouds working across the sky, and occasional squalls of snow. There were always odd jobs to be done about the barn on holidays, and the men were busy until afternoon. Then Jake and I played dominoes, while Otto wrote a long letter home to his mother. He always wrote to her on Christmas Day, he said, no matter where he was, and no matter how long it had been since his last letter. All afternoon he sat in the dining-room. He would write for a while, then sit idle, his clenched fist lying on the table, his eyes following the pattern of the oilcloth. He spoke and wrote his own language so seldom that it came to him awkwardly. His effort to remember entirely absorbed him. At about four o\u2019clock a visitor appeared: Mr. Shimerda, wearing his rabbit-skin cap and collar, and new mittens his wife had knitted.", " At dinner grandfather talked to Jelinek more than he usually did to strangers. \u2018Will they be much disappointed because we cannot get a priest?\u2019 he asked. Jelinek looked serious. \u2018Yes, sir, that is very bad for them. Their father has done a great sin\u2019--he looked straight at grandfather. \u2018Our Lord has said that.\u2019 Grandfather seemed to like his frankness. \u2018We believe that, too, Jelinek. But we believe that Mr. Shimerda\u2019s soul will come to its Creator as well off without a priest. We believe that Christ is our only intercessor.\u2019 The young man shook his head. \u2018I know how you think. My teacher at the school has explain. But I have seen too much. I believe in prayer for the dead. I have seen too much.\u2019 We asked him what he meant. He glanced around the table. \u2018You want I shall tell you? When I was a little boy like this one, I begin to help the priest at the altar. I make my first communion very young; what the Church teach seem plain to me. By \u2018n\u2019 by war-times come, when the Prussians fight us. We have very many soldiers in camp near my village, and the cholera break out in that camp, and the men die like flies. All day long our priest go about there to give the Sacrament to dying men, and I go with him to carry the vessels with the Holy Sacrament. Everybody that go near that camp catch the sickness but me and the priest. But we have no sickness, we have no fear, because we carry that blood and that body of Christ, and it preserve us.\u2019 He paused, looking at grandfather."], "Who becomes Jim'stutor in Lincoln?": [" I seemed to have forgotten all my reasonable explanations. Lena drew close to me, and the little hesitation in her voice that had hurt me was not there when she spoke again. \u2018I oughtn\u2019t to have begun it, ought I?\u2019 she murmured. \u2018I oughtn\u2019t to have gone to see you that first time. But I did want to. I guess I\u2019ve always been a little foolish about you. I don\u2019t know what first put it into my head, unless it was Antonia, always telling me I mustn\u2019t be up to any of my nonsense with you. I let you alone for a long while, though, didn\u2019t I?\u2019 She was a sweet creature to those she loved, that Lena Lingard! At last she sent me away with her soft, slow, renunciatory kiss. \u2018You aren\u2019t sorry I came to see you that time?\u2019 she whispered. \u2018It seemed so natural. I used to think I\u2019d like to be your first sweetheart. You were such a funny kid!\u2019 She always kissed one as if she were sadly and wisely sending one away forever. We said many good-byes before I left Lincoln, but she never tried to hinder me or hold me back. \u2018You are going, but you haven\u2019t gone yet, have you?\u2019 she used to say. My Lincoln chapter closed abruptly. I went home to my grandparents for a few weeks, and afterward visited my relatives in Virginia until I joined Cleric in Boston. I was then nineteen years old. BOOK IV. The Pioneer Woman\u2019s Story I TWO YEARS AFTER I left Lincoln, I completed my academic course at Harvard. Before I entered the Law School I went home for the summer vacation.", " Gaston Cleric had arrived in Lincoln only a few weeks earlier than I, to begin his work as head of the Latin Department. He came West at the suggestion of his physicians, his health having been enfeebled by a long illness in Italy. When I took my entrance examinations, he was my examiner, and my course was arranged under his supervision. I did not go home for my first summer vacation, but stayed in Lincoln, working off a year\u2019s Greek, which had been my only condition on entering the freshman class. Cleric\u2019s doctor advised against his going back to New England, and, except for a few weeks in Colorado, he, too, was in Lincoln all that summer. We played tennis, read, and took long walks together. I shall always look back on that time of mental awakening as one of the happiest in my life. Gaston Cleric introduced me to the world of ideas; when one first enters that world everything else fades for a time, and all that went before is as if it had not been. Yet I found curious survivals; some of the figures of my old life seemed to be waiting for me in the new. In those days there were many serious young men among the students who had come up to the university from the farms and the little towns scattered over the thinly settled state. Some of those boys came straight from the cornfields with only a summer\u2019s wages in their pockets, hung on through the four years, shabby and underfed, and completed the course by really heroic self-sacrifice.", " I hurried to the door and when I opened it saw a woman standing in the dark hall. \u2018I expect you hardly know me, Jim.\u2019 The voice seemed familiar, but I did not recognize her until she stepped into the light of my doorway and I beheld--Lena Lingard! She was so quietly conventionalized by city clothes that I might have passed her on the street without seeing her. Her black suit fitted her figure smoothly, and a black lace hat, with pale-blue forget-me-nots, sat demurely on her yellow hair. I led her toward Cleric\u2019s chair, the only comfortable one I had, questioning her confusedly. She was not disconcerted by my embarrassment. She looked about her with the naive curiosity I remembered so well. \u2018You are quite comfortable here, aren\u2019t you? I live in Lincoln now, too, Jim. I\u2019m in business for myself. I have a dressmaking shop in the Raleigh Block, out on O Street. I\u2019ve made a real good start.\u2019 \u2018But, Lena, when did you come?\u2019 \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve been here all winter. Didn\u2019t your grandmother ever write you? I\u2019ve thought about looking you up lots of times. But we\u2019ve all heard what a studious young man you\u2019ve got to be, and I felt bashful. I didn\u2019t know whether you\u2019d be glad to see me.\u2019 She laughed her mellow, easy laugh, that was either very artless or very comprehending, one never quite knew which. \u2018You seem the same, though--except you\u2019re a young man, now, of course. Do you think I\u2019ve changed?\u2019 \u2018Maybe you\u2019re prettier--though you were always pretty enough.", " Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim. If you\u2019re going to be a preacher, I want you to marry me. You must promise to marry us all, and then baptize the babies.\u2019 Norwegian Anna, always dignified, looked at her reprovingly. \u2018Baptists don\u2019t believe in christening babies, do they, Jim?\u2019 I told her I didn\u2019t know what they believed, and didn\u2019t care, and that I certainly wasn\u2019t going to be a preacher. \u2018That\u2019s too bad,\u2019 Tiny simpered. She was in a teasing mood. \u2018You\u2019d make such a good one. You\u2019re so studious. Maybe you\u2019d like to be a professor. You used to teach Tony, didn\u2019t you?\u2019 Antonia broke in. \u2018I\u2019ve set my heart on Jim being a doctor. You\u2019d be good with sick people, Jim. Your grandmother\u2019s trained you up so nice. My papa always said you were an awful smart boy.\u2019 I said I was going to be whatever I pleased. \u2018Won\u2019t you be surprised, Miss Tiny, if I turn out to be a regular devil of a fellow?\u2019 They laughed until a glance from Norwegian Anna checked them; the high-school principal had just come into the front part of the shop to buy bread for supper. Anna knew the whisper was going about that I was a sly one. People said there must be something queer about a boy who showed no interest in girls of his own age, but who could be lively enough when he was with Tony and Lena or the three Marys. The enthusiasm for the dance, which the Vannis had kindled, did not at once die out."], "What play doJim and Lena see together?": [" I liked to watch a play with Lena; everything was wonderful to her, and everything was true. It was like going to revival meetings with someone who was always being converted. She handed her feelings over to the actors with a kind of fatalistic resignation. Accessories of costume and scene meant much more to her than to me. She sat entranced through \u2018Robin Hood\u2019 and hung upon the lips of the contralto who sang, \u2018Oh, Promise Me!\u2019 Toward the end of April, the billboards, which I watched anxiously in those days, bloomed out one morning with gleaming white posters on which two names were impressively printed in blue Gothic letters: the name of an actress of whom I had often heard, and the name \u2018Camille.\u2019 I called at the Raleigh Block for Lena on Saturday evening, and we walked down to the theatre. The weather was warm and sultry and put us both in a holiday humour. We arrived early, because Lena liked to watch the people come in. There was a note on the programme, saying that the \u2018incidental music\u2019 would be from the opera \u2018Traviata,\u2019 which was made from the same story as the play. We had neither of us read the play, and we did not know what it was about--though I seemed to remember having heard it was a piece in which great actresses shone. \u2018The Count of Monte Cristo,\u2019 which I had seen James O\u2019Neill play that winter, was by the only Alexandre Dumas I knew. This play, I saw, was by his son, and I expected a family resemblance.", " My business took me West several times every year, and it was always in the back of my mind that I would stop in Nebraska some day and go to see Antonia. But I kept putting it off until the next trip. I did not want to find her aged and broken; I really dreaded it. In the course of twenty crowded years one parts with many illusions. I did not wish to lose the early ones. Some memories are realities, and are better than anything that can ever happen to one again. I owe it to Lena Lingard that I went to see Antonia at last. I was in San Francisco two summers ago when both Lena and Tiny Soderball were in town. Tiny lives in a house of her own, and Lena\u2019s shop is in an apartment house just around the corner. It interested me, after so many years, to see the two women together. Tiny audits Lena\u2019s accounts occasionally, and invests her money for her; and Lena, apparently, takes care that Tiny doesn\u2019t grow too miserly. \u2018If there\u2019s anything I can\u2019t stand,\u2019 she said to me in Tiny\u2019s presence, \u2018it\u2019s a shabby rich woman.\u2019 Tiny smiled grimly and assured me that Lena would never be either shabby or rich. \u2018And I don\u2019t want to be,\u2019 the other agreed complacently. Lena gave me a cheerful account of Antonia and urged me to make her a visit. \u2018You really ought to go, Jim. It would be such a satisfaction to her. Never mind what Tiny says. There\u2019s nothing the matter with Cuzak. You\u2019d like him. He isn\u2019t a hustler, but a rough man would never have suited Tony.", " But Lena Lingard only laughed her lazy, good-natured laugh and rode on, gazing back over her shoulder at Ole\u2019s infuriated wife. The time came, however, when Lena didn\u2019t laugh. More than once Crazy Mary chased her across the prairie and round and round the Shimerdas\u2019 cornfield. Lena never told her father; perhaps she was ashamed; perhaps she was more afraid of his anger than of the corn-knife. I was at the Shimerdas\u2019 one afternoon when Lena came bounding through the red grass as fast as her white legs could carry her. She ran straight into the house and hid in Antonia\u2019s feather-bed. Mary was not far behind: she came right up to the door and made us feel how sharp her blade was, showing us very graphically just what she meant to do to Lena. Mrs. Shimerda, leaning out of the window, enjoyed the situation keenly, and was sorry when Antonia sent Mary away, mollified by an apronful of bottle-tomatoes. Lena came out from Tony\u2019s room behind the kitchen, very pink from the heat of the feathers, but otherwise calm. She begged Antonia and me to go with her, and help get her cattle together; they were scattered and might be gorging themselves in somebody\u2019s cornfield. \u2018Maybe you lose a steer and learn not to make somethings with your eyes at married men,\u2019 Mrs. Shimerda told her hectoringly. Lena only smiled her sleepy smile. \u2018I never made anything to him with my eyes. I can\u2019t help it if he hangs around, and I can\u2019t order him off.", " Yes, I\u2019ve seen her with you at the theatre. She\u2019s very pretty, and perfectly irresponsible, I should judge.\u2019 Cleric wrote my grandfather that he would like to take me East with him. To my astonishment, grandfather replied that I might go if I wished. I was both glad and sorry on the day when the letter came. I stayed in my room all evening and thought things over. I even tried to persuade myself that I was standing in Lena\u2019s way--it is so necessary to be a little noble!--and that if she had not me to play with, she would probably marry and secure her future. The next evening I went to call on Lena. I found her propped up on the couch in her bay-window, with her foot in a big slipper. An awkward little Russian girl whom she had taken into her work-room had dropped a flat-iron on Lena\u2019s toe. On the table beside her there was a basket of early summer flowers which the Pole had left after he heard of the accident. He always managed to know what went on in Lena\u2019s apartment. Lena was telling me some amusing piece of gossip about one of her clients, when I interrupted her and picked up the flower basket. \u2018This old chap will be proposing to you some day, Lena.\u2019 \u2018Oh, he has--often!\u2019 she murmured. \u2018What! After you\u2019ve refused him?\u2019 \u2018He doesn\u2019t mind that. It seems to cheer him to mention the subject. Old men are like that, you know. It makes them feel important to think they\u2019re in love with somebody.\u2019 \u2018The colonel would marry you in a minute."], "Where did WillaCather live before moving to Nebraska?": [" He wore the rings and pins and badges of different fraternal orders to which he belonged. Even his cuff-buttons were engraved with hieroglyphics, and he was more inscribed than an Egyptian obelisk. Once when he sat down to chat, he told us that in the immigrant car ahead there was a family from \u2018across the water\u2019 whose destination was the same as ours. \u2018They can\u2019t any of them speak English, except one little girl, and all she can say is \u201cWe go Black Hawk, Nebraska.\u201d She\u2019s not much older than you, twelve or thirteen, maybe, and she\u2019s as bright as a new dollar. Don\u2019t you want to go ahead and see her, Jimmy? She\u2019s got the pretty brown eyes, too!\u2019 This last remark made me bashful, and I shook my head and settled down to \u2018Jesse James.\u2019 Jake nodded at me approvingly and said you were likely to get diseases from foreigners. I do not remember crossing the Missouri River, or anything about the long day\u2019s journey through Nebraska. Probably by that time I had crossed so many rivers that I was dull to them. The only thing very noticeable about Nebraska was that it was still, all day long, Nebraska. I had been sleeping, curled up in a red plush seat, for a long while when we reached Black Hawk. Jake roused me and took me by the hand. We stumbled down from the train to a wooden siding, where men were running about with lanterns. I couldn\u2019t see any town, or even distant lights; we were surrounded by utter darkness.", " Tony has nice children--ten or eleven of them by this time, I guess. I shouldn\u2019t care for a family of that size myself, but somehow it\u2019s just right for Tony. She\u2019d love to show them to you.\u2019 On my way East I broke my journey at Hastings, in Nebraska, and set off with an open buggy and a fairly good livery team to find the Cuzak farm. At a little past midday, I knew I must be nearing my destination. Set back on a swell of land at my right, I saw a wide farm-house, with a red barn and an ash grove, and cattle-yards in front that sloped down to the highroad. I drew up my horses and was wondering whether I should drive in here, when I heard low voices. Ahead of me, in a plum thicket beside the road, I saw two boys bending over a dead dog. The little one, not more than four or five, was on his knees, his hands folded, and his close-clipped, bare head drooping forward in deep dejection. The other stood beside him, a hand on his shoulder, and was comforting him in a language I had not heard for a long while. When I stopped my horses opposite them, the older boy took his brother by the hand and came toward me. He, too, looked grave. This was evidently a sad afternoon for them. \u2018Are you Mrs. Cuzak\u2019s boys?\u2019 I asked. The younger one did not look up; he was submerged in his own feelings, but his brother met me with intelligent grey eyes. \u2018Yes, sir.\u2019 \u2018Does she live up there on the hill? I am going to see her.", " All about us we could hear the felty beat of the raindrops on the soft dust of the farmyard. Grandmother came to the door and said it was late, and we would get wet out there. \u2018In a minute we come,\u2019 Antonia called back to her. \u2018I like your grandmother, and all things here,\u2019 she sighed. \u2018I wish my papa live to see this summer. I wish no winter ever come again.\u2019 \u2018It will be summer a long while yet,\u2019 I reassured her. \u2018Why aren\u2019t you always nice like this, Tony?\u2019 \u2018How nice?\u2019 \u2018Why, just like this; like yourself. Why do you all the time try to be like Ambrosch?\u2019 She put her arms under her head and lay back, looking up at the sky. \u2018If I live here, like you, that is different. Things will be easy for you. But they will be hard for us.\u2019 BOOK II. The Hired Girls I I HAD BEEN LIVING with my grandfather for nearly three years when he decided to move to Black Hawk. He and grandmother were getting old for the heavy work of a farm, and as I was now thirteen they thought I ought to be going to school. Accordingly our homestead was rented to \u2018that good woman, the Widow Steavens,\u2019 and her bachelor brother, and we bought Preacher White\u2019s house, at the north end of Black Hawk. This was the first town house one passed driving in from the farm, a landmark which told country people their long ride was over. We were to move to Black Hawk in March, and as soon as grandfather had fixed the date he let Jake and Otto know of his intention.", " Now I must go, or my girls will be doing all the work, and I want to cook your supper myself.\u2019 As we went toward the house, we met Ambrosch and Anton, starting off with their milking-pails to hunt the cows. I joined them, and Leo accompanied us at some distance, running ahead and starting up at us out of clumps of ironweed, calling, \u2018I\u2019m a jack rabbit,\u2019 or, \u2018I\u2019m a big bull-snake.\u2019 I walked between the two older boys--straight, well-made fellows, with good heads and clear eyes. They talked about their school and the new teacher, told me about the crops and the harvest, and how many steers they would feed that winter. They were easy and confidential with me, as if I were an old friend of the family--and not too old. I felt like a boy in their company, and all manner of forgotten interests revived in me. It seemed, after all, so natural to be walking along a barbed-wire fence beside the sunset, toward a red pond, and to see my shadow moving along at my right, over the close-cropped grass. \u2018Has mother shown you the pictures you sent her from the old country?\u2019 Ambrosch asked. \u2018We\u2019ve had them framed and they\u2019re hung up in the parlour. She was so glad to get them. I don\u2019t believe I ever saw her so pleased about anything.\u2019 There was a note of simple gratitude in his voice that made me wish I had given more occasion for it. I put my hand on his shoulder. \u2018Your mother, you know, was very much loved by all of us."], "What is Jim'sprofession when he writes the memoir?": [" Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim.

I suppose it wouldn\u2019t be right for you to leave the place alone, either, after giving your word. Maybe Jim would be willing to go over there and sleep, and you could come here nights. I\u2019d feel safer, knowing you were under my own roof. I guess Jim could take care of their silver and old usury notes as well as you could.\u2019 Antonia turned to me eagerly. \u2018Oh, would you, Jim? I\u2019d make up my bed nice and fresh for you. It\u2019s a real cool room, and the bed\u2019s right next the window. I was afraid to leave the window open last night.\u2019 I liked my own room, and I didn\u2019t like the Cutters\u2019 house under any circumstances; but Tony looked so troubled that I consented to try this arrangement. I found that I slept there as well as anywhere, and when I got home in the morning, Tony had a good breakfast waiting for me. After prayers she sat down at the table with us, and it was like old times in the country. The third night I spent at the Cutters\u2019, I awoke suddenly with the impression that I had heard a door open and shut. Everything was still, however, and I must have gone to sleep again immediately. The next thing I knew, I felt someone sit down on the edge of the bed.", " I didn\u2019t believe you could do as well as that. You didn\u2019t get that speech out of books.\u2019 Among my graduation presents there was a silk umbrella from Mrs. Harling, with my name on the handle. I walked home from the Opera House alone. As I passed the Methodist Church, I saw three white figures ahead of me, pacing up and down under the arching maple trees, where the moonlight filtered through the lush June foliage. They hurried toward me; they were waiting for me--Lena and Tony and Anna Hansen. \u2018Oh, Jim, it was splendid!\u2019 Tony was breathing hard, as she always did when her feelings outran her language. \u2018There ain\u2019t a lawyer in Black Hawk could make a speech like that. I just stopped your grandpa and said so to him. He won\u2019t tell you, but he told us he was awful surprised himself, didn\u2019t he, girls?\u2019 Lena sidled up to me and said teasingly, \u2018What made you so solemn? I thought you were scared. I was sure you\u2019d forget.\u2019 Anna spoke wistfully. \u2018It must make you very happy, Jim, to have fine thoughts like that in your mind all the time, and to have words to put them in.

She has her own fortune and lives her own life. For some reason, she wishes to remain Mrs. James Burden. As for Jim, no disappointments have been severe enough to chill his naturally romantic and ardent disposition. This disposition, though it often made him seem very funny when he was a boy, has been one of the strongest elements in his success. He loves with a personal passion the great country through which his railway runs and branches. His faith in it and his knowledge of it have played an important part in its development. He is always able to raise capital for new enterprises in Wyoming or Montana, and has helped young men out there to do remarkable things in mines and timber and oil. If a young man with an idea can once get Jim Burden\u2019s attention, can manage to accompany him when he goes off into the wilds hunting for lost parks or exploring new canyons, then the money which means action is usually forthcoming. Jim is still able to lose himself in those big Western dreams. Though he is over forty now, he meets new people and new enterprises with the impulsiveness by which his boyhood friends remember him. He never seems to me to grow older. His fresh color and sandy hair and quick-changing blue eyes are those of a young man, and his sympathetic, solicitous interest in women is as youthful as it is Western and American."], "How many yearspass between the last two books of the novel?": [" I can\u2019t think of what I want to say, you\u2019ve got me so stirred up.

You wouldn\u2019t have known me, would you, Jim? You\u2019ve kept so young, yourself. But it\u2019s easier for a man. I can\u2019t see how my Anton looks any older than the day I married him. His teeth have kept so nice. I haven\u2019t got many left. But I feel just as young as I used to, and I can do as much work. Oh, we don\u2019t have to work so hard now! We\u2019ve got plenty to help us, papa and me. And how many have you got, Jim?\u2019 When I told her I had no children, she seemed embarrassed. \u2018Oh, ain\u2019t that too bad! Maybe you could take one of my bad ones, now? That Leo; he\u2019s the worst of all.\u2019 She leaned toward me with a smile. \u2018And I love him the best,\u2019 she whispered. \u2018Mother!\u2019 the two girls murmured reproachfully from the dishes. Antonia threw up her head and laughed. \u2018I can\u2019t help it. You know I do. Maybe it\u2019s because he came on Easter Day, I don\u2019t know. And he\u2019s never out of mischief one minute!\u2019 I was thinking, as I watched her, how little it mattered--about her teeth, for instance. I know so many women who have kept all the things that she had lost, but whose inner glow has faded.", " He looked like a humorous philosopher who had hitched up one shoulder under the burdens of life, and gone on his way having a good time when he could. He advanced to meet me and gave me a hard hand, burned red on the back and heavily coated with hair. He wore his Sunday clothes, very thick and hot for the weather, an unstarched white shirt, and a blue necktie with big white dots, like a little boy\u2019s, tied in a flowing bow. Cuzak began at once to talk about his holiday--from politeness he spoke in English. \u2018Mama, I wish you had see the lady dance on the slack-wire in the street at night. They throw a bright light on her and she float through the air something beautiful, like a bird! They have a dancing bear, like in the old country, and two-three merry-go-around, and people in balloons, and what you call the big wheel, Rudolph?\u2019 \u2018A Ferris wheel,\u2019 Rudolph entered the conversation in a deep baritone voice. He was six foot two, and had a chest like a young blacksmith. \u2018We went to the big dance in the hall behind the saloon last night, mother, and I danced with all the girls, and so did father. I never saw so many pretty girls. It was a Bohunk crowd, for sure. We didn\u2019t hear a word of English on the street, except from the show people, did we, papa?\u2019 Cuzak nodded. \u2018And very many send word to you, Antonia. You will excuse\u2019--turning to me--\u2018if I tell her.\u2019 While we walked toward the house he related incidents and delivered messages in the tongue he spoke fluently, and I dropped a little behind, curious to know what their relations had become--or remained.", " My business took me West several times every year, and it was always in the back of my mind that I would stop in Nebraska some day and go to see Antonia. But I kept putting it off until the next trip. I did not want to find her aged and broken; I really dreaded it. In the course of twenty crowded years one parts with many illusions. I did not wish to lose the early ones. Some memories are realities, and are better than anything that can ever happen to one again. I owe it to Lena Lingard that I went to see Antonia at last. I was in San Francisco two summers ago when both Lena and Tiny Soderball were in town. Tiny lives in a house of her own, and Lena\u2019s shop is in an apartment house just around the corner. It interested me, after so many years, to see the two women together. Tiny audits Lena\u2019s accounts occasionally, and invests her money for her; and Lena, apparently, takes care that Tiny doesn\u2019t grow too miserly. \u2018If there\u2019s anything I can\u2019t stand,\u2019 she said to me in Tiny\u2019s presence, \u2018it\u2019s a shabby rich woman.\u2019 Tiny smiled grimly and assured me that Lena would never be either shabby or rich. \u2018And I don\u2019t want to be,\u2019 the other agreed complacently. Lena gave me a cheerful account of Antonia and urged me to make her a visit. \u2018You really ought to go, Jim. It would be such a satisfaction to her. Never mind what Tiny says. There\u2019s nothing the matter with Cuzak. You\u2019d like him. He isn\u2019t a hustler, but a rough man would never have suited Tony.", " She remembered home as a place where there were always too many children, a cross man and work piling up around a sick woman. \u2018It wasn\u2019t mother\u2019s fault. She would have made us comfortable if she could. But that was no life for a girl! After I began to herd and milk, I could never get the smell of the cattle off me. The few underclothes I had I kept in a cracker-box. On Saturday nights, after everybody was in bed, then I could take a bath if I wasn\u2019t too tired. I could make two trips to the windmill to carry water, and heat it in the wash-boiler on the stove. While the water was heating, I could bring in a washtub out of the cave, and take my bath in the kitchen. Then I could put on a clean night-gown and get into bed with two others, who likely hadn\u2019t had a bath unless I\u2019d given it to them. You can\u2019t tell me anything about family life. I\u2019ve had plenty to last me.\u2019 \u2018But it\u2019s not all like that,\u2019 I objected. \u2018Near enough. It\u2019s all being under somebody\u2019s thumb. What\u2019s on your mind, Jim? Are you afraid I\u2019ll want you to marry me some day?\u2019 Then I told her I was going away. \u2018What makes you want to go away, Jim? Haven\u2019t I been nice to you?\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ve been just awfully good to me, Lena,\u2019 I blurted. \u2018I don\u2019t think about much else. I never shall think about much else while I\u2019m with you. I\u2019ll never settle down and grind if I stay here. You know that.\u2019 I dropped down beside her and sat looking at the floor."], "Who abandons\u00c1ntonia before their wedding?": [" She went to country funerals and weddings in all weathers. A farmer\u2019s daughter who was to be married could count on a wedding present from Frances Harling. In August the Harlings\u2019 Danish cook had to leave them. Grandmother entreated them to try Antonia. She cornered Ambrosch the next time he came to town, and pointed out to him that any connection with Christian Harling would strengthen his credit and be of advantage to him. One Sunday Mrs. Harling took the long ride out to the Shimerdas\u2019 with Frances. She said she wanted to see \u2018what the girl came from\u2019 and to have a clear understanding with her mother. I was in our yard when they came driving home, just before sunset. They laughed and waved to me as they passed, and I could see they were in great good humour. After supper, when grandfather set off to church, grandmother and I took my short cut through the willow hedge and went over to hear about the visit to the Shimerdas\u2019. We found Mrs. Harling with Charley and Sally on the front porch, resting after her hard drive. Julia was in the hammock--she was fond of repose--and Frances was at the piano, playing without a light and talking to her mother through the open window. Mrs. Harling laughed when she saw us coming. \u2018I expect you left your dishes on the table tonight, Mrs. Burden,\u2019 she called. Frances shut the piano and came out to join us. They had liked Antonia from their first glimpse of her; felt they knew exactly what kind of girl she was.", " He had always thought he would like to raise oranges! The second year a hard frost killed his young grove, and he fell ill with malaria. He came to Nebraska to visit his cousin, Anton Jelinek, and to look about. When he began to look about, he saw Antonia, and she was exactly the kind of girl he had always been hunting for. They were married at once, though he had to borrow money from his cousin to buy the wedding ring. \u2018It was a pretty hard job, breaking up this place and making the first crops grow,\u2019 he said, pushing back his hat and scratching his grizzled hair. \u2018Sometimes I git awful sore on this place and want to quit, but my wife she always say we better stick it out. The babies come along pretty fast, so it look like it be hard to move, anyhow. I guess she was right, all right. We got this place clear now. We pay only twenty dollars an acre then, and I been offered a hundred. We bought another quarter ten years ago, and we got it most paid for. We got plenty boys; we can work a lot of land. Yes, she is a good wife for a poor man. She ain\u2019t always so strict with me, neither. Sometimes maybe I drink a little too much beer in town, and when I come home she don\u2019t say nothing. She don\u2019t ask me no questions. We always get along fine, her and me, like at first. The children don\u2019t make trouble between us, like sometimes happens.\u2019 He lit another pipe and pulled on it contentedly.", " Antonia spoke to Leo in Bohemian. He frowned and wrinkled up his face. He seemed to be trying to pout, but his attempt only brought out dimples in unusual places. After twisting and screwing the keys, he played some Bohemian airs, without the organ to hold him back, and that went better. The boy was so restless that I had not had a chance to look at his face before. My first impression was right; he really was faun-like. He hadn\u2019t much head behind his ears, and his tawny fleece grew down thick to the back of his neck. His eyes were not frank and wide apart like those of the other boys, but were deep-set, gold-green in colour, and seemed sensitive to the light. His mother said he got hurt oftener than all the others put together. He was always trying to ride the colts before they were broken, teasing the turkey gobbler, seeing just how much red the bull would stand for, or how sharp the new axe was. After the concert was over, Antonia brought out a big boxful of photographs: she and Anton in their wedding clothes, holding hands; her brother Ambrosch and his very fat wife, who had a farm of her own, and who bossed her husband, I was delighted to hear; the three Bohemian Marys and their large families. \u2018You wouldn\u2019t believe how steady those girls have turned out,\u2019 Antonia remarked. \u2018Mary Svoboda\u2019s the best butter-maker in all this country, and a fine manager. Her children will have a grand chance.\u2019 As Antonia turned over the pictures the young Cuzaks stood behind her chair, looking over her shoulder with interested faces.", " On the back porch he tried to kiss her, and when she protested--because he was going to be married on Monday--he caught her and kissed her until she got one hand free and slapped him. Mr. Harling put his beer-bottles down on the table. \u2018This is what I\u2019ve been expecting, Antonia. You\u2019ve been going with girls who have a reputation for being free and easy, and now you\u2019ve got the same reputation. I won\u2019t have this and that fellow tramping about my back yard all the time. This is the end of it, tonight. It stops, short. You can quit going to these dances, or you can hunt another place. Think it over.\u2019 The next morning when Mrs. Harling and Frances tried to reason with Antonia, they found her agitated but determined. \u2018Stop going to the tent?\u2019 she panted. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t think of it for a minute! My own father couldn\u2019t make me stop! Mr. Harling ain\u2019t my boss outside my work. I won\u2019t give up my friends, either. The boys I go with are nice fellows. I thought Mr. Paine was all right, too, because he used to come here. I guess I gave him a red face for his wedding, all right!\u2019 she blazed out indignantly. \u2018You\u2019ll have to do one thing or the other, Antonia,\u2019 Mrs. Harling told her decidedly. \u2018I can\u2019t go back on what Mr. Harling has said. This is his house.\u2019 \u2018Then I\u2019ll just leave, Mrs. Harling. Lena\u2019s been wanting me to get a place closer to her for a long while. Mary Svoboda\u2019s going away from the Cutters\u2019 to work at the hotel, and I can have her place.\u2019 Mrs. Harling rose from her chair."], "From whom doesJim seek information about \u00c1ntonia when he visits Black Hawk beforestarting law school?": [" Physically they were almost a race apart, and out-of-door work had given them a vigour which, when they got over their first shyness on coming to town, developed into a positive carriage and freedom of movement, and made them conspicuous among Black Hawk women. That was before the day of high-school athletics. Girls who had to walk more than half a mile to school were pitied. There was not a tennis-court in the town; physical exercise was thought rather inelegant for the daughters of well-to-do families. Some of the high-school girls were jolly and pretty, but they stayed indoors in winter because of the cold, and in summer because of the heat. When one danced with them, their bodies never moved inside their clothes; their muscles seemed to ask but one thing--not to be disturbed. I remember those girls merely as faces in the schoolroom, gay and rosy, or listless and dull, cut off below the shoulders, like cherubs, by the ink-smeared tops of the high desks that were surely put there to make us round-shouldered and hollow-chested. The daughters of Black Hawk merchants had a confident, unenquiring belief that they were \u2018refined,\u2019 and that the country girls, who \u2018worked out,\u2019 were not. The American farmers in our county were quite as hard-pressed as their neighbours from other countries. All alike had come to Nebraska with little capital and no knowledge of the soil they must subdue.", " All about us we could hear the felty beat of the raindrops on the soft dust of the farmyard. Grandmother came to the door and said it was late, and we would get wet out there. \u2018In a minute we come,\u2019 Antonia called back to her. \u2018I like your grandmother, and all things here,\u2019 she sighed. \u2018I wish my papa live to see this summer. I wish no winter ever come again.\u2019 \u2018It will be summer a long while yet,\u2019 I reassured her. \u2018Why aren\u2019t you always nice like this, Tony?\u2019 \u2018How nice?\u2019 \u2018Why, just like this; like yourself. Why do you all the time try to be like Ambrosch?\u2019 She put her arms under her head and lay back, looking up at the sky. \u2018If I live here, like you, that is different.

He and grandmother were getting old for the heavy work of a farm, and as I was now thirteen they thought I ought to be going to school. Accordingly our homestead was rented to \u2018that good woman, the Widow Steavens,\u2019 and her bachelor brother, and we bought Preacher White\u2019s house, at the north end of Black Hawk.

To-day the best that a harassed Black Hawk merchant can hope for is to sell provisions and farm machinery and automobiles to the rich farms where that first crop of stalwart Bohemian and Scandinavian girls are now the mistresses.

But sometimes a young fellow would look up from his ledger, or out through the grating of his father\u2019s bank, and let his eyes follow Lena Lingard, as she passed the window with her slow, undulating walk, or Tiny Soderball, tripping by in her short skirt and striped stockings. The country girls were considered a menace to the social order. Their beauty shone out too boldly against a conventional background. But anxious mothers need have felt no alarm.", " I went down across the fields, and Tony saw me from a long way off. She stood still by her shocks, leaning on her pitchfork, watching me as I came. We met like the people in the old song, in silence, if not in tears. Her warm hand clasped mine. \u2018I thought you\u2019d come, Jim. I heard you were at Mrs. Steavens\u2019s last night. I\u2019ve been looking for you all day.\u2019 She was thinner than I had ever seen her, and looked as Mrs. Steavens said, \u2018worked down,\u2019 but there was a new kind of strength in the gravity of her face, and her colour still gave her that look of deep-seated health and ardour. Still? Why, it flashed across me that though so much had happened in her life and in mine, she was barely twenty-four years old. Antonia stuck her fork in the ground, and instinctively we walked toward that unploughed patch at the crossing of the roads as the fittest place to talk to each other. We sat down outside the sagging wire fence that shut Mr. Shimerda\u2019s plot off from the rest of the world. The tall red grass had never been cut there. It had died down in winter and come up again in the spring until it was as thick and shrubby as some tropical garden-grass. I found myself telling her everything: why I had decided to study law and to go into the law office of one of my mother\u2019s relatives in New York City; about Gaston Cleric\u2019s death from pneumonia last winter, and the difference it had made in my life."], "Why does Jim move to his grandparents in Nebraska?": [" He wore the rings and pins and badges of different fraternal orders to which he belonged. Even his cuff-buttons were engraved with hieroglyphics, and he was more inscribed than an Egyptian obelisk. Once when he sat down to chat, he told us that in the immigrant car ahead there was a family from \u2018across the water\u2019 whose destination was the same as ours. \u2018They can\u2019t any of them speak English, except one little girl, and all she can say is \u201cWe go Black Hawk, Nebraska.\u201d She\u2019s not much older than you, twelve or thirteen, maybe, and she\u2019s as bright as a new dollar. Don\u2019t you want to go ahead and see her, Jimmy?

I do not remember crossing the Missouri River, or anything about the long day\u2019s journey through Nebraska. Probably by that time I had crossed so many rivers that I was dull to them. The only thing very noticeable about Nebraska was that it was still, all day long, Nebraska. I had been sleeping, curled up in a red plush seat, for a long while when we reached Black Hawk. Jake roused me and took me by the hand. We stumbled down from the train to a wooden siding, where men were running about with lanterns.

I travelled in the care of a mountain boy, Jake Marpole, one of the \u2018hands\u2019 on my father\u2019s old farm under the Blue Ridge, who was now going West to work for my grandfather. Jake\u2019s experience of the world was not much wider than mine. He had never been in a railway train until the morning when we set out together to try our fortunes in a new world. We went all the way in day-coaches, becoming more sticky and grimy with each stage of the journey. Jake bought everything the newsboys offered him: candy, oranges, brass collar buttons, a watch-charm, and for me a \u2018Life of Jesse James,\u2019 which I remember as one of the most satisfactory books I have ever read. Beyond Chicago we were under the protection of a friendly passenger conductor, who knew all about the country to which we were going and gave us a great deal of advice in exchange for our confidence. He seemed to us an experienced and worldly man who had been almost everywhere; in his conversation he threw out lightly the names of distant states and cities."], "What description best describes the Shimerdas?": [" \u2018I seen bunches of hair and stuff sticking to the poles and straw along the roof.

Mrs. Gardener was admittedly the best-dressed woman in Black Hawk, drove the best horse, and had a smart trap and a little white-and-gold sleigh. She seemed indifferent to her possessions, was not half so solicitous about them as her friends were. She was tall, dark, severe, with something Indian-like in the rigid immobility of her face. Her manner was cold, and she talked little. Guests felt that they were receiving, not conferring, a favour when they stayed at her house.

Jake paid his fine with a ten-dollar bill grandfather had given him for that purpose. But when the Shimerdas found that Jake sold his pig in town that day, Ambrosch worked it out in his shrewd head that Jake had to sell his pig to pay his fine. This theory afforded the Shimerdas great satisfaction, apparently. For weeks afterward, whenever Jake and I met Antonia on her way to the post-office, or going along the road with her work-team, she would clap her hands and call to us in a spiteful, crowing voice: \u2018Jake-y, Jake-y, sell the pig and pay the slap!\u2019 Otto pretended not to be surprised at Antonia\u2019s behaviour. He only lifted his brows and said, \u2018You can\u2019t tell me anything new about a Czech; I\u2019m an Austrian.\u2019 Grandfather was never a party to what Jake called our feud with the Shimerdas. Ambrosch and Antonia always greeted him respectfully, and he asked them about their affairs and gave them advice as usual. He thought the future looked hopeful for them. Ambrosch was a far-seeing fellow; he soon realized that his oxen were too heavy for any work except breaking sod, and he succeeded in selling them to a newly arrived German. With the money he bought another team of horses, which grandfather selected for him. Marek was strong, and Ambrosch worked him hard; but he could never teach him to cultivate corn, I remember."], "What university does Jim attend?": [" There stood Mrs. Cutter--locked out, for she had no key to the new lock--her head trembling with rage. \u2018I advised her to control herself, or she would have a stroke,\u2019 grandmother said afterward. Grandmother would not let her see Antonia at all, but made her sit down in the parlour while she related to her just what had occurred the night before. Antonia was frightened, and was going home to stay for a while, she told Mrs. Cutter; it would be useless to interrogate the girl, for she knew nothing of what had happened. Then Mrs. Cutter told her story. She and her husband had started home from Omaha together the morning before. They had to stop over several hours at Waymore Junction to catch the Black Hawk train. During the wait, Cutter left her at the depot and went to the Waymore bank to attend to some business. When he returned, he told her that he would have to stay overnight there, but she could go on home. He bought her ticket and put her on the train. She saw him slip a twenty-dollar bill into her handbag with her ticket. That bill, she said, should have aroused her suspicions at once--but did not. The trains are never called at little junction towns; everybody knows when they come in. Mr. Cutter showed his wife\u2019s ticket to the conductor, and settled her in her seat before the train moved off. It was not until nearly nightfall that she discovered she was on the express bound for Kansas City, that her ticket was made out to that point, and that Cutter must have planned it so.", " Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim. If you\u2019re going to be a preacher, I want you to marry me. You must promise to marry us all, and then baptize the babies.\u2019 Norwegian Anna, always dignified, looked at her reprovingly. \u2018Baptists don\u2019t believe in christening babies, do they, Jim?\u2019 I told her I didn\u2019t know what they believed, and didn\u2019t care, and that I certainly wasn\u2019t going to be a preacher. \u2018That\u2019s too bad,\u2019 Tiny simpered. She was in a teasing mood. \u2018You\u2019d make such a good one. You\u2019re so studious. Maybe you\u2019d like to be a professor. You used to teach Tony, didn\u2019t you?\u2019 Antonia broke in. \u2018I\u2019ve set my heart on Jim being a doctor. You\u2019d be good with sick people, Jim. Your grandmother\u2019s trained you up so nice. My papa always said you were an awful smart boy.\u2019 I said I was going to be whatever I pleased. \u2018Won\u2019t you be surprised, Miss Tiny, if I turn out to be a regular devil of a fellow?\u2019 They laughed until a glance from Norwegian Anna checked them; the high-school principal had just come into the front part of the shop to buy bread for supper. Anna knew the whisper was going about that I was a sly one. People said there must be something queer about a boy who showed no interest in girls of his own age, but who could be lively enough when he was with Tony and Lena or the three Marys. The enthusiasm for the dance, which the Vannis had kindled, did not at once die out.", " People say you are growing up to be a bad boy, and that ain\u2019t just to us.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t care what they say about me, but if it hurts you, that settles it. I won\u2019t go to the Firemen\u2019s Hall again.\u2019 I kept my promise, of course, but I found the spring months dull enough. I sat at home with the old people in the evenings now, reading Latin that was not in our high-school course. I had made up my mind to do a lot of college requirement work in the summer, and to enter the freshman class at the university without conditions in the fall. I wanted to get away as soon as possible. Disapprobation hurt me, I found--even that of people whom I did not admire. As the spring came on, I grew more and more lonely, and fell back on the telegrapher and the cigar-maker and his canaries for companionship. I remember I took a melancholy pleasure in hanging a May-basket for Nina Harling that spring. I bought the flowers from an old German woman who always had more window plants than anyone else, and spent an afternoon trimming a little workbasket. When dusk came on, and the new moon hung in the sky, I went quietly to the Harlings\u2019 front door with my offering, rang the bell, and then ran away as was the custom. Through the willow hedge I could hear Nina\u2019s cries of delight, and I felt comforted. On those warm, soft spring evenings I often lingered downtown to walk home with Frances, and talked to her about my plans and about the reading I was doing.", " She had spent too much of her life taking care of animals to have much sentiment about them. But Prince was a knowing little beast, and she grew fond of him. After breakfast I made him do his lessons; play dead dog, shake hands, stand up like a soldier. We used to put my cadet cap on his head--I had to take military drill at the university--and give him a yard-measure to hold with his front leg. His gravity made us laugh immoderately. Lena\u2019s talk always amused me. Antonia had never talked like the people about her. Even after she learned to speak English readily, there was always something impulsive and foreign in her speech. But Lena had picked up all the conventional expressions she heard at Mrs. Thomas\u2019s dressmaking shop. Those formal phrases, the very flower of small-town proprieties, and the flat commonplaces, nearly all hypocritical in their origin, became very funny, very engaging, when they were uttered in Lena\u2019s soft voice, with her caressing intonation and arch naivete. Nothing could be more diverting than to hear Lena, who was almost as candid as Nature, call a leg a \u2018limb\u2019 or a house a \u2018home.\u2019 We used to linger a long while over our coffee in that sunny corner. Lena was never so pretty as in the morning; she wakened fresh with the world every day, and her eyes had a deeper colour then, like the blue flowers that are never so blue as when they first open. I could sit idle all through a Sunday morning and look at her."], "What does \u00c1ntonia cover up?": [" Lena\u2019s success puzzled me. She was so easygoing; had none of the push and self-assertiveness that get people ahead in business. She had come to Lincoln, a country girl, with no introductions except to some cousins of Mrs. Thomas who lived there, and she was already making clothes for the women of \u2018the young married set.\u2019 Evidently she had great natural aptitude for her work. She knew, as she said, \u2018what people looked well in.\u2019 She never tired of poring over fashion-books. Sometimes in the evening I would find her alone in her work-room, draping folds of satin on a wire figure, with a quite blissful expression of countenance. I couldn\u2019t help thinking that the years when Lena literally hadn\u2019t enough clothes to cover herself might have something to do with her untiring interest in dressing the human figure. Her clients said that Lena \u2018had style,\u2019 and overlooked her habitual inaccuracies. She never, I discovered, finished anything by the time she had promised, and she frequently spent more money on materials than her customer had authorized. Once, when I arrived at six o\u2019clock, Lena was ushering out a fidgety mother and her awkward, overgrown daughter. The woman detained Lena at the door to say apologetically: \u2018You\u2019ll try to keep it under fifty for me, won\u2019t you, Miss Lingard? You see, she\u2019s really too young to come to an expensive dressmaker, but I knew you could do more with her than anybody else.\u2019 \u2018Oh, that will be all right, Mrs. Herron."], "What profession does Jim take up?": [" She remembered home as a place where there were always too many children, a cross man and work piling up around a sick woman. \u2018It wasn\u2019t mother\u2019s fault. She would have made us comfortable if she could. But that was no life for a girl! After I began to herd and milk, I could never get the smell of the cattle off me. The few underclothes I had I kept in a cracker-box. On Saturday nights, after everybody was in bed, then I could take a bath if I wasn\u2019t too tired. I could make two trips to the windmill to carry water, and heat it in the wash-boiler on the stove. While the water was heating, I could bring in a washtub out of the cave, and take my bath in the kitchen. Then I could put on a clean night-gown and get into bed with two others, who likely hadn\u2019t had a bath unless I\u2019d given it to them. You can\u2019t tell me anything about family life. I\u2019ve had plenty to last me.\u2019 \u2018But it\u2019s not all like that,\u2019 I objected. \u2018Near enough. It\u2019s all being under somebody\u2019s thumb. What\u2019s on your mind, Jim? Are you afraid I\u2019ll want you to marry me some day?\u2019 Then I told her I was going away. \u2018What makes you want to go away, Jim? Haven\u2019t I been nice to you?\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ve been just awfully good to me, Lena,\u2019 I blurted. \u2018I don\u2019t think about much else. I never shall think about much else while I\u2019m with you. I\u2019ll never settle down and grind if I stay here. You know that.\u2019 I dropped down beside her and sat looking at the floor.", " She hadn\u2019t liked the way he kept coming into the kitchen to instruct her, or the way he looked at her. \u2018I feel as if he is up to some of his tricks again, and is going to try to scare me, somehow.\u2019 Grandmother was apprehensive at once. \u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for you to stay there, feeling that way. I suppose it wouldn\u2019t be right for you to leave the place alone, either, after giving your word. Maybe Jim would be willing to go over there and sleep, and you could come here nights. I\u2019d feel safer, knowing you were under my own roof. I guess Jim could take care of their silver and old usury notes as well as you could.\u2019 Antonia turned to me eagerly. \u2018Oh, would you, Jim? I\u2019d make up my bed nice and fresh for you. It\u2019s a real cool room, and the bed\u2019s right next the window. I was afraid to leave the window open last night.\u2019 I liked my own room, and I didn\u2019t like the Cutters\u2019 house under any circumstances; but Tony looked so troubled that I consented to try this arrangement. I found that I slept there as well as anywhere, and when I got home in the morning, Tony had a good breakfast waiting for me. After prayers she sat down at the table with us, and it was like old times in the country. The third night I spent at the Cutters\u2019, I awoke suddenly with the impression that I had heard a door open and shut. Everything was still, however, and I must have gone to sleep again immediately. The next thing I knew, I felt someone sit down on the edge of the bed.", " Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim.

And then, I\u2019ve forgot my English so. I don\u2019t often talk it any more. I tell the children I used to speak real well.\u2019 She said they always spoke Bohemian at home. The little ones could not speak English at all--didn\u2019t learn it until they went to school. \u2018I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s you, sitting here, in my own kitchen. You wouldn\u2019t have known me, would you, Jim? You\u2019ve kept so young, yourself. But it\u2019s easier for a man. I can\u2019t see how my Anton looks any older than the day I married him.

It makes me kind of faint to wring an old goose\u2019s neck. Ain\u2019t that strange, Jim?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know. The young Queen of Italy said the same thing once, to a friend of mine.

She told me how she and her husband had come out to this new country when the farm-land was cheap and could be had on easy payments. The first ten years were a hard struggle. Her husband knew very little about farming and often grew discouraged. \u2018We\u2019d never have got through if I hadn\u2019t been so strong. I\u2019ve always had good health, thank God, and I was able to help him in the fields until right up to the time before my babies came. Our children were good about taking care of each other. Martha, the one you saw when she was a baby, was such a help to me, and she trained Anna to be just like her. My Martha\u2019s married now, and has a baby of her own. Think of that, Jim! \u2018No, I never got down-hearted. Anton\u2019s a good man, and I loved my children and always believed they would turn out well.", " In summer, when they were in bloom, he used to sit there with his friend that played the trombone.

She sighed and shook her head. \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t know!

I said I felt sure then that he was on his way back to his own country, and that even now, when I passed his grave, I always thought of him as being among the woods and fields that were so dear to him. Antonia had the most trusting, responsive eyes in the world; love and credulousness seemed to look out of them with open faces. \u2018Why didn\u2019t you ever tell me that before? It makes me feel more sure for him.\u2019 After a while she said: \u2018You know, Jim, my father was different from my mother. He did not have to marry my mother, and all his brothers quarrelled with him because he did. I used to hear the old people at home whisper about it.

They begin to tell you what\u2019s sensible and what\u2019s foolish, and want you to stick at home all the time. I prefer to be foolish when I feel like it, and be accountable to nobody.\u2019 \u2018But you\u2019ll be lonesome. You\u2019ll get tired of this sort of life, and you\u2019ll want a family.\u2019 \u2018Not me. I like to be lonesome. When I went to work for Mrs. Thomas I was nineteen years old, and I had never slept a night in my life when there weren\u2019t three in the bed. I never had a minute to myself except when I was off with the cattle.\u2019 Usually, when Lena referred to her life in the country at all, she dismissed it with a single remark, humorous or mildly cynical. But tonight her mind seemed to dwell on those early years.

The quiet was delightful, and the ticking clock was the most pleasant of companions. I got \u2018Robinson Crusoe\u2019 and tried to read, but his life on the island seemed dull compared with ours. Presently, as I looked with satisfaction about our comfortable sitting-room, it flashed upon me that if Mr. Shimerda\u2019s soul were lingering about in this world at all, it would be here, in our house, which had been more to his liking than any other in the neighbourhood. I remembered his contented face when he was with us on Christmas Day. If he could have lived with us, this terrible thing would never have happened. I knew it was homesickness that had killed Mr. Shimerda, and I wondered whether his released spirit would not eventually find its way back to his own country. I thought of how far it was to Chicago, and then to Virginia, to Baltimore--and then the great wintry ocean. No, he would not at once set out upon that long journey. Surely, his exhausted spirit, so tired of cold and crowding and the struggle with the ever-falling snow, was resting now in this quiet house. I was not frightened, but I made no noise. I did not wish to disturb him. I went softly down to the kitchen which, tucked away so snugly underground, always seemed to me the heart and centre of the house. There, on the bench behind the stove, I thought and thought about Mr. Shimerda.", " Her hands were so uncertain that she could no longer disfigure china, poor woman!

Cutter was tormented by the fear that Mrs. Cutter would live longer than he, and that eventually her \u2018people,\u2019 whom he had always hated so violently, would inherit. Their quarrels on this subject passed the boundary of the close-growing cedars, and were heard in the street by whoever wished to loiter and listen. One morning, two years ago, Cutter went into the hardware store and bought a pistol, saying he was going to shoot a dog, and adding that he \u2018thought he would take a shot at an old cat while he was about it.\u2019 (Here the children interrupted Rudolph\u2019s narrative by smothered giggles.) Cutter went out behind the hardware store, put up a target, practised for an hour or so, and then went home. At six o\u2019clock that evening, when several men were passing the Cutter house on their way home to supper, they heard a pistol shot. They paused and were looking doubtfully at one another, when another shot came crashing through an upstairs window.

When the characters all spoke at once and I missed some of the phrases they flashed at each other, I was in misery. I strained my ears and eyes to catch every exclamation. The actress who played Marguerite was even then old-fashioned, though historic. She had been a member of Daly\u2019s famous New York company, and afterward a \u2018star\u2019 under his direction. She was a woman who could not be taught, it is said, though she had a crude natural force which carried with people whose feelings were accessible and whose taste was not squeamish. She was already old, with a ravaged countenance and a physique curiously hard and stiff. She moved with difficulty--I think she was lame--I seem to remember some story about a malady of the spine. Her Armand was disproportionately young and slight, a handsome youth, perplexed in the extreme. But what did it matter? I believed devoutly in her power to fascinate him, in her dazzling loveliness. I believed her young, ardent, reckless, disillusioned, under sentence, feverish, avid of pleasure. I wanted to cross the footlights and help the slim-waisted Armand in the frilled shirt to convince her that there was still loyalty and devotion in the world. Her sudden illness, when the gaiety was at its height, her pallor, the handkerchief she crushed against her lips, the cough she smothered under the laughter while Gaston kept playing the piano lightly--it all wrung my heart.", " Overhead the sky was that indescribable blue of autumn; bright and shadowless, hard as enamel. To the south I could see the dun-shaded river bluffs that used to look so big to me, and all about stretched drying cornfields, of the pale-gold colour, I remembered so well. Russian thistles were blowing across the uplands and piling against the wire fences like barricades. Along the cattle-paths the plumes of goldenrod were already fading into sun-warmed velvet, grey with gold threads in it. I had escaped from the curious depression that hangs over little towns, and my mind was full of pleasant things; trips I meant to take with the Cuzak boys, in the Bad Lands and up on the Stinking Water. There were enough Cuzaks to play with for a long while yet. Even after the boys grew up, there would always be Cuzak himself! I meant to tramp along a few miles of lighted streets with Cuzak. As I wandered over those rough pastures, I had the good luck to stumble upon a bit of the first road that went from Black Hawk out to the north country; to my grandfather\u2019s farm, then on to the Shimerdas\u2019 and to the Norwegian settlement. Everywhere else it had been ploughed under when the highways were surveyed; this half-mile or so within the pasture fence was all that was left of that old road which used to run like a wild thing across the open prairie, clinging to the high places and circling and doubling like a rabbit before the hounds.", " After the cat had had his milk, I could think of nothing else to do, and I sat down to get warm. The quiet was delightful, and the ticking clock was the most pleasant of companions. I got \u2018Robinson Crusoe\u2019 and tried to read, but his life on the island seemed dull compared with ours. Presently, as I looked with satisfaction about our comfortable sitting-room, it flashed upon me that if Mr. Shimerda\u2019s soul were lingering about in this world at all, it would be here, in our house, which had been more to his liking than any other in the neighbourhood. I remembered his contented face when he was with us on Christmas Day. If he could have lived with us, this terrible thing would never have happened. I knew it was homesickness that had killed Mr. Shimerda, and I wondered whether his released spirit would not eventually find its way back to his own country. I thought of how far it was to Chicago, and then to Virginia, to Baltimore--and then the great wintry ocean. No, he would not at once set out upon that long journey. Surely, his exhausted spirit, so tired of cold and crowding and the struggle with the ever-falling snow, was resting now in this quiet house. I was not frightened, but I made no noise. I did not wish to disturb him. I went softly down to the kitchen which, tucked away so snugly underground, always seemed to me the heart and centre of the house. There, on the bench behind the stove, I thought and thought about Mr. Shimerda.", " He broke out now and then into German hymns, as if this occupation brought back old times to him. At four o\u2019clock Mr. Bushy, the postmaster, with another neighbour who lived east of us, stopped in to get warm. They were on their way to the Shimerdas\u2019. The news of what had happened over there had somehow got abroad through the snow-blocked country. Grandmother gave the visitors sugar-cakes and hot coffee. Before these callers were gone, the brother of the Widow Steavens, who lived on the Black Hawk road, drew up at our door, and after him came the father of the German family, our nearest neighbours on the south. They dismounted and joined us in the dining-room. They were all eager for any details about the suicide, and they were greatly concerned as to where Mr. Shimerda would be buried. The nearest Catholic cemetery was at Black Hawk, and it might be weeks before a wagon could get so far. Besides, Mr. Bushy and grandmother were sure that a man who had killed himself could not be buried in a Catholic graveyard. There was a burying-ground over by the Norwegian church, west of Squaw Creek; perhaps the Norwegians would take Mr. Shimerda in. After our visitors rode away in single file over the hill, we returned to the kitchen. Grandmother began to make the icing for a chocolate cake, and Otto again filled the house with the exciting, expectant song of the plane. One pleasant thing about this time was that everybody talked more than usual."], "Who is Jim\u2019s tutor at Lincoln?": [" I seemed to have forgotten all my reasonable explanations. Lena drew close to me, and the little hesitation in her voice that had hurt me was not there when she spoke again. \u2018I oughtn\u2019t to have begun it, ought I?\u2019 she murmured. \u2018I oughtn\u2019t to have gone to see you that first time. But I did want to. I guess I\u2019ve always been a little foolish about you. I don\u2019t know what first put it into my head, unless it was Antonia, always telling me I mustn\u2019t be up to any of my nonsense with you. I let you alone for a long while, though, didn\u2019t I?\u2019 She was a sweet creature to those she loved, that Lena Lingard! At last she sent me away with her soft, slow, renunciatory kiss. \u2018You aren\u2019t sorry I came to see you that time?\u2019 she whispered. \u2018It seemed so natural. I used to think I\u2019d like to be your first sweetheart. You were such a funny kid!\u2019 She always kissed one as if she were sadly and wisely sending one away forever. We said many good-byes before I left Lincoln, but she never tried to hinder me or hold me back. \u2018You are going, but you haven\u2019t gone yet, have you?\u2019 she used to say. My Lincoln chapter closed abruptly. I went home to my grandparents for a few weeks, and afterward visited my relatives in Virginia until I joined Cleric in Boston. I was then nineteen years old. BOOK IV. The Pioneer Woman\u2019s Story I TWO YEARS AFTER I left Lincoln, I completed my academic course at Harvard. Before I entered the Law School I went home for the summer vacation.", " Gaston Cleric had arrived in Lincoln only a few weeks earlier than I, to begin his work as head of the Latin Department. He came West at the suggestion of his physicians, his health having been enfeebled by a long illness in Italy. When I took my entrance examinations, he was my examiner, and my course was arranged under his supervision. I did not go home for my first summer vacation, but stayed in Lincoln, working off a year\u2019s Greek, which had been my only condition on entering the freshman class. Cleric\u2019s doctor advised against his going back to New England, and, except for a few weeks in Colorado, he, too, was in Lincoln all that summer. We played tennis, read, and took long walks together. I shall always look back on that time of mental awakening as one of the happiest in my life. Gaston Cleric introduced me to the world of ideas; when one first enters that world everything else fades for a time, and all that went before is as if it had not been. Yet I found curious survivals; some of the figures of my old life seemed to be waiting for me in the new. In those days there were many serious young men among the students who had come up to the university from the farms and the little towns scattered over the thinly settled state. Some of those boys came straight from the cornfields with only a summer\u2019s wages in their pockets, hung on through the four years, shabby and underfed, and completed the course by really heroic self-sacrifice.", " I hurried to the door and when I opened it saw a woman standing in the dark hall. \u2018I expect you hardly know me, Jim.\u2019 The voice seemed familiar, but I did not recognize her until she stepped into the light of my doorway and I beheld--Lena Lingard! She was so quietly conventionalized by city clothes that I might have passed her on the street without seeing her. Her black suit fitted her figure smoothly, and a black lace hat, with pale-blue forget-me-nots, sat demurely on her yellow hair. I led her toward Cleric\u2019s chair, the only comfortable one I had, questioning her confusedly. She was not disconcerted by my embarrassment. She looked about her with the naive curiosity I remembered so well. \u2018You are quite comfortable here, aren\u2019t you? I live in Lincoln now, too, Jim. I\u2019m in business for myself. I have a dressmaking shop in the Raleigh Block, out on O Street. I\u2019ve made a real good start.\u2019 \u2018But, Lena, when did you come?\u2019 \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve been here all winter. Didn\u2019t your grandmother ever write you? I\u2019ve thought about looking you up lots of times. But we\u2019ve all heard what a studious young man you\u2019ve got to be, and I felt bashful. I didn\u2019t know whether you\u2019d be glad to see me.\u2019 She laughed her mellow, easy laugh, that was either very artless or very comprehending, one never quite knew which. \u2018You seem the same, though--except you\u2019re a young man, now, of course. Do you think I\u2019ve changed?\u2019 \u2018Maybe you\u2019re prettier--though you were always pretty enough.", " Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim. If you\u2019re going to be a preacher, I want you to marry me. You must promise to marry us all, and then baptize the babies.\u2019 Norwegian Anna, always dignified, looked at her reprovingly. \u2018Baptists don\u2019t believe in christening babies, do they, Jim?\u2019 I told her I didn\u2019t know what they believed, and didn\u2019t care, and that I certainly wasn\u2019t going to be a preacher. \u2018That\u2019s too bad,\u2019 Tiny simpered. She was in a teasing mood. \u2018You\u2019d make such a good one. You\u2019re so studious. Maybe you\u2019d like to be a professor. You used to teach Tony, didn\u2019t you?\u2019 Antonia broke in. \u2018I\u2019ve set my heart on Jim being a doctor. You\u2019d be good with sick people, Jim. Your grandmother\u2019s trained you up so nice. My papa always said you were an awful smart boy.\u2019 I said I was going to be whatever I pleased. \u2018Won\u2019t you be surprised, Miss Tiny, if I turn out to be a regular devil of a fellow?\u2019 They laughed until a glance from Norwegian Anna checked them; the high-school principal had just come into the front part of the shop to buy bread for supper. Anna knew the whisper was going about that I was a sly one. People said there must be something queer about a boy who showed no interest in girls of his own age, but who could be lively enough when he was with Tony and Lena or the three Marys. The enthusiasm for the dance, which the Vannis had kindled, did not at once die out."], "Who is Larry Donovan?": [" She has great confidence in Tony. Tony\u2019s made it up with the Harlings, too. Little Nina is so fond of her that Mrs. Harling kind of overlooked things.\u2019 \u2018Is she still going with Larry Donovan?\u2019 \u2018Oh, that\u2019s on, worse than ever! I guess they\u2019re engaged. Tony talks about him like he was president of the railroad. Everybody laughs about it, because she was never a girl to be soft. She won\u2019t hear a word against him. She\u2019s so sort of innocent.\u2019 I said I didn\u2019t like Larry, and never would. Lena\u2019s face dimpled. \u2018Some of us could tell her things, but it wouldn\u2019t do any good. She\u2019d always believe him. That\u2019s Antonia\u2019s failing, you know; if she once likes people, she won\u2019t hear anything against them.\u2019 \u2018I think I\u2019d better go home and look after Antonia,\u2019 I said. \u2018I think you had.\u2019 Lena looked up at me in frank amusement. \u2018It\u2019s a good thing the Harlings are friendly with her again. Larry\u2019s afraid of them. They ship so much grain, they have influence with the railroad people. What are you studying?\u2019 She leaned her elbows on the table and drew my book toward her. I caught a faint odour of violet sachet. \u2018So that\u2019s Latin, is it? It looks hard. You do go to the theatre sometimes, though, for I\u2019ve seen you there. Don\u2019t you just love a good play, Jim? I can\u2019t stay at home in the evening if there\u2019s one in town. I\u2019d be willing to work like a slave, it seems to me, to live in a place where there are theatres.\u2019 \u2018Let\u2019s go to a show together sometime.", " I noticed, in a heavy frame, one of those depressing \u2018crayon enlargements\u2019 often seen in farm-house parlours, the subject being a round-eyed baby in short dresses. The photographer came out and gave a constrained, apologetic laugh. \u2018That\u2019s Tony Shimerda\u2019s baby. You remember her; she used to be the Harlings\u2019 Tony. Too bad! She seems proud of the baby, though; wouldn\u2019t hear to a cheap frame for the picture. I expect her brother will be in for it Saturday.\u2019 I went away feeling that I must see Antonia again. Another girl would have kept her baby out of sight, but Tony, of course, must have its picture on exhibition at the town photographer\u2019s, in a great gilt frame. How like her! I could forgive her, I told myself, if she hadn\u2019t thrown herself away on such a cheap sort of fellow. Larry Donovan was a passenger conductor, one of those train-crew aristocrats who are always afraid that someone may ask them to put up a car-window, and who, if requested to perform such a menial service, silently point to the button that calls the porter. Larry wore this air of official aloofness even on the street, where there were no car-windows to compromise his dignity. At the end of his run he stepped indifferently from the train along with the passengers, his street hat on his head and his conductor\u2019s cap in an alligator-skin bag, went directly into the station and changed his clothes. It was a matter of the utmost importance to him never to be seen in his blue trousers away from his train.", " On the night of my arrival, Mrs. Harling and Frances and Sally came over to greet me. Everything seemed just as it used to be. My grandparents looked very little older. Frances Harling was married now, and she and her husband managed the Harling interests in Black Hawk. When we gathered in grandmother\u2019s parlour, I could hardly believe that I had been away at all. One subject, however, we avoided all evening. When I was walking home with Frances, after we had left Mrs. Harling at her gate, she said simply, \u2018You know, of course, about poor Antonia.\u2019 Poor Antonia! Everyone would be saying that now, I thought bitterly. I replied that grandmother had written me how Antonia went away to marry Larry Donovan at some place where he was working; that he had deserted her, and that there was now a baby. This was all I knew. \u2018He never married her,\u2019 Frances said. \u2018I haven\u2019t seen her since she came back. She lives at home, on the farm, and almost never comes to town. She brought the baby in to show it to mama once. I\u2019m afraid she\u2019s settled down to be Ambrosch\u2019s drudge for good.\u2019 I tried to shut Antonia out of my mind. I was bitterly disappointed in her. I could not forgive her for becoming an object of pity, while Lena Lingard, for whom people had always foretold trouble, was now the leading dressmaker of Lincoln, much respected in Black Hawk. Lena gave her heart away when she felt like it, but she kept her head for her business and had got on in the world.", " There were never girls enough to go round at those dances, but everyone wanted a turn with Tony and Lena. Lena moved without exertion, rather indolently, and her hand often accented the rhythm softly on her partner\u2019s shoulder. She smiled if one spoke to her, but seldom answered. The music seemed to put her into a soft, waking dream, and her violet-coloured eyes looked sleepily and confidingly at one from under her long lashes. When she sighed she exhaled a heavy perfume of sachet powder. To dance \u2018Home, Sweet Home,\u2019 with Lena was like coming in with the tide. She danced every dance like a waltz, and it was always the same waltz--the waltz of coming home to something, of inevitable, fated return. After a while one got restless under it, as one does under the heat of a soft, sultry summer day. When you spun out into the floor with Tony, you didn\u2019t return to anything. You set out every time upon a new adventure. I liked to schottische with her; she had so much spring and variety, and was always putting in new steps and slides. She taught me to dance against and around the hard-and-fast beat of the music. If, instead of going to the end of the railroad, old Mr. Shimerda had stayed in New York and picked up a living with his fiddle, how different Antonia\u2019s life might have been! Antonia often went to the dances with Larry Donovan, a passenger conductor who was a kind of professional ladies\u2019 man, as we said."], "What word would best describe the overall tone of the novel?": [" \u2018I seen bunches of hair and stuff sticking to the poles and straw along the roof. They was blown up there by gunshot, no question.\u2019 Grandmother told grandfather she meant to go over to the Shimerdas\u2019 with him. \u2018There is nothing you can do,\u2019 he said doubtfully. \u2018The body can\u2019t be touched until we get the coroner here from Black Hawk, and that will be a matter of several days, this weather.\u2019 \u2018Well, I can take them some victuals, anyway, and say a word of comfort to them poor little girls. The oldest one was his darling, and was like a right hand to him. He might have thought of her. He\u2019s left her alone in a hard world.\u2019 She glanced distrustfully at Ambrosch, who was now eating his breakfast at the kitchen table. Fuchs, although he had been up in the cold nearly all night, was going to make the long ride to Black Hawk to fetch the priest and the coroner. On the grey gelding, our best horse, he would try to pick his way across the country with no roads to guide him. \u2018Don\u2019t you worry about me, Mrs. Burden,\u2019 he said cheerfully, as he put on a second pair of socks. \u2018I\u2019ve got a good nose for directions, and I never did need much sleep. It\u2019s the grey I\u2019m worried about. I\u2019ll save him what I can, but it\u2019ll strain him, as sure as I\u2019m telling you!\u2019 \u2018This is no time to be over-considerate of animals, Otto; do the best you can for yourself. Stop at the Widow Steavens\u2019s for dinner. She\u2019s a good woman, and she\u2019ll do well by you.\u2019 After Fuchs rode away, I was left with Ambrosch.", " His iron constitution was somewhat broken by mountain pneumonia, and he had drifted back to live in a milder country for a while. He had relatives in Bismarck, a German settlement to the north of us, but for a year now he had been working for grandfather. The minute supper was over, Otto took me into the kitchen to whisper to me about a pony down in the barn that had been bought for me at a sale; he had been riding him to find out whether he had any bad tricks, but he was a \u2018perfect gentleman,\u2019 and his name was Dude. Fuchs told me everything I wanted to know: how he had lost his ear in a Wyoming blizzard when he was a stage-driver, and how to throw a lasso. He promised to rope a steer for me before sundown next day. He got out his \u2018chaps\u2019 and silver spurs to show them to Jake and me, and his best cowboy boots, with tops stitched in bold design--roses, and true-lover\u2019s knots, and undraped female figures. These, he solemnly explained, were angels. Before we went to bed, Jake and Otto were called up to the living-room for prayers. Grandfather put on silver-rimmed spectacles and read several Psalms. His voice was so sympathetic and he read so interestingly that I wished he had chosen one of my favourite chapters in the Book of Kings. I was awed by his intonation of the word \u2018Selah.\u2019 \u2018He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom He loved. Selah.\u2019 I had no idea what the word meant; perhaps he had not.", " \u2018Law for knock my Ambrosch down!\u2019 \u2018I never like you no more, Jake and Jim Burden,\u2019 Antonia panted. \u2018No friends any more!\u2019 Jake stopped and turned his horse for a second. \u2018Well, you\u2019re a damned ungrateful lot, the whole pack of you,\u2019 he shouted back. \u2018I guess the Burdens can get along without you. You\u2019ve been a sight of trouble to them, anyhow!\u2019 We rode away, feeling so outraged that the fine morning was spoiled for us. I hadn\u2019t a word to say, and poor Jake was white as paper and trembling all over. It made him sick to get so angry. \u2018They ain\u2019t the same, Jimmy,\u2019 he kept saying in a hurt tone. \u2018These foreigners ain\u2019t the same. You can\u2019t trust \u2018em to be fair. It\u2019s dirty to kick a feller. You heard how the women turned on you--and after all we went through on account of \u2018em last winter! They ain\u2019t to be trusted. I don\u2019t want to see you get too thick with any of \u2018em.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll never be friends with them again, Jake,\u2019 I declared hotly. \u2018I believe they are all like Krajiek and Ambrosch underneath.\u2019 Grandfather heard our story with a twinkle in his eye. He advised Jake to ride to town tomorrow, go to a justice of the peace, tell him he had knocked young Shimerda down, and pay his fine. Then if Mrs. Shimerda was inclined to make trouble--her son was still under age--she would be forestalled. Jake said he might as well take the wagon and haul to market the pig he had been fattening. On Monday, about an hour after Jake had started, we saw Mrs. Shimerda and her Ambrosch proudly driving by, looking neither to the right nor left.", " \u2018Am I to understand that you have this young woman\u2019s interests at heart? That you do not wish to compromise her?\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s a word we don\u2019t use much here, Mr. Ordinsky. A girl who makes her own living can ask a college boy to supper without being talked about. We take some things for granted.\u2019 \u2018Then I have misjudged you, and I ask your pardon\u2019--he bowed gravely. \u2018Miss Lingard,\u2019 he went on, \u2018is an absolutely trustful heart. She has not learned the hard lessons of life. As for you and me, noblesse oblige\u2019--he watched me narrowly. Lena returned with the vest. \u2018Come in and let us look at you as you go out, Mr. Ordinsky. I\u2019ve never seen you in your dress suit,\u2019 she said as she opened the door for him. A few moments later he reappeared with his violin-case a heavy muffler about his neck and thick woollen gloves on his bony hands. Lena spoke encouragingly to him, and he went off with such an important professional air that we fell to laughing as soon as we had shut the door. \u2018Poor fellow,\u2019 Lena said indulgently, \u2018he takes everything so hard.\u2019 After that Ordinsky was friendly to me, and behaved as if there were some deep understanding between us. He wrote a furious article, attacking the musical taste of the town, and asked me to do him a great service by taking it to the editor of the morning paper. If the editor refused to print it, I was to tell him that he would be answerable to Ordinsky \u2018in person.\u2019 He declared that he would never retract one word, and that he was quite prepared to lose all his pupils."], "How are immigrants portrayed in the novel?": [" The top of his left ear was gone, and his skin was brown as an Indian\u2019s. Surely this was the face of a desperado. As he walked about the platform in his high-heeled boots, looking for our trunks, I saw that he was a rather slight man, quick and wiry, and light on his feet. He told us we had a long night drive ahead of us, and had better be on the hike. He led us to a hitching-bar where two farm-wagons were tied, and I saw the foreign family crowding into one of them. The other was for us. Jake got on the front seat with Otto Fuchs, and I rode on the straw in the bottom of the wagon-box, covered up with a buffalo hide. The immigrants rumbled off into the empty darkness, and we followed them. I tried to go to sleep, but the jolting made me bite my tongue, and I soon began to ache all over. When the straw settled down, I had a hard bed. Cautiously I slipped from under the buffalo hide, got up on my knees and peered over the side of the wagon. There seemed to be nothing to see; no fences, no creeks or trees, no hills or fields. If there was a road, I could not make it out in the faint starlight. There was nothing but land: not a country at all, but the material out of which countries are made. No, there was nothing but land--slightly undulating, I knew, because often our wheels ground against the brake as we went down into a hollow and lurched up again on the other side. I had the feeling that the world was left behind, that we had got over the edge of it, and were outside man\u2019s jurisdiction."], "How does Jim begin to incorporate his past into his present?": [" The big storm of the winter began on my eleventh birthday, the twentieth of January. When I went down to breakfast that morning, Jake and Otto came in white as snow-men, beating their hands and stamping their feet. They began to laugh boisterously when they saw me, calling: \u2018You\u2019ve got a birthday present this time, Jim, and no mistake. They was a full-grown blizzard ordered for you.\u2019 All day the storm went on. The snow did not fall this time, it simply spilled out of heaven, like thousands of featherbeds being emptied. That afternoon the kitchen was a carpenter-shop; the men brought in their tools and made two great wooden shovels with long handles. Neither grandmother nor I could go out in the storm, so Jake fed the chickens and brought in a pitiful contribution of eggs. Next day our men had to shovel until noon to reach the barn--and the snow was still falling! There had not been such a storm in the ten years my grandfather had lived in Nebraska. He said at dinner that we would not try to reach the cattle--they were fat enough to go without their corn for a day or two; but tomorrow we must feed them and thaw out their water-tap so that they could drink. We could not so much as see the corrals, but we knew the steers were over there, huddled together under the north bank. Our ferocious bulls, subdued enough by this time, were probably warming each other\u2019s backs. \u2018This\u2019ll take the bile out of \u2018em!\u2019 Fuchs remarked gleefully.", " You are going to let me come to see you, aren\u2019t you?\u2019 \u2018Would you like to? I\u2019d be ever so pleased. I\u2019m never busy after six o\u2019clock, and I let my sewing girls go at half-past five. I board, to save time, but sometimes I cook a chop for myself, and I\u2019d be glad to cook one for you. Well\u2019--she began to put on her white gloves--\u2018it\u2019s been awful good to see you, Jim.\u2019 \u2018You needn\u2019t hurry, need you? You\u2019ve hardly told me anything yet.\u2019 \u2018We can talk when you come to see me. I expect you don\u2019t often have lady visitors. The old woman downstairs didn\u2019t want to let me come up very much. I told her I was from your home town, and had promised your grandmother to come and see you. How surprised Mrs. Burden would be!\u2019 Lena laughed softly as she rose. When I caught up my hat, she shook her head. \u2018No, I don\u2019t want you to go with me. I\u2019m to meet some Swedes at the drugstore. You wouldn\u2019t care for them. I wanted to see your room so I could write Tony all about it, but I must tell her how I left you right here with your books. She\u2019s always so afraid someone will run off with you!\u2019 Lena slipped her silk sleeves into the jacket I held for her, smoothed it over her person, and buttoned it slowly. I walked with her to the door. \u2018Come and see me sometimes when you\u2019re lonesome. But maybe you have all the friends you want.

Everything seemed just as it used to be. My grandparents looked very little older. Frances Harling was married now, and she and her husband managed the Harling interests in Black Hawk. When we gathered in grandmother\u2019s parlour, I could hardly believe that I had been away at all. One subject, however, we avoided all evening. When I was walking home with Frances, after we had left Mrs. Harling at her gate, she said simply, \u2018You know, of course, about poor Antonia.\u2019 Poor Antonia! Everyone would be saying that now, I thought bitterly. I replied that grandmother had written me how Antonia went away to marry Larry Donovan at some place where he was working; that he had deserted her, and that there was now a baby. This was all I knew. \u2018He never married her,\u2019 Frances said. \u2018I haven\u2019t seen her since she came back. She lives at home, on the farm, and almost never comes to town. She brought the baby in to show it to mama once. I\u2019m afraid she\u2019s settled down to be Ambrosch\u2019s drudge for good.\u2019 I tried to shut Antonia out of my mind. I was bitterly disappointed in her. I could not forgive her for becoming an object of pity, while Lena Lingard, for whom people had always foretold trouble, was now the leading dressmaker of Lincoln, much respected in Black Hawk. Lena gave her heart away when she felt like it, but she kept her head for her business and had got on in the world.", " When I got home, I climbed in at the kitchen window. I was covered with blood from my nose and lip, but I was too sick to do anything about it. I found a shawl and an overcoat on the hat-rack, lay down on the parlour sofa, and in spite of my hurts, went to sleep. Grandmother found me there in the morning. Her cry of fright awakened me. Truly, I was a battered object. As she helped me to my room, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. My lip was cut and stood out like a snout. My nose looked like a big blue plum, and one eye was swollen shut and hideously discoloured. Grandmother said we must have the doctor at once, but I implored her, as I had never begged for anything before, not to send for him. I could stand anything, I told her, so long as nobody saw me or knew what had happened to me. I entreated her not to let grandfather, even, come into my room. She seemed to understand, though I was too faint and miserable to go into explanations. When she took off my night-shirt, she found such bruises on my chest and shoulders that she began to cry. She spent the whole morning bathing and poulticing me, and rubbing me with arnica. I heard Antonia sobbing outside my door, but I asked grandmother to send her away. I felt that I never wanted to see her again. I hated her almost as much as I hated Cutter. She had let me in for all this disgustingness. Grandmother kept saying how thankful we ought to be that I had been there instead of Antonia.", " It was like this: When Otto left Austria to come to America, he was asked by one of his relatives to look after a woman who was crossing on the same boat, to join her husband in Chicago. The woman started off with two children, but it was clear that her family might grow larger on the journey. Fuchs said he \u2018got on fine with the kids,\u2019 and liked the mother, though she played a sorry trick on him. In mid-ocean she proceeded to have not one baby, but three! This event made Fuchs the object of undeserved notoriety, since he was travelling with her. The steerage stewardess was indignant with him, the doctor regarded him with suspicion. The first-cabin passengers, who made up a purse for the woman, took an embarrassing interest in Otto, and often enquired of him about his charge. When the triplets were taken ashore at New York, he had, as he said, \u2018to carry some of them.\u2019 The trip to Chicago was even worse than the ocean voyage. On the train it was very difficult to get milk for the babies and to keep their bottles clean. The mother did her best, but no woman, out of her natural resources, could feed three babies. The husband, in Chicago, was working in a furniture factory for modest wages, and when he met his family at the station he was rather crushed by the size of it. He, too, seemed to consider Fuchs in some fashion to blame. \u2018I was sure glad,\u2019 Otto concluded, \u2018that he didn\u2019t take his hard feeling out on that poor woman; but he had a sullen eye for me, all right!"], "What does Jim initially title his memoir?": [" \u201cOf course,\u201d he said, \u201cI should have to do it in a direct way, and say a great deal about myself. It\u2019s through myself that I knew and felt her, and I\u2019ve had no practice in any other form of presentation.\u201d I told him that how he knew her and felt her was exactly what I most wanted to know about Antonia. He had had opportunities that I, as a little girl who watched her come and go, had not. Months afterward Jim Burden arrived at my apartment one stormy winter afternoon, with a bulging legal portfolio sheltered under his fur overcoat. He brought it into the sitting-room with him and tapped it with some pride as he stood warming his hands. \u201cI finished it last night--the thing about Antonia,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, what about yours?\u201d I had to confess that mine had not gone beyond a few straggling notes. \u201cNotes? I didn\u2019t make any.\u201d He drank his tea all at once and put down the cup. \u201cI didn\u2019t arrange or rearrange. I simply wrote down what of herself and myself and other people Antonia\u2019s name recalls to me. I suppose it hasn\u2019t any form. It hasn\u2019t any title, either.\u201d He went into the next room, sat down at my desk and wrote on the pinkish face of the portfolio the word, \u201cAntonia.\u201d He frowned at this a moment, then prefixed another word, making it \u201cMy Antonia.\u201d That seemed to satisfy him. \u201cRead it as soon as you can,\u201d he said, rising, \u201cbut don\u2019t let it influence your own story.\u201d My own story was never written, but the following narrative is Jim\u2019s manuscript, substantially as he brought it to me.", " Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim.

He took women, married or single, into his confidence; walked them up and down in the moonlight, telling them what a mistake he had made by not entering the office branch of the service, and how much better fitted he was to fill the post of General Passenger Agent in Denver than the rough-shod man who then bore that title. His unappreciated worth was the tender secret Larry shared with his sweethearts, and he was always able to make some foolish heart ache over it. As I drew near home that morning, I saw Mrs. Harling out in her yard, digging round her mountain-ash tree. It was a dry summer, and she had now no boy to help her. Charley was off in his battleship, cruising somewhere on the Caribbean sea. I turned in at the gate it was with a feeling of pleasure that I opened and shut that gate in those days; I liked the feel of it under my hand. I took the spade away from Mrs. Harling, and while I loosened the earth around the tree, she sat down on the steps and talked about the oriole family that had a nest in its branches. \u2018Mrs. Harling,\u2019 I said presently, \u2018I wish I could find out exactly how Antonia\u2019s marriage fell through.\u2019 \u2018Why don\u2019t you go out and see your grandfather\u2019s tenant, the Widow Steavens? She knows more about it than anybody else.", " There had been a warm thaw all day, with mushy yards and little streams of dark water gurgling cheerfully into the streets out of old snow-banks. My window was open, and the earthy wind blowing through made me indolent. On the edge of the prairie, where the sun had gone down, the sky was turquoise blue, like a lake, with gold light throbbing in it. Higher up, in the utter clarity of the western slope, the evening star hung like a lamp suspended by silver chains--like the lamp engraved upon the title-page of old Latin texts, which is always appearing in new heavens, and waking new desires in men. It reminded me, at any rate, to shut my window and light my wick in answer. I did so regretfully, and the dim objects in the room emerged from the shadows and took their place about me with the helpfulness which custom breeds. I propped my book open and stared listlessly at the page of the \u2018Georgics\u2019 where tomorrow\u2019s lesson began. It opened with the melancholy reflection that, in the lives of mortals the best days are the first to flee. \u2018Optima dies... prima fugit.\u2019 I turned back to the beginning of the third book, which we had read in class that morning. \u2018Primus ego in patriam mecum... deducam Musas\u2019; \u2018for I shall be the first, if I live, to bring the Muse into my country.\u2019 Cleric had explained to us that \u2018patria\u2019 here meant, not a nation or even a province, but the little rural neighbourhood on the Mincio where the poet was born."], "Who does Jim first encounter on his train ride from Virginia to Black Hawk, Nebraska?": [" He wore the rings and pins and badges of different fraternal orders to which he belonged. Even his cuff-buttons were engraved with hieroglyphics, and he was more inscribed than an Egyptian obelisk. Once when he sat down to chat, he told us that in the immigrant car ahead there was a family from \u2018across the water\u2019 whose destination was the same as ours. \u2018They can\u2019t any of them speak English, except one little girl, and all she can say is \u201cWe go Black Hawk, Nebraska.\u201d She\u2019s not much older than you, twelve or thirteen, maybe, and she\u2019s as bright as a new dollar. Don\u2019t you want to go ahead and see her, Jimmy? She\u2019s got the pretty brown eyes, too!\u2019 This last remark made me bashful, and I shook my head and settled down to \u2018Jesse James.\u2019 Jake nodded at me approvingly and said you were likely to get diseases from foreigners. I do not remember crossing the Missouri River, or anything about the long day\u2019s journey through Nebraska. Probably by that time I had crossed so many rivers that I was dull to them. The only thing very noticeable about Nebraska was that it was still, all day long, Nebraska. I had been sleeping, curled up in a red plush seat, for a long while when we reached Black Hawk. Jake roused me and took me by the hand. We stumbled down from the train to a wooden siding, where men were running about with lanterns. I couldn\u2019t see any town, or even distant lights; we were surrounded by utter darkness.", " All about us we could hear the felty beat of the raindrops on the soft dust of the farmyard. Grandmother came to the door and said it was late, and we would get wet out there. \u2018In a minute we come,\u2019 Antonia called back to her. \u2018I like your grandmother, and all things here,\u2019 she sighed. \u2018I wish my papa live to see this summer.

He and grandmother were getting old for the heavy work of a farm, and as I was now thirteen they thought I ought to be going to school. Accordingly our homestead was rented to \u2018that good woman, the Widow Steavens,\u2019 and her bachelor brother, and we bought Preacher White\u2019s house, at the north end of Black Hawk. This was the first town house one passed driving in from the farm, a landmark which told country people their long ride was over. We were to move to Black Hawk in March, and as soon as grandfather had fixed the date he let Jake and Otto know of his intention.", " The conductor told her the Black Hawk train was due at Waymore twelve minutes after the Kansas City train left. She saw at once that her husband had played this trick in order to get back to Black Hawk without her. She had no choice but to go on to Kansas City and take the first fast train for home. Cutter could have got home a day earlier than his wife by any one of a dozen simpler devices; he could have left her in the Omaha hotel, and said he was going on to Chicago for a few days. But apparently it was part of his fun to outrage her feelings as much as possible. \u2018Mr. Cutter will pay for this, Mrs. Burden. He will pay!\u2019 Mrs. Cutter avouched, nodding her horse-like head and rolling her eyes. Grandmother said she hadn\u2019t a doubt of it. Certainly Cutter liked to have his wife think him a devil. In some way he depended upon the excitement He could arouse in her hysterical nature. Perhaps he got the feeling of being a rake more from his wife\u2019s rage and amazement than from any experiences of his own. His zest in debauchery might wane, but never Mrs. Cutter\u2019s belief in it. The reckoning with his wife at the end of an escapade was something he counted on--like the last powerful liqueur after a long dinner. The one excitement he really couldn\u2019t do without was quarrelling with Mrs. Cutter! BOOK III.

I was ten years old then; I had lost both my father and mother within a year, and my Virginia relatives were sending me out to my grandparents, who lived in Nebraska. I travelled in the care of a mountain boy, Jake Marpole, one of the \u2018hands\u2019 on my father\u2019s old farm under the Blue Ridge, who was now going West to work for my grandfather. Jake\u2019s experience of the world was not much wider than mine. He had never been in a railway train until the morning when we set out together to try our fortunes in a new world. We went all the way in day-coaches, becoming more sticky and grimy with each stage of the journey. Jake bought everything the newsboys offered him: candy, oranges, brass collar buttons, a watch-charm, and for me a \u2018Life of Jesse James,\u2019 which I remember as one of the most satisfactory books I have ever read. Beyond Chicago we were under the protection of a friendly passenger conductor, who knew all about the country to which we were going and gave us a great deal of advice in exchange for our confidence. He seemed to us an experienced and worldly man who had been almost everywhere; in his conversation he threw out lightly the names of distant states and cities."], "What does Mr. Shimerda promise to give Jim when he is older?": [" Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim.

I have to promise her I help Ambrosch make the grave tomorrow.\u2019 Grandfather smoothed his beard and looked judicial. \u2018I don\u2019t know whose wish should decide the matter, if not hers.

SHIMERDA LAY DEAD in the barn four days, and on the fifth they buried him. All day Friday Jelinek was off with Ambrosch digging the grave, chopping out the frozen earth with old axes. On Saturday we breakfasted before daylight and got into the wagon with the coffin. Jake and Jelinek went ahead on horseback to cut the body loose from the pool of blood in which it was frozen fast to the ground. When grandmother and I went into the Shimerdas\u2019 house, we found the womenfolk alone; Ambrosch and Marek were at the barn. Mrs. Shimerda sat crouching by the stove, Antonia was washing dishes. When she saw me, she ran out of her dark corner and threw her arms around me. \u2018Oh, Jimmy,\u2019 she sobbed, \u2018what you tink for my lovely papa!\u2019 It seemed to me that I could feel her heart breaking as she clung to me.", " Mrs. Shimerda, sitting on the stump by the stove, kept looking over her shoulder toward the door while the neighbours were arriving. They came on horseback, all except the postmaster, who brought his family in a wagon over the only broken wagon-trail. The Widow Steavens rode up from her farm eight miles down the Black Hawk road. The cold drove the women into the cave-house, and it was soon crowded. A fine, sleety snow was beginning to fall, and everyone was afraid of another storm and anxious to have the burial over with. Grandfather and Jelinek came to tell Mrs. Shimerda that it was time to start. After bundling her mother up in clothes the neighbours had brought, Antonia put on an old cape from our house and the rabbit-skin hat her father had made for her. Four men carried Mr. Shimerda\u2019s box up the hill; Krajiek slunk along behind them. The coffin was too wide for the door, so it was put down on the slope outside. I slipped out from the cave and looked at Mr. Shimerda. He was lying on his side, with his knees drawn up. His body was draped in a black shawl, and his head was bandaged in white muslin, like a mummy\u2019s; one of his long, shapely hands lay out on the black cloth; that was all one could see of him. Mrs. Shimerda came out and placed an open prayer-book against the body, making the sign of the cross on the bandaged head with her fingers. Ambrosch knelt down and made the same gesture, and after him Antonia and Marek.", " After the cat had had his milk, I could think of nothing else to do, and I sat down to get warm. The quiet was delightful, and the ticking clock was the most pleasant of companions. I got \u2018Robinson Crusoe\u2019 and tried to read, but his life on the island seemed dull compared with ours. Presently, as I looked with satisfaction about our comfortable sitting-room, it flashed upon me that if Mr. Shimerda\u2019s soul were lingering about in this world at all, it would be here, in our house, which had been more to his liking than any other in the neighbourhood. I remembered his contented face when he was with us on Christmas Day. If he could have lived with us, this terrible thing would never have happened. I knew it was homesickness that had killed Mr. Shimerda, and I wondered whether his released spirit would not eventually find its way back to his own country. I thought of how far it was to Chicago, and then to Virginia, to Baltimore--and then the great wintry ocean. No, he would not at once set out upon that long journey. Surely, his exhausted spirit, so tired of cold and crowding and the struggle with the ever-falling snow, was resting now in this quiet house. I was not frightened, but I made no noise. I did not wish to disturb him. I went softly down to the kitchen which, tucked away so snugly underground, always seemed to me the heart and centre of the house. There, on the bench behind the stove, I thought and thought about Mr. Shimerda."], "What does the novel\u2019s epigraph, from Virgil\u2019s Georgics, translate to?": [" This was not a boast, but a hope, at once bold and devoutly humble, that he might bring the Muse (but lately come to Italy from her cloudy Grecian mountains), not to the capital, the palatia Romana, but to his own little I country\u2019; to his father\u2019s fields, \u2018sloping down to the river and to the old beech trees with broken tops.\u2019 Cleric said he thought Virgil, when he was dying at Brindisi, must have remembered that passage. After he had faced the bitter fact that he was to leave the \u2018Aeneid\u2019 unfinished, and had decreed that the great canvas, crowded with figures of gods and men, should be burned rather than survive him unperfected, then his mind must have gone back to the perfect utterance of the \u2018Georgics,\u2019 where the pen was fitted to the matter as the plough is to the furrow; and he must have said to himself, with the thankfulness of a good man, \u2018I was the first to bring the Muse into my country.\u2019 We left the classroom quietly, conscious that we had been brushed by the wing of a great feeling, though perhaps I alone knew Cleric intimately enough to guess what that feeling was. In the evening, as I sat staring at my book, the fervour of his voice stirred through the quantities on the page before me. I was wondering whether that particular rocky strip of New England coast about which he had so often told me was Cleric\u2019s patria. Before I had got far with my reading, I was disturbed by a knock.", " There had been a warm thaw all day, with mushy yards and little streams of dark water gurgling cheerfully into the streets out of old snow-banks.

On the edge of the prairie, where the sun had gone down, the sky was turquoise blue, like a lake, with gold light throbbing in it. Higher up, in the utter clarity of the western slope, the evening star hung like a lamp suspended by silver chains--like the lamp engraved upon the title-page of old Latin texts, which is always appearing in new heavens, and waking new desires in men. It reminded me, at any rate, to shut my window and light my wick in answer. I did so regretfully, and the dim objects in the room emerged from the shadows and took their place about me with the helpfulness which custom breeds. I propped my book open and stared listlessly at the page of the \u2018Georgics\u2019 where tomorrow\u2019s lesson began. It opened with the melancholy reflection that, in the lives of mortals the best days are the first to flee. \u2018Optima dies... prima fugit.\u2019 I turned back to the beginning of the third book, which we had read in class that morning. \u2018Primus ego in patriam mecum... deducam Musas\u2019; \u2018for I shall be the first, if I live, to bring the Muse into my country.\u2019 Cleric had explained to us that \u2018patria\u2019 here meant, not a nation or even a province, but the little rural neighbourhood on the Mincio where the poet was born.", " I stood watching their white dresses glimmer smaller and smaller down the sidewalk as they went away. I have had no other success that pulled at my heartstrings like that one. XIV THE DAY AFTER COMMENCEMENT I moved my books and desk upstairs, to an empty room where I should be undisturbed, and I fell to studying in earnest. I worked off a year\u2019s trigonometry that summer, and began Virgil alone. Morning after morning I used to pace up and down my sunny little room, looking off at the distant river bluffs and the roll of the blond pastures between, scanning the \u2018Aeneid\u2019 aloud and committing long passages to memory. Sometimes in the evening Mrs. Harling called to me as I passed her gate, and asked me to come in and let her play for me. She was lonely for Charley, she said, and liked to have a boy about. Whenever my grandparents had misgivings, and began to wonder whether I was not too young to go off to college alone, Mrs. Harling took up my cause vigorously. Grandfather had such respect for her judgment that I knew he would not go against her. I had only one holiday that summer. It was in July. I met Antonia downtown on Saturday afternoon, and learned that she and Tiny and Lena were going to the river next day with Anna Hansen--the elder was all in bloom now, and Anna wanted to make elderblow wine. \u2018Anna\u2019s to drive us down in the Marshalls\u2019 delivery wagon, and we\u2019ll take a nice lunch and have a picnic.", " In a moment I watched her fade down the dusky stairway. When I turned back to my room the place seemed much pleasanter than before. Lena had left something warm and friendly in the lamplight. How I loved to hear her laugh again! It was so soft and unexcited and appreciative gave a favourable interpretation to everything. When I closed my eyes I could hear them all laughing--the Danish laundry girls and the three Bohemian Marys. Lena had brought them all back to me. It came over me, as it had never done before, the relation between girls like those and the poetry of Virgil. If there were no girls like them in the world, there would be no poetry. I understood that clearly, for the first time. This revelation seemed to me inestimably precious. I clung to it as if it might suddenly vanish. As I sat down to my book at last, my old dream about Lena coming across the harvest-field in her short skirt seemed to me like the memory of an actual experience. It floated before me on the page like a picture, and underneath it stood the mournful line: \u2018Optima dies... prima fugit.\u2019 III IN LINCOLN THE BEST part of the theatrical season came late, when the good companies stopped off there for one-night stands, after their long runs in New York and Chicago. That spring Lena went with me to see Joseph Jefferson in \u2018Rip Van Winkle,\u2019 and to a war play called \u2018Shenandoah.\u2019 She was inflexible about paying for her own seat; said she was in business now, and she wouldn\u2019t have a schoolboy spending his money on her."], "How does the frame narrative temper the intense nostalgia of the novel?": [" I noticed, in a heavy frame, one of those depressing \u2018crayon enlargements\u2019 often seen in farm-house parlours, the subject being a round-eyed baby in short dresses. The photographer came out and gave a constrained, apologetic laugh. \u2018That\u2019s Tony Shimerda\u2019s baby. You remember her; she used to be the Harlings\u2019 Tony. Too bad! She seems proud of the baby, though; wouldn\u2019t hear to a cheap frame for the picture. I expect her brother will be in for it Saturday.\u2019 I went away feeling that I must see Antonia again. Another girl would have kept her baby out of sight, but Tony, of course, must have its picture on exhibition at the town photographer\u2019s, in a great gilt frame. How like her! I could forgive her, I told myself, if she hadn\u2019t thrown herself away on such a cheap sort of fellow. Larry Donovan was a passenger conductor, one of those train-crew aristocrats who are always afraid that someone may ask them to put up a car-window, and who, if requested to perform such a menial service, silently point to the button that calls the porter. Larry wore this air of official aloofness even on the street, where there were no car-windows to compromise his dignity. At the end of his run he stepped indifferently from the train along with the passengers, his street hat on his head and his conductor\u2019s cap in an alligator-skin bag, went directly into the station and changed his clothes. It was a matter of the utmost importance to him never to be seen in his blue trousers away from his train.", " Fuchs had been a cowboy, a stage-driver, a bartender, a miner; had wandered all over that great Western country and done hard work everywhere, though, as grandmother said, he had nothing to show for it. Jake was duller than Otto. He could scarcely read, wrote even his name with difficulty, and he had a violent temper which sometimes made him behave like a crazy man--tore him all to pieces and actually made him ill. But he was so soft-hearted that anyone could impose upon him. If he, as he said, \u2018forgot himself\u2019 and swore before grandmother, he went about depressed and shamefaced all day. They were both of them jovial about the cold in winter and the heat in summer, always ready to work overtime and to meet emergencies. It was a matter of pride with them not to spare themselves. Yet they were the sort of men who never get on, somehow, or do anything but work hard for a dollar or two a day. On those bitter, starlit nights, as we sat around the old stove that fed us and warmed us and kept us cheerful, we could hear the coyotes howling down by the corrals, and their hungry, wintry cry used to remind the boys of wonderful animal stories; about grey wolves and bears in the Rockies, wildcats and panthers in the Virginia mountains. Sometimes Fuchs could be persuaded to talk about the outlaws and desperate characters he had known. I remember one funny story about himself that made grandmother, who was working her bread on the bread-board, laugh until she wiped her eyes with her bare arm, her hands being floury.", " \u201cOf course,\u201d he said, \u201cI should have to do it in a direct way, and say a great deal about myself. It\u2019s through myself that I knew and felt her, and I\u2019ve had no practice in any other form of presentation.\u201d I told him that how he knew her and felt her was exactly what I most wanted to know about Antonia. He had had opportunities that I, as a little girl who watched her come and go, had not. Months afterward Jim Burden arrived at my apartment one stormy winter afternoon, with a bulging legal portfolio sheltered under his fur overcoat. He brought it into the sitting-room with him and tapped it with some pride as he stood warming his hands. \u201cI finished it last night--the thing about Antonia,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, what about yours?\u201d I had to confess that mine had not gone beyond a few straggling notes. \u201cNotes? I didn\u2019t make any.\u201d He drank his tea all at once and put down the cup. \u201cI didn\u2019t arrange or rearrange. I simply wrote down what of herself and myself and other people Antonia\u2019s name recalls to me. I suppose it hasn\u2019t any form. It hasn\u2019t any title, either.\u201d He went into the next room, sat down at my desk and wrote on the pinkish face of the portfolio the word, \u201cAntonia.\u201d He frowned at this a moment, then prefixed another word, making it \u201cMy Antonia.\u201d That seemed to satisfy him. \u201cRead it as soon as you can,\u201d he said, rising, \u201cbut don\u2019t let it influence your own story.\u201d My own story was never written, but the following narrative is Jim\u2019s manuscript, substantially as he brought it to me.", " Her hands were so uncertain that she could no longer disfigure china, poor woman! As the couple grew older, they quarrelled more and more often about the ultimate disposition of their \u2018property.\u2019 A new law was passed in the state, securing the surviving wife a third of her husband\u2019s estate under all conditions. Cutter was tormented by the fear that Mrs. Cutter would live longer than he, and that eventually her \u2018people,\u2019 whom he had always hated so violently, would inherit. Their quarrels on this subject passed the boundary of the close-growing cedars, and were heard in the street by whoever wished to loiter and listen. One morning, two years ago, Cutter went into the hardware store and bought a pistol, saying he was going to shoot a dog, and adding that he \u2018thought he would take a shot at an old cat while he was about it.\u2019 (Here the children interrupted Rudolph\u2019s narrative by smothered giggles.) Cutter went out behind the hardware store, put up a target, practised for an hour or so, and then went home. At six o\u2019clock that evening, when several men were passing the Cutter house on their way home to supper, they heard a pistol shot. They paused and were looking doubtfully at one another, when another shot came crashing through an upstairs window. They ran into the house and found Wick Cutter lying on a sofa in his upstairs bedroom, with his throat torn open, bleeding on a roll of sheets he had placed beside his head."], "What incident drove Pavel and Peter to leave Russia for America?": [" When the shrieking behind them died away, Pavel realized that he was alone upon the familiar road. \u2018They still come?\u2019 he asked Peter. \u2018Yes.\u2019 \u2018How many?\u2019 \u2018Twenty, thirty--enough.\u2019 Now his middle horse was being almost dragged by the other two. Pavel gave Peter the reins and stepped carefully into the back of the sledge. He called to the groom that they must lighten--and pointed to the bride. The young man cursed him and held her tighter. Pavel tried to drag her away. In the struggle, the groom rose. Pavel knocked him over the side of the sledge and threw the girl after him. He said he never remembered exactly how he did it, or what happened afterward. Peter, crouching in the front seat, saw nothing. The first thing either of them noticed was a new sound that broke into the clear air, louder than they had ever heard it before--the bell of the monastery of their own village, ringing for early prayers. Pavel and Peter drove into the village alone, and they had been alone ever since. They were run out of their village. Pavel\u2019s own mother would not look at him. They went away to strange towns, but when people learned where they came from, they were always asked if they knew the two men who had fed the bride to the wolves. Wherever they went, the story followed them. It took them five years to save money enough to come to America. They worked in Chicago, Des Moines, Fort Wayne, but they were always unfortunate.", " Gradually, relief came to all of us. Whatever it was, the worst was over. Mr. Shimerda signed to us that Pavel was asleep. Without a word Peter got up and lit his lantern. He was going out to get his team to drive us home. Mr. Shimerda went with him. We sat and watched the long bowed back under the blue sheet, scarcely daring to breathe. On the way home, when we were lying in the straw, under the jolting and rattling Antonia told me as much of the story as she could. What she did not tell me then, she told later; we talked of nothing else for days afterward. When Pavel and Peter were young men, living at home in Russia, they were asked to be groomsmen for a friend who was to marry the belle of another village. It was in the dead of winter and the groom\u2019s party went over to the wedding in sledges. Peter and Pavel drove in the groom\u2019s sledge, and six sledges followed with all his relatives and friends. After the ceremony at the church, the party went to a dinner given by the parents of the bride. The dinner lasted all afternoon; then it became a supper and continued far into the night. There was much dancing and drinking. At midnight the parents of the bride said good-bye to her and blessed her. The groom took her up in his arms and carried her out to his sledge and tucked her under the blankets. He sprang in beside her, and Pavel and Peter (our Pavel and Peter!) took the front seat.", " When Pavel\u2019s health grew so bad, they decided to try farming. Pavel died a few days after he unburdened his mind to Mr. Shimerda, and was buried in the Norwegian graveyard. Peter sold off everything, and left the country--went to be cook in a railway construction camp where gangs of Russians were employed. At his sale we bought Peter\u2019s wheelbarrow and some of his harness. During the auction he went about with his head down, and never lifted his eyes. He seemed not to care about anything. The Black Hawk money-lender who held mortgages on Peter\u2019s livestock was there, and he bought in the sale notes at about fifty cents on the dollar. Everyone said Peter kissed the cow before she was led away by her new owner. I did not see him do it, but this I know: after all his furniture and his cookstove and pots and pans had been hauled off by the purchasers, when his house was stripped and bare, he sat down on the floor with his clasp-knife and ate all the melons that he had put away for winter. When Mr. Shimerda and Krajiek drove up in their wagon to take Peter to the train, they found him with a dripping beard, surrounded by heaps of melon rinds. The loss of his two friends had a depressing effect upon old Mr. Shimerda. When he was out hunting, he used to go into the empty log house and sit there, brooding. This cabin was his hermitage until the winter snows penned him in his cave. For Antonia and me, the story of the wedding party was never at an end.", " The little bride hid her face on the groom\u2019s shoulder and sobbed. Pavel sat still and watched his horses. The road was clear and white, and the groom\u2019s three blacks went like the wind. It was only necessary to be calm and to guide them carefully. At length, as they breasted a long hill, Peter rose cautiously and looked back. \u2018There are only three sledges left,\u2019 he whispered. \u2018And the wolves?\u2019 Pavel asked. \u2018Enough! Enough for all of us.\u2019 Pavel reached the brow of the hill, but only two sledges followed him down the other side. In that moment on the hilltop, they saw behind them a whirling black group on the snow. Presently the groom screamed. He saw his father\u2019s sledge overturned, with his mother and sisters. He sprang up as if he meant to jump, but the girl shrieked and held him back. It was even then too late. The black ground-shadows were already crowding over the heap in the road, and one horse ran out across the fields, his harness hanging to him, wolves at his heels. But the groom\u2019s movement had given Pavel an idea. They were within a few miles of their village now. The only sledge left out of six was not very far behind them, and Pavel\u2019s middle horse was failing. Beside a frozen pond something happened to the other sledge; Peter saw it plainly. Three big wolves got abreast of the horses, and the horses went crazy. They tried to jump over each other, got tangled up in the harness, and overturned the sledge."], "What convention does Cather challenge with the friendship between Jim and \u00c1ntonia?": [" During that burning day when we were crossing Iowa, our talk kept returning to a central figure, a Bohemian girl whom we had known long ago and whom both of us admired. More than any other person we remembered, this girl seemed to mean to us the country, the conditions, the whole adventure of our childhood. To speak her name was to call up pictures of people and places, to set a quiet drama going in one\u2019s brain. I had lost sight of her altogether, but Jim had found her again after long years, had renewed a friendship that meant a great deal to him, and out of his busy life had set apart time enough to enjoy that friendship. His mind was full of her that day. He made me see her again, feel her presence, revived all my old affection for her. \u201cI can\u2019t see,\u201d he said impetuously, \u201cwhy you have never written anything about Antonia.\u201d I told him I had always felt that other people--he himself, for one knew her much better than I. I was ready, however, to make an agreement with him; I would set down on paper all that I remembered of Antonia if he would do the same. We might, in this way, get a picture of her. He rumpled his hair with a quick, excited gesture, which with him often announces a new determination, and I could see that my suggestion took hold of him. \u201cMaybe I will, maybe I will!\u201d he declared. He stared out of the window for a few moments, and when he turned to me again his eyes had the sudden clearness that comes from something the mind itself sees.", " *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MY ANTONIA *** Produced by Judith Boss, and Martin Robb MY ANTONIA By Willa Cather CONTENTS Introduction BOOK I.

Cuzak\u2019s Boys TO CARRIE AND IRENE MINER In memory of affections old and true Optima dies... prima fugit VIRGIL INTRODUCTION LAST summer I happened to be crossing the plains of Iowa in a season of intense heat, and it was my good fortune to have for a traveling companion James Quayle Burden--Jim Burden, as we still call him in the West. He and I are old friends--we grew up together in the same Nebraska town--and we had much to say to each other. While the train flashed through never-ending miles of ripe wheat, by country towns and bright-flowered pastures and oak groves wilting in the sun, we sat in the observation car, where the woodwork was hot to the touch and red dust lay deep over everything. The dust and heat, the burning wind, reminded us of many things. We were talking about what it is like to spend one\u2019s childhood in little towns like these, buried in wheat and corn, under stimulating extremes of climate: burning summers when the world lies green and billowy beneath a brilliant sky, when one is fairly stifled in vegetation, in the color and smell of strong weeds and heavy harvests; blustery winters with little snow, when the whole country is stripped bare and gray as sheet-iron.", " Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim. If you\u2019re going to be a preacher, I want you to marry me. You must promise to marry us all, and then baptize the babies.\u2019 Norwegian Anna, always dignified, looked at her reprovingly. \u2018Baptists don\u2019t believe in christening babies, do they, Jim?\u2019 I told her I didn\u2019t know what they believed, and didn\u2019t care, and that I certainly wasn\u2019t going to be a preacher. \u2018That\u2019s too bad,\u2019 Tiny simpered. She was in a teasing mood. \u2018You\u2019d make such a good one. You\u2019re so studious. Maybe you\u2019d like to be a professor. You used to teach Tony, didn\u2019t you?\u2019 Antonia broke in. \u2018I\u2019ve set my heart on Jim being a doctor. You\u2019d be good with sick people, Jim. Your grandmother\u2019s trained you up so nice. My papa always said you were an awful smart boy.\u2019 I said I was going to be whatever I pleased. \u2018Won\u2019t you be surprised, Miss Tiny, if I turn out to be a regular devil of a fellow?\u2019 They laughed until a glance from Norwegian Anna checked them; the high-school principal had just come into the front part of the shop to buy bread for supper. Anna knew the whisper was going about that I was a sly one. People said there must be something queer about a boy who showed no interest in girls of his own age, but who could be lively enough when he was with Tony and Lena or the three Marys. The enthusiasm for the dance, which the Vannis had kindled, did not at once die out.", " She hadn\u2019t liked the way he kept coming into the kitchen to instruct her, or the way he looked at her. \u2018I feel as if he is up to some of his tricks again, and is going to try to scare me, somehow.\u2019 Grandmother was apprehensive at once. \u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for you to stay there, feeling that way. I suppose it wouldn\u2019t be right for you to leave the place alone, either, after giving your word. Maybe Jim would be willing to go over there and sleep, and you could come here nights. I\u2019d feel safer, knowing you were under my own roof. I guess Jim could take care of their silver and old usury notes as well as you could.\u2019 Antonia turned to me eagerly. \u2018Oh, would you, Jim? I\u2019d make up my bed nice and fresh for you. It\u2019s a real cool room, and the bed\u2019s right next the window. I was afraid to leave the window open last night.\u2019 I liked my own room, and I didn\u2019t like the Cutters\u2019 house under any circumstances; but Tony looked so troubled that I consented to try this arrangement. I found that I slept there as well as anywhere, and when I got home in the morning, Tony had a good breakfast waiting for me. After prayers she sat down at the table with us, and it was like old times in the country. The third night I spent at the Cutters\u2019, I awoke suddenly with the impression that I had heard a door open and shut. Everything was still, however, and I must have gone to sleep again immediately. The next thing I knew, I felt someone sit down on the edge of the bed."], "What animal attacks Jim and \u00c1ntonia on their walk home from Peter\u2019s?": [" Gradually, relief came to all of us.

They were as thick and curly as carded wool. His rosy face, with its snub nose, set in this fleece, was like a melon among its leaves. He was usually called \u2018Curly Peter,\u2019 or \u2018Rooshian Peter.\u2019 The two Russians made good farm-hands, and in summer they worked out together. I had heard our neighbours laughing when they told how Peter always had to go home at night to milk his cow. Other bachelor homesteaders used canned milk, to save trouble. Sometimes Peter came to church at the sod schoolhouse. It was there I first saw him, sitting on a low bench by the door, his plush cap in his hands, his bare feet tucked apologetically under the seat. After Mr. Shimerda discovered the Russians, he went to see them almost every evening, and sometimes took Antonia with him. She said they came from a part of Russia where the language was not very different from Bohemian, and if I wanted to go to their place, she could talk to them for me. One afternoon, before the heavy frosts began, we rode up there together on my pony. The Russians had a neat log house built on a grassy slope, with a windlass well beside the door. As we rode up the draw, we skirted a big melon patch, and a garden where squashes and yellow cucumbers lay about on the sod. We found Peter out behind his kitchen, bending over a washtub.", " When Pavel\u2019s health grew so bad, they decided to try farming.

Peter put the melons in a row on the oilcloth-covered table and stood over them, brandishing a butcher knife. Before the blade got fairly into them, they split of their own ripeness, with a delicious sound. He gave us knives, but no plates, and the top of the table was soon swimming with juice and seeds. I had never seen anyone eat so many melons as Peter ate. He assured us that they were good for one--better than medicine; in his country people lived on them at this time of year. He was very hospitable and jolly. Once, while he was looking at Antonia, he sighed and told us that if he had stayed at home in Russia perhaps by this time he would have had a pretty daughter of his own to cook and keep house for him. He said he had left his country because of a \u2018great trouble.\u2019 When we got up to go, Peter looked about in perplexity for something that would entertain us. He ran into the storeroom and brought out a gaudily painted harmonica, sat down on a bench, and spreading his fat legs apart began to play like a whole band. The tunes were either very lively or very doleful, and he sang words to some of them. Before we left, Peter put ripe cucumbers into a sack for Mrs. Shimerda and gave us a lard-pail full of milk to cook them in. I had never heard of cooking cucumbers, but Antonia assured me they were very good."], "When speaking to \u00c1ntonia, what does Jim refer to Virginia as?": [" She was a buxom girl with dark hair and eyes, calm and self-possessed. \u2018Won\u2019t you come in? Mother will be here in a minute.\u2019 Before I could sit down in the chair she offered me, the miracle happened; one of those quiet moments that clutch the heart, and take more courage than the noisy, excited passages in life. Antonia came in and stood before me; a stalwart, brown woman, flat-chested, her curly brown hair a little grizzled. It was a shock, of course. It always is, to meet people after long years, especially if they have lived as much and as hard as this woman had. We stood looking at each other. The eyes that peered anxiously at me were--simply Antonia\u2019s eyes. I had seen no others like them since I looked into them last, though I had looked at so many thousands of human faces. As I confronted her, the changes grew less apparent to me, her identity stronger. She was there, in the full vigour of her personality, battered but not diminished, looking at me, speaking to me in the husky, breathy voice I remembered so well. \u2018My husband\u2019s not at home, sir. Can I do anything?\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t you remember me, Antonia? Have I changed so much?\u2019 She frowned into the slanting sunlight that made her brown hair look redder than it was. Suddenly her eyes widened, her whole face seemed to grow broader. She caught her breath and put out two hard-worked hands. \u2018Why, it\u2019s Jim! Anna, Yulka, it\u2019s Jim Burden!\u2019 She had no sooner caught my hands than she looked alarmed.", " I can hear him now, speaking the lines of the poet Statius, who spoke for Dante: \u2018I was famous on earth with the name which endures longest and honours most. The seeds of my ardour were the sparks from that divine flame whereby more than a thousand have kindled; I speak of the \u201cAeneid,\u201d mother to me and nurse to me in poetry.\u2019 Although I admired scholarship so much in Cleric, I was not deceived about myself; I knew that I should never be a scholar. I could never lose myself for long among impersonal things. Mental excitement was apt to send me with a rush back to my own naked land and the figures scattered upon it. While I was in the very act of yearning toward the new forms that Cleric brought up before me, my mind plunged away from me, and I suddenly found myself thinking of the places and people of my own infinitesimal past. They stood out strengthened and simplified now, like the image of the plough against the sun. They were all I had for an answer to the new appeal. I begrudged the room that Jake and Otto and Russian Peter took up in my memory, which I wanted to crowd with other things. But whenever my consciousness was quickened, all those early friends were quickened within it, and in some strange way they accompanied me through all my new experiences. They were so much alive in me that I scarcely stopped to wonder whether they were alive anywhere else, or how. II ONE MARCH EVENING in my sophomore year I was sitting alone in my room after supper.", " Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim. If you\u2019re going to be a preacher, I want you to marry me. You must promise to marry us all, and then baptize the babies.\u2019 Norwegian Anna, always dignified, looked at her reprovingly. \u2018Baptists don\u2019t believe in christening babies, do they, Jim?\u2019 I told her I didn\u2019t know what they believed, and didn\u2019t care, and that I certainly wasn\u2019t going to be a preacher. \u2018That\u2019s too bad,\u2019 Tiny simpered. She was in a teasing mood. \u2018You\u2019d make such a good one. You\u2019re so studious. Maybe you\u2019d like to be a professor. You used to teach Tony, didn\u2019t you?\u2019 Antonia broke in. \u2018I\u2019ve set my heart on Jim being a doctor. You\u2019d be good with sick people, Jim. Your grandmother\u2019s trained you up so nice. My papa always said you were an awful smart boy.\u2019 I said I was going to be whatever I pleased. \u2018Won\u2019t you be surprised, Miss Tiny, if I turn out to be a regular devil of a fellow?\u2019 They laughed until a glance from Norwegian Anna checked them; the high-school principal had just come into the front part of the shop to buy bread for supper. Anna knew the whisper was going about that I was a sly one. People said there must be something queer about a boy who showed no interest in girls of his own age, but who could be lively enough when he was with Tony and Lena or the three Marys. The enthusiasm for the dance, which the Vannis had kindled, did not at once die out.", " She hadn\u2019t liked the way he kept coming into the kitchen to instruct her, or the way he looked at her. \u2018I feel as if he is up to some of his tricks again, and is going to try to scare me, somehow.\u2019 Grandmother was apprehensive at once. \u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for you to stay there, feeling that way. I suppose it wouldn\u2019t be right for you to leave the place alone, either, after giving your word. Maybe Jim would be willing to go over there and sleep, and you could come here nights. I\u2019d feel safer, knowing you were under my own roof. I guess Jim could take care of their silver and old usury notes as well as you could.\u2019 Antonia turned to me eagerly. \u2018Oh, would you, Jim? I\u2019d make up my bed nice and fresh for you. It\u2019s a real cool room, and the bed\u2019s right next the window. I was afraid to leave the window open last night.\u2019 I liked my own room, and I didn\u2019t like the Cutters\u2019 house under any circumstances; but Tony looked so troubled that I consented to try this arrangement. I found that I slept there as well as anywhere, and when I got home in the morning, Tony had a good breakfast waiting for me. After prayers she sat down at the table with us, and it was like old times in the country. The third night I spent at the Cutters\u2019, I awoke suddenly with the impression that I had heard a door open and shut. Everything was still, however, and I must have gone to sleep again immediately. The next thing I knew, I felt someone sit down on the edge of the bed."], "While reading from the Book of Matthew, how does the story of Jesus seem to Jim?": [" *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MY ANTONIA *** Produced by Judith Boss, and Martin Robb MY ANTONIA By Willa Cather CONTENTS Introduction BOOK I.

Cuzak\u2019s Boys TO CARRIE AND IRENE MINER In memory of affections old and true Optima dies... prima fugit VIRGIL INTRODUCTION LAST summer I happened to be crossing the plains of Iowa in a season of intense heat, and it was my good fortune to have for a traveling companion James Quayle Burden--Jim Burden, as we still call him in the West. He and I are old friends--we grew up together in the same Nebraska town--and we had much to say to each other. While the train flashed through never-ending miles of ripe wheat, by country towns and bright-flowered pastures and oak groves wilting in the sun, we sat in the observation car, where the woodwork was hot to the touch and red dust lay deep over everything. The dust and heat, the burning wind, reminded us of many things. We were talking about what it is like to spend one\u2019s childhood in little towns like these, buried in wheat and corn, under stimulating extremes of climate: burning summers when the world lies green and billowy beneath a brilliant sky, when one is fairly stifled in vegetation, in the color and smell of strong weeds and heavy harvests; blustery winters with little snow, when the whole country is stripped bare and gray as sheet-iron.", " \u2018Hello, Tony. Don\u2019t you know me?\u2019 she asked in a smooth, low voice, looking in at us archly. Antonia gasped and stepped back. \u2018Why, it\u2019s Lena! Of course I didn\u2019t know you, so dressed up!\u2019 Lena Lingard laughed, as if this pleased her. I had not recognized her for a moment, either. I had never seen her before with a hat on her head--or with shoes and stockings on her feet, for that matter. And here she was, brushed and smoothed and dressed like a town girl, smiling at us with perfect composure. \u2018Hello, Jim,\u2019 she said carelessly as she walked into the kitchen and looked about her. \u2018I\u2019ve come to town to work, too, Tony.\u2019 \u2018Have you, now? Well, ain\u2019t that funny!\u2019 Antonia stood ill at ease, and didn\u2019t seem to know just what to do with her visitor. The door was open into the dining-room, where Mrs. Harling sat crocheting and Frances was reading. Frances asked Lena to come in and join them. \u2018You are Lena Lingard, aren\u2019t you? I\u2019ve been to see your mother, but you were off herding cattle that day. Mama, this is Chris Lingard\u2019s oldest girl.\u2019 Mrs. Harling dropped her worsted and examined the visitor with quick, keen eyes. Lena was not at all disconcerted. She sat down in the chair Frances pointed out, carefully arranging her pocket-book and grey cotton gloves on her lap. We followed with our popcorn, but Antonia hung back--said she had to get her cake into the oven. \u2018So you have come to town,\u2019 said Mrs. Harling, her eyes still fixed on Lena.", " On this occasion she asked me very craftily when grandfather expected to begin planting corn. I told her, adding that he thought we should have a dry spring and that the corn would not be held back by too much rain, as it had been last year. She gave me a shrewd glance. \u2018He not Jesus,\u2019 she blustered; \u2018he not know about the wet and the dry. I did not answer her; what was the use? As I sat waiting for the hour when Ambrosch and Antonia would return from the fields, I watched Mrs. Shimerda at her work. She took from the oven a coffee-cake which she wanted to keep warm for supper, and wrapped it in a quilt stuffed with feathers. I have seen her put even a roast goose in this quilt to keep it hot. When the neighbours were there building the new house, they saw her do this, and the story got abroad that the Shimerdas kept their food in their featherbeds. When the sun was dropping low, Antonia came up the big south draw with her team. How much older she had grown in eight months! She had come to us a child, and now she was a tall, strong young girl, although her fifteenth birthday had just slipped by. I ran out and met her as she brought her horses up to the windmill to water them. She wore the boots her father had so thoughtfully taken off before he shot himself, and his old fur cap. Her outgrown cotton dress switched about her calves, over the boot-tops. She kept her sleeves rolled up all day, and her arms and throat were burned as brown as a sailor\u2019s.", " \u201cOf course,\u201d he said, \u201cI should have to do it in a direct way, and say a great deal about myself. It\u2019s through myself that I knew and felt her, and I\u2019ve had no practice in any other form of presentation.\u201d I told him that how he knew her and felt her was exactly what I most wanted to know about Antonia. He had had opportunities that I, as a little girl who watched her come and go, had not. Months afterward Jim Burden arrived at my apartment one stormy winter afternoon, with a bulging legal portfolio sheltered under his fur overcoat. He brought it into the sitting-room with him and tapped it with some pride as he stood warming his hands. \u201cI finished it last night--the thing about Antonia,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, what about yours?\u201d I had to confess that mine had not gone beyond a few straggling notes. \u201cNotes? I didn\u2019t make any.\u201d He drank his tea all at once and put down the cup. \u201cI didn\u2019t arrange or rearrange. I simply wrote down what of herself and myself and other people Antonia\u2019s name recalls to me. I suppose it hasn\u2019t any form. It hasn\u2019t any title, either.\u201d He went into the next room, sat down at my desk and wrote on the pinkish face of the portfolio the word, \u201cAntonia.\u201d He frowned at this a moment, then prefixed another word, making it \u201cMy Antonia.\u201d That seemed to satisfy him. \u201cRead it as soon as you can,\u201d he said, rising, \u201cbut don\u2019t let it influence your own story.\u201d My own story was never written, but the following narrative is Jim\u2019s manuscript, substantially as he brought it to me."], "What news does Jim wake up to after the second blizzard?": [" The big storm of the winter began on my eleventh birthday, the twentieth of January. When I went down to breakfast that morning, Jake and Otto came in white as snow-men, beating their hands and stamping their feet. They began to laugh boisterously when they saw me, calling: \u2018You\u2019ve got a birthday present this time, Jim, and no mistake. They was a full-grown blizzard ordered for you.\u2019 All day the storm went on. The snow did not fall this time, it simply spilled out of heaven, like thousands of featherbeds being emptied. That afternoon the kitchen was a carpenter-shop; the men brought in their tools and made two great wooden shovels with long handles. Neither grandmother nor I could go out in the storm, so Jake fed the chickens and brought in a pitiful contribution of eggs. Next day our men had to shovel until noon to reach the barn--and the snow was still falling! There had not been such a storm in the ten years my grandfather had lived in Nebraska. He said at dinner that we would not try to reach the cattle--they were fat enough to go without their corn for a day or two; but tomorrow we must feed them and thaw out their water-tap so that they could drink. We could not so much as see the corrals, but we knew the steers were over there, huddled together under the north bank. Our ferocious bulls, subdued enough by this time, were probably warming each other\u2019s backs. \u2018This\u2019ll take the bile out of \u2018em!\u2019 Fuchs remarked gleefully.", " I had never before looked up at the sky when there was not a familiar mountain ridge against it. But this was the complete dome of heaven, all there was of it. I did not believe that my dead father and mother were watching me from up there; they would still be looking for me at the sheep-fold down by the creek, or along the white road that led to the mountain pastures. I had left even their spirits behind me. The wagon jolted on, carrying me I knew not whither. I don\u2019t think I was homesick. If we never arrived anywhere, it did not matter. Between that earth and that sky I felt erased, blotted out. I did not say my prayers that night: here, I felt, what would be would be. II I DO NOT REMEMBER our arrival at my grandfather\u2019s farm sometime before daybreak, after a drive of nearly twenty miles with heavy work-horses. When I awoke, it was afternoon. I was lying in a little room, scarcely larger than the bed that held me, and the window-shade at my head was flapping softly in a warm wind. A tall woman, with wrinkled brown skin and black hair, stood looking down at me; I knew that she must be my grandmother. She had been crying, I could see, but when I opened my eyes she smiled, peered at me anxiously, and sat down on the foot of my bed. \u2018Had a good sleep, Jimmy?\u2019 she asked briskly. Then in a very different tone she said, as if to herself, \u2018My, how you do look like your father!\u2019 I remembered that my father had been her little boy; she must often have come to wake him like this when he overslept.", " His iron constitution was somewhat broken by mountain pneumonia, and he had drifted back to live in a milder country for a while. He had relatives in Bismarck, a German settlement to the north of us, but for a year now he had been working for grandfather. The minute supper was over, Otto took me into the kitchen to whisper to me about a pony down in the barn that had been bought for me at a sale; he had been riding him to find out whether he had any bad tricks, but he was a \u2018perfect gentleman,\u2019 and his name was Dude. Fuchs told me everything I wanted to know: how he had lost his ear in a Wyoming blizzard when he was a stage-driver, and how to throw a lasso. He promised to rope a steer for me before sundown next day. He got out his \u2018chaps\u2019 and silver spurs to show them to Jake and me, and his best cowboy boots, with tops stitched in bold design--roses, and true-lover\u2019s knots, and undraped female figures. These, he solemnly explained, were angels. Before we went to bed, Jake and Otto were called up to the living-room for prayers. Grandfather put on silver-rimmed spectacles and read several Psalms. His voice was so sympathetic and he read so interestingly that I wished he had chosen one of my favourite chapters in the Book of Kings. I was awed by his intonation of the word \u2018Selah.\u2019 \u2018He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom He loved. Selah.\u2019 I had no idea what the word meant; perhaps he had not.", " Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim. If you\u2019re going to be a preacher, I want you to marry me. You must promise to marry us all, and then baptize the babies.\u2019 Norwegian Anna, always dignified, looked at her reprovingly. \u2018Baptists don\u2019t believe in christening babies, do they, Jim?\u2019 I told her I didn\u2019t know what they believed, and didn\u2019t care, and that I certainly wasn\u2019t going to be a preacher. \u2018That\u2019s too bad,\u2019 Tiny simpered. She was in a teasing mood. \u2018You\u2019d make such a good one. You\u2019re so studious. Maybe you\u2019d like to be a professor. You used to teach Tony, didn\u2019t you?\u2019 Antonia broke in. \u2018I\u2019ve set my heart on Jim being a doctor. You\u2019d be good with sick people, Jim.

The enthusiasm for the dance, which the Vannis had kindled, did not at once die out."], "What does Jim identify as the cause of Mr. Shimerda\u2019s death?": [" \u2018Oh, I\u2019m not worrying, Mrs. Burden! I can bring something out of that girl. She\u2019s barely seventeen, not too old to learn new ways. She\u2019s good-looking, too!\u2019 she added warmly. Frances turned to grandmother. \u2018Oh, yes, Mrs. Burden, you didn\u2019t tell us that! She was working in the garden when we got there, barefoot and ragged. But she has such fine brown legs and arms, and splendid colour in her cheeks--like those big dark red plums.\u2019 We were pleased at this praise. Grandmother spoke feelingly. \u2018When she first came to this country, Frances, and had that genteel old man to watch over her, she was as pretty a girl as ever I saw. But, dear me, what a life she\u2019s led, out in the fields with those rough threshers! Things would have been very different with poor Antonia if her father had lived.\u2019 The Harlings begged us to tell them about Mr. Shimerda\u2019s death and the big snowstorm. By the time we saw grandfather coming home from church, we had told them pretty much all we knew of the Shimerdas. \u2018The girl will be happy here, and she\u2019ll forget those things,\u2019 said Mrs. Harling confidently, as we rose to take our leave. III ON SATURDAY AMBROSCH drove up to the back gate, and Antonia jumped down from the wagon and ran into our kitchen just as she used to do. She was wearing shoes and stockings, and was breathless and excited. She gave me a playful shake by the shoulders. \u2018You ain\u2019t forget about me, Jim?\u2019 Grandmother kissed her.", " I went down across the fields, and Tony saw me from a long way off. She stood still by her shocks, leaning on her pitchfork, watching me as I came. We met like the people in the old song, in silence, if not in tears. Her warm hand clasped mine. \u2018I thought you\u2019d come, Jim. I heard you were at Mrs. Steavens\u2019s last night. I\u2019ve been looking for you all day.\u2019 She was thinner than I had ever seen her, and looked as Mrs. Steavens said, \u2018worked down,\u2019 but there was a new kind of strength in the gravity of her face, and her colour still gave her that look of deep-seated health and ardour. Still? Why, it flashed across me that though so much had happened in her life and in mine, she was barely twenty-four years old. Antonia stuck her fork in the ground, and instinctively we walked toward that unploughed patch at the crossing of the roads as the fittest place to talk to each other. We sat down outside the sagging wire fence that shut Mr. Shimerda\u2019s plot off from the rest of the world. The tall red grass had never been cut there. It had died down in winter and come up again in the spring until it was as thick and shrubby as some tropical garden-grass. I found myself telling her everything: why I had decided to study law and to go into the law office of one of my mother\u2019s relatives in New York City; about Gaston Cleric\u2019s death from pneumonia last winter, and the difference it had made in my life.", " Mrs. Shimerda, sitting on the stump by the stove, kept looking over her shoulder toward the door while the neighbours were arriving. They came on horseback, all except the postmaster, who brought his family in a wagon over the only broken wagon-trail. The Widow Steavens rode up from her farm eight miles down the Black Hawk road. The cold drove the women into the cave-house, and it was soon crowded. A fine, sleety snow was beginning to fall, and everyone was afraid of another storm and anxious to have the burial over with. Grandfather and Jelinek came to tell Mrs. Shimerda that it was time to start. After bundling her mother up in clothes the neighbours had brought, Antonia put on an old cape from our house and the rabbit-skin hat her father had made for her. Four men carried Mr. Shimerda\u2019s box up the hill; Krajiek slunk along behind them. The coffin was too wide for the door, so it was put down on the slope outside. I slipped out from the cave and looked at Mr. Shimerda. He was lying on his side, with his knees drawn up. His body was draped in a black shawl, and his head was bandaged in white muslin, like a mummy\u2019s; one of his long, shapely hands lay out on the black cloth; that was all one could see of him. Mrs. Shimerda came out and placed an open prayer-book against the body, making the sign of the cross on the bandaged head with her fingers. Ambrosch knelt down and made the same gesture, and after him Antonia and Marek.", " I said I would go with her until we could see Squaw Creek, and then turn and run home. We drifted along lazily, very happy, through the magical light of the late afternoon. All those fall afternoons were the same, but I never got used to them. As far as we could see, the miles of copper-red grass were drenched in sunlight that was stronger and fiercer than at any other time of the day. The blond cornfields were red gold, the haystacks turned rosy and threw long shadows. The whole prairie was like the bush that burned with fire and was not consumed. That hour always had the exultation of victory, of triumphant ending, like a hero\u2019s death--heroes who died young and gloriously. It was a sudden transfiguration, a lifting-up of day. How many an afternoon Antonia and I have trailed along the prairie under that magnificence! And always two long black shadows flitted before us or followed after, dark spots on the ruddy grass. We had been silent a long time, and the edge of the sun sank nearer and nearer the prairie floor, when we saw a figure moving on the edge of the upland, a gun over his shoulder. He was walking slowly, dragging his feet along as if he had no purpose. We broke into a run to overtake him. \u2018My papa sick all the time,\u2019 Tony panted as we flew. \u2018He not look good, Jim.\u2019 As we neared Mr. Shimerda she shouted, and he lifted his head and peered about. Tony ran up to him, caught his hand and pressed it against her cheek."], "Why will none of the graveyards accept Mr. Shimerda?": [" Mrs. Shimerda, sitting on the stump by the stove, kept looking over her shoulder toward the door while the neighbours were arriving. They came on horseback, all except the postmaster, who brought his family in a wagon over the only broken wagon-trail. The Widow Steavens rode up from her farm eight miles down the Black Hawk road.

Ambrosch knelt down and made the same gesture, and after him Antonia and Marek.", " After the cat had had his milk, I could think of nothing else to do, and I sat down to get warm. The quiet was delightful, and the ticking clock was the most pleasant of companions. I got \u2018Robinson Crusoe\u2019 and tried to read, but his life on the island seemed dull compared with ours. Presently, as I looked with satisfaction about our comfortable sitting-room, it flashed upon me that if Mr. Shimerda\u2019s soul were lingering about in this world at all, it would be here, in our house, which had been more to his liking than any other in the neighbourhood. I remembered his contented face when he was with us on Christmas Day. If he could have lived with us, this terrible thing would never have happened. I knew it was homesickness that had killed Mr. Shimerda, and I wondered whether his released spirit would not eventually find its way back to his own country. I thought of how far it was to Chicago, and then to Virginia, to Baltimore--and then the great wintry ocean. No, he would not at once set out upon that long journey. Surely, his exhausted spirit, so tired of cold and crowding and the struggle with the ever-falling snow, was resting now in this quiet house. I was not frightened, but I made no noise. I did not wish to disturb him. I went softly down to the kitchen which, tucked away so snugly underground, always seemed to me the heart and centre of the house. There, on the bench behind the stove, I thought and thought about Mr. Shimerda.", " His eyes followed Peter about the room with a contemptuous, unfriendly expression. It seemed to me that he despised him for being so simple and docile. Presently Pavel began to talk to Mr. Shimerda, scarcely above a whisper. He was telling a long story, and as he went on, Antonia took my hand under the table and held it tight. She leaned forward and strained her ears to hear him. He grew more and more excited, and kept pointing all around his bed, as if there were things there and he wanted Mr. Shimerda to see them. \u2018It\u2019s wolves, Jimmy,\u2019 Antonia whispered. \u2018It\u2019s awful, what he says!\u2019 The sick man raged and shook his fist. He seemed to be cursing people who had wronged him. Mr. Shimerda caught him by the shoulders, but could hardly hold him in bed. At last he was shut off by a coughing fit which fairly choked him. He pulled a cloth from under his pillow and held it to his mouth. Quickly it was covered with bright red spots--I thought I had never seen any blood so bright. When he lay down and turned his face to the wall, all the rage had gone out of him. He lay patiently fighting for breath, like a child with croup. Antonia\u2019s father uncovered one of his long bony legs and rubbed it rhythmically. From our bench we could see what a hollow case his body was. His spine and shoulder-blades stood out like the bones under the hide of a dead steer left in the fields. That sharp backbone must have hurt him when he lay on it.", " When Frances came home at noon, she played until dinner was ready. When Sally got back from school, she sat down in her hat and coat and drummed the plantation melodies that Negro minstrel troupes brought to town. Even Nina played the Swedish Wedding March. Mrs. Harling had studied the piano under a good teacher, and somehow she managed to practise every day. I soon learned that if I were sent over on an errand and found Mrs. Harling at the piano, I must sit down and wait quietly until she turned to me. I can see her at this moment: her short, square person planted firmly on the stool, her little fat hands moving quickly and neatly over the keys, her eyes fixed on the music with intelligent concentration. IV \u2018I won\u2019t have none of your weevily wheat, and I won\u2019t have none of your barley, But I\u2019ll take a measure of fine white flour, to make a cake for Charley.\u2019 WE WERE SINGING rhymes to tease Antonia while she was beating up one of Charley\u2019s favourite cakes in her big mixing-bowl. It was a crisp autumn evening, just cold enough to make one glad to quit playing tag in the yard, and retreat into the kitchen. We had begun to roll popcorn balls with syrup when we heard a knock at the back door, and Tony dropped her spoon and went to open it. A plump, fair-skinned girl was standing in the doorway. She looked demure and pretty, and made a graceful picture in her blue cashmere dress and little blue hat, with a plaid shawl drawn neatly about her shoulders and a clumsy pocket-book in her hand."], "Where does Ambrosch believe his father has been sent after his death?": [" He don\u2019t like this kawntree.\u2019 \u2018People who don\u2019t like this country ought to stay at home,\u2019 I said severely. \u2018We don\u2019t make them come here.\u2019 \u2018He not want to come, never!\u2019 she burst out. \u2018My mamenka make him come. All the time she say: \u201cAmerica big country; much money, much land for my boys, much husband for my girls.\u201d My papa, he cry for leave his old friends what make music with him. He love very much the man what play the long horn like this\u2019--she indicated a slide trombone. \u201cThey go to school together and are friends from boys. But my mama, she want Ambrosch for be rich, with many cattle.\u201d\u2019 \u2018Your mama,\u2019 I said angrily, \u2018wants other people\u2019s things.\u2019 \u201cYour grandfather is rich,\u201d she retorted fiercely. \u2018Why he not help my papa? Ambrosch be rich, too, after while, and he pay back. He is very smart boy. For Ambrosch my mama come here.\u2019 Ambrosch was considered the important person in the family. Mrs. Shimerda and Antonia always deferred to him, though he was often surly with them and contemptuous toward his father. Ambrosch and his mother had everything their own way. Though Antonia loved her father more than she did anyone else, she stood in awe of her elder brother. After I watched Antonia and her mother go over the hill on their miserable horse, carrying our iron pot with them, I turned to grandmother, who had taken up her darning, and said I hoped that snooping old woman wouldn\u2019t come to see us any more.", " On Sundays she helped her mother make garden or sewed all day. Grandfather was pleased with Antonia. When we complained of her, he only smiled and said, \u2018She will help some fellow get ahead in the world.\u2019 Nowadays Tony could talk of nothing but the prices of things, or how much she could lift and endure. She was too proud of her strength. I knew, too, that Ambrosch put upon her some chores a girl ought not to do, and that the farm-hands around the country joked in a nasty way about it. Whenever I saw her come up the furrow, shouting to her beasts, sunburned, sweaty, her dress open at the neck, and her throat and chest dust-plastered, I used to think of the tone in which poor Mr. Shimerda, who could say so little, yet managed to say so much when he exclaimed, \u2018My Antonia!\u2019 XVIII AFTER I BEGAN TO go to the country school, I saw less of the Bohemians. We were sixteen pupils at the sod schoolhouse, and we all came on horseback and brought our dinner. My schoolmates were none of them very interesting, but I somehow felt that, by making comrades of them, I was getting even with Antonia for her indifference. Since the father\u2019s death, Ambrosch was more than ever the head of the house, and he seemed to direct the feelings as well as the fortunes of his womenfolk. Antonia often quoted his opinions to me, and she let me see that she admired him, while she thought of me only as a little boy.", " At dinner grandfather talked to Jelinek more than he usually did to strangers. \u2018Will they be much disappointed because we cannot get a priest?\u2019 he asked. Jelinek looked serious. \u2018Yes, sir, that is very bad for them. Their father has done a great sin\u2019--he looked straight at grandfather. \u2018Our Lord has said that.\u2019 Grandfather seemed to like his frankness. \u2018We believe that, too, Jelinek. But we believe that Mr. Shimerda\u2019s soul will come to its Creator as well off without a priest. We believe that Christ is our only intercessor.\u2019 The young man shook his head. \u2018I know how you think. My teacher at the school has explain. But I have seen too much. I believe in prayer for the dead. I have seen too much.\u2019 We asked him what he meant. He glanced around the table. \u2018You want I shall tell you? When I was a little boy like this one, I begin to help the priest at the altar. I make my first communion very young; what the Church teach seem plain to me. By \u2018n\u2019 by war-times come, when the Prussians fight us. We have very many soldiers in camp near my village, and the cholera break out in that camp, and the men die like flies. All day long our priest go about there to give the Sacrament to dying men, and I go with him to carry the vessels with the Holy Sacrament. Everybody that go near that camp catch the sickness but me and the priest. But we have no sickness, we have no fear, because we carry that blood and that body of Christ, and it preserve us.\u2019 He paused, looking at grandfather.", " Now I must go, or my girls will be doing all the work, and I want to cook your supper myself.\u2019 As we went toward the house, we met Ambrosch and Anton, starting off with their milking-pails to hunt the cows. I joined them, and Leo accompanied us at some distance, running ahead and starting up at us out of clumps of ironweed, calling, \u2018I\u2019m a jack rabbit,\u2019 or, \u2018I\u2019m a big bull-snake.\u2019 I walked between the two older boys--straight, well-made fellows, with good heads and clear eyes. They talked about their school and the new teacher, told me about the crops and the harvest, and how many steers they would feed that winter. They were easy and confidential with me, as if I were an old friend of the family--and not too old. I felt like a boy in their company, and all manner of forgotten interests revived in me. It seemed, after all, so natural to be walking along a barbed-wire fence beside the sunset, toward a red pond, and to see my shadow moving along at my right, over the close-cropped grass. \u2018Has mother shown you the pictures you sent her from the old country?\u2019 Ambrosch asked. \u2018We\u2019ve had them framed and they\u2019re hung up in the parlour. She was so glad to get them. I don\u2019t believe I ever saw her so pleased about anything.\u2019 There was a note of simple gratitude in his voice that made me wish I had given more occasion for it. I put my hand on his shoulder. \u2018Your mother, you know, was very much loved by all of us."], "What role does \u00c1ntonia take in relation to Jim\u2019s leisured thinker?": [" In a moment I watched her fade down the dusky stairway. When I turned back to my room the place seemed much pleasanter than before. Lena had left something warm and friendly in the lamplight. How I loved to hear her laugh again! It was so soft and unexcited and appreciative gave a favourable interpretation to everything. When I closed my eyes I could hear them all laughing--the Danish laundry girls and the three Bohemian Marys. Lena had brought them all back to me. It came over me, as it had never done before, the relation between girls like those and the poetry of Virgil. If there were no girls like them in the world, there would be no poetry. I understood that clearly, for the first time. This revelation seemed to me inestimably precious. I clung to it as if it might suddenly vanish. As I sat down to my book at last, my old dream about Lena coming across the harvest-field in her short skirt seemed to me like the memory of an actual experience. It floated before me on the page like a picture, and underneath it stood the mournful line: \u2018Optima dies... prima fugit.\u2019 III IN LINCOLN THE BEST part of the theatrical season came late, when the good companies stopped off there for one-night stands, after their long runs in New York and Chicago. That spring Lena went with me to see Joseph Jefferson in \u2018Rip Van Winkle,\u2019 and to a war play called \u2018Shenandoah.\u2019 She was inflexible about paying for her own seat; said she was in business now, and she wouldn\u2019t have a schoolboy spending his money on her.", " She remembered home as a place where there were always too many children, a cross man and work piling up around a sick woman. \u2018It wasn\u2019t mother\u2019s fault. She would have made us comfortable if she could. But that was no life for a girl! After I began to herd and milk, I could never get the smell of the cattle off me. The few underclothes I had I kept in a cracker-box. On Saturday nights, after everybody was in bed, then I could take a bath if I wasn\u2019t too tired. I could make two trips to the windmill to carry water, and heat it in the wash-boiler on the stove. While the water was heating, I could bring in a washtub out of the cave, and take my bath in the kitchen. Then I could put on a clean night-gown and get into bed with two others, who likely hadn\u2019t had a bath unless I\u2019d given it to them. You can\u2019t tell me anything about family life. I\u2019ve had plenty to last me.\u2019 \u2018But it\u2019s not all like that,\u2019 I objected. \u2018Near enough. It\u2019s all being under somebody\u2019s thumb. What\u2019s on your mind, Jim? Are you afraid I\u2019ll want you to marry me some day?\u2019 Then I told her I was going away. \u2018What makes you want to go away, Jim? Haven\u2019t I been nice to you?\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ve been just awfully good to me, Lena,\u2019 I blurted. \u2018I don\u2019t think about much else. I never shall think about much else while I\u2019m with you. I\u2019ll never settle down and grind if I stay here. You know that.\u2019 I dropped down beside her and sat looking at the floor.", " She hadn\u2019t liked the way he kept coming into the kitchen to instruct her, or the way he looked at her. \u2018I feel as if he is up to some of his tricks again, and is going to try to scare me, somehow.\u2019 Grandmother was apprehensive at once. \u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for you to stay there, feeling that way. I suppose it wouldn\u2019t be right for you to leave the place alone, either, after giving your word. Maybe Jim would be willing to go over there and sleep, and you could come here nights. I\u2019d feel safer, knowing you were under my own roof. I guess Jim could take care of their silver and old usury notes as well as you could.\u2019 Antonia turned to me eagerly. \u2018Oh, would you, Jim? I\u2019d make up my bed nice and fresh for you. It\u2019s a real cool room, and the bed\u2019s right next the window. I was afraid to leave the window open last night.\u2019 I liked my own room, and I didn\u2019t like the Cutters\u2019 house under any circumstances; but Tony looked so troubled that I consented to try this arrangement. I found that I slept there as well as anywhere, and when I got home in the morning, Tony had a good breakfast waiting for me. After prayers she sat down at the table with us, and it was like old times in the country. The third night I spent at the Cutters\u2019, I awoke suddenly with the impression that I had heard a door open and shut. Everything was still, however, and I must have gone to sleep again immediately. The next thing I knew, I felt someone sit down on the edge of the bed.", " Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim. If you\u2019re going to be a preacher, I want you to marry me. You must promise to marry us all, and then baptize the babies.\u2019 Norwegian Anna, always dignified, looked at her reprovingly. \u2018Baptists don\u2019t believe in christening babies, do they, Jim?\u2019 I told her I didn\u2019t know what they believed, and didn\u2019t care, and that I certainly wasn\u2019t going to be a preacher. \u2018That\u2019s too bad,\u2019 Tiny simpered. She was in a teasing mood. \u2018You\u2019d make such a good one. You\u2019re so studious. Maybe you\u2019d like to be a professor. You used to teach Tony, didn\u2019t you?\u2019 Antonia broke in. \u2018I\u2019ve set my heart on Jim being a doctor. You\u2019d be good with sick people, Jim. Your grandmother\u2019s trained you up so nice. My papa always said you were an awful smart boy.\u2019 I said I was going to be whatever I pleased. \u2018Won\u2019t you be surprised, Miss Tiny, if I turn out to be a regular devil of a fellow?\u2019 They laughed until a glance from Norwegian Anna checked them; the high-school principal had just come into the front part of the shop to buy bread for supper. Anna knew the whisper was going about that I was a sly one. People said there must be something queer about a boy who showed no interest in girls of his own age, but who could be lively enough when he was with Tony and Lena or the three Marys. The enthusiasm for the dance, which the Vannis had kindled, did not at once die out."], "Whom does Mrs. Burden convince the Harlings to hire?": [" The farmers liked her and were kind to her; said they would rather have her for a hand than Ambrosch. When fall came she was to husk corn for the neighbours until Christmas, as she had done the year before; but grandmother saved her from this by getting her a place to work with our neighbours, the Harlings. II GRANDMOTHER OFTEN SAID THAT if she had to live in town, she thanked God she lived next the Harlings. They had been farming people, like ourselves, and their place was like a little farm, with a big barn and a garden, and an orchard and grazing lots--even a windmill. The Harlings were Norwegians, and Mrs. Harling had lived in Christiania until she was ten years old. Her husband was born in Minnesota. He was a grain merchant and cattle-buyer, and was generally considered the most enterprising business man in our county. He controlled a line of grain elevators in the little towns along the railroad to the west of us, and was away from home a great deal. In his absence his wife was the head of the household. Mrs. Harling was short and square and sturdy-looking, like her house. Every inch of her was charged with an energy that made itself felt the moment she entered a room. Her face was rosy and solid, with bright, twinkling eyes and a stubborn little chin. She was quick to anger, quick to laughter, and jolly from the depths of her soul. How well I remember her laugh; it had in it the same sudden recognition that flashed into her eyes, was a burst of humour, short and intelligent.", " \u2018Oh, I\u2019m not worrying, Mrs. Burden! I can bring something out of that girl. She\u2019s barely seventeen, not too old to learn new ways. She\u2019s good-looking, too!\u2019 she added warmly. Frances turned to grandmother. \u2018Oh, yes, Mrs. Burden, you didn\u2019t tell us that! She was working in the garden when we got there, barefoot and ragged. But she has such fine brown legs and arms, and splendid colour in her cheeks--like those big dark red plums.\u2019 We were pleased at this praise. Grandmother spoke feelingly. \u2018When she first came to this country, Frances, and had that genteel old man to watch over her, she was as pretty a girl as ever I saw. But, dear me, what a life she\u2019s led, out in the fields with those rough threshers! Things would have been very different with poor Antonia if her father had lived.\u2019 The Harlings begged us to tell them about Mr. Shimerda\u2019s death and the big snowstorm. By the time we saw grandfather coming home from church, we had told them pretty much all we knew of the Shimerdas. \u2018The girl will be happy here, and she\u2019ll forget those things,\u2019 said Mrs. Harling confidently, as we rose to take our leave. III ON SATURDAY AMBROSCH drove up to the back gate, and Antonia jumped down from the wagon and ran into our kitchen just as she used to do. She was wearing shoes and stockings, and was breathless and excited. She gave me a playful shake by the shoulders. \u2018You ain\u2019t forget about me, Jim?\u2019 Grandmother kissed her.", " She went to country funerals and weddings in all weathers. A farmer\u2019s daughter who was to be married could count on a wedding present from Frances Harling. In August the Harlings\u2019 Danish cook had to leave them. Grandmother entreated them to try Antonia. She cornered Ambrosch the next time he came to town, and pointed out to him that any connection with Christian Harling would strengthen his credit and be of advantage to him. One Sunday Mrs. Harling took the long ride out to the Shimerdas\u2019 with Frances. She said she wanted to see \u2018what the girl came from\u2019 and to have a clear understanding with her mother. I was in our yard when they came driving home, just before sunset. They laughed and waved to me as they passed, and I could see they were in great good humour. After supper, when grandfather set off to church, grandmother and I took my short cut through the willow hedge and went over to hear about the visit to the Shimerdas\u2019. We found Mrs. Harling with Charley and Sally on the front porch, resting after her hard drive. Julia was in the hammock--she was fond of repose--and Frances was at the piano, playing without a light and talking to her mother through the open window. Mrs. Harling laughed when she saw us coming. \u2018I expect you left your dishes on the table tonight, Mrs. Burden,\u2019 she called. Frances shut the piano and came out to join us. They had liked Antonia from their first glimpse of her; felt they knew exactly what kind of girl she was.", " As for Mrs. Shimerda, they found her very amusing. Mrs. Harling chuckled whenever she spoke of her. \u2018I expect I am more at home with that sort of bird than you are, Mrs. Burden. They\u2019re a pair, Ambrosch and that old woman!\u2019 They had had a long argument with Ambrosch about Antonia\u2019s allowance for clothes and pocket-money. It was his plan that every cent of his sister\u2019s wages should be paid over to him each month, and he would provide her with such clothing as he thought necessary. When Mrs. Harling told him firmly that she would keep fifty dollars a year for Antonia\u2019s own use, he declared they wanted to take his sister to town and dress her up and make a fool of her. Mrs. Harling gave us a lively account of Ambrosch\u2019s behaviour throughout the interview; how he kept jumping up and putting on his cap as if he were through with the whole business, and how his mother tweaked his coat-tail and prompted him in Bohemian. Mrs. Harling finally agreed to pay three dollars a week for Antonia\u2019s services--good wages in those days--and to keep her in shoes. There had been hot dispute about the shoes, Mrs. Shimerda finally saying persuasively that she would send Mrs. Harling three fat geese every year to \u2018make even.\u2019 Ambrosch was to bring his sister to town next Saturday. \u2018She\u2019ll be awkward and rough at first, like enough,\u2019 grandmother said anxiously, \u2018but unless she\u2019s been spoiled by the hard life she\u2019s led, she has it in her to be a real helpful girl.\u2019 Mrs. Harling laughed her quick, decided laugh."], "What is the title of Book II?": [" *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MY ANTONIA *** Produced by Judith Boss, and Martin Robb MY ANTONIA By Willa Cather CONTENTS Introduction BOOK I.

He and I are old friends--we grew up together in the same Nebraska town--and we had much to say to each other. While the train flashed through never-ending miles of ripe wheat, by country towns and bright-flowered pastures and oak groves wilting in the sun, we sat in the observation car, where the woodwork was hot to the touch and red dust lay deep over everything. The dust and heat, the burning wind, reminded us of many things. We were talking about what it is like to spend one\u2019s childhood in little towns like these, buried in wheat and corn, under stimulating extremes of climate: burning summers when the world lies green and billowy beneath a brilliant sky, when one is fairly stifled in vegetation, in the color and smell of strong weeds and heavy harvests; blustery winters with little snow, when the whole country is stripped bare and gray as sheet-iron.", " There had been a warm thaw all day, with mushy yards and little streams of dark water gurgling cheerfully into the streets out of old snow-banks. My window was open, and the earthy wind blowing through made me indolent. On the edge of the prairie, where the sun had gone down, the sky was turquoise blue, like a lake, with gold light throbbing in it. Higher up, in the utter clarity of the western slope, the evening star hung like a lamp suspended by silver chains--like the lamp engraved upon the title-page of old Latin texts, which is always appearing in new heavens, and waking new desires in men. It reminded me, at any rate, to shut my window and light my wick in answer. I did so regretfully, and the dim objects in the room emerged from the shadows and took their place about me with the helpfulness which custom breeds. I propped my book open and stared listlessly at the page of the \u2018Georgics\u2019 where tomorrow\u2019s lesson began. It opened with the melancholy reflection that, in the lives of mortals the best days are the first to flee. \u2018Optima dies... prima fugit.\u2019 I turned back to the beginning of the third book, which we had read in class that morning. \u2018Primus ego in patriam mecum... deducam Musas\u2019; \u2018for I shall be the first, if I live, to bring the Muse into my country.\u2019 Cleric had explained to us that \u2018patria\u2019 here meant, not a nation or even a province, but the little rural neighbourhood on the Mincio where the poet was born.", " All about us we could hear the felty beat of the raindrops on the soft dust of the farmyard.

He and grandmother were getting old for the heavy work of a farm, and as I was now thirteen they thought I ought to be going to school. Accordingly our homestead was rented to \u2018that good woman, the Widow Steavens,\u2019 and her bachelor brother, and we bought Preacher White\u2019s house, at the north end of Black Hawk. This was the first town house one passed driving in from the farm, a landmark which told country people their long ride was over. We were to move to Black Hawk in March, and as soon as grandfather had fixed the date he let Jake and Otto know of his intention.", " \u201cOf course,\u201d he said, \u201cI should have to do it in a direct way, and say a great deal about myself. It\u2019s through myself that I knew and felt her, and I\u2019ve had no practice in any other form of presentation.\u201d I told him that how he knew her and felt her was exactly what I most wanted to know about Antonia. He had had opportunities that I, as a little girl who watched her come and go, had not. Months afterward Jim Burden arrived at my apartment one stormy winter afternoon, with a bulging legal portfolio sheltered under his fur overcoat. He brought it into the sitting-room with him and tapped it with some pride as he stood warming his hands. \u201cI finished it last night--the thing about Antonia,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, what about yours?\u201d I had to confess that mine had not gone beyond a few straggling notes. \u201cNotes?

At night, before I went to sleep, I often found myself in a sledge drawn by three horses, dashing through a country that looked something like Nebraska and something like Virginia. IX THE FIRST SNOWFALL came early in December. I remember how the world looked from our sitting-room window as I dressed behind the stove that morning: the low sky was like a sheet of metal; the blond cornfields had faded out into ghostliness at last; the little pond was frozen under its stiff willow bushes. Big white flakes were whirling over everything and disappearing in the red grass. Beyond the pond, on the slope that climbed to the cornfield, there was, faintly marked in the grass, a great circle where the Indians used to ride. Jake and Otto were sure that when they galloped round that ring the Indians tortured prisoners, bound to a stake in the centre; but grandfather thought they merely ran races or trained horses there. Whenever one looked at this slope against the setting sun, the circle showed like a pattern in the grass; and this morning, when the first light spray of snow lay over it, it came out with wonderful distinctness, like strokes of Chinese white on canvas. The old figure stirred me as it had never done before and seemed a good omen for the winter.", " While we snuggled down there out of the wind, she learned a score of words. She was alive, and very eager. We were so deep in the grass that we could see nothing but the blue sky over us and the gold tree in front of us. It was wonderfully pleasant. After Antonia had said the new words over and over, she wanted to give me a little chased silver ring she wore on her middle finger. When she coaxed and insisted, I repulsed her quite sternly. I didn\u2019t want her ring, and I felt there was something reckless and extravagant about her wishing to give it away to a boy she had never seen before. No wonder Krajiek got the better of these people, if this was how they behaved. While we were disputing \u2018about the ring, I heard a mournful voice calling, \u2018Antonia, Antonia!\u2019 She sprang up like a hare. \u2018Tatinek! Tatinek!\u2019 she shouted, and we ran to meet the old man who was coming toward us. Antonia reached him first, took his hand and kissed it. When I came up, he touched my shoulder and looked searchingly down into my face for several seconds. I became somewhat embarrassed, for I was used to being taken for granted by my elders. We went with Mr. Shimerda back to the dugout, where grandmother was waiting for me. Before I got into the wagon, he took a book out of his pocket, opened it, and showed me a page with two alphabets, one English and the other Bohemian. He placed this book in my grandmother\u2019s hands, looked at her entreatingly, and said, with an earnestness which I shall never forget, \u2018Te-e-ach, te-e-ach my Antonia!\u2019 IV ON THE AFTERNOON of that same Sunday I took my first long ride on my pony, under Otto\u2019s direction."], "What character\u2019s insensitive characterization makes him / her offensive to modern readers?": [" Cleric had ordered it for me when he was sending for books from abroad. Over the bookcase hung a photograph of the Tragic Theatre at Pompeii, which he had given me from his collection. When I sat at work I half-faced a deep, upholstered chair which stood at the end of my table, its high back against the wall. I had bought it with great care. My instructor sometimes looked in upon me when he was out for an evening tramp, and I noticed that he was more likely to linger and become talkative if I had a comfortable chair for him to sit in, and if he found a bottle of Benedictine and plenty of the kind of cigarettes he liked, at his elbow. He was, I had discovered, parsimonious about small expenditures--a trait absolutely inconsistent with his general character. Sometimes when he came he was silent and moody, and after a few sarcastic remarks went away again, to tramp the streets of Lincoln, which were almost as quiet and oppressively domestic as those of Black Hawk. Again, he would sit until nearly midnight, talking about Latin and English poetry, or telling me about his long stay in Italy. I can give no idea of the peculiar charm and vividness of his talk. In a crowd he was nearly always silent. Even for his classroom he had no platitudes, no stock of professorial anecdotes. When he was tired, his lectures were clouded, obscure, elliptical; but when he was interested they were wonderful.", " At all times she was highly tragic, devoured by remorse. Lightness of stress or behaviour was far from her. Her voice was heavy and deep: \u2018Ar-r-r-mond!\u2019 she would begin, as if she were summoning him to the bar of Judgment. But the lines were enough. She had only to utter them. They created the character in spite of her. The heartless world which Marguerite re-entered with Varville had never been so glittering and reckless as on the night when it gathered in Olympe\u2019s salon for the fourth act. There were chandeliers hung from the ceiling, I remember, many servants in livery, gaming-tables where the men played with piles of gold, and a staircase down which the guests made their entrance. After all the others had gathered round the card-tables and young Duval had been warned by Prudence, Marguerite descended the staircase with Varville; such a cloak, such a fan, such jewels--and her face! One knew at a glance how it was with her. When Armand, with the terrible words, \u2018Look, all of you, I owe this woman nothing!\u2019 flung the gold and bank-notes at the half-swooning Marguerite, Lena cowered beside me and covered her face with her hands. The curtain rose on the bedroom scene. By this time there wasn\u2019t a nerve in me that hadn\u2019t been twisted. Nanine alone could have made me cry. I loved Nanine tenderly; and Gaston, how one clung to that good fellow! The New Year\u2019s presents were not too much; nothing could be too much now.", " But not so much as her cynicism in the long dialogue with her lover which followed. How far was I from questioning her unbelief! While the charmingly sincere young man pleaded with her--accompanied by the orchestra in the old \u2018Traviata\u2019 duet, \u2018misterioso, misterios\u2019 altero!\u2019--she maintained her bitter scepticism, and the curtain fell on her dancing recklessly with the others, after Armand had been sent away with his flower. Between the acts we had no time to forget. The orchestra kept sawing away at the \u2018Traviata\u2019 music, so joyous and sad, so thin and far-away, so clap-trap and yet so heart-breaking. After the second act I left Lena in tearful contemplation of the ceiling, and went out into the lobby to smoke. As I walked about there I congratulated myself that I had not brought some Lincoln girl who would talk during the waits about the junior dances, or whether the cadets would camp at Plattsmouth. Lena was at least a woman, and I was a man. Through the scene between Marguerite and the elder Duval, Lena wept unceasingly, and I sat helpless to prevent the closing of that chapter of idyllic love, dreading the return of the young man whose ineffable happiness was only to be the measure of his fall. I suppose no woman could have been further in person, voice, and temperament from Dumas\u2019 appealing heroine than the veteran actress who first acquainted me with her. Her conception of the character was as heavy and uncompromising as her diction; she bore hard on the idea and on the consonants.", " In summer, when they were in bloom, he used to sit there with his friend that played the trombone. When I was little I used to go down there to hear them talk--beautiful talk, like what I never hear in this country.\u2019 \u2018What did they talk about?\u2019 I asked her. She sighed and shook her head. \u2018Oh, I don\u2019t know! About music, and the woods, and about God, and when they were young.\u2019 She turned to me suddenly and looked into my eyes. \u2018You think, Jimmy, that maybe my father\u2019s spirit can go back to those old places?\u2019 I told her about the feeling of her father\u2019s presence I had on that winter day when my grandparents had gone over to see his dead body and I was left alone in the house. I said I felt sure then that he was on his way back to his own country, and that even now, when I passed his grave, I always thought of him as being among the woods and fields that were so dear to him. Antonia had the most trusting, responsive eyes in the world; love and credulousness seemed to look out of them with open faces. \u2018Why didn\u2019t you ever tell me that before? It makes me feel more sure for him.\u2019 After a while she said: \u2018You know, Jim, my father was different from my mother. He did not have to marry my mother, and all his brothers quarrelled with him because he did. I used to hear the old people at home whisper about it. They said he could have paid my mother money, and not married her.

When fall came she was to husk corn for the neighbours until Christmas, as she had done the year before; but grandmother saved her from this by getting her a place to work with our neighbours, the Harlings. II GRANDMOTHER OFTEN SAID THAT if she had to live in town, she thanked God she lived next the Harlings. They had been farming people, like ourselves, and their place was like a little farm, with a big barn and a garden, and an orchard and grazing lots--even a windmill. The Harlings were Norwegians, and Mrs. Harling had lived in Christiania until she was ten years old. Her husband was born in Minnesota. He was a grain merchant and cattle-buyer, and was generally considered the most enterprising business man in our county. He controlled a line of grain elevators in the little towns along the railroad to the west of us, and was away from home a great deal. In his absence his wife was the head of the household. Mrs. Harling was short and square and sturdy-looking, like her house. Every inch of her was charged with an energy that made itself felt the moment she entered a room. Her face was rosy and solid, with bright, twinkling eyes and a stubborn little chin. She was quick to anger, quick to laughter, and jolly from the depths of her soul. How well I remember her laugh; it had in it the same sudden recognition that flashed into her eyes, was a burst of humour, short and intelligent.", " \u201cMy God!\u201d he says, \u201cso it\u2019s Norwegians now, is it?

I won\u2019t go no farther.\u201d \u2018I tried to make signs to Ole, \u2018cause I thought that man was crazy and might get the machine stopped up. But Ole, he was glad to get down out of the sun and chaff--it gets down your neck and sticks to you something awful when it\u2019s hot like that. So Ole jumped down and crawled under one of the wagons for shade, and the tramp got on the machine. He cut bands all right for a few minutes, and then, Mrs. Harling, he waved his hand to me and jumped head-first right into the threshing machine after the wheat. \u2018I begun to scream, and the men run to stop the horses, but the belt had sucked him down, and by the time they got her stopped, he was all beat and cut to pieces. He was wedged in so tight it was a hard job to get him out, and the machine ain\u2019t never worked right since.\u2019 \u2018Was he clear dead, Tony?\u2019 we cried. \u2018Was he dead? Well, I guess so! There, now, Nina\u2019s all upset. We won\u2019t talk about it. Don\u2019t you cry, Nina. No old tramp won\u2019t get you while Tony\u2019s here.\u2019 Mrs. Harling spoke up sternly. \u2018Stop crying, Nina, or I\u2019ll always send you upstairs when Antonia tells us about the country.

I guess they\u2019re engaged. Tony talks about him like he was president of the railroad. Everybody laughs about it, because she was never a girl to be soft. She won\u2019t hear a word against him.

She would have made us comfortable if she could. But that was no life for a girl! After I began to herd and milk, I could never get the smell of the cattle off me. The few underclothes I had I kept in a cracker-box. On Saturday nights, after everybody was in bed, then I could take a bath if I wasn\u2019t too tired. I could make two trips to the windmill to carry water, and heat it in the wash-boiler on the stove. While the water was heating, I could bring in a washtub out of the cave, and take my bath in the kitchen. Then I could put on a clean night-gown and get into bed with two others, who likely hadn\u2019t had a bath unless I\u2019d given it to them. You can\u2019t tell me anything about family life.

I never shall think about much else while I\u2019m with you. I\u2019ll never settle down and grind if I stay here. You know that.\u2019 I dropped down beside her and sat looking at the floor.", " At dinner grandfather talked to Jelinek more than he usually did to strangers. \u2018Will they be much disappointed because we cannot get a priest?\u2019 he asked. Jelinek looked serious. \u2018Yes, sir, that is very bad for them. Their father has done a great sin\u2019--he looked straight at grandfather. \u2018Our Lord has said that.\u2019 Grandfather seemed to like his frankness. \u2018We believe that, too, Jelinek. But we believe that Mr. Shimerda\u2019s soul will come to its Creator as well off without a priest. We believe that Christ is our only intercessor.\u2019 The young man shook his head. \u2018I know how you think. My teacher at the school has explain. But I have seen too much. I believe in prayer for the dead. I have seen too much.\u2019 We asked him what he meant. He glanced around the table. \u2018You want I shall tell you? When I was a little boy like this one, I begin to help the priest at the altar. I make my first communion very young; what the Church teach seem plain to me. By \u2018n\u2019 by war-times come, when the Prussians fight us. We have very many soldiers in camp near my village, and the cholera break out in that camp, and the men die like flies. All day long our priest go about there to give the Sacrament to dying men, and I go with him to carry the vessels with the Holy Sacrament. Everybody that go near that camp catch the sickness but me and the priest. But we have no sickness, we have no fear, because we carry that blood and that body of Christ, and it preserve us.\u2019 He paused, looking at grandfather.", " Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim. If you\u2019re going to be a preacher, I want you to marry me. You must promise to marry us all, and then baptize the babies.\u2019 Norwegian Anna, always dignified, looked at her reprovingly. \u2018Baptists don\u2019t believe in christening babies, do they, Jim?\u2019 I told her I didn\u2019t know what they believed, and didn\u2019t care, and that I certainly wasn\u2019t going to be a preacher. \u2018That\u2019s too bad,\u2019 Tiny simpered. She was in a teasing mood. \u2018You\u2019d make such a good one. You\u2019re so studious. Maybe you\u2019d like to be a professor. You used to teach Tony, didn\u2019t you?\u2019 Antonia broke in. \u2018I\u2019ve set my heart on Jim being a doctor. You\u2019d be good with sick people, Jim. Your grandmother\u2019s trained you up so nice. My papa always said you were an awful smart boy.\u2019 I said I was going to be whatever I pleased. \u2018Won\u2019t you be surprised, Miss Tiny, if I turn out to be a regular devil of a fellow?\u2019 They laughed until a glance from Norwegian Anna checked them; the high-school principal had just come into the front part of the shop to buy bread for supper. Anna knew the whisper was going about that I was a sly one. People said there must be something queer about a boy who showed no interest in girls of his own age, but who could be lively enough when he was with Tony and Lena or the three Marys. The enthusiasm for the dance, which the Vannis had kindled, did not at once die out.", " \u2018This what you want?\u2019 he asked surlily. Jake jumped off his horse. I saw a wave of red come up under the rough stubble on his face. \u2018That ain\u2019t the piece of harness I loaned you, Ambrosch; or, if it is, you\u2019ve used it shameful. I ain\u2019t a-going to carry such a looking thing back to Mr. Burden.\u2019 Ambrosch dropped the collar on the ground. \u2018All right,\u2019 he said coolly, took up his oil-can, and began to climb the mill. Jake caught him by the belt of his trousers and yanked him back. Ambrosch\u2019s feet had scarcely touched the ground when he lunged out with a vicious kick at Jake\u2019s stomach. Fortunately, Jake was in such a position that he could dodge it. This was not the sort of thing country boys did when they played at fisticuffs, and Jake was furious. He landed Ambrosch a blow on the head--it sounded like the crack of an axe on a cow-pumpkin. Ambrosch dropped over, stunned. We heard squeals, and looking up saw Antonia and her mother coming on the run. They did not take the path around the pond, but plunged through the muddy water, without even lifting their skirts. They came on, screaming and clawing the air. By this time Ambrosch had come to his senses and was sputtering with nosebleed. Jake sprang into his saddle. \u2018Let\u2019s get out of this, Jim,\u2019 he called. Mrs. Shimerda threw her hands over her head and clutched as if she were going to pull down lightning. \u2018Law, law!\u2019 she shrieked after us."], "What do the Harlings forbid \u00c1ntonia to do, causing her to leave?": [" The farmers liked her and were kind to her; said they would rather have her for a hand than Ambrosch.

Frances turned to grandmother. \u2018Oh, yes, Mrs. Burden, you didn\u2019t tell us that! She was working in the garden when we got there, barefoot and ragged. But she has such fine brown legs and arms, and splendid colour in her cheeks--like those big dark red plums.\u2019 We were pleased at this praise. Grandmother spoke feelingly. \u2018When she first came to this country, Frances, and had that genteel old man to watch over her, she was as pretty a girl as ever I saw.

He never looked at Lena again, nor lifted his eyes as he ceremoniously tipped his hat when he happened to meet her on the sidewalk. So that was what they were like, I thought, these white-handed, high-collared clerks and bookkeepers! I used to glare at young Lovett from a distance and only wished I had some way of showing my contempt for him. X IT WAS AT THE Vannis\u2019 tent that Antonia was discovered. Hitherto she had been looked upon more as a ward of the Harlings than as one of the \u2018hired girls.\u2019 She had lived in their house and yard and garden; her thoughts never seemed to stray outside that little kingdom. But after the tent came to town she began to go about with Tiny and Lena and their friends. The Vannis often said that Antonia was the best dancer of them all. I sometimes heard murmurs in the crowd outside the pavilion that Mrs. Harling would soon have her hands full with that girl. The young men began to joke with each other about \u2018the Harlings\u2019 Tony\u2019 as they did about \u2018the Marshalls\u2019 Anna\u2019 or \u2018the Gardeners\u2019 Tiny.\u2019 Antonia talked and thought of nothing but the tent. She hummed the dance tunes all day. When supper was late, she hurried with her dishes, dropped and smashed them in her excitement. At the first call of the music, she became irresponsible. If she hadn\u2019t time to dress, she merely flung off her apron and shot out of the kitchen door."], "Whom does Jim dedicate his oration to during his school commencement?": [" One evening she said she thought Mrs. Harling was not seriously offended with me. \u2018Mama is as broad-minded as mothers ever are, I guess.

Frances laughed. \u2018Yes, I think I can. You knew them in the country, and you like to take sides. In some ways you\u2019re older than boys of your age. It will be all right with mama after you pass your college examinations and she sees you\u2019re in earnest.\u2019 \u2018If you were a boy,\u2019 I persisted, \u2018you wouldn\u2019t belong to the Owl Club, either. You\u2019d be just like me.\u2019 She shook her head. \u2018I would and I wouldn\u2019t. I expect I know the country girls better than you do. You always put a kind of glamour over them. The trouble with you, Jim, is that you\u2019re romantic. Mama\u2019s going to your Commencement. She asked me the other day if I knew what your oration is to be about. She wants you to do well.\u2019 I thought my oration very good. It stated with fervour a great many things I had lately discovered. Mrs. Harling came to the Opera House to hear the Commencement exercises, and I looked at her most of the time while I made my speech. Her keen, intelligent eyes never left my face. Afterward she came back to the dressing-room where we stood, with our diplomas in our hands, walked up to me, and said heartily: \u2018You surprised me, Jim.", " Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim.

You must promise to marry us all, and then baptize the babies.\u2019 Norwegian Anna, always dignified, looked at her reprovingly. \u2018Baptists don\u2019t believe in christening babies, do they, Jim?\u2019 I told her I didn\u2019t know what they believed, and didn\u2019t care, and that I certainly wasn\u2019t going to be a preacher. \u2018That\u2019s too bad,\u2019 Tiny simpered. She was in a teasing mood. \u2018You\u2019d make such a good one. You\u2019re so studious. Maybe you\u2019d like to be a professor. You used to teach Tony, didn\u2019t you?\u2019 Antonia broke in. \u2018I\u2019ve set my heart on Jim being a doctor. You\u2019d be good with sick people, Jim.

Anna knew the whisper was going about that I was a sly one.

I was sure you\u2019d forget.\u2019 Anna spoke wistfully. \u2018It must make you very happy, Jim, to have fine thoughts like that in your mind all the time, and to have words to put them in.

That was before the day of high-school athletics. Girls who had to walk more than half a mile to school were pitied. There was not a tennis-court in the town; physical exercise was thought rather inelegant for the daughters of well-to-do families. Some of the high-school girls were jolly and pretty, but they stayed indoors in winter because of the cold, and in summer because of the heat. When one danced with them, their bodies never moved inside their clothes; their muscles seemed to ask but one thing--not to be disturbed. I remember those girls merely as faces in the schoolroom, gay and rosy, or listless and dull, cut off below the shoulders, like cherubs, by the ink-smeared tops of the high desks that were surely put there to make us round-shouldered and hollow-chested. The daughters of Black Hawk merchants had a confident, unenquiring belief that they were \u2018refined,\u2019 and that the country girls, who \u2018worked out,\u2019 were not. The American farmers in our county were quite as hard-pressed as their neighbours from other countries.

She has her own fortune and lives her own life. For some reason, she wishes to remain Mrs. James Burden. As for Jim, no disappointments have been severe enough to chill his naturally romantic and ardent disposition. This disposition, though it often made him seem very funny when he was a boy, has been one of the strongest elements in his success. He loves with a personal passion the great country through which his railway runs and branches. His faith in it and his knowledge of it have played an important part in its development. He is always able to raise capital for new enterprises in Wyoming or Montana, and has helped young men out there to do remarkable things in mines and timber and oil. If a young man with an idea can once get Jim Burden\u2019s attention, can manage to accompany him when he goes off into the wilds hunting for lost parks or exploring new canyons, then the money which means action is usually forthcoming. Jim is still able to lose himself in those big Western dreams. Though he is over forty now, he meets new people and new enterprises with the impulsiveness by which his boyhood friends remember him. He never seems to me to grow older. His fresh color and sandy hair and quick-changing blue eyes are those of a young man, and his sympathetic, solicitous interest in women is as youthful as it is Western and American."], "What does Cather use to symbolize the helplessness of humankind in the face of greater forces?": [" Without knowing why, we used to linger on the sidewalk outside the church when the lamps were lighted early for choir practice or prayer-meeting, shivering and talking until our feet were like lumps of ice. The crude reds and greens and blues of that coloured glass held us there. On winter nights, the lights in the Harlings\u2019 windows drew me like the painted glass. Inside that warm, roomy house there was colour, too. After supper I used to catch up my cap, stick my hands in my pockets, and dive through the willow hedge as if witches were after me. Of course, if Mr. Harling was at home, if his shadow stood out on the blind of the west room, I did not go in, but turned and walked home by the long way, through the street, wondering what book I should read as I sat down with the two old people. Such disappointments only gave greater zest to the nights when we acted charades, or had a costume ball in the back parlour, with Sally always dressed like a boy. Frances taught us to dance that winter, and she said, from the first lesson, that Antonia would make the best dancer among us. On Saturday nights, Mrs. Harling used to play the old operas for us--\u2018Martha,\u2019 \u2018Norma,\u2019 \u2018Rigoletto\u2019--telling us the story while she played.

Cuzak\u2019s Boys TO CARRIE AND IRENE MINER In memory of affections old and true Optima dies... prima fugit VIRGIL INTRODUCTION LAST summer I happened to be crossing the plains of Iowa in a season of intense heat, and it was my good fortune to have for a traveling companion James Quayle Burden--Jim Burden, as we still call him in the West. He and I are old friends--we grew up together in the same Nebraska town--and we had much to say to each other. While the train flashed through never-ending miles of ripe wheat, by country towns and bright-flowered pastures and oak groves wilting in the sun, we sat in the observation car, where the woodwork was hot to the touch and red dust lay deep over everything. The dust and heat, the burning wind, reminded us of many things. We were talking about what it is like to spend one\u2019s childhood in little towns like these, buried in wheat and corn, under stimulating extremes of climate: burning summers when the world lies green and billowy beneath a brilliant sky, when one is fairly stifled in vegetation, in the color and smell of strong weeds and heavy harvests; blustery winters with little snow, when the whole country is stripped bare and gray as sheet-iron.", " I wept unrestrainedly. Even the handkerchief in my breast-pocket, worn for elegance and not at all for use, was wet through by the time that moribund woman sank for the last time into the arms of her lover. When we reached the door of the theatre, the streets were shining with rain. I had prudently brought along Mrs. Harling\u2019s useful Commencement present, and I took Lena home under its shelter. After leaving her, I walked slowly out into the country part of the town where I lived. The lilacs were all blooming in the yards, and the smell of them after the rain, of the new leaves and the blossoms together, blew into my face with a sort of bitter sweetness. I tramped through the puddles and under the showery trees, mourning for Marguerite Gauthier as if she had died only yesterday, sighing with the spirit of 1840, which had sighed so much, and which had reached me only that night, across long years and several languages, through the person of an infirm old actress. The idea is one that no circumstances can frustrate. Wherever and whenever that piece is put on, it is April. IV HOW WELL I REMEMBER the stiff little parlour where I used to wait for Lena: the hard horsehair furniture, bought at some auction sale, the long mirror, the fashion-plates on the wall. If I sat down even for a moment, I was sure to find threads and bits of coloured silk clinging to my clothes after I went away.", " But the next time Samson had a chance, he ran away again. If Miss d\u2019Arnault stopped practising for a moment and went toward the window, she saw this hideous little pickaninny, dressed in an old piece of sacking, standing in the open space between the hollyhock rows, his body rocking automatically, his blind face lifted to the sun and wearing an expression of idiotic rapture. Often she was tempted to tell Martha that the child must be kept at home, but somehow the memory of his foolish, happy face deterred her. She remembered that his sense of hearing was nearly all he had--though it did not occur to her that he might have more of it than other children. One day Samson was standing thus while Miss Nellie was playing her lesson to her music-teacher. The windows were open. He heard them get up from the piano, talk a little while, and then leave the room. He heard the door close after them. He crept up to the front windows and stuck his head in: there was no one there. He could always detect the presence of anyone in a room. He put one foot over the window-sill and straddled it. His mother had told him over and over how his master would give him to the big mastiff if he ever found him \u2018meddling.\u2019 Samson had got too near the mastiff\u2019s kennel once, and had felt his terrible breath in his face. He thought about that, but he pulled in his other foot. Through the dark he found his way to the Thing, to its mouth."], "What does Jim study at Lincoln?": [" I seemed to have forgotten all my reasonable explanations. Lena drew close to me, and the little hesitation in her voice that had hurt me was not there when she spoke again. \u2018I oughtn\u2019t to have begun it, ought I?\u2019 she murmured. \u2018I oughtn\u2019t to have gone to see you that first time. But I did want to. I guess I\u2019ve always been a little foolish about you. I don\u2019t know what first put it into my head, unless it was Antonia, always telling me I mustn\u2019t be up to any of my nonsense with you. I let you alone for a long while, though, didn\u2019t I?\u2019 She was a sweet creature to those she loved, that Lena Lingard! At last she sent me away with her soft, slow, renunciatory kiss. \u2018You aren\u2019t sorry I came to see you that time?\u2019 she whispered. \u2018It seemed so natural. I used to think I\u2019d like to be your first sweetheart. You were such a funny kid!\u2019 She always kissed one as if she were sadly and wisely sending one away forever. We said many good-byes before I left Lincoln, but she never tried to hinder me or hold me back. \u2018You are going, but you haven\u2019t gone yet, have you?\u2019 she used to say. My Lincoln chapter closed abruptly. I went home to my grandparents for a few weeks, and afterward visited my relatives in Virginia until I joined Cleric in Boston. I was then nineteen years old. BOOK IV. The Pioneer Woman\u2019s Story I TWO YEARS AFTER I left Lincoln, I completed my academic course at Harvard. Before I entered the Law School I went home for the summer vacation.", " Gaston Cleric had arrived in Lincoln only a few weeks earlier than I, to begin his work as head of the Latin Department. He came West at the suggestion of his physicians, his health having been enfeebled by a long illness in Italy. When I took my entrance examinations, he was my examiner, and my course was arranged under his supervision. I did not go home for my first summer vacation, but stayed in Lincoln, working off a year\u2019s Greek, which had been my only condition on entering the freshman class. Cleric\u2019s doctor advised against his going back to New England, and, except for a few weeks in Colorado, he, too, was in Lincoln all that summer. We played tennis, read, and took long walks together. I shall always look back on that time of mental awakening as one of the happiest in my life. Gaston Cleric introduced me to the world of ideas; when one first enters that world everything else fades for a time, and all that went before is as if it had not been. Yet I found curious survivals; some of the figures of my old life seemed to be waiting for me in the new. In those days there were many serious young men among the students who had come up to the university from the farms and the little towns scattered over the thinly settled state. Some of those boys came straight from the cornfields with only a summer\u2019s wages in their pockets, hung on through the four years, shabby and underfed, and completed the course by really heroic self-sacrifice.", " Our instructors were oddly assorted; wandering pioneer school-teachers, stranded ministers of the Gospel, a few enthusiastic young men just out of graduate schools. There was an atmosphere of endeavour, of expectancy and bright hopefulness about the young college that had lifted its head from the prairie only a few years before. Our personal life was as free as that of our instructors. There were no college dormitories; we lived where we could and as we could. I took rooms with an old couple, early settlers in Lincoln, who had married off their children and now lived quietly in their house at the edge of town, near the open country. The house was inconveniently situated for students, and on that account I got two rooms for the price of one. My bedroom, originally a linen-closet, was unheated and was barely large enough to contain my cot-bed, but it enabled me to call the other room my study. The dresser, and the great walnut wardrobe which held all my clothes, even my hats and shoes, I had pushed out of the way, and I considered them non-existent, as children eliminate incongruous objects when they are playing house. I worked at a commodious green-topped table placed directly in front of the west window which looked out over the prairie. In the corner at my right were all my books, in shelves I had made and painted myself. On the blank wall at my left the dark, old-fashioned wall-paper was covered by a large map of ancient Rome, the work of some German scholar.", " I went down across the fields, and Tony saw me from a long way off. She stood still by her shocks, leaning on her pitchfork, watching me as I came. We met like the people in the old song, in silence, if not in tears. Her warm hand clasped mine. \u2018I thought you\u2019d come, Jim. I heard you were at Mrs. Steavens\u2019s last night. I\u2019ve been looking for you all day.\u2019 She was thinner than I had ever seen her, and looked as Mrs. Steavens said, \u2018worked down,\u2019 but there was a new kind of strength in the gravity of her face, and her colour still gave her that look of deep-seated health and ardour. Still? Why, it flashed across me that though so much had happened in her life and in mine, she was barely twenty-four years old. Antonia stuck her fork in the ground, and instinctively we walked toward that unploughed patch at the crossing of the roads as the fittest place to talk to each other. We sat down outside the sagging wire fence that shut Mr. Shimerda\u2019s plot off from the rest of the world. The tall red grass had never been cut there. It had died down in winter and come up again in the spring until it was as thick and shrubby as some tropical garden-grass. I found myself telling her everything: why I had decided to study law and to go into the law office of one of my mother\u2019s relatives in New York City; about Gaston Cleric\u2019s death from pneumonia last winter, and the difference it had made in my life."], "What play deeply affects Jim and Lena?": [" I liked to watch a play with Lena; everything was wonderful to her, and everything was true. It was like going to revival meetings with someone who was always being converted. She handed her feelings over to the actors with a kind of fatalistic resignation. Accessories of costume and scene meant much more to her than to me. She sat entranced through \u2018Robin Hood\u2019 and hung upon the lips of the contralto who sang, \u2018Oh, Promise Me!\u2019 Toward the end of April, the billboards, which I watched anxiously in those days, bloomed out one morning with gleaming white posters on which two names were impressively printed in blue Gothic letters: the name of an actress of whom I had often heard, and the name \u2018Camille.\u2019 I called at the Raleigh Block for Lena on Saturday evening, and we walked down to the theatre. The weather was warm and sultry and put us both in a holiday humour. We arrived early, because Lena liked to watch the people come in. There was a note on the programme, saying that the \u2018incidental music\u2019 would be from the opera \u2018Traviata,\u2019 which was made from the same story as the play. We had neither of us read the play, and we did not know what it was about--though I seemed to remember having heard it was a piece in which great actresses shone. \u2018The Count of Monte Cristo,\u2019 which I had seen James O\u2019Neill play that winter, was by the only Alexandre Dumas I knew. This play, I saw, was by his son, and I expected a family resemblance.", " Yes, I\u2019ve seen her with you at the theatre. She\u2019s very pretty, and perfectly irresponsible, I should judge.\u2019 Cleric wrote my grandfather that he would like to take me East with him. To my astonishment, grandfather replied that I might go if I wished. I was both glad and sorry on the day when the letter came. I stayed in my room all evening and thought things over. I even tried to persuade myself that I was standing in Lena\u2019s way--it is so necessary to be a little noble!--and that if she had not me to play with, she would probably marry and secure her future. The next evening I went to call on Lena. I found her propped up on the couch in her bay-window, with her foot in a big slipper. An awkward little Russian girl whom she had taken into her work-room had dropped a flat-iron on Lena\u2019s toe. On the table beside her there was a basket of early summer flowers which the Pole had left after he heard of the accident. He always managed to know what went on in Lena\u2019s apartment. Lena was telling me some amusing piece of gossip about one of her clients, when I interrupted her and picked up the flower basket. \u2018This old chap will be proposing to you some day, Lena.\u2019 \u2018Oh, he has--often!\u2019 she murmured. \u2018What! After you\u2019ve refused him?\u2019 \u2018He doesn\u2019t mind that. It seems to cheer him to mention the subject. Old men are like that, you know. It makes them feel important to think they\u2019re in love with somebody.\u2019 \u2018The colonel would marry you in a minute.", " My business took me West several times every year, and it was always in the back of my mind that I would stop in Nebraska some day and go to see Antonia. But I kept putting it off until the next trip. I did not want to find her aged and broken; I really dreaded it. In the course of twenty crowded years one parts with many illusions. I did not wish to lose the early ones. Some memories are realities, and are better than anything that can ever happen to one again. I owe it to Lena Lingard that I went to see Antonia at last. I was in San Francisco two summers ago when both Lena and Tiny Soderball were in town. Tiny lives in a house of her own, and Lena\u2019s shop is in an apartment house just around the corner. It interested me, after so many years, to see the two women together. Tiny audits Lena\u2019s accounts occasionally, and invests her money for her; and Lena, apparently, takes care that Tiny doesn\u2019t grow too miserly. \u2018If there\u2019s anything I can\u2019t stand,\u2019 she said to me in Tiny\u2019s presence, \u2018it\u2019s a shabby rich woman.\u2019 Tiny smiled grimly and assured me that Lena would never be either shabby or rich. \u2018And I don\u2019t want to be,\u2019 the other agreed complacently. Lena gave me a cheerful account of Antonia and urged me to make her a visit. \u2018You really ought to go, Jim. It would be such a satisfaction to her. Never mind what Tiny says. There\u2019s nothing the matter with Cuzak. You\u2019d like him. He isn\u2019t a hustler, but a rough man would never have suited Tony.", " \u2018Hello, Tony. Don\u2019t you know me?\u2019 she asked in a smooth, low voice, looking in at us archly. Antonia gasped and stepped back. \u2018Why, it\u2019s Lena! Of course I didn\u2019t know you, so dressed up!\u2019 Lena Lingard laughed, as if this pleased her. I had not recognized her for a moment, either. I had never seen her before with a hat on her head--or with shoes and stockings on her feet, for that matter. And here she was, brushed and smoothed and dressed like a town girl, smiling at us with perfect composure. \u2018Hello, Jim,\u2019 she said carelessly as she walked into the kitchen and looked about her. \u2018I\u2019ve come to town to work, too, Tony.\u2019 \u2018Have you, now? Well, ain\u2019t that funny!\u2019 Antonia stood ill at ease, and didn\u2019t seem to know just what to do with her visitor. The door was open into the dining-room, where Mrs. Harling sat crocheting and Frances was reading. Frances asked Lena to come in and join them. \u2018You are Lena Lingard, aren\u2019t you? I\u2019ve been to see your mother, but you were off herding cattle that day. Mama, this is Chris Lingard\u2019s oldest girl.\u2019 Mrs. Harling dropped her worsted and examined the visitor with quick, keen eyes. Lena was not at all disconcerted. She sat down in the chair Frances pointed out, carefully arranging her pocket-book and grey cotton gloves on her lap. We followed with our popcorn, but Antonia hung back--said she had to get her cake into the oven. \u2018So you have come to town,\u2019 said Mrs. Harling, her eyes still fixed on Lena."], "What concept most affects Jim during his studies?": [" Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim. If you\u2019re going to be a preacher, I want you to marry me. You must promise to marry us all, and then baptize the babies.\u2019 Norwegian Anna, always dignified, looked at her reprovingly. \u2018Baptists don\u2019t believe in christening babies, do they, Jim?\u2019 I told her I didn\u2019t know what they believed, and didn\u2019t care, and that I certainly wasn\u2019t going to be a preacher. \u2018That\u2019s too bad,\u2019 Tiny simpered. She was in a teasing mood. \u2018You\u2019d make such a good one. You\u2019re so studious. Maybe you\u2019d like to be a professor. You used to teach Tony, didn\u2019t you?\u2019 Antonia broke in. \u2018I\u2019ve set my heart on Jim being a doctor. You\u2019d be good with sick people, Jim. Your grandmother\u2019s trained you up so nice. My papa always said you were an awful smart boy.\u2019 I said I was going to be whatever I pleased. \u2018Won\u2019t you be surprised, Miss Tiny, if I turn out to be a regular devil of a fellow?\u2019 They laughed until a glance from Norwegian Anna checked them; the high-school principal had just come into the front part of the shop to buy bread for supper. Anna knew the whisper was going about that I was a sly one. People said there must be something queer about a boy who showed no interest in girls of his own age, but who could be lively enough when he was with Tony and Lena or the three Marys. The enthusiasm for the dance, which the Vannis had kindled, did not at once die out.", " She hadn\u2019t liked the way he kept coming into the kitchen to instruct her, or the way he looked at her. \u2018I feel as if he is up to some of his tricks again, and is going to try to scare me, somehow.\u2019 Grandmother was apprehensive at once. \u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for you to stay there, feeling that way. I suppose it wouldn\u2019t be right for you to leave the place alone, either, after giving your word. Maybe Jim would be willing to go over there and sleep, and you could come here nights. I\u2019d feel safer, knowing you were under my own roof. I guess Jim could take care of their silver and old usury notes as well as you could.\u2019 Antonia turned to me eagerly. \u2018Oh, would you, Jim? I\u2019d make up my bed nice and fresh for you. It\u2019s a real cool room, and the bed\u2019s right next the window. I was afraid to leave the window open last night.\u2019 I liked my own room, and I didn\u2019t like the Cutters\u2019 house under any circumstances; but Tony looked so troubled that I consented to try this arrangement. I found that I slept there as well as anywhere, and when I got home in the morning, Tony had a good breakfast waiting for me. After prayers she sat down at the table with us, and it was like old times in the country. The third night I spent at the Cutters\u2019, I awoke suddenly with the impression that I had heard a door open and shut. Everything was still, however, and I must have gone to sleep again immediately. The next thing I knew, I felt someone sit down on the edge of the bed.", " I didn\u2019t believe you could do as well as that. You didn\u2019t get that speech out of books.\u2019 Among my graduation presents there was a silk umbrella from Mrs. Harling, with my name on the handle. I walked home from the Opera House alone. As I passed the Methodist Church, I saw three white figures ahead of me, pacing up and down under the arching maple trees, where the moonlight filtered through the lush June foliage. They hurried toward me; they were waiting for me--Lena and Tony and Anna Hansen. \u2018Oh, Jim, it was splendid!\u2019 Tony was breathing hard, as she always did when her feelings outran her language. \u2018There ain\u2019t a lawyer in Black Hawk could make a speech like that. I just stopped your grandpa and said so to him. He won\u2019t tell you, but he told us he was awful surprised himself, didn\u2019t he, girls?\u2019 Lena sidled up to me and said teasingly, \u2018What made you so solemn? I thought you were scared. I was sure you\u2019d forget.\u2019 Anna spoke wistfully. \u2018It must make you very happy, Jim, to have fine thoughts like that in your mind all the time, and to have words to put them in. I always wanted to go to school, you know.\u2019 \u2018Oh, I just sat there and wished my papa could hear you! Jim\u2019--Antonia took hold of my coat lapels--\u2018there was something in your speech that made me think so about my papa!\u2019 \u2018I thought about your papa when I wrote my speech, Tony,\u2019 I said. \u2018I dedicated it to him.\u2019 She threw her arms around me, and her dear face was all wet with tears.", " Her husband\u2019s quiet tastes irritate her, I think, and she finds it worth while to play the patroness to a group of young poets and painters of advanced ideas and mediocre ability. She has her own fortune and lives her own life. For some reason, she wishes to remain Mrs. James Burden. As for Jim, no disappointments have been severe enough to chill his naturally romantic and ardent disposition. This disposition, though it often made him seem very funny when he was a boy, has been one of the strongest elements in his success. He loves with a personal passion the great country through which his railway runs and branches. His faith in it and his knowledge of it have played an important part in its development. He is always able to raise capital for new enterprises in Wyoming or Montana, and has helped young men out there to do remarkable things in mines and timber and oil. If a young man with an idea can once get Jim Burden\u2019s attention, can manage to accompany him when he goes off into the wilds hunting for lost parks or exploring new canyons, then the money which means action is usually forthcoming. Jim is still able to lose himself in those big Western dreams. Though he is over forty now, he meets new people and new enterprises with the impulsiveness by which his boyhood friends remember him. He never seems to me to grow older. His fresh color and sandy hair and quick-changing blue eyes are those of a young man, and his sympathetic, solicitous interest in women is as youthful as it is Western and American."], "Who acts as a link between Jim\u2019s past and present in Lincoln?": [" I seemed to have forgotten all my reasonable explanations. Lena drew close to me, and the little hesitation in her voice that had hurt me was not there when she spoke again. \u2018I oughtn\u2019t to have begun it, ought I?\u2019 she murmured. \u2018I oughtn\u2019t to have gone to see you that first time. But I did want to. I guess I\u2019ve always been a little foolish about you. I don\u2019t know what first put it into my head, unless it was Antonia, always telling me I mustn\u2019t be up to any of my nonsense with you. I let you alone for a long while, though, didn\u2019t I?\u2019 She was a sweet creature to those she loved, that Lena Lingard! At last she sent me away with her soft, slow, renunciatory kiss. \u2018You aren\u2019t sorry I came to see you that time?\u2019 she whispered. \u2018It seemed so natural. I used to think I\u2019d like to be your first sweetheart. You were such a funny kid!\u2019 She always kissed one as if she were sadly and wisely sending one away forever. We said many good-byes before I left Lincoln, but she never tried to hinder me or hold me back. \u2018You are going, but you haven\u2019t gone yet, have you?\u2019 she used to say. My Lincoln chapter closed abruptly. I went home to my grandparents for a few weeks, and afterward visited my relatives in Virginia until I joined Cleric in Boston. I was then nineteen years old. BOOK IV. The Pioneer Woman\u2019s Story I TWO YEARS AFTER I left Lincoln, I completed my academic course at Harvard. Before I entered the Law School I went home for the summer vacation.", " But not so much as her cynicism in the long dialogue with her lover which followed. How far was I from questioning her unbelief! While the charmingly sincere young man pleaded with her--accompanied by the orchestra in the old \u2018Traviata\u2019 duet, \u2018misterioso, misterios\u2019 altero!\u2019--she maintained her bitter scepticism, and the curtain fell on her dancing recklessly with the others, after Armand had been sent away with his flower. Between the acts we had no time to forget. The orchestra kept sawing away at the \u2018Traviata\u2019 music, so joyous and sad, so thin and far-away, so clap-trap and yet so heart-breaking. After the second act I left Lena in tearful contemplation of the ceiling, and went out into the lobby to smoke. As I walked about there I congratulated myself that I had not brought some Lincoln girl who would talk during the waits about the junior dances, or whether the cadets would camp at Plattsmouth. Lena was at least a woman, and I was a man. Through the scene between Marguerite and the elder Duval, Lena wept unceasingly, and I sat helpless to prevent the closing of that chapter of idyllic love, dreading the return of the young man whose ineffable happiness was only to be the measure of his fall. I suppose no woman could have been further in person, voice, and temperament from Dumas\u2019 appealing heroine than the veteran actress who first acquainted me with her. Her conception of the character was as heavy and uncompromising as her diction; she bore hard on the idea and on the consonants.", " Gaston Cleric had arrived in Lincoln only a few weeks earlier than I, to begin his work as head of the Latin Department. He came West at the suggestion of his physicians, his health having been enfeebled by a long illness in Italy. When I took my entrance examinations, he was my examiner, and my course was arranged under his supervision. I did not go home for my first summer vacation, but stayed in Lincoln, working off a year\u2019s Greek, which had been my only condition on entering the freshman class. Cleric\u2019s doctor advised against his going back to New England, and, except for a few weeks in Colorado, he, too, was in Lincoln all that summer. We played tennis, read, and took long walks together. I shall always look back on that time of mental awakening as one of the happiest in my life. Gaston Cleric introduced me to the world of ideas; when one first enters that world everything else fades for a time, and all that went before is as if it had not been. Yet I found curious survivals; some of the figures of my old life seemed to be waiting for me in the new. In those days there were many serious young men among the students who had come up to the university from the farms and the little towns scattered over the thinly settled state. Some of those boys came straight from the cornfields with only a summer\u2019s wages in their pockets, hung on through the four years, shabby and underfed, and completed the course by really heroic self-sacrifice.", " I hurried to the door and when I opened it saw a woman standing in the dark hall. \u2018I expect you hardly know me, Jim.\u2019 The voice seemed familiar, but I did not recognize her until she stepped into the light of my doorway and I beheld--Lena Lingard! She was so quietly conventionalized by city clothes that I might have passed her on the street without seeing her. Her black suit fitted her figure smoothly, and a black lace hat, with pale-blue forget-me-nots, sat demurely on her yellow hair. I led her toward Cleric\u2019s chair, the only comfortable one I had, questioning her confusedly. She was not disconcerted by my embarrassment. She looked about her with the naive curiosity I remembered so well. \u2018You are quite comfortable here, aren\u2019t you? I live in Lincoln now, too, Jim. I\u2019m in business for myself. I have a dressmaking shop in the Raleigh Block, out on O Street. I\u2019ve made a real good start.\u2019 \u2018But, Lena, when did you come?\u2019 \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve been here all winter. Didn\u2019t your grandmother ever write you? I\u2019ve thought about looking you up lots of times. But we\u2019ve all heard what a studious young man you\u2019ve got to be, and I felt bashful. I didn\u2019t know whether you\u2019d be glad to see me.\u2019 She laughed her mellow, easy laugh, that was either very artless or very comprehending, one never quite knew which. \u2018You seem the same, though--except you\u2019re a young man, now, of course. Do you think I\u2019ve changed?\u2019 \u2018Maybe you\u2019re prettier--though you were always pretty enough."], "What setting do both Cather and Jim long for and devote themselves to?": [" We did not tell Pavel\u2019s secret to anyone, but guarded it jealously--as if the wolves of the Ukraine had gathered that night long ago, and the wedding party been sacrificed, to give us a painful and peculiar pleasure. At night, before I went to sleep, I often found myself in a sledge drawn by three horses, dashing through a country that looked something like Nebraska and something like Virginia. IX THE FIRST SNOWFALL came early in December. I remember how the world looked from our sitting-room window as I dressed behind the stove that morning: the low sky was like a sheet of metal; the blond cornfields had faded out into ghostliness at last; the little pond was frozen under its stiff willow bushes. Big white flakes were whirling over everything and disappearing in the red grass. Beyond the pond, on the slope that climbed to the cornfield, there was, faintly marked in the grass, a great circle where the Indians used to ride. Jake and Otto were sure that when they galloped round that ring the Indians tortured prisoners, bound to a stake in the centre; but grandfather thought they merely ran races or trained horses there. Whenever one looked at this slope against the setting sun, the circle showed like a pattern in the grass; and this morning, when the first light spray of snow lay over it, it came out with wonderful distinctness, like strokes of Chinese white on canvas. The old figure stirred me as it had never done before and seemed a good omen for the winter.", " *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MY ANTONIA *** Produced by Judith Boss, and Martin Robb MY ANTONIA By Willa Cather CONTENTS Introduction BOOK I.

He and I are old friends--we grew up together in the same Nebraska town--and we had much to say to each other. While the train flashed through never-ending miles of ripe wheat, by country towns and bright-flowered pastures and oak groves wilting in the sun, we sat in the observation car, where the woodwork was hot to the touch and red dust lay deep over everything. The dust and heat, the burning wind, reminded us of many things. We were talking about what it is like to spend one\u2019s childhood in little towns like these, buried in wheat and corn, under stimulating extremes of climate: burning summers when the world lies green and billowy beneath a brilliant sky, when one is fairly stifled in vegetation, in the color and smell of strong weeds and heavy harvests; blustery winters with little snow, when the whole country is stripped bare and gray as sheet-iron.", " Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim.

Indeed, he was never the same horse afterward. That long trip through the deep snow had taken all the endurance out of him. Fuchs brought home with him a stranger, a young Bohemian who had taken a homestead near Black Hawk, and who came on his only horse to help his fellow countrymen in their trouble. That was the first time I ever saw Anton Jelinek. He was a strapping young fellow in the early twenties then, handsome, warm-hearted, and full of life, and he came to us like a miracle in the midst of that grim business. I remember exactly how he strode into our kitchen in his felt boots and long wolfskin coat, his eyes and cheeks bright with the cold. At sight of grandmother, he snatched off his fur cap, greeting her in a deep, rolling voice which seemed older than he. \u2018I want to thank you very much, Mrs. Burden, for that you are so kind to poor strangers from my kawntree.\u2019 He did not hesitate like a farmer boy, but looked one eagerly in the eye when he spoke. Everything about him was warm and spontaneous. He said he would have come to see the Shimerdas before, but he had hired out to husk corn all the fall, and since winter began he had been going to the school by the mill, to learn English, along with the little children. He told me he had a nice \u2018lady-teacher\u2019 and that he liked to go to school.", " \u2018None of your smart speeches,\u2019 said Ambrosch severely. Leo poked out a supple red tongue at him, but a moment later broke into a giggle at a tintype of two men, uncomfortably seated, with an awkward-looking boy in baggy clothes standing between them: Jake and Otto and I! We had it taken, I remembered, when we went to Black Hawk on the first Fourth of July I spent in Nebraska. I was glad to see Jake\u2019s grin again, and Otto\u2019s ferocious moustaches. The young Cuzaks knew all about them. \u2018He made grandfather\u2019s coffin, didn\u2019t he?\u2019 Anton asked. \u2018Wasn\u2019t they good fellows, Jim?\u2019 Antonia\u2019s eyes filled. \u2018To this day I\u2019m ashamed because I quarrelled with Jake that way. I was saucy and impertinent to him, Leo, like you are with people sometimes, and I wish somebody had made me behave.\u2019 \u2018We aren\u2019t through with you, yet,\u2019 they warned me. They produced a photograph taken just before I went away to college: a tall youth in striped trousers and a straw hat, trying to look easy and jaunty. \u2018Tell us, Mr. Burden,\u2019 said Charley, \u2018about the rattler you killed at the dog-town. How long was he? Sometimes mother says six feet and sometimes she says five.\u2019 These children seemed to be upon very much the same terms with Antonia as the Harling children had been so many years before. They seemed to feel the same pride in her, and to look to her for stories and entertainment as we used to do. It was eleven o\u2019clock when I at last took my bag and some blankets and started for the barn with the boys.", " \u2018Oh, I\u2019m not worrying, Mrs. Burden! I can bring something out of that girl. She\u2019s barely seventeen, not too old to learn new ways. She\u2019s good-looking, too!\u2019 she added warmly. Frances turned to grandmother. \u2018Oh, yes, Mrs. Burden, you didn\u2019t tell us that! She was working in the garden when we got there, barefoot and ragged. But she has such fine brown legs and arms, and splendid colour in her cheeks--like those big dark red plums.\u2019 We were pleased at this praise. Grandmother spoke feelingly. \u2018When she first came to this country, Frances, and had that genteel old man to watch over her, she was as pretty a girl as ever I saw. But, dear me, what a life she\u2019s led, out in the fields with those rough threshers! Things would have been very different with poor Antonia if her father had lived.\u2019 The Harlings begged us to tell them about Mr. Shimerda\u2019s death and the big snowstorm. By the time we saw grandfather coming home from church, we had told them pretty much all we knew of the Shimerdas. \u2018The girl will be happy here, and she\u2019ll forget those things,\u2019 said Mrs. Harling confidently, as we rose to take our leave. III ON SATURDAY AMBROSCH drove up to the back gate, and Antonia jumped down from the wagon and ran into our kitchen just as she used to do. She was wearing shoes and stockings, and was breathless and excited. She gave me a playful shake by the shoulders. \u2018You ain\u2019t forget about me, Jim?\u2019 Grandmother kissed her.", " On the level land the tracks had almost disappeared--were mere shadings in the grass, and a stranger would not have noticed them. But wherever the road had crossed a draw, it was easy to find. The rains had made channels of the wheel-ruts and washed them so deeply that the sod had never healed over them. They looked like gashes torn by a grizzly\u2019s claws, on the slopes where the farm-wagons used to lurch up out of the hollows with a pull that brought curling muscles on the smooth hips of the horses. I sat down and watched the haystacks turn rosy in the slanting sunlight. This was the road over which Antonia and I came on that night when we got off the train at Black Hawk and were bedded down in the straw, wondering children, being taken we knew not whither. I had only to close my eyes to hear the rumbling of the wagons in the dark, and to be again overcome by that obliterating strangeness. The feelings of that night were so near that I could reach out and touch them with my hand. I had the sense of coming home to myself, and of having found out what a little circle man\u2019s experience is. For Antonia and for me, this had been the road of Destiny; had taken us to those early accidents of fortune which predetermined for us all that we can ever be. Now I understood that the same road was to bring us together again. Whatever we had missed, we possessed together the precious, the incommunicable past."], "What does \u00c1ntonia manage to conceal from her family beneath for bulky clothes?": [" When I stole into the parlour, Anson Kirkpatrick, Marshall Field\u2019s man, was at the piano, playing airs from a musical comedy then running in Chicago. He was a dapper little Irishman, very vain, homely as a monkey, with friends everywhere, and a sweetheart in every port, like a sailor. I did not know all the men who were sitting about, but I recognized a furniture salesman from Kansas City, a drug man, and Willy O\u2019Reilly, who travelled for a jewellery house and sold musical instruments. The talk was all about good and bad hotels, actors and actresses and musical prodigies. I learned that Mrs. Gardener had gone to Omaha to hear Booth and Barrett, who were to play there next week, and that Mary Anderson was having a great success in \u2018A Winter\u2019s Tale,\u2019 in London. The door from the office opened, and Johnnie Gardener came in, directing Blind d\u2019Arnault--he would never consent to be led. He was a heavy, bulky mulatto, on short legs, and he came tapping the floor in front of him with his gold-headed cane. His yellow face was lifted in the light, with a show of white teeth, all grinning, and his shrunken, papery eyelids lay motionless over his blind eyes. \u2018Good evening, gentlemen. No ladies here? Good evening, gentlemen. We going to have a little music? Some of you gentlemen going to play for me this evening?\u2019 It was the soft, amiable Negro voice, like those I remembered from early childhood, with the note of docile subservience in it.", " Mrs. Shimerda had run to the animal, pulled up the lariat pin, and, when we came upon her, she was trying to hide the cow in an old cave in the bank. As the hole was narrow and dark, the cow held back, and the old woman was slapping and pushing at her hind quarters, trying to spank her into the drawside. Grandfather ignored her singular occupation and greeted her politely. \u2018Good morning, Mrs. Shimerda. Can you tell me where I will find Ambrosch? Which field?\u2019 \u2018He with the sod corn.\u2019 She pointed toward the north, still standing in front of the cow as if she hoped to conceal it. \u2018His sod corn will be good for fodder this winter,\u2019 said grandfather encouragingly. \u2018And where is Antonia?\u2019 \u2018She go with.\u2019 Mrs. Shimerda kept wiggling her bare feet about nervously in the dust. \u2018Very well. I will ride up there. I want them to come over and help me cut my oats and wheat next month. I will pay them wages. Good morning. By the way, Mrs. Shimerda,\u2019 he said as he turned up the path, \u2018I think we may as well call it square about the cow.\u2019 She started and clutched the rope tighter. Seeing that she did not understand, grandfather turned back. \u2018You need not pay me anything more; no more money. The cow is yours.\u2019 \u2018Pay no more, keep cow?\u2019 she asked in a bewildered tone, her narrow eyes snapping at us in the sunlight. \u2018Exactly. Pay no more, keep cow.\u2019 He nodded. Mrs. Shimerda dropped the rope, ran after us, and, crouching down beside grandfather, she took his hand and kissed it.", " They\u2019ve never had a sewing-machine at the Shimerdas\u2019, and she made all her things here. I taught her hemstitching, and I helped her to cut and fit. She used to sit there at that machine by the window, pedalling the life out of it--she was so strong--and always singing them queer Bohemian songs, like she was the happiest thing in the world. \u2018\u201cAntonia,\u201d I used to say, \u201cdon\u2019t run that machine so fast. You won\u2019t hasten the day none that way.\u201d \u2018Then she\u2019d laugh and slow down for a little, but she\u2019d soon forget and begin to pedal and sing again. I never saw a girl work harder to go to housekeeping right and well-prepared. Lovely table-linen the Harlings had given her, and Lena Lingard had sent her nice things from Lincoln. We hemstitched all the tablecloths and pillow-cases, and some of the sheets. Old Mrs. Shimerda knit yards and yards of lace for her underclothes. Tony told me just how she meant to have everything in her house. She\u2019d even bought silver spoons and forks, and kept them in her trunk. She was always coaxing brother to go to the post-office. Her young man did write her real often, from the different towns along his run. \u2018The first thing that troubled her was when he wrote that his run had been changed, and they would likely have to live in Denver. \u201cI\u2019m a country girl,\u201d she said, \u201cand I doubt if I\u2019ll be able to manage so well for him in a city. I was counting on keeping chickens, and maybe a cow.\u201d She soon cheered up, though.", " There it was, heroic in size, a picture writing on the sun. Even while we whispered about it, our vision disappeared; the ball dropped and dropped until the red tip went beneath the earth. The fields below us were dark, the sky was growing pale, and that forgotten plough had sunk back to its own littleness somewhere on the prairie. XV LATE IN AUGUST the Cutters went to Omaha for a few days, leaving Antonia in charge of the house. Since the scandal about the Swedish girl, Wick Cutter could never get his wife to stir out of Black Hawk without him. The day after the Cutters left, Antonia came over to see us. Grandmother noticed that she seemed troubled and distracted. \u2018You\u2019ve got something on your mind, Antonia,\u2019 she said anxiously. \u2018Yes, Mrs. Burden. I couldn\u2019t sleep much last night.\u2019 She hesitated, and then told us how strangely Mr. Cutter had behaved before he went away. He put all the silver in a basket and placed it under her bed, and with it a box of papers which he told her were valuable. He made her promise that she would not sleep away from the house, or be out late in the evening, while he was gone. He strictly forbade her to ask any of the girls she knew to stay with her at night. She would be perfectly safe, he said, as he had just put a new Yale lock on the front door. Cutter had been so insistent in regard to these details that now she felt uncomfortable about staying there alone."], "Where does Jim go to study law?": [" I went down across the fields, and Tony saw me from a long way off. She stood still by her shocks, leaning on her pitchfork, watching me as I came. We met like the people in the old song, in silence, if not in tears. Her warm hand clasped mine. \u2018I thought you\u2019d come, Jim. I heard you were at Mrs. Steavens\u2019s last night. I\u2019ve been looking for you all day.\u2019 She was thinner than I had ever seen her, and looked as Mrs. Steavens said, \u2018worked down,\u2019 but there was a new kind of strength in the gravity of her face, and her colour still gave her that look of deep-seated health and ardour. Still? Why, it flashed across me that though so much had happened in her life and in mine, she was barely twenty-four years old. Antonia stuck her fork in the ground, and instinctively we walked toward that unploughed patch at the crossing of the roads as the fittest place to talk to each other. We sat down outside the sagging wire fence that shut Mr. Shimerda\u2019s plot off from the rest of the world. The tall red grass had never been cut there. It had died down in winter and come up again in the spring until it was as thick and shrubby as some tropical garden-grass. I found myself telling her everything: why I had decided to study law and to go into the law office of one of my mother\u2019s relatives in New York City; about Gaston Cleric\u2019s death from pneumonia last winter, and the difference it had made in my life.", " \u2018This what you want?\u2019 he asked surlily. Jake jumped off his horse. I saw a wave of red come up under the rough stubble on his face. \u2018That ain\u2019t the piece of harness I loaned you, Ambrosch; or, if it is, you\u2019ve used it shameful. I ain\u2019t a-going to carry such a looking thing back to Mr. Burden.\u2019 Ambrosch dropped the collar on the ground. \u2018All right,\u2019 he said coolly, took up his oil-can, and began to climb the mill. Jake caught him by the belt of his trousers and yanked him back. Ambrosch\u2019s feet had scarcely touched the ground when he lunged out with a vicious kick at Jake\u2019s stomach. Fortunately, Jake was in such a position that he could dodge it. This was not the sort of thing country boys did when they played at fisticuffs, and Jake was furious. He landed Ambrosch a blow on the head--it sounded like the crack of an axe on a cow-pumpkin. Ambrosch dropped over, stunned. We heard squeals, and looking up saw Antonia and her mother coming on the run. They did not take the path around the pond, but plunged through the muddy water, without even lifting their skirts. They came on, screaming and clawing the air. By this time Ambrosch had come to his senses and was sputtering with nosebleed. Jake sprang into his saddle. \u2018Let\u2019s get out of this, Jim,\u2019 he called. Mrs. Shimerda threw her hands over her head and clutched as if she were going to pull down lightning. \u2018Law, law!\u2019 she shrieked after us.", " \u2018Law for knock my Ambrosch down!\u2019 \u2018I never like you no more, Jake and Jim Burden,\u2019 Antonia panted. \u2018No friends any more!\u2019 Jake stopped and turned his horse for a second. \u2018Well, you\u2019re a damned ungrateful lot, the whole pack of you,\u2019 he shouted back. \u2018I guess the Burdens can get along without you. You\u2019ve been a sight of trouble to them, anyhow!\u2019 We rode away, feeling so outraged that the fine morning was spoiled for us. I hadn\u2019t a word to say, and poor Jake was white as paper and trembling all over. It made him sick to get so angry. \u2018They ain\u2019t the same, Jimmy,\u2019 he kept saying in a hurt tone. \u2018These foreigners ain\u2019t the same. You can\u2019t trust \u2018em to be fair. It\u2019s dirty to kick a feller. You heard how the women turned on you--and after all we went through on account of \u2018em last winter! They ain\u2019t to be trusted. I don\u2019t want to see you get too thick with any of \u2018em.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ll never be friends with them again, Jake,\u2019 I declared hotly. \u2018I believe they are all like Krajiek and Ambrosch underneath.\u2019 Grandfather heard our story with a twinkle in his eye. He advised Jake to ride to town tomorrow, go to a justice of the peace, tell him he had knocked young Shimerda down, and pay his fine. Then if Mrs. Shimerda was inclined to make trouble--her son was still under age--she would be forestalled. Jake said he might as well take the wagon and haul to market the pig he had been fattening. On Monday, about an hour after Jake had started, we saw Mrs. Shimerda and her Ambrosch proudly driving by, looking neither to the right nor left.", " Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim. If you\u2019re going to be a preacher, I want you to marry me. You must promise to marry us all, and then baptize the babies.\u2019 Norwegian Anna, always dignified, looked at her reprovingly. \u2018Baptists don\u2019t believe in christening babies, do they, Jim?\u2019 I told her I didn\u2019t know what they believed, and didn\u2019t care, and that I certainly wasn\u2019t going to be a preacher. \u2018That\u2019s too bad,\u2019 Tiny simpered. She was in a teasing mood. \u2018You\u2019d make such a good one. You\u2019re so studious. Maybe you\u2019d like to be a professor. You used to teach Tony, didn\u2019t you?\u2019 Antonia broke in. \u2018I\u2019ve set my heart on Jim being a doctor. You\u2019d be good with sick people, Jim. Your grandmother\u2019s trained you up so nice. My papa always said you were an awful smart boy.\u2019 I said I was going to be whatever I pleased. \u2018Won\u2019t you be surprised, Miss Tiny, if I turn out to be a regular devil of a fellow?\u2019 They laughed until a glance from Norwegian Anna checked them; the high-school principal had just come into the front part of the shop to buy bread for supper. Anna knew the whisper was going about that I was a sly one. People said there must be something queer about a boy who showed no interest in girls of his own age, but who could be lively enough when he was with Tony and Lena or the three Marys. The enthusiasm for the dance, which the Vannis had kindled, did not at once die out."], "What do both \u00c1ntonia and Jim need to come to terms with in order to accept change?": [" You are going to let me come to see you, aren\u2019t you?\u2019 \u2018Would you like to? I\u2019d be ever so pleased. I\u2019m never busy after six o\u2019clock, and I let my sewing girls go at half-past five. I board, to save time, but sometimes I cook a chop for myself, and I\u2019d be glad to cook one for you. Well\u2019--she began to put on her white gloves--\u2018it\u2019s been awful good to see you, Jim.\u2019 \u2018You needn\u2019t hurry, need you? You\u2019ve hardly told me anything yet.\u2019 \u2018We can talk when you come to see me. I expect you don\u2019t often have lady visitors. The old woman downstairs didn\u2019t want to let me come up very much. I told her I was from your home town, and had promised your grandmother to come and see you. How surprised Mrs. Burden would be!\u2019 Lena laughed softly as she rose. When I caught up my hat, she shook her head. \u2018No, I don\u2019t want you to go with me. I\u2019m to meet some Swedes at the drugstore. You wouldn\u2019t care for them. I wanted to see your room so I could write Tony all about it, but I must tell her how I left you right here with your books. She\u2019s always so afraid someone will run off with you!\u2019 Lena slipped her silk sleeves into the jacket I held for her, smoothed it over her person, and buttoned it slowly. I walked with her to the door. \u2018Come and see me sometimes when you\u2019re lonesome. But maybe you have all the friends you want. Have you?\u2019 She turned her soft cheek to me. \u2018Have you?\u2019 she whispered teasingly in my ear.", " If I told my schoolmates that Lena Lingard\u2019s grandfather was a clergyman, and much respected in Norway, they looked at me blankly. What did it matter? All foreigners were ignorant people who couldn\u2019t speak English. There was not a man in Black Hawk who had the intelligence or cultivation, much less the personal distinction, of Antonia\u2019s father. Yet people saw no difference between her and the three Marys; they were all Bohemians, all \u2018hired girls.\u2019 I always knew I should live long enough to see my country girls come into their own, and I have. To-day the best that a harassed Black Hawk merchant can hope for is to sell provisions and farm machinery and automobiles to the rich farms where that first crop of stalwart Bohemian and Scandinavian girls are now the mistresses. The Black Hawk boys looked forward to marrying Black Hawk girls, and living in a brand-new little house with best chairs that must not be sat upon, and hand-painted china that must not be used. But sometimes a young fellow would look up from his ledger, or out through the grating of his father\u2019s bank, and let his eyes follow Lena Lingard, as she passed the window with her slow, undulating walk, or Tiny Soderball, tripping by in her short skirt and striped stockings. The country girls were considered a menace to the social order. Their beauty shone out too boldly against a conventional background. But anxious mothers need have felt no alarm.", " \u2018None of your smart speeches,\u2019 said Ambrosch severely. Leo poked out a supple red tongue at him, but a moment later broke into a giggle at a tintype of two men, uncomfortably seated, with an awkward-looking boy in baggy clothes standing between them: Jake and Otto and I! We had it taken, I remembered, when we went to Black Hawk on the first Fourth of July I spent in Nebraska. I was glad to see Jake\u2019s grin again, and Otto\u2019s ferocious moustaches. The young Cuzaks knew all about them. \u2018He made grandfather\u2019s coffin, didn\u2019t he?\u2019 Anton asked. \u2018Wasn\u2019t they good fellows, Jim?\u2019 Antonia\u2019s eyes filled. \u2018To this day I\u2019m ashamed because I quarrelled with Jake that way. I was saucy and impertinent to him, Leo, like you are with people sometimes, and I wish somebody had made me behave.\u2019 \u2018We aren\u2019t through with you, yet,\u2019 they warned me. They produced a photograph taken just before I went away to college: a tall youth in striped trousers and a straw hat, trying to look easy and jaunty. \u2018Tell us, Mr. Burden,\u2019 said Charley, \u2018about the rattler you killed at the dog-town. How long was he? Sometimes mother says six feet and sometimes she says five.\u2019 These children seemed to be upon very much the same terms with Antonia as the Harling children had been so many years before. They seemed to feel the same pride in her, and to look to her for stories and entertainment as we used to do. It was eleven o\u2019clock when I at last took my bag and some blankets and started for the barn with the boys.", " I liked to drop into his bar-room and listen to the talk. But one day he overtook me on the street and clapped me on the shoulder. \u2018Jim,\u2019 he said, \u2018I am good friends with you and I always like to see you. But you know how the church people think about saloons. Your grandpa has always treated me fine, and I don\u2019t like to have you come into my place, because I know he don\u2019t like it, and it puts me in bad with him.\u2019 So I was shut out of that. One could hang about the drugstore; and listen to the old men who sat there every evening, talking politics and telling raw stories. One could go to the cigar factory and chat with the old German who raised canaries for sale, and look at his stuffed birds. But whatever you began with him, the talk went back to taxidermy. There was the depot, of course; I often went down to see the night train come in, and afterward sat awhile with the disconsolate telegrapher who was always hoping to be transferred to Omaha or Denver, \u2018where there was some life.\u2019 He was sure to bring out his pictures of actresses and dancers. He got them with cigarette coupons, and nearly smoked himself to death to possess these desired forms and faces. For a change, one could talk to the station agent; but he was another malcontent; spent all his spare time writing letters to officials requesting a transfer. He wanted to get back to Wyoming where he could go trout-fishing on Sundays."], "Who stands in contrast to \u00c1ntonia as a successful woman in urban America?": [" It was like this: When Otto left Austria to come to America, he was asked by one of his relatives to look after a woman who was crossing on the same boat, to join her husband in Chicago. The woman started off with two children, but it was clear that her family might grow larger on the journey. Fuchs said he \u2018got on fine with the kids,\u2019 and liked the mother, though she played a sorry trick on him. In mid-ocean she proceeded to have not one baby, but three! This event made Fuchs the object of undeserved notoriety, since he was travelling with her. The steerage stewardess was indignant with him, the doctor regarded him with suspicion. The first-cabin passengers, who made up a purse for the woman, took an embarrassing interest in Otto, and often enquired of him about his charge. When the triplets were taken ashore at New York, he had, as he said, \u2018to carry some of them.\u2019 The trip to Chicago was even worse than the ocean voyage. On the train it was very difficult to get milk for the babies and to keep their bottles clean. The mother did her best, but no woman, out of her natural resources, could feed three babies. The husband, in Chicago, was working in a furniture factory for modest wages, and when he met his family at the station he was rather crushed by the size of it. He, too, seemed to consider Fuchs in some fashion to blame. \u2018I was sure glad,\u2019 Otto concluded, \u2018that he didn\u2019t take his hard feeling out on that poor woman; but he had a sullen eye for me, all right!", " In a moment I watched her fade down the dusky stairway. When I turned back to my room the place seemed much pleasanter than before. Lena had left something warm and friendly in the lamplight. How I loved to hear her laugh again! It was so soft and unexcited and appreciative gave a favourable interpretation to everything. When I closed my eyes I could hear them all laughing--the Danish laundry girls and the three Bohemian Marys. Lena had brought them all back to me. It came over me, as it had never done before, the relation between girls like those and the poetry of Virgil. If there were no girls like them in the world, there would be no poetry. I understood that clearly, for the first time. This revelation seemed to me inestimably precious. I clung to it as if it might suddenly vanish. As I sat down to my book at last, my old dream about Lena coming across the harvest-field in her short skirt seemed to me like the memory of an actual experience. It floated before me on the page like a picture, and underneath it stood the mournful line: \u2018Optima dies... prima fugit.\u2019 III IN LINCOLN THE BEST part of the theatrical season came late, when the good companies stopped off there for one-night stands, after their long runs in New York and Chicago. That spring Lena went with me to see Joseph Jefferson in \u2018Rip Van Winkle,\u2019 and to a war play called \u2018Shenandoah.\u2019 She was inflexible about paying for her own seat; said she was in business now, and she wouldn\u2019t have a schoolboy spending his money on her.", " He don\u2019t like this kawntree.\u2019 \u2018People who don\u2019t like this country ought to stay at home,\u2019 I said severely. \u2018We don\u2019t make them come here.\u2019 \u2018He not want to come, never!\u2019 she burst out. \u2018My mamenka make him come. All the time she say: \u201cAmerica big country; much money, much land for my boys, much husband for my girls.\u201d My papa, he cry for leave his old friends what make music with him. He love very much the man what play the long horn like this\u2019--she indicated a slide trombone. \u201cThey go to school together and are friends from boys. But my mama, she want Ambrosch for be rich, with many cattle.\u201d\u2019 \u2018Your mama,\u2019 I said angrily, \u2018wants other people\u2019s things.\u2019 \u201cYour grandfather is rich,\u201d she retorted fiercely. \u2018Why he not help my papa? Ambrosch be rich, too, after while, and he pay back. He is very smart boy. For Ambrosch my mama come here.\u2019 Ambrosch was considered the important person in the family. Mrs. Shimerda and Antonia always deferred to him, though he was often surly with them and contemptuous toward his father. Ambrosch and his mother had everything their own way. Though Antonia loved her father more than she did anyone else, she stood in awe of her elder brother. After I watched Antonia and her mother go over the hill on their miserable horse, carrying our iron pot with them, I turned to grandmother, who had taken up her darning, and said I hoped that snooping old woman wouldn\u2019t come to see us any more.", " I began to feel the loneliness of the farm-boy at evening, when the chores seem everlastingly the same, and the world so far away. What a tableful we were at supper: two long rows of restless heads in the lamplight, and so many eyes fastened excitedly upon Antonia as she sat at the head of the table, filling the plates and starting the dishes on their way. The children were seated according to a system; a little one next an older one, who was to watch over his behaviour and to see that he got his food. Anna and Yulka left their chairs from time to time to bring fresh plates of kolaches and pitchers of milk. After supper we went into the parlour, so that Yulka and Leo could play for me. Antonia went first, carrying the lamp. There were not nearly chairs enough to go round, so the younger children sat down on the bare floor. Little Lucie whispered to me that they were going to have a parlour carpet if they got ninety cents for their wheat. Leo, with a good deal of fussing, got out his violin. It was old Mr. Shimerda\u2019s instrument, which Antonia had always kept, and it was too big for him. But he played very well for a self-taught boy. Poor Yulka\u2019s efforts were not so successful. While they were playing, little Nina got up from her corner, came out into the middle of the floor, and began to do a pretty little dance on the boards with her bare feet. No one paid the least attention to her, and when she was through she stole back and sat down by her brother."], "At the end of the novel, how long has it been since Jim has visited Nebraska?": [" He wore the rings and pins and badges of different fraternal orders to which he belonged. Even his cuff-buttons were engraved with hieroglyphics, and he was more inscribed than an Egyptian obelisk. Once when he sat down to chat, he told us that in the immigrant car ahead there was a family from \u2018across the water\u2019 whose destination was the same as ours. \u2018They can\u2019t any of them speak English, except one little girl, and all she can say is \u201cWe go Black Hawk, Nebraska.\u201d She\u2019s not much older than you, twelve or thirteen, maybe, and she\u2019s as bright as a new dollar. Don\u2019t you want to go ahead and see her, Jimmy? She\u2019s got the pretty brown eyes, too!\u2019 This last remark made me bashful, and I shook my head and settled down to \u2018Jesse James.\u2019 Jake nodded at me approvingly and said you were likely to get diseases from foreigners. I do not remember crossing the Missouri River, or anything about the long day\u2019s journey through Nebraska. Probably by that time I had crossed so many rivers that I was dull to them. The only thing very noticeable about Nebraska was that it was still, all day long, Nebraska. I had been sleeping, curled up in a red plush seat, for a long while when we reached Black Hawk. Jake roused me and took me by the hand. We stumbled down from the train to a wooden siding, where men were running about with lanterns. I couldn\u2019t see any town, or even distant lights; we were surrounded by utter darkness.", " I seemed to have forgotten all my reasonable explanations. Lena drew close to me, and the little hesitation in her voice that had hurt me was not there when she spoke again. \u2018I oughtn\u2019t to have begun it, ought I?\u2019 she murmured. \u2018I oughtn\u2019t to have gone to see you that first time. But I did want to. I guess I\u2019ve always been a little foolish about you. I don\u2019t know what first put it into my head, unless it was Antonia, always telling me I mustn\u2019t be up to any of my nonsense with you. I let you alone for a long while, though, didn\u2019t I?\u2019 She was a sweet creature to those she loved, that Lena Lingard! At last she sent me away with her soft, slow, renunciatory kiss. \u2018You aren\u2019t sorry I came to see you that time?\u2019 she whispered. \u2018It seemed so natural. I used to think I\u2019d like to be your first sweetheart. You were such a funny kid!\u2019 She always kissed one as if she were sadly and wisely sending one away forever. We said many good-byes before I left Lincoln, but she never tried to hinder me or hold me back. \u2018You are going, but you haven\u2019t gone yet, have you?\u2019 she used to say. My Lincoln chapter closed abruptly. I went home to my grandparents for a few weeks, and afterward visited my relatives in Virginia until I joined Cleric in Boston. I was then nineteen years old. BOOK IV. The Pioneer Woman\u2019s Story I TWO YEARS AFTER I left Lincoln, I completed my academic course at Harvard. Before I entered the Law School I went home for the summer vacation.", " She was a buxom girl with dark hair and eyes, calm and self-possessed. \u2018Won\u2019t you come in? Mother will be here in a minute.\u2019 Before I could sit down in the chair she offered me, the miracle happened; one of those quiet moments that clutch the heart, and take more courage than the noisy, excited passages in life. Antonia came in and stood before me; a stalwart, brown woman, flat-chested, her curly brown hair a little grizzled. It was a shock, of course. It always is, to meet people after long years, especially if they have lived as much and as hard as this woman had. We stood looking at each other. The eyes that peered anxiously at me were--simply Antonia\u2019s eyes. I had seen no others like them since I looked into them last, though I had looked at so many thousands of human faces. As I confronted her, the changes grew less apparent to me, her identity stronger. She was there, in the full vigour of her personality, battered but not diminished, looking at me, speaking to me in the husky, breathy voice I remembered so well. \u2018My husband\u2019s not at home, sir. Can I do anything?\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t you remember me, Antonia? Have I changed so much?\u2019 She frowned into the slanting sunlight that made her brown hair look redder than it was. Suddenly her eyes widened, her whole face seemed to grow broader. She caught her breath and put out two hard-worked hands. \u2018Why, it\u2019s Jim! Anna, Yulka, it\u2019s Jim Burden!\u2019 She had no sooner caught my hands than she looked alarmed.", " \u2018You weren\u2019t a bad shot, Tony. Do you remember how you used to want to run away and go for ducks with Charley Harling and me?\u2019 \u2018I know, but I\u2019m afraid to look at a gun now.\u2019 She picked up one of the drakes and ruffled his green capote with her fingers. \u2018Ever since I\u2019ve had children, I don\u2019t like to kill anything. It makes me kind of faint to wring an old goose\u2019s neck. Ain\u2019t that strange, Jim?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know. The young Queen of Italy said the same thing once, to a friend of mine. She used to be a great huntswoman, but now she feels as you do, and only shoots clay pigeons.\u2019 \u2018Then I\u2019m sure she\u2019s a good mother,\u2019 Antonia said warmly. She told me how she and her husband had come out to this new country when the farm-land was cheap and could be had on easy payments. The first ten years were a hard struggle. Her husband knew very little about farming and often grew discouraged. \u2018We\u2019d never have got through if I hadn\u2019t been so strong. I\u2019ve always had good health, thank God, and I was able to help him in the fields until right up to the time before my babies came. Our children were good about taking care of each other. Martha, the one you saw when she was a baby, was such a help to me, and she trained Anna to be just like her. My Martha\u2019s married now, and has a baby of her own. Think of that, Jim! \u2018No, I never got down-hearted. Anton\u2019s a good man, and I loved my children and always believed they would turn out well."], "Upon returning, what about Black Hawk disappoints Jim?": [" If I told my schoolmates that Lena Lingard\u2019s grandfather was a clergyman, and much respected in Norway, they looked at me blankly.

But anxious mothers need have felt no alarm.", " During that burning day when we were crossing Iowa, our talk kept returning to a central figure, a Bohemian girl whom we had known long ago and whom both of us admired. More than any other person we remembered, this girl seemed to mean to us the country, the conditions, the whole adventure of our childhood. To speak her name was to call up pictures of people and places, to set a quiet drama going in one\u2019s brain. I had lost sight of her altogether, but Jim had found her again after long years, had renewed a friendship that meant a great deal to him, and out of his busy life had set apart time enough to enjoy that friendship. His mind was full of her that day. He made me see her again, feel her presence, revived all my old affection for her. \u201cI can\u2019t see,\u201d he said impetuously, \u201cwhy you have never written anything about Antonia.\u201d I told him I had always felt that other people--he himself, for one knew her much better than I. I was ready, however, to make an agreement with him; I would set down on paper all that I remembered of Antonia if he would do the same. We might, in this way, get a picture of her. He rumpled his hair with a quick, excited gesture, which with him often announces a new determination, and I could see that my suggestion took hold of him. \u201cMaybe I will, maybe I will!\u201d he declared. He stared out of the window for a few moments, and when he turned to me again his eyes had the sudden clearness that comes from something the mind itself sees.", " All about us we could hear the felty beat of the raindrops on the soft dust of the farmyard. Grandmother came to the door and said it was late, and we would get wet out there. \u2018In a minute we come,\u2019 Antonia called back to her. \u2018I like your grandmother, and all things here,\u2019 she sighed. \u2018I wish my papa live to see this summer. I wish no winter ever come again.\u2019 \u2018It will be summer a long while yet,\u2019 I reassured her. \u2018Why aren\u2019t you always nice like this, Tony?\u2019 \u2018How nice?\u2019 \u2018Why, just like this; like yourself. Why do you all the time try to be like Ambrosch?\u2019 She put her arms under her head and lay back, looking up at the sky. \u2018If I live here, like you, that is different. Things will be easy for you. But they will be hard for us.\u2019 BOOK II. The Hired Girls I I HAD BEEN LIVING with my grandfather for nearly three years when he decided to move to Black Hawk. He and grandmother were getting old for the heavy work of a farm, and as I was now thirteen they thought I ought to be going to school. Accordingly our homestead was rented to \u2018that good woman, the Widow Steavens,\u2019 and her bachelor brother, and we bought Preacher White\u2019s house, at the north end of Black Hawk. This was the first town house one passed driving in from the farm, a landmark which told country people their long ride was over. We were to move to Black Hawk in March, and as soon as grandfather had fixed the date he let Jake and Otto know of his intention.", " I didn\u2019t believe you could do as well as that. You didn\u2019t get that speech out of books.\u2019 Among my graduation presents there was a silk umbrella from Mrs. Harling, with my name on the handle. I walked home from the Opera House alone. As I passed the Methodist Church, I saw three white figures ahead of me, pacing up and down under the arching maple trees, where the moonlight filtered through the lush June foliage. They hurried toward me; they were waiting for me--Lena and Tony and Anna Hansen. \u2018Oh, Jim, it was splendid!\u2019 Tony was breathing hard, as she always did when her feelings outran her language. \u2018There ain\u2019t a lawyer in Black Hawk could make a speech like that. I just stopped your grandpa and said so to him. He won\u2019t tell you, but he told us he was awful surprised himself, didn\u2019t he, girls?\u2019 Lena sidled up to me and said teasingly, \u2018What made you so solemn? I thought you were scared. I was sure you\u2019d forget.\u2019 Anna spoke wistfully. \u2018It must make you very happy, Jim, to have fine thoughts like that in your mind all the time, and to have words to put them in. I always wanted to go to school, you know.\u2019 \u2018Oh, I just sat there and wished my papa could hear you! Jim\u2019--Antonia took hold of my coat lapels--\u2018there was something in your speech that made me think so about my papa!\u2019 \u2018I thought about your papa when I wrote my speech, Tony,\u2019 I said. \u2018I dedicated it to him.\u2019 She threw her arms around me, and her dear face was all wet with tears."], "Why is \u00c1ntonia initially unable to recognize Jim?": [" I hurried to the door and when I opened it saw a woman standing in the dark hall. \u2018I expect you hardly know me, Jim.\u2019 The voice seemed familiar, but I did not recognize her until she stepped into the light of my doorway and I beheld--Lena Lingard! She was so quietly conventionalized by city clothes that I might have passed her on the street without seeing her. Her black suit fitted her figure smoothly, and a black lace hat, with pale-blue forget-me-nots, sat demurely on her yellow hair. I led her toward Cleric\u2019s chair, the only comfortable one I had, questioning her confusedly. She was not disconcerted by my embarrassment. She looked about her with the naive curiosity I remembered so well. \u2018You are quite comfortable here, aren\u2019t you? I live in Lincoln now, too, Jim. I\u2019m in business for myself. I have a dressmaking shop in the Raleigh Block, out on O Street. I\u2019ve made a real good start.\u2019 \u2018But, Lena, when did you come?\u2019 \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve been here all winter. Didn\u2019t your grandmother ever write you? I\u2019ve thought about looking you up lots of times. But we\u2019ve all heard what a studious young man you\u2019ve got to be, and I felt bashful. I didn\u2019t know whether you\u2019d be glad to see me.\u2019 She laughed her mellow, easy laugh, that was either very artless or very comprehending, one never quite knew which. \u2018You seem the same, though--except you\u2019re a young man, now, of course. Do you think I\u2019ve changed?\u2019 \u2018Maybe you\u2019re prettier--though you were always pretty enough.", " He had probably lived there for years, with a fat prairie-dog for breakfast whenever he felt like it, a sheltered home, even an owl-feather bed, perhaps, and he had forgot that the world doesn\u2019t owe rattlers a living. A snake of his size, in fighting trim, would be more than any boy could handle. So in reality it was a mock adventure; the game was fixed for me by chance, as it probably was for many a dragon-slayer. I had been adequately armed by Russian Peter; the snake was old and lazy; and I had Antonia beside me, to appreciate and admire. That snake hung on our corral fence for several days; some of the neighbours came to see it and agreed that it was the biggest rattler ever killed in those parts. This was enough for Antonia. She liked me better from that time on, and she never took a supercilious air with me again. I had killed a big snake--I was now a big fellow. VIII WHILE THE AUTUMN COLOUR was growing pale on the grass and cornfields, things went badly with our friends the Russians. Peter told his troubles to Mr. Shimerda: he was unable to meet a note which fell due on the first of November; had to pay an exorbitant bonus on renewing it, and to give a mortgage on his pigs and horses and even his milk cow. His creditor was Wick Cutter, the merciless Black Hawk money-lender, a man of evil name throughout the county, of whom I shall have more to say later. Peter could give no very clear account of his transactions with Cutter.", " Won\u2019t he look funny, girls?\u2019 Lena laughed. \u2018You\u2019ll have to hurry up, Jim. If you\u2019re going to be a preacher, I want you to marry me. You must promise to marry us all, and then baptize the babies.\u2019 Norwegian Anna, always dignified, looked at her reprovingly. \u2018Baptists don\u2019t believe in christening babies, do they, Jim?\u2019 I told her I didn\u2019t know what they believed, and didn\u2019t care, and that I certainly wasn\u2019t going to be a preacher. \u2018That\u2019s too bad,\u2019 Tiny simpered. She was in a teasing mood. \u2018You\u2019d make such a good one. You\u2019re so studious. Maybe you\u2019d like to be a professor. You used to teach Tony, didn\u2019t you?\u2019 Antonia broke in. \u2018I\u2019ve set my heart on Jim being a doctor. You\u2019d be good with sick people, Jim. Your grandmother\u2019s trained you up so nice. My papa always said you were an awful smart boy.\u2019 I said I was going to be whatever I pleased. \u2018Won\u2019t you be surprised, Miss Tiny, if I turn out to be a regular devil of a fellow?\u2019 They laughed until a glance from Norwegian Anna checked them; the high-school principal had just come into the front part of the shop to buy bread for supper. Anna knew the whisper was going about that I was a sly one. People said there must be something queer about a boy who showed no interest in girls of his own age, but who could be lively enough when he was with Tony and Lena or the three Marys. The enthusiasm for the dance, which the Vannis had kindled, did not at once die out.", " \u2018In a town of that size Lena would always be gossiped about. Frisco\u2019s the right field for her. She has a fine class of trade. Oh, she\u2019s just the same as she always was! She\u2019s careless, but she\u2019s level-headed. She\u2019s the only person I know who never gets any older. It\u2019s fine for me to have her there; somebody who enjoys things like that. She keeps an eye on me and won\u2019t let me be shabby.

He was a dapper little Irishman, very vain, homely as a monkey, with friends everywhere, and a sweetheart in every port, like a sailor. I did not know all the men who were sitting about, but I recognized a furniture salesman from Kansas City, a drug man, and Willy O\u2019Reilly, who travelled for a jewellery house and sold musical instruments. The talk was all about good and bad hotels, actors and actresses and musical prodigies. I learned that Mrs. Gardener had gone to Omaha to hear Booth and Barrett, who were to play there next week, and that Mary Anderson was having a great success in \u2018A Winter\u2019s Tale,\u2019 in London. The door from the office opened, and Johnnie Gardener came in, directing Blind d\u2019Arnault--he would never consent to be led. He was a heavy, bulky mulatto, on short legs, and he came tapping the floor in front of him with his gold-headed cane. His yellow face was lifted in the light, with a show of white teeth, all grinning, and his shrunken, papery eyelids lay motionless over his blind eyes. \u2018Good evening, gentlemen. No ladies here? Good evening, gentlemen. We going to have a little music? Some of you gentlemen going to play for me this evening?\u2019 It was the soft, amiable Negro voice, like those I remembered from early childhood, with the note of docile subservience in it.", " *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MY ANTONIA *** Produced by Judith Boss, and Martin Robb MY ANTONIA By Willa Cather CONTENTS Introduction BOOK I.

Cuzak\u2019s Boys TO CARRIE AND IRENE MINER In memory of affections old and true Optima dies... prima fugit VIRGIL INTRODUCTION LAST summer I happened to be crossing the plains of Iowa in a season of intense heat, and it was my good fortune to have for a traveling companion James Quayle Burden--Jim Burden, as we still call him in the West. He and I are old friends--we grew up together in the same Nebraska town--and we had much to say to each other. While the train flashed through never-ending miles of ripe wheat, by country towns and bright-flowered pastures and oak groves wilting in the sun, we sat in the observation car, where the woodwork was hot to the touch and red dust lay deep over everything. The dust and heat, the burning wind, reminded us of many things. We were talking about what it is like to spend one\u2019s childhood in little towns like these, buried in wheat and corn, under stimulating extremes of climate: burning summers when the world lies green and billowy beneath a brilliant sky, when one is fairly stifled in vegetation, in the color and smell of strong weeds and heavy harvests; blustery winters with little snow, when the whole country is stripped bare and gray as sheet-iron."], "What does Jim claim him and \u00c1ntonia hold in common?": [" The poor fellow thought it great good fortune to be cared for by a woman, and a woman who spoke his own tongue. When he was told that his feet must be amputated, he said he hoped he would not get well; what could a working-man do in this hard world without feet? He did, in fact, die from the operation, but not before he had deeded Tiny Soderball his claim on Hunker Creek. Tiny sold her hotel, invested half her money in Dawson building lots, and with the rest she developed her claim. She went off into the wilds and lived on the claim. She bought other claims from discouraged miners, traded or sold them on percentages. After nearly ten years in the Klondike, Tiny returned, with a considerable fortune, to live in San Francisco. I met her in Salt Lake City in 1908. She was a thin, hard-faced woman, very well-dressed, very reserved in manner. Curiously enough, she reminded me of Mrs. Gardener, for whom she had worked in Black Hawk so long ago. She told me about some of the desperate chances she had taken in the gold country, but the thrill of them was quite gone. She said frankly that nothing interested her much now but making money. The only two human beings of whom she spoke with any feeling were the Swede, Johnson, who had given her his claim, and Lena Lingard. She had persuaded Lena to come to San Francisco and go into business there. \u2018Lincoln was never any place for her,\u2019 Tiny remarked.", " I didn\u2019t believe you could do as well as that. You didn\u2019t get that speech out of books.\u2019 Among my graduation presents there was a silk umbrella from Mrs. Harling, with my name on the handle. I walked home from the Opera House alone.

I had not been mistaken. She was a battered woman now, not a lovely girl; but she still had that something which fires the imagination, could still stop one\u2019s breath for a moment by a look or gesture that somehow revealed the meaning in common things. She had only to stand in the orchard, to put her hand on a little crab tree and look up at the apples, to make you feel the goodness of planting and tending and harvesting at last. All the strong things of her heart came out in her body, that had been so tireless in serving generous emotions. It was no wonder that her sons stood tall and straight. She was a rich mine of life, like the founders of early races. II WHEN I AWOKE IN THE morning, long bands of sunshine were coming in at the window and reaching back under the eaves where the two boys lay. Leo was wide awake and was tickling his brother\u2019s leg with a dried cone-flower he had pulled out of the hay. Ambrosch kicked at him and turned over. I closed my eyes and pretended to be asleep. Leo lay on his back, elevated one foot, and began exercising his toes. He picked up dried flowers with his toes and brandished them in the belt of sunlight. After he had amused himself thus for some time, he rose on one elbow and began to look at me, cautiously, then critically, blinking his eyes in the light.", " \u2018In a town of that size Lena would always be gossiped about.
