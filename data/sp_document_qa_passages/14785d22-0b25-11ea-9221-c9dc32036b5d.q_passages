{"From what is theCaterpillar in Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland smoking?": [" *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ALICE\u2019S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND *** ALICE\u2019S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND Lewis Carroll THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 3.0 CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, \u2018and what is the use of a book,\u2019 thought Alice \u2018without pictures or conversations?\u2019 So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \u2018Oh dear!", " \u2018Of course not,\u2019 said the Mock Turtle: \u2018why, if a fish came to ME, and told me he was going a journey, I should say \u201cWith what porpoise?\u201d\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t you mean \u201cpurpose\u201d?\u2019 said Alice. \u2018I mean what I say,\u2019 the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And the Gryphon added \u2018Come, let\u2019s hear some of YOUR adventures.\u2019 \u2018I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,\u2019 said Alice a little timidly: \u2018but it\u2019s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.\u2019 \u2018Explain all that,\u2019 said the Mock Turtle. \u2018No, no! The adventures first,\u2019 said the Gryphon in an impatient tone: \u2018explanations take such a dreadful time.\u2019 So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she went on.", " \u2018Wake up, Alice dear!\u2019 said her sister; \u2018Why, what a long sleep you\u2019ve had!\u2019 \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve had such a curious dream!\u2019 said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, \u2018It WAS a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it\u2019s getting late.\u2019 So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been. But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:-- First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister\u2019s dream.", " \u2018But I\u2019m not used to it!\u2019 pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she thought of herself, \u2018I wish the creatures wouldn\u2019t be so easily offended!\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ll get used to it in time,\u2019 said the Caterpillar; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again. This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went, \u2018One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.\u2019 \u2018One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?\u2019 thought Alice to herself. \u2018Of the mushroom,\u2019 said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight. Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question."], "Which characterdoes Alice scare away with talk of her cat Dinah?": [" \u2018You\u2019re enough to try the patience of an oyster!\u2019 \u2018I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!\u2019 said Alice aloud, addressing nobody in particular. \u2018She\u2019d soon fetch it back!\u2019 \u2018And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?\u2019 said the Lory. Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet: \u2018Dinah\u2019s our cat. And she\u2019s such a capital one for catching mice you can\u2019t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why, she\u2019ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!\u2019 This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, \u2018I really must be getting home; the night-air doesn\u2019t suit my throat!\u2019 and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children, \u2018Come away, my dears! It\u2019s high time you were all in bed!\u2019 On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.", " \u2018Not at all,\u2019 said Alice: \u2018she\u2019s so extremely--\u2019 Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on, \u2018--likely to win, that it\u2019s hardly worth while finishing the game.\u2019 The Queen smiled and passed on. \u2018Who ARE you talking to?\u2019 said the King, going up to Alice, and looking at the Cat\u2019s head with great curiosity. \u2018It\u2019s a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,\u2019 said Alice: \u2018allow me to introduce it.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t like the look of it at all,\u2019 said the King: \u2018however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019d rather not,\u2019 the Cat remarked. \u2018Don\u2019t be impertinent,\u2019 said the King, \u2018and don\u2019t look at me like that!\u2019 He got behind Alice as he spoke. \u2018A cat may look at a king,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018I\u2019ve read that in some book, but I don\u2019t remember where.\u2019 \u2018Well, it must be removed,\u2019 said the King very decidedly, and he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, \u2018My dear! I wish you would have this cat removed!\u2019 The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.", " The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect. \u2018Cheshire Puss,\u2019 she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider. \u2018Come, it\u2019s pleased so far,\u2019 thought Alice, and she went on. \u2018Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?\u2019 \u2018That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,\u2019 said the Cat. \u2018I don\u2019t much care where--\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Then it doesn\u2019t matter which way you go,\u2019 said the Cat. \u2018--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,\u2019 Alice added as an explanation. \u2018Oh, you\u2019re sure to do that,\u2019 said the Cat, \u2018if you only walk long enough.\u2019 Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question. \u2018What sort of people live about here?\u2019 \u2018In THAT direction,\u2019 the Cat said, waving its right paw round, \u2018lives a Hatter: and in THAT direction,\u2019 waving the other paw, \u2018lives a March Hare.", " Visit either you like: they\u2019re both mad.\u2019 \u2018But I don\u2019t want to go among mad people,\u2019 Alice remarked. \u2018Oh, you can\u2019t help that,\u2019 said the Cat: \u2018we\u2019re all mad here. I\u2019m mad. You\u2019re mad.\u2019 \u2018How do you know I\u2019m mad?\u2019 said Alice. \u2018You must be,\u2019 said the Cat, \u2018or you wouldn\u2019t have come here.\u2019 Alice didn\u2019t think that proved it at all; however, she went on \u2018And how do you know that you\u2019re mad?\u2019 \u2018To begin with,\u2019 said the Cat, \u2018a dog\u2019s not mad. You grant that?\u2019 \u2018I suppose so,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Well, then,\u2019 the Cat went on, \u2018you see, a dog growls when it\u2019s angry, and wags its tail when it\u2019s pleased. Now I growl when I\u2019m pleased, and wag my tail when I\u2019m angry. Therefore I\u2019m mad.\u2019 \u2018I call it purring, not growling,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Call it what you like,\u2019 said the Cat. \u2018Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?\u2019 \u2018I should like it very much,\u2019 said Alice, \u2018but I haven\u2019t been invited yet.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ll see me there,\u2019 said the Cat, and vanished."], "In Alice\u2019sAdventures in Wonderland, which character serves as heraldto the King and Queen of Hearts?": [" After these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King\u2019s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS. Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions; \u2018and besides, what would be the use of a procession,\u2019 thought she, \u2018if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn\u2019t see it?\u2019 So she stood still where she was, and waited.", " \u2018Not at all,\u2019 said Alice: \u2018she\u2019s so extremely--\u2019 Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on, \u2018--likely to win, that it\u2019s hardly worth while finishing the game.\u2019 The Queen smiled and passed on. \u2018Who ARE you talking to?\u2019 said the King, going up to Alice, and looking at the Cat\u2019s head with great curiosity. \u2018It\u2019s a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,\u2019 said Alice: \u2018allow me to introduce it.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t like the look of it at all,\u2019 said the King: \u2018however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019d rather not,\u2019 the Cat remarked. \u2018Don\u2019t be impertinent,\u2019 said the King, \u2018and don\u2019t look at me like that!\u2019 He got behind Alice as he spoke. \u2018A cat may look at a king,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018I\u2019ve read that in some book, but I don\u2019t remember where.\u2019 \u2018Well, it must be removed,\u2019 said the King very decidedly, and he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, \u2018My dear! I wish you would have this cat removed!\u2019 The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.", " Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down \u2018stupid things!\u2019 on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them didn\u2019t know how to spell \u2018stupid,\u2019 and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. \u2018A nice muddle their slates\u2019ll be in before the trial\u2019s over!\u2019 thought Alice. One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate. \u2018Herald, read the accusation!\u2019 said the King. On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:-- \u2018The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts, All on a summer day: The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts, And took them quite away!\u2019 \u2018Consider your verdict,\u2019 the King said to the jury.", " Off--\u2019 \u2018Nonsense!\u2019 said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent. The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said \u2018Consider, my dear: she is only a child!\u2019 The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave \u2018Turn them over!\u2019 The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot. \u2018Get up!\u2019 said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else. \u2018Leave off that!\u2019 screamed the Queen. \u2018You make me giddy.\u2019 And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, \u2018What HAVE you been doing here?\u2019 \u2018May it please your Majesty,\u2019 said Two, in a very humble tone, going down on one knee as he spoke, \u2018we were trying--\u2019 \u2018I see!\u2019 said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses. \u2018Off with their heads!\u2019 and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection."], "Which characterseems to have a fondness for treacle?": [" \u2018Treacle,\u2019 said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time. \u2018I want a clean cup,\u2019 interrupted the Hatter: \u2018let\u2019s all move one place on.\u2019 He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare moved into the Dormouse\u2019s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate. Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very cautiously: \u2018But I don\u2019t understand. Where did they draw the treacle from?\u2019 \u2018You can draw water out of a water-well,\u2019 said the Hatter; \u2018so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?\u2019 \u2018But they were IN the well,\u2019 Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to notice this last remark. \u2018Of course they were\u2019, said the Dormouse; \u2018--well in.\u2019 This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it.", " \u2018Who\u2019s making personal remarks now?\u2019 the Hatter asked triumphantly. Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and repeated her question. \u2018Why did they live at the bottom of a well?\u2019 The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then said, \u2018It was a treacle-well.\u2019 \u2018There\u2019s no such thing!\u2019 Alice was beginning very angrily, but the Hatter and the March Hare went \u2018Sh! sh!\u2019 and the Dormouse sulkily remarked, \u2018If you can\u2019t be civil, you\u2019d better finish the story for yourself.\u2019 \u2018No, please go on!\u2019 Alice said very humbly; \u2018I won\u2019t interrupt again. I dare say there may be ONE.\u2019 \u2018One, indeed!\u2019 said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to go on. \u2018And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw, you know--\u2019 \u2018What did they draw?\u2019 said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.", " \u2018Yes, please do!\u2019 pleaded Alice. \u2018And be quick about it,\u2019 added the Hatter, \u2018or you\u2019ll be asleep again before it\u2019s done.\u2019 \u2018Once upon a time there were three little sisters,\u2019 the Dormouse began in a great hurry; \u2018and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--\u2019 \u2018What did they live on?\u2019 said Alice, who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking. \u2018They lived on treacle,\u2019 said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or two. \u2018They couldn\u2019t have done that, you know,\u2019 Alice gently remarked; \u2018they\u2019d have been ill.\u2019 \u2018So they were,\u2019 said the Dormouse; \u2018VERY ill.\u2019 Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: \u2018But why did they live at the bottom of a well?\u2019 \u2018Take some more tea,\u2019 the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly. \u2018I\u2019ve had nothing yet,\u2019 Alice replied in an offended tone, \u2018so I can\u2019t take more.\u2019 \u2018You mean you can\u2019t take LESS,\u2019 said the Hatter: \u2018it\u2019s very easy to take MORE than nothing.\u2019 \u2018Nobody asked YOUR opinion,\u2019 said Alice.", " \u2018Treacle,\u2019 said a sleepy voice behind her. \u2018Collar that Dormouse,\u2019 the Queen shrieked out. \u2018Behead that Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his whiskers!\u2019 For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared. \u2018Never mind!\u2019 said the King, with an air of great relief. \u2018Call the next witness.\u2019 And he added in an undertone to the Queen, \u2018Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead ache!\u2019 Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like, \u2018--for they haven\u2019t got much evidence YET,\u2019 she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name \u2018Alice!\u2019 CHAPTER XII. Alice\u2019s Evidence \u2018Here!\u2019 cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before."], "Who has condemnedthe Mad Hatter to perpetual teatime?": [" Visit either you like: they\u2019re both mad.\u2019 \u2018But I don\u2019t want to go among mad people,\u2019 Alice remarked. \u2018Oh, you can\u2019t help that,\u2019 said the Cat: \u2018we\u2019re all mad here. I\u2019m mad. You\u2019re mad.\u2019 \u2018How do you know I\u2019m mad?\u2019 said Alice. \u2018You must be,\u2019 said the Cat, \u2018or you wouldn\u2019t have come here.\u2019 Alice didn\u2019t think that proved it at all; however, she went on \u2018And how do you know that you\u2019re mad?\u2019 \u2018To begin with,\u2019 said the Cat, \u2018a dog\u2019s not mad. You grant that?\u2019 \u2018I suppose so,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Well, then,\u2019 the Cat went on, \u2018you see, a dog growls when it\u2019s angry, and wags its tail when it\u2019s pleased. Now I growl when I\u2019m pleased, and wag my tail when I\u2019m angry. Therefore I\u2019m mad.\u2019 \u2018I call it purring, not growling,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Call it what you like,\u2019 said the Cat. \u2018Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?\u2019 \u2018I should like it very much,\u2019 said Alice, \u2018but I haven\u2019t been invited yet.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ll see me there,\u2019 said the Cat, and vanished.", " \u2018It began with the tea,\u2019 the Hatter replied. \u2018Of course twinkling begins with a T!\u2019 said the King sharply. \u2018Do you take me for a dunce? Go on!\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m a poor man,\u2019 the Hatter went on, \u2018and most things twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--\u2019 \u2018I didn\u2019t!\u2019 the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry. \u2018You did!\u2019 said the Hatter. \u2018I deny it!\u2019 said the March Hare. \u2018He denies it,\u2019 said the King: \u2018leave out that part.\u2019 \u2018Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--\u2019 the Hatter went on, looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep. \u2018After that,\u2019 continued the Hatter, \u2018I cut some more bread-and-butter--\u2019 \u2018But what did the Dormouse say?\u2019 one of the jury asked. \u2018That I can\u2019t remember,\u2019 said the Hatter. \u2018You MUST remember,\u2019 remarked the King, \u2018or I\u2019ll have you executed.\u2019 The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went down on one knee.", " Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter\u2019s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. \u2018I don\u2019t quite understand you,\u2019 she said, as politely as she could. \u2018The Dormouse is asleep again,\u2019 said the Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose. The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its eyes, \u2018Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.\u2019 \u2018Have you guessed the riddle yet?\u2019 the Hatter said, turning to Alice again. \u2018No, I give it up,\u2019 Alice replied: \u2018what\u2019s the answer?\u2019 \u2018I haven\u2019t the slightest idea,\u2019 said the Hatter. \u2018Nor I,\u2019 said the March Hare. Alice sighed wearily. \u2018I think you might do something better with the time,\u2019 she said, \u2018than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.\u2019 \u2018If you knew Time as well as I do,\u2019 said the Hatter, \u2018you wouldn\u2019t talk about wasting IT. It\u2019s HIM.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know what you mean,\u2019 said Alice.", " \u2018Take off your hat,\u2019 the King said to the Hatter. \u2018It isn\u2019t mine,\u2019 said the Hatter. \u2018Stolen!\u2019 the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a memorandum of the fact. \u2018I keep them to sell,\u2019 the Hatter added as an explanation; \u2018I\u2019ve none of my own. I\u2019m a hatter.\u2019 Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted. \u2018Give your evidence,\u2019 said the King; \u2018and don\u2019t be nervous, or I\u2019ll have you executed on the spot.\u2019 This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter. Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her."], "How does Aliceget to the great hallway lined with doors a second time?": [" Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice\u2019s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted! Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; \u2018and even if my head would go through,\u2019 thought poor Alice, \u2018it would be of very little use without my shoulders.", " \u2018The first thing I\u2019ve got to do,\u2019 said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, \u2018is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan.\u2019 It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry. An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. \u2018Poor little thing!\u2019 said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing. Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.", " She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, \u2018Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\u2019 when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over. Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, \u2018Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it\u2019s getting!\u2019 She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof. There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.", " \u2018Of course you don\u2019t!\u2019 the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously. \u2018I dare say you never even spoke to Time!\u2019 \u2018Perhaps not,\u2019 Alice cautiously replied: \u2018but I know I have to beat time when I learn music.\u2019 \u2018Ah! that accounts for it,\u2019 said the Hatter. \u2018He won\u2019t stand beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he\u2019d do almost anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o\u2019clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons: you\u2019d only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!\u2019 [\u2018I only wish it was,\u2019 the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.) \u2018That would be grand, certainly,\u2019 said Alice thoughtfully: \u2018but then--I shouldn\u2019t be hungry for it, you know.\u2019 \u2018Not at first, perhaps,\u2019 said the Hatter: \u2018but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked.\u2019 \u2018Is that the way YOU manage?\u2019 Alice asked."], "Which of the followingcharacters is friendliest to Alice during her adventures?": [" \u2018Of course not,\u2019 said the Mock Turtle: \u2018why, if a fish came to ME, and told me he was going a journey, I should say \u201cWith what porpoise?\u201d\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t you mean \u201cpurpose\u201d?\u2019 said Alice. \u2018I mean what I say,\u2019 the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And the Gryphon added \u2018Come, let\u2019s hear some of YOUR adventures.\u2019 \u2018I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,\u2019 said Alice a little timidly: \u2018but it\u2019s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.\u2019 \u2018Explain all that,\u2019 said the Mock Turtle. \u2018No, no! The adventures first,\u2019 said the Gryphon in an impatient tone: \u2018explanations take such a dreadful time.\u2019 So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she went on.", " *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ALICE\u2019S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND *** ALICE\u2019S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND Lewis Carroll THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 3.0 CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, \u2018and what is the use of a book,\u2019 thought Alice \u2018without pictures or conversations?\u2019 So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \u2018Oh dear!", " \u2018Wake up, Alice dear!\u2019 said her sister; \u2018Why, what a long sleep you\u2019ve had!\u2019 \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve had such a curious dream!\u2019 said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, \u2018It WAS a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it\u2019s getting late.\u2019 So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been. But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:-- First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister\u2019s dream.", " \u2018Yes, please do!\u2019 pleaded Alice. \u2018And be quick about it,\u2019 added the Hatter, \u2018or you\u2019ll be asleep again before it\u2019s done.\u2019 \u2018Once upon a time there were three little sisters,\u2019 the Dormouse began in a great hurry; \u2018and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--\u2019 \u2018What did they live on?\u2019 said Alice, who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking. \u2018They lived on treacle,\u2019 said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or two. \u2018They couldn\u2019t have done that, you know,\u2019 Alice gently remarked; \u2018they\u2019d have been ill.\u2019 \u2018So they were,\u2019 said the Dormouse; \u2018VERY ill.\u2019 Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: \u2018But why did they live at the bottom of a well?\u2019 \u2018Take some more tea,\u2019 the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly. \u2018I\u2019ve had nothing yet,\u2019 Alice replied in an offended tone, \u2018so I can\u2019t take more.\u2019 \u2018You mean you can\u2019t take LESS,\u2019 said the Hatter: \u2018it\u2019s very easy to take MORE than nothing.\u2019 \u2018Nobody asked YOUR opinion,\u2019 said Alice."], "In what capacitydoes Alice enter the chess game in Through the Looking-Glass?": [" \u2018Off with his head!\u2019 she said, without even looking round. \u2018I\u2019ll fetch the executioner myself,\u2019 said the King eagerly, and he hurried off. Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, as she heard the Queen\u2019s voice in the distance, screaming with passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog. The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree. By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: \u2018but it doesn\u2019t matter much,\u2019 thought Alice, \u2018as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground.\u2019 So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend.", " After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried. \u2018Come, there\u2019s no use in crying like that!\u2019 said Alice to herself, rather sharply; \u2018I advise you to leave off this minute!\u2019 She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.", " \u2018I wish I hadn\u2019t mentioned Dinah!\u2019 she said to herself in a melancholy tone. \u2018Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!\u2019 And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story. CHAPTER IV. The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself \u2018The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She\u2019ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?\u2019 Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.", " Alice heard it say to itself \u2018Then I\u2019ll go round and get in at the window.\u2019 \u2018THAT you won\u2019t\u2019 thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort. Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit\u2019s--\u2018Pat! Pat! Where are you?\u2019 And then a voice she had never heard before, \u2018Sure then I\u2019m here! Digging for apples, yer honour!\u2019 \u2018Digging for apples, indeed!\u2019 said the Rabbit angrily. \u2018Here! Come and help me out of THIS!\u2019 (Sounds of more broken glass.) \u2018Now tell me, Pat, what\u2019s that in the window?\u2019 \u2018Sure, it\u2019s an arm, yer honour!\u2019 (He pronounced it \u2018arrum.\u2019) \u2018An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size?"], "Which animalis not a character in either novel?": [" \u2018It proves nothing of the sort!\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Why, you don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re about!\u2019 \u2018Read them,\u2019 said the King. The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. \u2018Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?\u2019 he asked. \u2018Begin at the beginning,\u2019 the King said gravely, \u2018and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\u2019 These were the verses the White Rabbit read:-- \u2018They told me you had been to her, And mentioned me to him: She gave me a good character, But said I could not swim. He sent them word I had not gone (We know it to be true): If she should push the matter on, What would become of you? I gave her one, they gave him two, You gave us three or more; They all returned from him to you, Though they were mine before. If I or she should chance to be Involved in this affair, He trusts to you to set them free, Exactly as we were. My notion was that you had been (Before she had this fit) An obstacle that came between Him, and ourselves, and it.", " Oh dear! I shall be late!\u2019 (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge. In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again. The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.", " Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled \u2018ORANGE MARMALADE\u2019, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. \u2018Well!\u2019 thought Alice to herself, \u2018after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they\u2019ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn\u2019t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!\u2019 (Which was very likely true.)", " So she called softly after it, \u2018Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won\u2019t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don\u2019t like them!\u2019 When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, \u2018Let us get to the shore, and then I\u2019ll tell you my history, and you\u2019ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\u2019 It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore. CHAPTER III. A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable."], "What is the lastthing that Alice sees the Mad Hatter and March Hare doing?": [" Visit either you like: they\u2019re both mad.\u2019 \u2018But I don\u2019t want to go among mad people,\u2019 Alice remarked. \u2018Oh, you can\u2019t help that,\u2019 said the Cat: \u2018we\u2019re all mad here. I\u2019m mad. You\u2019re mad.\u2019 \u2018How do you know I\u2019m mad?\u2019 said Alice. \u2018You must be,\u2019 said the Cat, \u2018or you wouldn\u2019t have come here.\u2019 Alice didn\u2019t think that proved it at all; however, she went on \u2018And how do you know that you\u2019re mad?\u2019 \u2018To begin with,\u2019 said the Cat, \u2018a dog\u2019s not mad. You grant that?\u2019 \u2018I suppose so,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Well, then,\u2019 the Cat went on, \u2018you see, a dog growls when it\u2019s angry, and wags its tail when it\u2019s pleased. Now I growl when I\u2019m pleased, and wag my tail when I\u2019m angry. Therefore I\u2019m mad.\u2019 \u2018I call it purring, not growling,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Call it what you like,\u2019 said the Cat. \u2018Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?\u2019 \u2018I should like it very much,\u2019 said Alice, \u2018but I haven\u2019t been invited yet.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ll see me there,\u2019 said the Cat, and vanished.", " \u2018It began with the tea,\u2019 the Hatter replied. \u2018Of course twinkling begins with a T!\u2019 said the King sharply. \u2018Do you take me for a dunce? Go on!\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m a poor man,\u2019 the Hatter went on, \u2018and most things twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--\u2019 \u2018I didn\u2019t!\u2019 the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry. \u2018You did!\u2019 said the Hatter. \u2018I deny it!\u2019 said the March Hare. \u2018He denies it,\u2019 said the King: \u2018leave out that part.\u2019 \u2018Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--\u2019 the Hatter went on, looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep. \u2018After that,\u2019 continued the Hatter, \u2018I cut some more bread-and-butter--\u2019 \u2018But what did the Dormouse say?\u2019 one of the jury asked. \u2018That I can\u2019t remember,\u2019 said the Hatter. \u2018You MUST remember,\u2019 remarked the King, \u2018or I\u2019ll have you executed.\u2019 The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went down on one knee.", " Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared again. \u2018By-the-bye, what became of the baby?\u2019 said the Cat. \u2018I\u2019d nearly forgotten to ask.\u2019 \u2018It turned into a pig,\u2019 Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural way. \u2018I thought it would,\u2019 said the Cat, and vanished again. Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live. \u2018I\u2019ve seen hatters before,\u2019 she said to herself; \u2018the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won\u2019t be raving mad--at least not so mad as it was in March.\u2019 As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree. \u2018Did you say pig, or fig?\u2019 said the Cat.", " I almost wish I\u2019d gone to see the Hatter instead!\u2019 CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. \u2018Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,\u2019 thought Alice; \u2018only, as it\u2019s asleep, I suppose it doesn\u2019t mind.\u2019 The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: \u2018No room! No room!\u2019 they cried out when they saw Alice coming. \u2018There\u2019s PLENTY of room!\u2019 said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table. \u2018Have some wine,\u2019 the March Hare said in an encouraging tone. Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. \u2018I don\u2019t see any wine,\u2019 she remarked. \u2018There isn\u2019t any,\u2019 said the March Hare."], "On what doesthe Bread-and-butter-fly live?": [" Alice considered a little, and then said \u2018The fourth.\u2019 \u2018Two days wrong!\u2019 sighed the Hatter. \u2018I told you butter wouldn\u2019t suit the works!\u2019 he added looking angrily at the March Hare. \u2018It was the BEST butter,\u2019 the March Hare meekly replied. \u2018Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,\u2019 the Hatter grumbled: \u2018you shouldn\u2019t have put it in with the bread-knife.\u2019 The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, \u2018It was the BEST butter, you know.\u2019 Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. \u2018What a funny watch!\u2019 she remarked. \u2018It tells the day of the month, and doesn\u2019t tell what o\u2019clock it is!\u2019 \u2018Why should it?\u2019 muttered the Hatter. \u2018Does YOUR watch tell you what year it is?\u2019 \u2018Of course not,\u2019 Alice replied very readily: \u2018but that\u2019s because it stays the same year for such a long time together.\u2019 \u2018Which is just the case with MINE,\u2019 said the Hatter.", " \u2018It began with the tea,\u2019 the Hatter replied. \u2018Of course twinkling begins with a T!\u2019 said the King sharply. \u2018Do you take me for a dunce? Go on!\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m a poor man,\u2019 the Hatter went on, \u2018and most things twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--\u2019 \u2018I didn\u2019t!\u2019 the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry. \u2018You did!\u2019 said the Hatter. \u2018I deny it!\u2019 said the March Hare. \u2018He denies it,\u2019 said the King: \u2018leave out that part.\u2019 \u2018Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--\u2019 the Hatter went on, looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep. \u2018After that,\u2019 continued the Hatter, \u2018I cut some more bread-and-butter--\u2019 \u2018But what did the Dormouse say?\u2019 one of the jury asked. \u2018That I can\u2019t remember,\u2019 said the Hatter. \u2018You MUST remember,\u2019 remarked the King, \u2018or I\u2019ll have you executed.\u2019 The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went down on one knee.", " \u2018Who\u2019s making personal remarks now?\u2019 the Hatter asked triumphantly. Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and repeated her question. \u2018Why did they live at the bottom of a well?\u2019 The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then said, \u2018It was a treacle-well.\u2019 \u2018There\u2019s no such thing!\u2019 Alice was beginning very angrily, but the Hatter and the March Hare went \u2018Sh! sh!\u2019 and the Dormouse sulkily remarked, \u2018If you can\u2019t be civil, you\u2019d better finish the story for yourself.\u2019 \u2018No, please go on!\u2019 Alice said very humbly; \u2018I won\u2019t interrupt again. I dare say there may be ONE.\u2019 \u2018One, indeed!\u2019 said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to go on. \u2018And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw, you know--\u2019 \u2018What did they draw?\u2019 said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.", " \u2018Take off your hat,\u2019 the King said to the Hatter. \u2018It isn\u2019t mine,\u2019 said the Hatter. \u2018Stolen!\u2019 the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a memorandum of the fact. \u2018I keep them to sell,\u2019 the Hatter added as an explanation; \u2018I\u2019ve none of my own. I\u2019m a hatter.\u2019 Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted. \u2018Give your evidence,\u2019 said the King; \u2018and don\u2019t be nervous, or I\u2019ll have you executed on the spot.\u2019 This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter. Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her."], "In total, howmany queens are in both stories?": [" After these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King\u2019s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS. Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions; \u2018and besides, what would be the use of a procession,\u2019 thought she, \u2018if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn\u2019t see it?\u2019 So she stood still where she was, and waited."], "According toAlice, what is a common feature in the poetry in Throughthe Looking-Glass?": [" \u2018But it\u2019s no use now,\u2019 thought poor Alice, \u2018to pretend to be two people! Why, there\u2019s hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!\u2019 Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words \u2018EAT ME\u2019 were beautifully marked in currants. \u2018Well, I\u2019ll eat it,\u2019 said Alice, \u2018and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I\u2019ll get into the garden, and I don\u2019t care which happens!\u2019 She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, \u2018Which way? Which way?\u2019, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.", " \u2018I wish I hadn\u2019t mentioned Dinah!\u2019 she said to herself in a melancholy tone. \u2018Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!\u2019 And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story. CHAPTER IV. The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself \u2018The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She\u2019ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?\u2019 Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.", " Alice heard it say to itself \u2018Then I\u2019ll go round and get in at the window.\u2019 \u2018THAT you won\u2019t\u2019 thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort. Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit\u2019s--\u2018Pat! Pat! Where are you?\u2019 And then a voice she had never heard before, \u2018Sure then I\u2019m here! Digging for apples, yer honour!\u2019 \u2018Digging for apples, indeed!\u2019 said the Rabbit angrily. \u2018Here! Come and help me out of THIS!\u2019 (Sounds of more broken glass.) \u2018Now tell me, Pat, what\u2019s that in the window?\u2019 \u2018Sure, it\u2019s an arm, yer honour!\u2019 (He pronounced it \u2018arrum.\u2019) \u2018An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size?", " I suppose Dinah\u2019ll be sending me on messages next!\u2019 And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: \u2018\u201cMiss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!\u201d \u201cComing in a minute, nurse! But I\u2019ve got to see that the mouse doesn\u2019t get out.\u201d Only I don\u2019t think,\u2019 Alice went on, \u2018that they\u2019d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that!\u2019 By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time with the words \u2018DRINK ME,\u2019 but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. \u2018I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,\u2019 she said to herself, \u2018whenever I eat or drink anything; so I\u2019ll just see what this bottle does."], "What is the lastthing we see before the Cheshire Cat fades the first time?": [" \u2018There\u2019s certainly too much pepper in that soup!\u2019 Alice said to herself, as well as she could for sneezing. There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment\u2019s pause. The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear. \u2018Please would you tell me,\u2019 said Alice, a little timidly, for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, \u2018why your cat grins like that?\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s a Cheshire cat,\u2019 said the Duchess, \u2018and that\u2019s why. Pig!\u2019 She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:-- \u2018I didn\u2019t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn\u2019t know that cats COULD grin.\u2019 \u2018They all can,\u2019 said the Duchess; \u2018and most of \u2018em do.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know of any that do,\u2019 Alice said very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.", " \u2018Not at all,\u2019 said Alice: \u2018she\u2019s so extremely--\u2019 Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on, \u2018--likely to win, that it\u2019s hardly worth while finishing the game.\u2019 The Queen smiled and passed on. \u2018Who ARE you talking to?\u2019 said the King, going up to Alice, and looking at the Cat\u2019s head with great curiosity. \u2018It\u2019s a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,\u2019 said Alice: \u2018allow me to introduce it.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t like the look of it at all,\u2019 said the King: \u2018however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019d rather not,\u2019 the Cat remarked. \u2018Don\u2019t be impertinent,\u2019 said the King, \u2018and don\u2019t look at me like that!\u2019 He got behind Alice as he spoke. \u2018A cat may look at a king,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018I\u2019ve read that in some book, but I don\u2019t remember where.\u2019 \u2018Well, it must be removed,\u2019 said the King very decidedly, and he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, \u2018My dear! I wish you would have this cat removed!\u2019 The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.", " The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect. \u2018Cheshire Puss,\u2019 she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider. \u2018Come, it\u2019s pleased so far,\u2019 thought Alice, and she went on. \u2018Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?\u2019 \u2018That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,\u2019 said the Cat. \u2018I don\u2019t much care where--\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Then it doesn\u2019t matter which way you go,\u2019 said the Cat. \u2018--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,\u2019 Alice added as an explanation. \u2018Oh, you\u2019re sure to do that,\u2019 said the Cat, \u2018if you only walk long enough.\u2019 Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question. \u2018What sort of people live about here?\u2019 \u2018In THAT direction,\u2019 the Cat said, waving its right paw round, \u2018lives a Hatter: and in THAT direction,\u2019 waving the other paw, \u2018lives a March Hare.", " The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting \u2018Off with his head!\u2019 or \u2018Off with her head!\u2019 about once in a minute. Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute, \u2018and then,\u2019 thought she, \u2018what would become of me? They\u2019re dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there\u2019s any one left alive!\u2019 She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said to herself \u2018It\u2019s the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.\u2019 \u2018How are you getting on?\u2019 said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with."], "What secret doesthe Gryphon reveal about the Queen of Hearts?": [" \u2018I never saw one, or heard of one,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Come on, then,\u2019 said the Queen, \u2018and he shall tell you his history,\u2019 As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to the company generally, \u2018You are all pardoned.\u2019 \u2018Come, THAT\u2019S a good thing!\u2019 she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered. They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (IF you don\u2019t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) \u2018Up, lazy thing!\u2019 said the Queen, \u2018and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered\u2019; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited.

I needn\u2019t be afraid of them!\u2019 \u2018And who are THESE?\u2019 said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children. \u2018How should I know?\u2019 said Alice, surprised at her own courage. \u2018It\u2019s no business of MINE.\u2019 The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast, screamed \u2018Off with her head!"], "What piece ofclothing does Alice fasten for the White Queen?": [" Off--\u2019 \u2018Nonsense!\u2019 said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent.

So you see, Miss, we\u2019re doing our best, afore she comes, to--\u2019 At this moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out \u2018The Queen! The Queen!\u2019 and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen. First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did."], "Which two charactersfrom Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland reappearwith different names in Through the Looking-Glass?": [" \u2018Of course not,\u2019 said the Mock Turtle: \u2018why, if a fish came to ME, and told me he was going a journey, I should say \u201cWith what porpoise?\u201d\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t you mean \u201cpurpose\u201d?\u2019 said Alice. \u2018I mean what I say,\u2019 the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone.

Down the Rabbit-Hole Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, \u2018and what is the use of a book,\u2019 thought Alice \u2018without pictures or conversations?\u2019 So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \u2018Oh dear!", " \u2018Wake up, Alice dear!\u2019 said her sister; \u2018Why, what a long sleep you\u2019ve had!\u2019 \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve had such a curious dream!\u2019 said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, \u2018It WAS a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it\u2019s getting late.\u2019 So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been. But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:-- First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister\u2019s dream.", " \u2018I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t put it more clearly,\u2019 Alice replied very politely, \u2018for I can\u2019t understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.\u2019 \u2018It isn\u2019t,\u2019 said the Caterpillar. \u2018Well, perhaps you haven\u2019t found it so yet,\u2019 said Alice; \u2018but when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you\u2019ll feel it a little queer, won\u2019t you?\u2019 \u2018Not a bit,\u2019 said the Caterpillar. \u2018Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,\u2019 said Alice; \u2018all I know is, it would feel very queer to ME.\u2019 \u2018You!\u2019 said the Caterpillar contemptuously. \u2018Who are YOU?\u2019 Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar\u2019s making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, \u2018I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.\u2019 \u2018Why?\u2019 said the Caterpillar."], "Which charactertakes Alice through the forest in Through the Looking-Glass?": [" \u2018I wish I hadn\u2019t mentioned Dinah!\u2019 she said to herself in a melancholy tone. \u2018Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s the best cat in the world!

There could be no doubt that it had a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all. \u2018But perhaps it was only sobbing,\u2019 she thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears. No, there were no tears. \u2018If you\u2019re going to turn into a pig, my dear,\u2019 said Alice, seriously, \u2018I\u2019ll have nothing more to do with you.", " \u2018You shan\u2019t be beheaded!\u2019 said Alice, and she put them into a large flower-pot that stood near.

She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face. \u2018Very,\u2019 said Alice: \u2018--where\u2019s the Duchess?\u2019 \u2018Hush! Hush!\u2019 said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered \u2018She\u2019s under sentence of execution.\u2019 \u2018What for?\u2019 said Alice."], "What does theWhite Knight consider (to be) his most clever invention? (this questionis not discussed in detail in the summary)": [" \u2018It isn\u2019t directed at all,\u2019 said the White Rabbit; \u2018in fact, there\u2019s nothing written on the OUTSIDE.\u2019 He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and added \u2018It isn\u2019t a letter, after all: it\u2019s a set of verses.\u2019 \u2018Are they in the prisoner\u2019s handwriting?\u2019 asked another of the jurymen. \u2018No, they\u2019re not,\u2019 said the White Rabbit, \u2018and that\u2019s the queerest thing about it.\u2019 (The jury all looked puzzled.) \u2018He must have imitated somebody else\u2019s hand,\u2019 said the King.

You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you\u2019d have signed your name like an honest man.\u2019 There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever thing the King had said that day. \u2018That PROVES his guilt,\u2019 said the Queen.", " Off--\u2019 \u2018Nonsense!\u2019 said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent. The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said \u2018Consider, my dear: she is only a child!\u2019 The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave \u2018Turn them over!\u2019 The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot. \u2018Get up!\u2019 said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else. \u2018Leave off that!\u2019 screamed the Queen. \u2018You make me giddy.\u2019 And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, \u2018What HAVE you been doing here?\u2019 \u2018May it please your Majesty,\u2019 said Two, in a very humble tone, going down on one knee as he spoke, \u2018we were trying--\u2019 \u2018I see!\u2019 said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses. \u2018Off with their heads!\u2019 and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.", " ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.\u2019 Everybody looked at Alice. \u2018I\u2019M not a mile high,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018You are,\u2019 said the King. \u2018Nearly two miles high,\u2019 added the Queen. \u2018Well, I shan\u2019t go, at any rate,\u2019 said Alice: \u2018besides, that\u2019s not a regular rule: you invented it just now.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s the oldest rule in the book,\u2019 said the King. \u2018Then it ought to be Number One,\u2019 said Alice. The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. \u2018Consider your verdict,\u2019 he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice. \u2018There\u2019s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,\u2019 said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; \u2018this paper has just been picked up.\u2019 \u2018What\u2019s in it?\u2019 said the Queen. \u2018I haven\u2019t opened it yet,\u2019 said the White Rabbit, \u2018but it seems to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.\u2019 \u2018It must have been that,\u2019 said the King, \u2018unless it was written to nobody, which isn\u2019t usual, you know.\u2019 \u2018Who is it directed to?\u2019 said one of the jurymen.", " \u2018Then the words don\u2019t FIT you,\u2019 said the King, looking round the court with a smile. There was a dead silence. \u2018It\u2019s a pun!\u2019 the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed, \u2018Let the jury consider their verdict,\u2019 the King said, for about the twentieth time that day. \u2018No, no!\u2019 said the Queen. \u2018Sentence first--verdict afterwards.\u2019 \u2018Stuff and nonsense!\u2019 said Alice loudly. \u2018The idea of having the sentence first!\u2019 \u2018Hold your tongue!\u2019 said the Queen, turning purple. \u2018I won\u2019t!\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Off with her head!\u2019 the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved. \u2018Who cares for you?\u2019 said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this time.) \u2018You\u2019re nothing but a pack of cards!\u2019 At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face."], "According tothe Cook in Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland, ofwhat are tarts mostly made (what is the key ingredient in tarts)?": [" \u2018Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!\u2019 thought Alice. \u2018Now we shall get on better.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019d rather finish my tea,\u2019 said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers. \u2018You may go,\u2019 said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court, without even waiting to put his shoes on. \u2018--and just take his head off outside,\u2019 the Queen added to one of the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door. \u2018Call the next witness!\u2019 said the King. The next witness was the Duchess\u2019s cook. She carried the pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once. \u2018Give your evidence,\u2019 said the King. \u2018Shan\u2019t,\u2019 said the cook. The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice, \u2018Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.\u2019 \u2018Well, if I must, I must,\u2019 the King said, with a melancholy air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, \u2018What are tarts made of?\u2019 \u2018Pepper, mostly,\u2019 said the cook.", " The Knave shook his head sadly. \u2018Do I look like it?\u2019 he said. (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.) \u2018All right, so far,\u2019 said the King, and he went on muttering over the verses to himself: \u2018\u201cWE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--\u201d that\u2019s the jury, of course--\u201cI GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--\u201d why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--\u2019 \u2018But, it goes on \u201cTHEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,\u201d\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Why, there they are!\u2019 said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts on the table. \u2018Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then again--\u201cBEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--\u201d you never had fits, my dear, I think?\u2019 he said to the Queen. \u2018Never!\u2019 said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)", " *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ALICE\u2019S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND *** ALICE\u2019S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND Lewis Carroll THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 3.0 CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, \u2018and what is the use of a book,\u2019 thought Alice \u2018without pictures or conversations?\u2019 So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \u2018Oh dear!", " Who Stole the Tarts? The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--\u2018I wish they\u2019d get the trial done,\u2019 she thought, \u2018and hand round the refreshments!\u2019 But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about her, to pass away the time. Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there."]}
