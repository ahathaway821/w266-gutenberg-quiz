{"From what is theCaterpillar in Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland smoking?": [" *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ALICE\u2019S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND *** ALICE\u2019S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND Lewis Carroll THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 3.0 CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, \u2018and what is the use of a book,\u2019 thought Alice \u2018without pictures or conversations?\u2019 So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \u2018Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!\u2019 (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.", " Now you know.\u2019 \u2018And what are they made of?\u2019 Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity. \u2018Soles and eels, of course,\u2019 the Gryphon replied rather impatiently: \u2018any shrimp could have told you that.\u2019 \u2018If I\u2019d been the whiting,\u2019 said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the song, \u2018I\u2019d have said to the porpoise, \u201cKeep back, please: we don\u2019t want YOU with us!\u201d\u2019 \u2018They were obliged to have him with them,\u2019 the Mock Turtle said: \u2018no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.\u2019 \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it really?\u2019 said Alice in a tone of great surprise. \u2018Of course not,\u2019 said the Mock Turtle: \u2018why, if a fish came to ME, and told me he was going a journey, I should say \u201cWith what porpoise?\u201d\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t you mean \u201cpurpose\u201d?\u2019 said Alice. \u2018I mean what I say,\u2019 the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And the Gryphon added \u2018Come, let\u2019s hear some of YOUR adventures.\u2019 \u2018I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,\u2019 said Alice a little timidly: \u2018but it\u2019s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.\u2019 \u2018Explain all that,\u2019 said the Mock Turtle. \u2018No, no! The adventures first,\u2019 said the Gryphon in an impatient tone: \u2018explanations take such a dreadful time.\u2019 So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she went on.", " \u2018No, no!\u2019 said the Queen. \u2018Sentence first--verdict afterwards.\u2019 \u2018Stuff and nonsense!\u2019 said Alice loudly. \u2018The idea of having the sentence first!\u2019 \u2018Hold your tongue!\u2019 said the Queen, turning purple. \u2018I won\u2019t!\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Off with her head!\u2019 the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved. \u2018Who cares for you?\u2019 said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this time.) \u2018You\u2019re nothing but a pack of cards!\u2019 At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face. \u2018Wake up, Alice dear!\u2019 said her sister; \u2018Why, what a long sleep you\u2019ve had!\u2019 \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve had such a curious dream!\u2019 said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, \u2018It WAS a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it\u2019s getting late.\u2019 So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been. But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:-- First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister\u2019s dream.", " The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess\u2019s knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard\u2019s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle. So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen\u2019s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle\u2019s heavy sobs. Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days."], "Which characterdoes Alice scare away with talk of her cat Dinah?": [" \u2018What a pity it wouldn\u2019t stay!\u2019 sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter \u2018Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose YOUR temper!\u2019 \u2018Hold your tongue, Ma!\u2019 said the young Crab, a little snappishly. \u2018You\u2019re enough to try the patience of an oyster!\u2019 \u2018I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!\u2019 said Alice aloud, addressing nobody in particular. \u2018She\u2019d soon fetch it back!\u2019 \u2018And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?\u2019 said the Lory. Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet: \u2018Dinah\u2019s our cat. And she\u2019s such a capital one for catching mice you can\u2019t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why, she\u2019ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!\u2019 This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, \u2018I really must be getting home; the night-air doesn\u2019t suit my throat!\u2019 and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children, \u2018Come away, my dears! It\u2019s high time you were all in bed!\u2019 On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone. \u2018I wish I hadn\u2019t mentioned Dinah!\u2019 she said to herself in a melancholy tone. \u2018Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!\u2019 And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.", " \u2018What sort of people live about here?\u2019 \u2018In THAT direction,\u2019 the Cat said, waving its right paw round, \u2018lives a Hatter: and in THAT direction,\u2019 waving the other paw, \u2018lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they\u2019re both mad.\u2019 \u2018But I don\u2019t want to go among mad people,\u2019 Alice remarked. \u2018Oh, you can\u2019t help that,\u2019 said the Cat: \u2018we\u2019re all mad here. I\u2019m mad. You\u2019re mad.\u2019 \u2018How do you know I\u2019m mad?\u2019 said Alice. \u2018You must be,\u2019 said the Cat, \u2018or you wouldn\u2019t have come here.\u2019 Alice didn\u2019t think that proved it at all; however, she went on \u2018And how do you know that you\u2019re mad?\u2019 \u2018To begin with,\u2019 said the Cat, \u2018a dog\u2019s not mad. You grant that?\u2019 \u2018I suppose so,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Well, then,\u2019 the Cat went on, \u2018you see, a dog growls when it\u2019s angry, and wags its tail when it\u2019s pleased. Now I growl when I\u2019m pleased, and wag my tail when I\u2019m angry. Therefore I\u2019m mad.\u2019 \u2018I call it purring, not growling,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Call it what you like,\u2019 said the Cat. \u2018Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?\u2019 \u2018I should like it very much,\u2019 said Alice, \u2018but I haven\u2019t been invited yet.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ll see me there,\u2019 said the Cat, and vanished. Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared again. \u2018By-the-bye, what became of the baby?\u2019 said the Cat. \u2018I\u2019d nearly forgotten to ask.\u2019 \u2018It turned into a pig,\u2019 Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural way.", " \u2018I don\u2019t think they play at all fairly,\u2019 Alice began, in rather a complaining tone, \u2018and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can\u2019t hear oneself speak--and they don\u2019t seem to have any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you\u2019ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there\u2019s the arch I\u2019ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have croqueted the Queen\u2019s hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming!\u2019 \u2018How do you like the Queen?\u2019 said the Cat in a low voice. \u2018Not at all,\u2019 said Alice: \u2018she\u2019s so extremely--\u2019 Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on, \u2018--likely to win, that it\u2019s hardly worth while finishing the game.\u2019 The Queen smiled and passed on. \u2018Who ARE you talking to?\u2019 said the King, going up to Alice, and looking at the Cat\u2019s head with great curiosity. \u2018It\u2019s a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,\u2019 said Alice: \u2018allow me to introduce it.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t like the look of it at all,\u2019 said the King: \u2018however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019d rather not,\u2019 the Cat remarked. \u2018Don\u2019t be impertinent,\u2019 said the King, \u2018and don\u2019t look at me like that!\u2019 He got behind Alice as he spoke. \u2018A cat may look at a king,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018I\u2019ve read that in some book, but I don\u2019t remember where.\u2019 \u2018Well, it must be removed,\u2019 said the King very decidedly, and he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, \u2018My dear!", " This time there could be NO mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further. So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood. \u2018If it had grown up,\u2019 she said to herself, \u2018it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.\u2019 And she began thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to herself, \u2018if one only knew the right way to change them--\u2019 when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off. The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect. \u2018Cheshire Puss,\u2019 she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider. \u2018Come, it\u2019s pleased so far,\u2019 thought Alice, and she went on. \u2018Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?\u2019 \u2018That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,\u2019 said the Cat. \u2018I don\u2019t much care where--\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Then it doesn\u2019t matter which way you go,\u2019 said the Cat. \u2018--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,\u2019 Alice added as an explanation. \u2018Oh, you\u2019re sure to do that,\u2019 said the Cat, \u2018if you only walk long enough.\u2019 Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question."], "In Alice\u2019sAdventures in Wonderland, which character serves as heraldto the King and Queen of Hearts?": [" \u2018Would you tell me,\u2019 said Alice, a little timidly, \u2018why you are painting those roses?\u2019 Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low voice, \u2018Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we\u2019re doing our best, afore she comes, to--\u2019 At this moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out \u2018The Queen! The Queen!\u2019 and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen. First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King\u2019s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.", " \u2018Herald, read the accusation!\u2019 said the King. On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:-- \u2018The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts, All on a summer day: The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts, And took them quite away!\u2019 \u2018Consider your verdict,\u2019 the King said to the jury. \u2018Not yet, not yet!\u2019 the Rabbit hastily interrupted. \u2018There\u2019s a great deal to come before that!\u2019 \u2018Call the first witness,\u2019 said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, \u2018First witness!\u2019 The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. \u2018I beg pardon, your Majesty,\u2019 he began, \u2018for bringing these in: but I hadn\u2019t quite finished my tea when I was sent for.\u2019 \u2018You ought to have finished,\u2019 said the King. \u2018When did you begin?\u2019 The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. \u2018Fourteenth of March, I think it was,\u2019 he said. \u2018Fifteenth,\u2019 said the March Hare. \u2018Sixteenth,\u2019 added the Dormouse. \u2018Write that down,\u2019 the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence. \u2018Take off your hat,\u2019 the King said to the Hatter. \u2018It isn\u2019t mine,\u2019 said the Hatter. \u2018Stolen!\u2019 the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a memorandum of the fact.", " \u2018I don\u2019t think they play at all fairly,\u2019 Alice began, in rather a complaining tone, \u2018and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can\u2019t hear oneself speak--and they don\u2019t seem to have any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you\u2019ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there\u2019s the arch I\u2019ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have croqueted the Queen\u2019s hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming!\u2019 \u2018How do you like the Queen?\u2019 said the Cat in a low voice. \u2018Not at all,\u2019 said Alice: \u2018she\u2019s so extremely--\u2019 Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on, \u2018--likely to win, that it\u2019s hardly worth while finishing the game.\u2019 The Queen smiled and passed on. \u2018Who ARE you talking to?\u2019 said the King, going up to Alice, and looking at the Cat\u2019s head with great curiosity. \u2018It\u2019s a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,\u2019 said Alice: \u2018allow me to introduce it.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t like the look of it at all,\u2019 said the King: \u2018however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019d rather not,\u2019 the Cat remarked. \u2018Don\u2019t be impertinent,\u2019 said the King, \u2018and don\u2019t look at me like that!\u2019 He got behind Alice as he spoke. \u2018A cat may look at a king,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018I\u2019ve read that in some book, but I don\u2019t remember where.\u2019 \u2018Well, it must be removed,\u2019 said the King very decidedly, and he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, \u2018My dear!", " Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm. \u2018A fine day, your Majesty!\u2019 the Duchess began in a low, weak voice. \u2018Now, I give you fair warning,\u2019 shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she spoke; \u2018either you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time! Take your choice!\u2019 The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment. \u2018Let\u2019s go on with the game,\u2019 the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground. The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen\u2019s absence, and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment\u2019s delay would cost them their lives. All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players, and shouting \u2018Off with his head!\u2019 or \u2018Off with her head!\u2019 Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of execution. Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, \u2018Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018I don\u2019t even know what a Mock Turtle is.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,\u2019 said the Queen."], "Which characterseems to have a fondness for treacle?": [" \u2018Why did they live at the bottom of a well?\u2019 The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then said, \u2018It was a treacle-well.\u2019 \u2018There\u2019s no such thing!\u2019 Alice was beginning very angrily, but the Hatter and the March Hare went \u2018Sh! sh!\u2019 and the Dormouse sulkily remarked, \u2018If you can\u2019t be civil, you\u2019d better finish the story for yourself.\u2019 \u2018No, please go on!\u2019 Alice said very humbly; \u2018I won\u2019t interrupt again. I dare say there may be ONE.\u2019 \u2018One, indeed!\u2019 said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to go on. \u2018And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw, you know--\u2019 \u2018What did they draw?\u2019 said Alice, quite forgetting her promise. \u2018Treacle,\u2019 said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time. \u2018I want a clean cup,\u2019 interrupted the Hatter: \u2018let\u2019s all move one place on.\u2019 He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare moved into the Dormouse\u2019s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate. Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very cautiously: \u2018But I don\u2019t understand. Where did they draw the treacle from?\u2019 \u2018You can draw water out of a water-well,\u2019 said the Hatter; \u2018so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?\u2019 \u2018But they were IN the well,\u2019 Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to notice this last remark.", " \u2018Wake up, Dormouse!\u2019 And they pinched it on both sides at once. The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. \u2018I wasn\u2019t asleep,\u2019 he said in a hoarse, feeble voice: \u2018I heard every word you fellows were saying.\u2019 \u2018Tell us a story!\u2019 said the March Hare. \u2018Yes, please do!\u2019 pleaded Alice. \u2018And be quick about it,\u2019 added the Hatter, \u2018or you\u2019ll be asleep again before it\u2019s done.\u2019 \u2018Once upon a time there were three little sisters,\u2019 the Dormouse began in a great hurry; \u2018and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--\u2019 \u2018What did they live on?\u2019 said Alice, who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking. \u2018They lived on treacle,\u2019 said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or two. \u2018They couldn\u2019t have done that, you know,\u2019 Alice gently remarked; \u2018they\u2019d have been ill.\u2019 \u2018So they were,\u2019 said the Dormouse; \u2018VERY ill.\u2019 Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: \u2018But why did they live at the bottom of a well?\u2019 \u2018Take some more tea,\u2019 the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly. \u2018I\u2019ve had nothing yet,\u2019 Alice replied in an offended tone, \u2018so I can\u2019t take more.\u2019 \u2018You mean you can\u2019t take LESS,\u2019 said the Hatter: \u2018it\u2019s very easy to take MORE than nothing.\u2019 \u2018Nobody asked YOUR opinion,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Who\u2019s making personal remarks now?\u2019 the Hatter asked triumphantly. Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and repeated her question.", " \u2018Give your evidence,\u2019 said the King. \u2018Shan\u2019t,\u2019 said the cook. The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice, \u2018Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.\u2019 \u2018Well, if I must, I must,\u2019 the King said, with a melancholy air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, \u2018What are tarts made of?\u2019 \u2018Pepper, mostly,\u2019 said the cook. \u2018Treacle,\u2019 said a sleepy voice behind her. \u2018Collar that Dormouse,\u2019 the Queen shrieked out. \u2018Behead that Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his whiskers!\u2019 For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared. \u2018Never mind!\u2019 said the King, with an air of great relief. \u2018Call the next witness.\u2019 And he added in an undertone to the Queen, \u2018Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead ache!\u2019 Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like, \u2018--for they haven\u2019t got much evidence YET,\u2019 she said to herself. Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the name \u2018Alice!\u2019 CHAPTER XII. Alice\u2019s Evidence \u2018Here!\u2019 cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before."], "Who has condemnedthe Mad Hatter to perpetual teatime?": [" \u2018What sort of people live about here?\u2019 \u2018In THAT direction,\u2019 the Cat said, waving its right paw round, \u2018lives a Hatter: and in THAT direction,\u2019 waving the other paw, \u2018lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they\u2019re both mad.\u2019 \u2018But I don\u2019t want to go among mad people,\u2019 Alice remarked. \u2018Oh, you can\u2019t help that,\u2019 said the Cat: \u2018we\u2019re all mad here. I\u2019m mad. You\u2019re mad.\u2019 \u2018How do you know I\u2019m mad?\u2019 said Alice. \u2018You must be,\u2019 said the Cat, \u2018or you wouldn\u2019t have come here.\u2019 Alice didn\u2019t think that proved it at all; however, she went on \u2018And how do you know that you\u2019re mad?\u2019 \u2018To begin with,\u2019 said the Cat, \u2018a dog\u2019s not mad. You grant that?\u2019 \u2018I suppose so,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Well, then,\u2019 the Cat went on, \u2018you see, a dog growls when it\u2019s angry, and wags its tail when it\u2019s pleased. Now I growl when I\u2019m pleased, and wag my tail when I\u2019m angry. Therefore I\u2019m mad.\u2019 \u2018I call it purring, not growling,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Call it what you like,\u2019 said the Cat. \u2018Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?\u2019 \u2018I should like it very much,\u2019 said Alice, \u2018but I haven\u2019t been invited yet.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ll see me there,\u2019 said the Cat, and vanished. Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared again. \u2018By-the-bye, what became of the baby?\u2019 said the Cat. \u2018I\u2019d nearly forgotten to ask.\u2019 \u2018It turned into a pig,\u2019 Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural way.", " \u2018It was the BEST butter,\u2019 the March Hare meekly replied. \u2018Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,\u2019 the Hatter grumbled: \u2018you shouldn\u2019t have put it in with the bread-knife.\u2019 The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, \u2018It was the BEST butter, you know.\u2019 Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. \u2018What a funny watch!\u2019 she remarked. \u2018It tells the day of the month, and doesn\u2019t tell what o\u2019clock it is!\u2019 \u2018Why should it?\u2019 muttered the Hatter. \u2018Does YOUR watch tell you what year it is?\u2019 \u2018Of course not,\u2019 Alice replied very readily: \u2018but that\u2019s because it stays the same year for such a long time together.\u2019 \u2018Which is just the case with MINE,\u2019 said the Hatter. Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter\u2019s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. \u2018I don\u2019t quite understand you,\u2019 she said, as politely as she could. \u2018The Dormouse is asleep again,\u2019 said the Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose. The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its eyes, \u2018Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.\u2019 \u2018Have you guessed the riddle yet?\u2019 the Hatter said, turning to Alice again. \u2018No, I give it up,\u2019 Alice replied: \u2018what\u2019s the answer?\u2019 \u2018I haven\u2019t the slightest idea,\u2019 said the Hatter.", " \u2018Give your evidence,\u2019 the King repeated angrily, \u2018or I\u2019ll have you executed, whether you\u2019re nervous or not.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m a poor man, your Majesty,\u2019 the Hatter began, in a trembling voice, \u2018--and I hadn\u2019t begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea--\u2019 \u2018The twinkling of the what?\u2019 said the King. \u2018It began with the tea,\u2019 the Hatter replied. \u2018Of course twinkling begins with a T!\u2019 said the King sharply. \u2018Do you take me for a dunce? Go on!\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m a poor man,\u2019 the Hatter went on, \u2018and most things twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--\u2019 \u2018I didn\u2019t!\u2019 the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry. \u2018You did!\u2019 said the Hatter. \u2018I deny it!\u2019 said the March Hare. \u2018He denies it,\u2019 said the King: \u2018leave out that part.\u2019 \u2018Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--\u2019 the Hatter went on, looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep. \u2018After that,\u2019 continued the Hatter, \u2018I cut some more bread-and-butter--\u2019 \u2018But what did the Dormouse say?\u2019 one of the jury asked. \u2018That I can\u2019t remember,\u2019 said the Hatter. \u2018You MUST remember,\u2019 remarked the King, \u2018or I\u2019ll have you executed.\u2019 The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went down on one knee. \u2018I\u2019m a poor man, your Majesty,\u2019 he began. \u2018You\u2019re a very poor speaker,\u2019 said the King. Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court.", " \u2018Nor I,\u2019 said the March Hare. Alice sighed wearily. \u2018I think you might do something better with the time,\u2019 she said, \u2018than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.\u2019 \u2018If you knew Time as well as I do,\u2019 said the Hatter, \u2018you wouldn\u2019t talk about wasting IT. It\u2019s HIM.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know what you mean,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Of course you don\u2019t!\u2019 the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously. \u2018I dare say you never even spoke to Time!\u2019 \u2018Perhaps not,\u2019 Alice cautiously replied: \u2018but I know I have to beat time when I learn music.\u2019 \u2018Ah! that accounts for it,\u2019 said the Hatter. \u2018He won\u2019t stand beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he\u2019d do almost anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o\u2019clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons: you\u2019d only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!\u2019 [\u2018I only wish it was,\u2019 the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.) \u2018That would be grand, certainly,\u2019 said Alice thoughtfully: \u2018but then--I shouldn\u2019t be hungry for it, you know.\u2019 \u2018Not at first, perhaps,\u2019 said the Hatter: \u2018but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked.\u2019 \u2018Is that the way YOU manage?\u2019 Alice asked. The Hatter shook his head mournfully. \u2018Not I!\u2019 he replied. \u2018We quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--\u2019 (pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) \u2018--it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing \u201cTwinkle, twinkle, little bat!"], "How does Aliceget to the great hallway lined with doors a second time?": [" There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again. Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice\u2019s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted! Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head through the doorway; \u2018and even if my head would go through,\u2019 thought poor Alice, \u2018it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.\u2019 For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.", " They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood. \u2018The first thing I\u2019ve got to do,\u2019 said Alice to herself, as she wandered about in the wood, \u2018is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that will be the best plan.\u2019 It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry. An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her. \u2018Poor little thing!\u2019 said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing. Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.", " \u2018Nor I,\u2019 said the March Hare. Alice sighed wearily. \u2018I think you might do something better with the time,\u2019 she said, \u2018than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.\u2019 \u2018If you knew Time as well as I do,\u2019 said the Hatter, \u2018you wouldn\u2019t talk about wasting IT.

I\u2019m a hatter.\u2019 Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted. \u2018Give your evidence,\u2019 said the King; \u2018and don\u2019t be nervous, or I\u2019ll have you executed on the spot.\u2019 This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter. Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her. \u2018I wish you wouldn\u2019t squeeze so.\u2019 said the Dormouse, who was sitting next to her. \u2018I can hardly breathe.\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t help it,\u2019 said Alice very meekly: \u2018I\u2019m growing.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ve no right to grow here,\u2019 said the Dormouse. \u2018Don\u2019t talk nonsense,\u2019 said Alice more boldly: \u2018you know you\u2019re growing too.\u2019 \u2018Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,\u2019 said the Dormouse: \u2018not in that ridiculous fashion.\u2019 And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court. All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers of the court, \u2018Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!\u2019 on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off."], "Which of the followingcharacters is friendliest to Alice during her adventures?": [" Now you know.\u2019 \u2018And what are they made of?\u2019 Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity. \u2018Soles and eels, of course,\u2019 the Gryphon replied rather impatiently: \u2018any shrimp could have told you that.\u2019 \u2018If I\u2019d been the whiting,\u2019 said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the song, \u2018I\u2019d have said to the porpoise, \u201cKeep back, please: we don\u2019t want YOU with us!\u201d\u2019 \u2018They were obliged to have him with them,\u2019 the Mock Turtle said: \u2018no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.\u2019 \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it really?\u2019 said Alice in a tone of great surprise. \u2018Of course not,\u2019 said the Mock Turtle: \u2018why, if a fish came to ME, and told me he was going a journey, I should say \u201cWith what porpoise?\u201d\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t you mean \u201cpurpose\u201d?\u2019 said Alice. \u2018I mean what I say,\u2019 the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And the Gryphon added \u2018Come, let\u2019s hear some of YOUR adventures.\u2019 \u2018I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,\u2019 said Alice a little timidly: \u2018but it\u2019s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.\u2019 \u2018Explain all that,\u2019 said the Mock Turtle. \u2018No, no! The adventures first,\u2019 said the Gryphon in an impatient tone: \u2018explanations take such a dreadful time.\u2019 So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she went on.", " *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ALICE\u2019S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND *** ALICE\u2019S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND Lewis Carroll THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 3.0 CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, \u2018and what is the use of a book,\u2019 thought Alice \u2018without pictures or conversations?\u2019 So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \u2018Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!\u2019 (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.", " \u2018No, no!\u2019 said the Queen. \u2018Sentence first--verdict afterwards.\u2019 \u2018Stuff and nonsense!\u2019 said Alice loudly. \u2018The idea of having the sentence first!\u2019 \u2018Hold your tongue!\u2019 said the Queen, turning purple. \u2018I won\u2019t!\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Off with her head!\u2019 the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved. \u2018Who cares for you?\u2019 said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this time.) \u2018You\u2019re nothing but a pack of cards!\u2019 At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face. \u2018Wake up, Alice dear!\u2019 said her sister; \u2018Why, what a long sleep you\u2019ve had!\u2019 \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve had such a curious dream!\u2019 said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, \u2018It WAS a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it\u2019s getting late.\u2019 So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been. But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:-- First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister\u2019s dream.", " I almost wish I\u2019d gone to see the Hatter instead!\u2019 CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. \u2018Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,\u2019 thought Alice; \u2018only, as it\u2019s asleep, I suppose it doesn\u2019t mind.\u2019 The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: \u2018No room! No room!\u2019 they cried out when they saw Alice coming. \u2018There\u2019s PLENTY of room!\u2019 said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table. \u2018Have some wine,\u2019 the March Hare said in an encouraging tone. Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. \u2018I don\u2019t see any wine,\u2019 she remarked. \u2018There isn\u2019t any,\u2019 said the March Hare. \u2018Then it wasn\u2019t very civil of you to offer it,\u2019 said Alice angrily. \u2018It wasn\u2019t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,\u2019 said the March Hare. \u2018I didn\u2019t know it was YOUR table,\u2019 said Alice; \u2018it\u2019s laid for a great many more than three.\u2019 \u2018Your hair wants cutting,\u2019 said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech. \u2018You should learn not to make personal remarks,\u2019 Alice said with some severity; \u2018it\u2019s very rude.\u2019 The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he SAID was, \u2018Why is a raven like a writing-desk?\u2019 \u2018Come, we shall have some fun now!\u2019 thought Alice."], "In what capacitydoes Alice enter the chess game in Through the Looking-Glass?": [" I wish you would have this cat removed!\u2019 The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small. \u2018Off with his head!\u2019 she said, without even looking round. \u2018I\u2019ll fetch the executioner myself,\u2019 said the King eagerly, and he hurried off. Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, as she heard the Queen\u2019s voice in the distance, screaming with passion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog. The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree. By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: \u2018but it doesn\u2019t matter much,\u2019 thought Alice, \u2018as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground.\u2019 So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend. When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.", " She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort. Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit\u2019s--\u2018Pat! Pat! Where are you?\u2019 And then a voice she had never heard before, \u2018Sure then I\u2019m here! Digging for apples, yer honour!\u2019 \u2018Digging for apples, indeed!\u2019 said the Rabbit angrily. \u2018Here! Come and help me out of THIS!\u2019 (Sounds of more broken glass.) \u2018Now tell me, Pat, what\u2019s that in the window?\u2019 \u2018Sure, it\u2019s an arm, yer honour!\u2019 (He pronounced it \u2018arrum.\u2019) \u2018An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole window!\u2019 \u2018Sure, it does, yer honour: but it\u2019s an arm for all that.\u2019 \u2018Well, it\u2019s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!\u2019 There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then; such as, \u2018Sure, I don\u2019t like it, yer honour, at all, at all!\u2019 \u2018Do as I tell you, you coward!\u2019 and at last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. \u2018What a number of cucumber-frames there must be!\u2019 thought Alice. \u2018I wonder what they\u2019ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t want to stay in here any longer!\u2019 She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words: \u2018Where\u2019s the other ladder?--Why, I hadn\u2019t to bring but one; Bill\u2019s got the other--Bill!", " First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; \u2018for it might end, you know,\u2019 said Alice to herself, \u2018in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?\u2019 And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing. After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried. \u2018Come, there\u2019s no use in crying like that!\u2019 said Alice to herself, rather sharply; \u2018I advise you to leave off this minute!\u2019 She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people.", " Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm. \u2018A fine day, your Majesty!\u2019 the Duchess began in a low, weak voice. \u2018Now, I give you fair warning,\u2019 shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she spoke; \u2018either you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time! Take your choice!\u2019 The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment. \u2018Let\u2019s go on with the game,\u2019 the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground. The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen\u2019s absence, and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment\u2019s delay would cost them their lives. All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players, and shouting \u2018Off with his head!\u2019 or \u2018Off with her head!\u2019 Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of execution. Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, \u2018Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018I don\u2019t even know what a Mock Turtle is.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,\u2019 said the Queen."], "Which animalis not a character in either novel?": [" \u2018Begin at the beginning,\u2019 the King said gravely, \u2018and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\u2019 These were the verses the White Rabbit read:-- \u2018They told me you had been to her, And mentioned me to him: She gave me a good character, But said I could not swim. He sent them word I had not gone (We know it to be true): If she should push the matter on, What would become of you? I gave her one, they gave him two, You gave us three or more; They all returned from him to you, Though they were mine before. If I or she should chance to be Involved in this affair, He trusts to you to set them free, Exactly as we were. My notion was that you had been (Before she had this fit) An obstacle that came between Him, and ourselves, and it. Don\u2019t let him know she liked them best, For this must ever be A secret, kept from all the rest, Between yourself and me.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s the most important piece of evidence we\u2019ve heard yet,\u2019 said the King, rubbing his hands; \u2018so now let the jury--\u2019 \u2018If any one of them can explain it,\u2019 said Alice, (she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn\u2019t a bit afraid of interrupting him,) \u2018I\u2019ll give him sixpence. _I_ don\u2019t believe there\u2019s an atom of meaning in it.\u2019 The jury all wrote down on their slates, \u2018SHE doesn\u2019t believe there\u2019s an atom of meaning in it,\u2019 but none of them attempted to explain the paper. \u2018If there\u2019s no meaning in it,\u2019 said the King, \u2018that saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn\u2019t try to find any.", " \u2018I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think--\u2019 (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) \u2018--yes, that\u2019s about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I\u2019ve got to?\u2019 (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.) Presently she began again. \u2018I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the earth! How funny it\u2019ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think--\u2019 (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn\u2019t sound at all the right word) \u2018--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma\u2019am, is this New Zealand or Australia?\u2019 (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you\u2019re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) \u2018And what an ignorant little girl she\u2019ll think me for asking! No, it\u2019ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.\u2019 Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. \u2018Dinah\u2019ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!\u2019 (Dinah was the cat.)", " In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again. The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well. Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled \u2018ORANGE MARMALADE\u2019, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it. \u2018Well!\u2019 thought Alice to herself, \u2018after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they\u2019ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn\u2019t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!\u2019 (Which was very likely true.) Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! \u2018I wonder how many miles I\u2019ve fallen by this time?\u2019 she said aloud.", " \u2018But it\u2019s no use now,\u2019 thought poor Alice, \u2018to pretend to be two people! Why, there\u2019s hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!\u2019 Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words \u2018EAT ME\u2019 were beautifully marked in currants. \u2018Well, I\u2019ll eat it,\u2019 said Alice, \u2018and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I\u2019ll get into the garden, and I don\u2019t care which happens!\u2019 She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, \u2018Which way? Which way?\u2019, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way. So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * CHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears \u2018Curiouser and curiouser!\u2019 cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); \u2018now I\u2019m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!\u2019 (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off)."], "What is the lastthing that Alice sees the Mad Hatter and March Hare doing?": [" \u2018What sort of people live about here?\u2019 \u2018In THAT direction,\u2019 the Cat said, waving its right paw round, \u2018lives a Hatter: and in THAT direction,\u2019 waving the other paw, \u2018lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they\u2019re both mad.\u2019 \u2018But I don\u2019t want to go among mad people,\u2019 Alice remarked. \u2018Oh, you can\u2019t help that,\u2019 said the Cat: \u2018we\u2019re all mad here. I\u2019m mad. You\u2019re mad.\u2019 \u2018How do you know I\u2019m mad?\u2019 said Alice. \u2018You must be,\u2019 said the Cat, \u2018or you wouldn\u2019t have come here.\u2019 Alice didn\u2019t think that proved it at all; however, she went on \u2018And how do you know that you\u2019re mad?\u2019 \u2018To begin with,\u2019 said the Cat, \u2018a dog\u2019s not mad. You grant that?\u2019 \u2018I suppose so,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Well, then,\u2019 the Cat went on, \u2018you see, a dog growls when it\u2019s angry, and wags its tail when it\u2019s pleased. Now I growl when I\u2019m pleased, and wag my tail when I\u2019m angry. Therefore I\u2019m mad.\u2019 \u2018I call it purring, not growling,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Call it what you like,\u2019 said the Cat. \u2018Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?\u2019 \u2018I should like it very much,\u2019 said Alice, \u2018but I haven\u2019t been invited yet.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ll see me there,\u2019 said the Cat, and vanished. Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared again. \u2018By-the-bye, what became of the baby?\u2019 said the Cat. \u2018I\u2019d nearly forgotten to ask.\u2019 \u2018It turned into a pig,\u2019 Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural way.", " I almost wish I\u2019d gone to see the Hatter instead!\u2019 CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. \u2018Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,\u2019 thought Alice; \u2018only, as it\u2019s asleep, I suppose it doesn\u2019t mind.\u2019 The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: \u2018No room!

Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. \u2018I don\u2019t see any wine,\u2019 she remarked. \u2018There isn\u2019t any,\u2019 said the March Hare. \u2018Then it wasn\u2019t very civil of you to offer it,\u2019 said Alice angrily. \u2018It wasn\u2019t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,\u2019 said the March Hare. \u2018I didn\u2019t know it was YOUR table,\u2019 said Alice; \u2018it\u2019s laid for a great many more than three.\u2019 \u2018Your hair wants cutting,\u2019 said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech. \u2018You should learn not to make personal remarks,\u2019 Alice said with some severity; \u2018it\u2019s very rude.\u2019 The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he SAID was, \u2018Why is a raven like a writing-desk?\u2019 \u2018Come, we shall have some fun now!\u2019 thought Alice.", " \u2018Nor I,\u2019 said the March Hare. Alice sighed wearily. \u2018I think you might do something better with the time,\u2019 she said, \u2018than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.\u2019 \u2018If you knew Time as well as I do,\u2019 said the Hatter, \u2018you wouldn\u2019t talk about wasting IT. It\u2019s HIM.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know what you mean,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Of course you don\u2019t!\u2019 the Hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously. \u2018I dare say you never even spoke to Time!\u2019 \u2018Perhaps not,\u2019 Alice cautiously replied: \u2018but I know I have to beat time when I learn music.\u2019 \u2018Ah! that accounts for it,\u2019 said the Hatter. \u2018He won\u2019t stand beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he\u2019d do almost anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o\u2019clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons: you\u2019d only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one, time for dinner!\u2019 [\u2018I only wish it was,\u2019 the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.) \u2018That would be grand, certainly,\u2019 said Alice thoughtfully: \u2018but then--I shouldn\u2019t be hungry for it, you know.\u2019 \u2018Not at first, perhaps,\u2019 said the Hatter: \u2018but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked.\u2019 \u2018Is that the way YOU manage?\u2019 Alice asked. The Hatter shook his head mournfully. \u2018Not I!\u2019 he replied. \u2018We quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--\u2019 (pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) \u2018--it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing \u201cTwinkle, twinkle, little bat!", " \u2018I\u2019m glad they\u2019ve begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,\u2019 she added aloud. \u2018Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?\u2019 said the March Hare. \u2018Exactly so,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Then you should say what you mean,\u2019 the March Hare went on. \u2018I do,\u2019 Alice hastily replied; \u2018at least--at least I mean what I say--that\u2019s the same thing, you know.\u2019 \u2018Not the same thing a bit!\u2019 said the Hatter. \u2018You might just as well say that \u201cI see what I eat\u201d is the same thing as \u201cI eat what I see\u201d!\u2019 \u2018You might just as well say,\u2019 added the March Hare, \u2018that \u201cI like what I get\u201d is the same thing as \u201cI get what I like\u201d!\u2019 \u2018You might just as well say,\u2019 added the Dormouse, who seemed to be talking in his sleep, \u2018that \u201cI breathe when I sleep\u201d is the same thing as \u201cI sleep when I breathe\u201d!\u2019 \u2018It IS the same thing with you,\u2019 said the Hatter, and here the conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks, which wasn\u2019t much. The Hatter was the first to break the silence. \u2018What day of the month is it?\u2019 he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then, and holding it to his ear. Alice considered a little, and then said \u2018The fourth.\u2019 \u2018Two days wrong!\u2019 sighed the Hatter. \u2018I told you butter wouldn\u2019t suit the works!\u2019 he added looking angrily at the March Hare."], "On what doesthe Bread-and-butter-fly live?": [" \u2018Give your evidence,\u2019 the King repeated angrily, \u2018or I\u2019ll have you executed, whether you\u2019re nervous or not.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m a poor man, your Majesty,\u2019 the Hatter began, in a trembling voice, \u2018--and I hadn\u2019t begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea--\u2019 \u2018The twinkling of the what?\u2019 said the King. \u2018It began with the tea,\u2019 the Hatter replied. \u2018Of course twinkling begins with a T!\u2019 said the King sharply. \u2018Do you take me for a dunce? Go on!\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m a poor man,\u2019 the Hatter went on, \u2018and most things twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--\u2019 \u2018I didn\u2019t!\u2019 the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry. \u2018You did!\u2019 said the Hatter. \u2018I deny it!\u2019 said the March Hare. \u2018He denies it,\u2019 said the King: \u2018leave out that part.\u2019 \u2018Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--\u2019 the Hatter went on, looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep. \u2018After that,\u2019 continued the Hatter, \u2018I cut some more bread-and-butter--\u2019 \u2018But what did the Dormouse say?\u2019 one of the jury asked. \u2018That I can\u2019t remember,\u2019 said the Hatter. \u2018You MUST remember,\u2019 remarked the King, \u2018or I\u2019ll have you executed.\u2019 The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went down on one knee. \u2018I\u2019m a poor man, your Majesty,\u2019 he began. \u2018You\u2019re a very poor speaker,\u2019 said the King. Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court.", " \u2018Wake up, Dormouse!\u2019 And they pinched it on both sides at once. The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. \u2018I wasn\u2019t asleep,\u2019 he said in a hoarse, feeble voice: \u2018I heard every word you fellows were saying.\u2019 \u2018Tell us a story!\u2019 said the March Hare. \u2018Yes, please do!\u2019 pleaded Alice. \u2018And be quick about it,\u2019 added the Hatter, \u2018or you\u2019ll be asleep again before it\u2019s done.\u2019 \u2018Once upon a time there were three little sisters,\u2019 the Dormouse began in a great hurry; \u2018and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--\u2019 \u2018What did they live on?\u2019 said Alice, who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking. \u2018They lived on treacle,\u2019 said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or two. \u2018They couldn\u2019t have done that, you know,\u2019 Alice gently remarked; \u2018they\u2019d have been ill.\u2019 \u2018So they were,\u2019 said the Dormouse; \u2018VERY ill.\u2019 Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: \u2018But why did they live at the bottom of a well?\u2019 \u2018Take some more tea,\u2019 the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly. \u2018I\u2019ve had nothing yet,\u2019 Alice replied in an offended tone, \u2018so I can\u2019t take more.\u2019 \u2018You mean you can\u2019t take LESS,\u2019 said the Hatter: \u2018it\u2019s very easy to take MORE than nothing.\u2019 \u2018Nobody asked YOUR opinion,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Who\u2019s making personal remarks now?\u2019 the Hatter asked triumphantly. Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and repeated her question.", " \u2018It was the BEST butter,\u2019 the March Hare meekly replied. \u2018Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,\u2019 the Hatter grumbled: \u2018you shouldn\u2019t have put it in with the bread-knife.\u2019 The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, \u2018It was the BEST butter, you know.\u2019 Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. \u2018What a funny watch!\u2019 she remarked. \u2018It tells the day of the month, and doesn\u2019t tell what o\u2019clock it is!\u2019 \u2018Why should it?\u2019 muttered the Hatter. \u2018Does YOUR watch tell you what year it is?\u2019 \u2018Of course not,\u2019 Alice replied very readily: \u2018but that\u2019s because it stays the same year for such a long time together.\u2019 \u2018Which is just the case with MINE,\u2019 said the Hatter. Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter\u2019s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. \u2018I don\u2019t quite understand you,\u2019 she said, as politely as she could. \u2018The Dormouse is asleep again,\u2019 said the Hatter, and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose. The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its eyes, \u2018Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.\u2019 \u2018Have you guessed the riddle yet?\u2019 the Hatter said, turning to Alice again. \u2018No, I give it up,\u2019 Alice replied: \u2018what\u2019s the answer?\u2019 \u2018I haven\u2019t the slightest idea,\u2019 said the Hatter.", " \u2018I keep them to sell,\u2019 the Hatter added as an explanation; \u2018I\u2019ve none of my own. I\u2019m a hatter.\u2019 Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted. \u2018Give your evidence,\u2019 said the King; \u2018and don\u2019t be nervous, or I\u2019ll have you executed on the spot.\u2019 This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter. Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her. \u2018I wish you wouldn\u2019t squeeze so.\u2019 said the Dormouse, who was sitting next to her. \u2018I can hardly breathe.\u2019 \u2018I can\u2019t help it,\u2019 said Alice very meekly: \u2018I\u2019m growing.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ve no right to grow here,\u2019 said the Dormouse. \u2018Don\u2019t talk nonsense,\u2019 said Alice more boldly: \u2018you know you\u2019re growing too.\u2019 \u2018Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,\u2019 said the Dormouse: \u2018not in that ridiculous fashion.\u2019 And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court. All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers of the court, \u2018Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!\u2019 on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off."], "In total, howmany queens are in both stories?": [" \u2018Would you tell me,\u2019 said Alice, a little timidly, \u2018why you are painting those roses?\u2019 Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low voice, \u2018Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we\u2019re doing our best, afore she comes, to--\u2019 At this moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out \u2018The Queen! The Queen!\u2019 and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen. First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King\u2019s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS."], "According toAlice, what is a common feature in the poetry in Throughthe Looking-Glass?": [" \u2018But it\u2019s no use now,\u2019 thought poor Alice, \u2018to pretend to be two people! Why, there\u2019s hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!\u2019 Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words \u2018EAT ME\u2019 were beautifully marked in currants. \u2018Well, I\u2019ll eat it,\u2019 said Alice, \u2018and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I\u2019ll get into the garden, and I don\u2019t care which happens!\u2019 She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, \u2018Which way? Which way?\u2019, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way. So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * CHAPTER II. The Pool of Tears \u2018Curiouser and curiouser!\u2019 cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); \u2018now I\u2019m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!\u2019 (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off).", " She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort. Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit\u2019s--\u2018Pat! Pat! Where are you?\u2019 And then a voice she had never heard before, \u2018Sure then I\u2019m here! Digging for apples, yer honour!\u2019 \u2018Digging for apples, indeed!\u2019 said the Rabbit angrily. \u2018Here! Come and help me out of THIS!\u2019 (Sounds of more broken glass.) \u2018Now tell me, Pat, what\u2019s that in the window?\u2019 \u2018Sure, it\u2019s an arm, yer honour!\u2019 (He pronounced it \u2018arrum.\u2019) \u2018An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole window!\u2019 \u2018Sure, it does, yer honour: but it\u2019s an arm for all that.\u2019 \u2018Well, it\u2019s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!\u2019 There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then; such as, \u2018Sure, I don\u2019t like it, yer honour, at all, at all!\u2019 \u2018Do as I tell you, you coward!\u2019 and at last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. \u2018What a number of cucumber-frames there must be!\u2019 thought Alice. \u2018I wonder what they\u2019ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t want to stay in here any longer!\u2019 She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words: \u2018Where\u2019s the other ladder?--Why, I hadn\u2019t to bring but one; Bill\u2019s got the other--Bill!", " In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story. CHAPTER IV. The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself \u2018The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She\u2019ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?\u2019 Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely. Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, \u2018Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!\u2019 And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made. \u2018He took me for his housemaid,\u2019 she said to herself as she ran. \u2018How surprised he\u2019ll be when he finds out who I am! But I\u2019d better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.\u2019 As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name \u2018W.", " RABBIT\u2019 engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves. \u2018How queer it seems,\u2019 Alice said to herself, \u2018to be going messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah\u2019ll be sending me on messages next!\u2019 And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: \u2018\u201cMiss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!\u201d \u201cComing in a minute, nurse! But I\u2019ve got to see that the mouse doesn\u2019t get out.\u201d Only I don\u2019t think,\u2019 Alice went on, \u2018that they\u2019d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that!\u2019 By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time with the words \u2018DRINK ME,\u2019 but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. \u2018I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,\u2019 she said to herself, \u2018whenever I eat or drink anything; so I\u2019ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it\u2019ll make me grow large again, for really I\u2019m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\u2019 It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken."], "What is the lastthing we see before the Cheshire Cat fades the first time?": [" This time there could be NO mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further. So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood. \u2018If it had grown up,\u2019 she said to herself, \u2018it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.\u2019 And she began thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to herself, \u2018if one only knew the right way to change them--\u2019 when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off. The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect. \u2018Cheshire Puss,\u2019 she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider. \u2018Come, it\u2019s pleased so far,\u2019 thought Alice, and she went on. \u2018Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?\u2019 \u2018That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,\u2019 said the Cat. \u2018I don\u2019t much care where--\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Then it doesn\u2019t matter which way you go,\u2019 said the Cat. \u2018--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,\u2019 Alice added as an explanation. \u2018Oh, you\u2019re sure to do that,\u2019 said the Cat, \u2018if you only walk long enough.\u2019 Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question.", " \u2018I don\u2019t think they play at all fairly,\u2019 Alice began, in rather a complaining tone, \u2018and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can\u2019t hear oneself speak--and they don\u2019t seem to have any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you\u2019ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there\u2019s the arch I\u2019ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have croqueted the Queen\u2019s hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw mine coming!\u2019 \u2018How do you like the Queen?\u2019 said the Cat in a low voice. \u2018Not at all,\u2019 said Alice: \u2018she\u2019s so extremely--\u2019 Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on, \u2018--likely to win, that it\u2019s hardly worth while finishing the game.\u2019 The Queen smiled and passed on. \u2018Who ARE you talking to?\u2019 said the King, going up to Alice, and looking at the Cat\u2019s head with great curiosity. \u2018It\u2019s a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,\u2019 said Alice: \u2018allow me to introduce it.\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t like the look of it at all,\u2019 said the King: \u2018however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019d rather not,\u2019 the Cat remarked. \u2018Don\u2019t be impertinent,\u2019 said the King, \u2018and don\u2019t look at me like that!\u2019 He got behind Alice as he spoke. \u2018A cat may look at a king,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018I\u2019ve read that in some book, but I don\u2019t remember where.\u2019 \u2018Well, it must be removed,\u2019 said the King very decidedly, and he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, \u2018My dear!", " \u2018What sort of people live about here?\u2019 \u2018In THAT direction,\u2019 the Cat said, waving its right paw round, \u2018lives a Hatter: and in THAT direction,\u2019 waving the other paw, \u2018lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they\u2019re both mad.\u2019 \u2018But I don\u2019t want to go among mad people,\u2019 Alice remarked. \u2018Oh, you can\u2019t help that,\u2019 said the Cat: \u2018we\u2019re all mad here. I\u2019m mad. You\u2019re mad.\u2019 \u2018How do you know I\u2019m mad?\u2019 said Alice. \u2018You must be,\u2019 said the Cat, \u2018or you wouldn\u2019t have come here.\u2019 Alice didn\u2019t think that proved it at all; however, she went on \u2018And how do you know that you\u2019re mad?\u2019 \u2018To begin with,\u2019 said the Cat, \u2018a dog\u2019s not mad. You grant that?\u2019 \u2018I suppose so,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Well, then,\u2019 the Cat went on, \u2018you see, a dog growls when it\u2019s angry, and wags its tail when it\u2019s pleased. Now I growl when I\u2019m pleased, and wag my tail when I\u2019m angry. Therefore I\u2019m mad.\u2019 \u2018I call it purring, not growling,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Call it what you like,\u2019 said the Cat. \u2018Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?\u2019 \u2018I should like it very much,\u2019 said Alice, \u2018but I haven\u2019t been invited yet.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ll see me there,\u2019 said the Cat, and vanished. Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer things happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared again. \u2018By-the-bye, what became of the baby?\u2019 said the Cat. \u2018I\u2019d nearly forgotten to ask.\u2019 \u2018It turned into a pig,\u2019 Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural way.", " \u2018I thought it would,\u2019 said the Cat, and vanished again. Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live. \u2018I\u2019ve seen hatters before,\u2019 she said to herself; \u2018the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won\u2019t be raving mad--at least not so mad as it was in March.\u2019 As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree. \u2018Did you say pig, or fig?\u2019 said the Cat. \u2018I said pig,\u2019 replied Alice; \u2018and I wish you wouldn\u2019t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.\u2019 \u2018All right,\u2019 said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone. \u2018Well! I\u2019ve often seen a cat without a grin,\u2019 thought Alice; \u2018but a grin without a cat! It\u2019s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!\u2019 She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself \u2018Suppose it should be raving mad after all!"], "What secret doesthe Gryphon reveal about the Queen of Hearts?": [" \u2018I never saw one, or heard of one,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Come on, then,\u2019 said the Queen, \u2018and he shall tell you his history,\u2019 As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to the company generally, \u2018You are all pardoned.\u2019 \u2018Come, THAT\u2019S a good thing!\u2019 she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered. They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (IF you don\u2019t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) \u2018Up, lazy thing!\u2019 said the Queen, \u2018and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered\u2019; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited. The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled. \u2018What fun!\u2019 said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice. \u2018What IS the fun?\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Why, SHE,\u2019 said the Gryphon. \u2018It\u2019s all her fancy, that: they never executes nobody, you know. Come on!\u2019 \u2018Everybody says \u201ccome on!\u201d here,\u2019 thought Alice, as she went slowly after it: \u2018I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!\u2019 They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break.", " \u2018Would you tell me,\u2019 said Alice, a little timidly, \u2018why you are painting those roses?\u2019 Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low voice, \u2018Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we\u2019re doing our best, afore she comes, to--\u2019 At this moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out \u2018The Queen! The Queen!\u2019 and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen. First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did.

Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King\u2019s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.", " \u2018--you advance twice--\u2019 \u2018Each with a lobster as a partner!\u2019 cried the Gryphon. \u2018Of course,\u2019 the Mock Turtle said: \u2018advance twice, set to partners--\u2019 \u2018--change lobsters, and retire in same order,\u2019 continued the Gryphon. \u2018Then, you know,\u2019 the Mock Turtle went on, \u2018you throw the--\u2019 \u2018The lobsters!\u2019 shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air. \u2018--as far out to sea as you can--\u2019 \u2018Swim after them!\u2019 screamed the Gryphon. \u2018Turn a somersault in the sea!\u2019 cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly about. \u2018Change lobsters again!\u2019 yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice. \u2018Back to land again, and that\u2019s all the first figure,\u2019 said the Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice. \u2018It must be a very pretty dance,\u2019 said Alice timidly. \u2018Would you like to see a little of it?\u2019 said the Mock Turtle. \u2018Very much indeed,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Come, let\u2019s try the first figure!\u2019 said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon. \u2018We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?\u2019 \u2018Oh, YOU sing,\u2019 said the Gryphon. \u2018I\u2019ve forgotten the words.\u2019 So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly and sadly:-- \u2018\u201cWill you walk a little faster?\u201d said a whiting to a snail.", " \u2018I don\u2019t know where Dinn may be,\u2019 said the Mock Turtle, \u2018but if you\u2019ve seen them so often, of course you know what they\u2019re like.\u2019 \u2018I believe so,\u2019 Alice replied thoughtfully. \u2018They have their tails in their mouths--and they\u2019re all over crumbs.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re wrong about the crumbs,\u2019 said the Mock Turtle: \u2018crumbs would all wash off in the sea. But they HAVE their tails in their mouths; and the reason is--\u2019 here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes.--\u2018Tell her about the reason and all that,\u2019 he said to the Gryphon. \u2018The reason is,\u2019 said the Gryphon, \u2018that they WOULD go with the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn\u2019t get them out again. That\u2019s all.\u2019 \u2018Thank you,\u2019 said Alice, \u2018it\u2019s very interesting. I never knew so much about a whiting before.\u2019 \u2018I can tell you more than that, if you like,\u2019 said the Gryphon. \u2018Do you know why it\u2019s called a whiting?\u2019 \u2018I never thought about it,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Why?\u2019 \u2018IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.\u2019 the Gryphon replied very solemnly. Alice was thoroughly puzzled. \u2018Does the boots and shoes!\u2019 she repeated in a wondering tone. \u2018Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?\u2019 said the Gryphon. \u2018I mean, what makes them so shiny?\u2019 Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her answer. \u2018They\u2019re done with blacking, I believe.\u2019 \u2018Boots and shoes under the sea,\u2019 the Gryphon went on in a deep voice, \u2018are done with a whiting."], "What piece ofclothing does Alice fasten for the White Queen?": [" Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm. \u2018A fine day, your Majesty!\u2019 the Duchess began in a low, weak voice. \u2018Now, I give you fair warning,\u2019 shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she spoke; \u2018either you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time! Take your choice!\u2019 The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment. \u2018Let\u2019s go on with the game,\u2019 the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the croquet-ground. The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen\u2019s absence, and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment\u2019s delay would cost them their lives. All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players, and shouting \u2018Off with his head!\u2019 or \u2018Off with her head!\u2019 Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of execution. Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, \u2018Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?\u2019 \u2018No,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018I don\u2019t even know what a Mock Turtle is.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,\u2019 said the Queen.", " The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said \u2018Consider, my dear: she is only a child!\u2019 The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave \u2018Turn them over!\u2019 The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot. \u2018Get up!\u2019 said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else. \u2018Leave off that!\u2019 screamed the Queen. \u2018You make me giddy.\u2019 And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, \u2018What HAVE you been doing here?\u2019 \u2018May it please your Majesty,\u2019 said Two, in a very humble tone, going down on one knee as he spoke, \u2018we were trying--\u2019 \u2018I see!\u2019 said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses. \u2018Off with their heads!\u2019 and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection. \u2018You shan\u2019t be beheaded!\u2019 said Alice, and she put them into a large flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others. \u2018Are their heads off?\u2019 shouted the Queen. \u2018Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!\u2019 the soldiers shouted in reply. \u2018That\u2019s right!\u2019 shouted the Queen. \u2018Can you play croquet?\u2019 The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was evidently meant for her. \u2018Yes!\u2019 shouted Alice.", " \u2018Would you tell me,\u2019 said Alice, a little timidly, \u2018why you are painting those roses?\u2019 Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low voice, \u2018Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So you see, Miss, we\u2019re doing our best, afore she comes, to--\u2019 At this moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out \u2018The Queen! The Queen!\u2019 and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen. First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did.

Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King\u2019s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.", " Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions; \u2018and besides, what would be the use of a procession,\u2019 thought she, \u2018if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn\u2019t see it?\u2019 So she stood still where she was, and waited. When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely \u2018Who is this?\u2019 She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply. \u2018Idiot!\u2019 said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to Alice, she went on, \u2018What\u2019s your name, child?\u2019 \u2018My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,\u2019 said Alice very politely; but she added, to herself, \u2018Why, they\u2019re only a pack of cards, after all. I needn\u2019t be afraid of them!\u2019 \u2018And who are THESE?\u2019 said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children. \u2018How should I know?\u2019 said Alice, surprised at her own courage. \u2018It\u2019s no business of MINE.\u2019 The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast, screamed \u2018Off with her head! Off--\u2019 \u2018Nonsense!\u2019 said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent."], "Which two charactersfrom Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland reappearwith different names in Through the Looking-Glass?": [" Now you know.\u2019 \u2018And what are they made of?\u2019 Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity. \u2018Soles and eels, of course,\u2019 the Gryphon replied rather impatiently: \u2018any shrimp could have told you that.\u2019 \u2018If I\u2019d been the whiting,\u2019 said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the song, \u2018I\u2019d have said to the porpoise, \u201cKeep back, please: we don\u2019t want YOU with us!\u201d\u2019 \u2018They were obliged to have him with them,\u2019 the Mock Turtle said: \u2018no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.\u2019 \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it really?\u2019 said Alice in a tone of great surprise. \u2018Of course not,\u2019 said the Mock Turtle: \u2018why, if a fish came to ME, and told me he was going a journey, I should say \u201cWith what porpoise?\u201d\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t you mean \u201cpurpose\u201d?\u2019 said Alice. \u2018I mean what I say,\u2019 the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And the Gryphon added \u2018Come, let\u2019s hear some of YOUR adventures.\u2019 \u2018I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,\u2019 said Alice a little timidly: \u2018but it\u2019s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.\u2019 \u2018Explain all that,\u2019 said the Mock Turtle. \u2018No, no! The adventures first,\u2019 said the Gryphon in an impatient tone: \u2018explanations take such a dreadful time.\u2019 So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she went on.", " *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ALICE\u2019S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND *** ALICE\u2019S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND Lewis Carroll THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 3.0 CHAPTER I. Down the Rabbit-Hole Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, \u2018and what is the use of a book,\u2019 thought Alice \u2018without pictures or conversations?\u2019 So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \u2018Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!\u2019 (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.", " Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating \u2018YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,\u2019 to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said \u2018That\u2019s very curious.\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s all about as curious as it can be,\u2019 said the Gryphon. \u2018It all came different!\u2019 the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. \u2018I should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her to begin.\u2019 He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice. \u2018Stand up and repeat \u201c\u2018TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,\u201d\u2019 said the Gryphon. \u2018How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!\u2019 thought Alice; \u2018I might as well be at school at once.\u2019 However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came very queer indeed:-- \u2018\u2019Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare, \u201cYou have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.\u201d As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.\u2019 [later editions continued as follows When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark, And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark, But, when the tide rises and sharks are around, His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.] \u2018That\u2019s different from what I used to say when I was a child,\u2019 said the Gryphon.", " \u2018No, no!\u2019 said the Queen. \u2018Sentence first--verdict afterwards.\u2019 \u2018Stuff and nonsense!\u2019 said Alice loudly. \u2018The idea of having the sentence first!\u2019 \u2018Hold your tongue!\u2019 said the Queen, turning purple. \u2018I won\u2019t!\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Off with her head!\u2019 the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody moved. \u2018Who cares for you?\u2019 said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by this time.) \u2018You\u2019re nothing but a pack of cards!\u2019 At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face. \u2018Wake up, Alice dear!\u2019 said her sister; \u2018Why, what a long sleep you\u2019ve had!\u2019 \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve had such a curious dream!\u2019 said Alice, and she told her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, \u2018It WAS a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it\u2019s getting late.\u2019 So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been. But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:-- First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sister\u2019s dream."], "Which charactertakes Alice through the forest in Through the Looking-Glass?": [" She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort. Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit\u2019s--\u2018Pat! Pat! Where are you?\u2019 And then a voice she had never heard before, \u2018Sure then I\u2019m here! Digging for apples, yer honour!\u2019 \u2018Digging for apples, indeed!\u2019 said the Rabbit angrily. \u2018Here! Come and help me out of THIS!\u2019 (Sounds of more broken glass.) \u2018Now tell me, Pat, what\u2019s that in the window?\u2019 \u2018Sure, it\u2019s an arm, yer honour!\u2019 (He pronounced it \u2018arrum.\u2019) \u2018An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole window!\u2019 \u2018Sure, it does, yer honour: but it\u2019s an arm for all that.\u2019 \u2018Well, it\u2019s got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!\u2019 There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then; such as, \u2018Sure, I don\u2019t like it, yer honour, at all, at all!\u2019 \u2018Do as I tell you, you coward!\u2019 and at last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. \u2018What a number of cucumber-frames there must be!\u2019 thought Alice. \u2018I wonder what they\u2019ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t want to stay in here any longer!\u2019 She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words: \u2018Where\u2019s the other ladder?--Why, I hadn\u2019t to bring but one; Bill\u2019s got the other--Bill!", " In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story. CHAPTER IV. The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself \u2018The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She\u2019ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?\u2019 Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely. Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, \u2018Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!\u2019 And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made. \u2018He took me for his housemaid,\u2019 she said to herself as she ran. \u2018How surprised he\u2019ll be when he finds out who I am! But I\u2019d better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.\u2019 As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name \u2018W.", " RABBIT\u2019 engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves. \u2018How queer it seems,\u2019 Alice said to herself, \u2018to be going messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah\u2019ll be sending me on messages next!\u2019 And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: \u2018\u201cMiss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!\u201d \u201cComing in a minute, nurse! But I\u2019ve got to see that the mouse doesn\u2019t get out.\u201d Only I don\u2019t think,\u2019 Alice went on, \u2018that they\u2019d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that!\u2019 By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time with the words \u2018DRINK ME,\u2019 but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. \u2018I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,\u2019 she said to herself, \u2018whenever I eat or drink anything; so I\u2019ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it\u2019ll make me grow large again, for really I\u2019m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\u2019 It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken.", " First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; \u2018for it might end, you know,\u2019 said Alice to herself, \u2018in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?\u2019 And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing. After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried. \u2018Come, there\u2019s no use in crying like that!\u2019 said Alice to herself, rather sharply; \u2018I advise you to leave off this minute!\u2019 She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people."], "Which flowerfirst speaks to Alice in Through the Looking-Glass?": [" She did not get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.

I\u2019m sure I don\u2019t want to stay in here any longer!\u2019 She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together: she made out the words: \u2018Where\u2019s the other ladder?--Why, I hadn\u2019t to bring but one; Bill\u2019s got the other--Bill!", " In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finish his story. CHAPTER IV. The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering to itself \u2018The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She\u2019ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?\u2019 Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely. Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called out to her in an angry tone, \u2018Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing out here? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick, now!\u2019 And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made. \u2018He took me for his housemaid,\u2019 she said to herself as she ran. \u2018How surprised he\u2019ll be when he finds out who I am! But I\u2019d better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.\u2019 As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name \u2018W.", " RABBIT\u2019 engraved upon it. She went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves. \u2018How queer it seems,\u2019 Alice said to herself, \u2018to be going messages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah\u2019ll be sending me on messages next!\u2019 And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: \u2018\u201cMiss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!\u201d \u201cComing in a minute, nurse! But I\u2019ve got to see that the mouse doesn\u2019t get out.\u201d Only I don\u2019t think,\u2019 Alice went on, \u2018that they\u2019d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that!\u2019 By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass. There was no label this time with the words \u2018DRINK ME,\u2019 but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. \u2018I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,\u2019 she said to herself, \u2018whenever I eat or drink anything; so I\u2019ll just see what this bottle does. I do hope it\u2019ll make me grow large again, for really I\u2019m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!\u2019 It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken.", " First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; \u2018for it might end, you know,\u2019 said Alice to herself, \u2018in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?\u2019 And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing. After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried. \u2018Come, there\u2019s no use in crying like that!\u2019 said Alice to herself, rather sharply; \u2018I advise you to leave off this minute!\u2019 She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people."], "Which characterexplains \u201cJabberwocky\u201d to Alice?": [" I almost wish I\u2019d gone to see the Hatter instead!\u2019 CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. \u2018Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,\u2019 thought Alice; \u2018only, as it\u2019s asleep, I suppose it doesn\u2019t mind.\u2019 The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: \u2018No room! No room!\u2019 they cried out when they saw Alice coming. \u2018There\u2019s PLENTY of room!\u2019 said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table. \u2018Have some wine,\u2019 the March Hare said in an encouraging tone. Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. \u2018I don\u2019t see any wine,\u2019 she remarked. \u2018There isn\u2019t any,\u2019 said the March Hare. \u2018Then it wasn\u2019t very civil of you to offer it,\u2019 said Alice angrily. \u2018It wasn\u2019t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,\u2019 said the March Hare. \u2018I didn\u2019t know it was YOUR table,\u2019 said Alice; \u2018it\u2019s laid for a great many more than three.\u2019 \u2018Your hair wants cutting,\u2019 said the Hatter. He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech. \u2018You should learn not to make personal remarks,\u2019 Alice said with some severity; \u2018it\u2019s very rude.\u2019 The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he SAID was, \u2018Why is a raven like a writing-desk?\u2019 \u2018Come, we shall have some fun now!\u2019 thought Alice.", " \u2018Wake up, Dormouse!\u2019 And they pinched it on both sides at once. The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. \u2018I wasn\u2019t asleep,\u2019 he said in a hoarse, feeble voice: \u2018I heard every word you fellows were saying.\u2019 \u2018Tell us a story!\u2019 said the March Hare. \u2018Yes, please do!\u2019 pleaded Alice. \u2018And be quick about it,\u2019 added the Hatter, \u2018or you\u2019ll be asleep again before it\u2019s done.\u2019 \u2018Once upon a time there were three little sisters,\u2019 the Dormouse began in a great hurry; \u2018and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--\u2019 \u2018What did they live on?\u2019 said Alice, who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking. \u2018They lived on treacle,\u2019 said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or two. \u2018They couldn\u2019t have done that, you know,\u2019 Alice gently remarked; \u2018they\u2019d have been ill.\u2019 \u2018So they were,\u2019 said the Dormouse; \u2018VERY ill.\u2019 Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: \u2018But why did they live at the bottom of a well?\u2019 \u2018Take some more tea,\u2019 the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly. \u2018I\u2019ve had nothing yet,\u2019 Alice replied in an offended tone, \u2018so I can\u2019t take more.\u2019 \u2018You mean you can\u2019t take LESS,\u2019 said the Hatter: \u2018it\u2019s very easy to take MORE than nothing.\u2019 \u2018Nobody asked YOUR opinion,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Who\u2019s making personal remarks now?\u2019 the Hatter asked triumphantly. Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and repeated her question.", " Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions; \u2018and besides, what would be the use of a procession,\u2019 thought she, \u2018if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn\u2019t see it?\u2019 So she stood still where she was, and waited. When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her, and the Queen said severely \u2018Who is this?\u2019 She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply. \u2018Idiot!\u2019 said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to Alice, she went on, \u2018What\u2019s your name, child?\u2019 \u2018My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,\u2019 said Alice very politely; but she added, to herself, \u2018Why, they\u2019re only a pack of cards, after all. I needn\u2019t be afraid of them!\u2019 \u2018And who are THESE?\u2019 said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her own children. \u2018How should I know?\u2019 said Alice, surprised at her own courage. \u2018It\u2019s no business of MINE.\u2019 The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast, screamed \u2018Off with her head! Off--\u2019 \u2018Nonsense!\u2019 said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent.", " \u2018I never saw one, or heard of one,\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Come on, then,\u2019 said the Queen, \u2018and he shall tell you his history,\u2019 As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to the company generally, \u2018You are all pardoned.\u2019 \u2018Come, THAT\u2019S a good thing!\u2019 she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered. They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (IF you don\u2019t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) \u2018Up, lazy thing!\u2019 said the Queen, \u2018and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered\u2019; and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon. Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen: so she waited. The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight: then it chuckled. \u2018What fun!\u2019 said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice. \u2018What IS the fun?\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Why, SHE,\u2019 said the Gryphon. \u2018It\u2019s all her fancy, that: they never executes nobody, you know. Come on!\u2019 \u2018Everybody says \u201ccome on!\u201d here,\u2019 thought Alice, as she went slowly after it: \u2018I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!\u2019 They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break."], "What does theWhite Knight consider (to be) his most clever invention? (this questionis not discussed in detail in the summary)": [" \u2018I haven\u2019t opened it yet,\u2019 said the White Rabbit, \u2018but it seems to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.\u2019 \u2018It must have been that,\u2019 said the King, \u2018unless it was written to nobody, which isn\u2019t usual, you know.\u2019 \u2018Who is it directed to?\u2019 said one of the jurymen. \u2018It isn\u2019t directed at all,\u2019 said the White Rabbit; \u2018in fact, there\u2019s nothing written on the OUTSIDE.\u2019 He unfolded the paper as he spoke, and added \u2018It isn\u2019t a letter, after all: it\u2019s a set of verses.\u2019 \u2018Are they in the prisoner\u2019s handwriting?\u2019 asked another of the jurymen. \u2018No, they\u2019re not,\u2019 said the White Rabbit, \u2018and that\u2019s the queerest thing about it.\u2019 (The jury all looked puzzled.) \u2018He must have imitated somebody else\u2019s hand,\u2019 said the King. (The jury all brightened up again.) \u2018Please your Majesty,\u2019 said the Knave, \u2018I didn\u2019t write it, and they can\u2019t prove I did: there\u2019s no name signed at the end.\u2019 \u2018If you didn\u2019t sign it,\u2019 said the King, \u2018that only makes the matter worse. You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you\u2019d have signed your name like an honest man.\u2019 There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever thing the King had said that day. \u2018That PROVES his guilt,\u2019 said the Queen. \u2018It proves nothing of the sort!\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Why, you don\u2019t even know what they\u2019re about!\u2019 \u2018Read them,\u2019 said the King. The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. \u2018Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?\u2019 he asked.", " And yet I don\u2019t know,\u2019 he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them with one eye; \u2018I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. \u201c--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--\u201d you can\u2019t swim, can you?\u2019 he added, turning to the Knave. The Knave shook his head sadly. \u2018Do I look like it?\u2019 he said. (Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.) \u2018All right, so far,\u2019 said the King, and he went on muttering over the verses to himself: \u2018\u201cWE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--\u201d that\u2019s the jury, of course--\u201cI GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--\u201d why, that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--\u2019 \u2018But, it goes on \u201cTHEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,\u201d\u2019 said Alice. \u2018Why, there they are!\u2019 said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts on the table. \u2018Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then again--\u201cBEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--\u201d you never had fits, my dear, I think?\u2019 he said to the Queen. \u2018Never!\u2019 said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.) \u2018Then the words don\u2019t FIT you,\u2019 said the King, looking round the court with a smile. There was a dead silence. \u2018It\u2019s a pun!\u2019 the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed, \u2018Let the jury consider their verdict,\u2019 the King said, for about the twentieth time that day.", " The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said \u2018Consider, my dear: she is only a child!\u2019 The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave \u2018Turn them over!\u2019 The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot. \u2018Get up!\u2019 said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else. \u2018Leave off that!\u2019 screamed the Queen. \u2018You make me giddy.\u2019 And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, \u2018What HAVE you been doing here?\u2019 \u2018May it please your Majesty,\u2019 said Two, in a very humble tone, going down on one knee as he spoke, \u2018we were trying--\u2019 \u2018I see!\u2019 said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses. \u2018Off with their heads!\u2019 and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection. \u2018You shan\u2019t be beheaded!\u2019 said Alice, and she put them into a large flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others. \u2018Are their heads off?\u2019 shouted the Queen. \u2018Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!\u2019 the soldiers shouted in reply. \u2018That\u2019s right!\u2019 shouted the Queen. \u2018Can you play croquet?\u2019 The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was evidently meant for her. \u2018Yes!\u2019 shouted Alice.", " \u2018Herald, read the accusation!\u2019 said the King. On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:-- \u2018The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts, All on a summer day: The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts, And took them quite away!\u2019 \u2018Consider your verdict,\u2019 the King said to the jury. \u2018Not yet, not yet!\u2019 the Rabbit hastily interrupted. \u2018There\u2019s a great deal to come before that!\u2019 \u2018Call the first witness,\u2019 said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, \u2018First witness!\u2019 The first witness was the Hatter.

Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off with his whiskers!\u2019 For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared. \u2018Never mind!\u2019 said the King, with an air of great relief. \u2018Call the next witness.\u2019 And he added in an undertone to the Queen, \u2018Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness. It quite makes my forehead ache!\u2019 Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like, \u2018--for they haven\u2019t got much evidence YET,\u2019 she said to herself.

Down the Rabbit-Hole Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, \u2018and what is the use of a book,\u2019 thought Alice \u2018without pictures or conversations?\u2019 So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her. There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, \u2018Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!\u2019 (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.", " And yet I don\u2019t know,\u2019 he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at them with one eye; \u2018I seem to see some meaning in them, after all. \u201c--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--\u201d you can\u2019t swim, can you?\u2019 he added, turning to the Knave.

There was a dead silence. \u2018It\u2019s a pun!\u2019 the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed, \u2018Let the jury consider their verdict,\u2019 the King said, for about the twentieth time that day.", " Now you know.\u2019 \u2018And what are they made of?\u2019 Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity. \u2018Soles and eels, of course,\u2019 the Gryphon replied rather impatiently: \u2018any shrimp could have told you that.\u2019 \u2018If I\u2019d been the whiting,\u2019 said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the song, \u2018I\u2019d have said to the porpoise, \u201cKeep back, please: we don\u2019t want YOU with us!\u201d\u2019 \u2018They were obliged to have him with them,\u2019 the Mock Turtle said: \u2018no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.\u2019 \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it really?\u2019 said Alice in a tone of great surprise. \u2018Of course not,\u2019 said the Mock Turtle: \u2018why, if a fish came to ME, and told me he was going a journey, I should say \u201cWith what porpoise?\u201d\u2019 \u2018Don\u2019t you mean \u201cpurpose\u201d?\u2019 said Alice. \u2018I mean what I say,\u2019 the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone. And the Gryphon added \u2018Come, let\u2019s hear some of YOUR adventures.\u2019 \u2018I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,\u2019 said Alice a little timidly: \u2018but it\u2019s no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.\u2019 \u2018Explain all that,\u2019 said the Mock Turtle. \u2018No, no! The adventures first,\u2019 said the Gryphon in an impatient tone: \u2018explanations take such a dreadful time.\u2019 So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she gained courage as she went on."]}
