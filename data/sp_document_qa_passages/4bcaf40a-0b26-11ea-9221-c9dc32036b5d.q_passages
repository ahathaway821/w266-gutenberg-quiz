{"What is Carrie Meeber\u2019s social status by the end of the novel?": [" \u201cUm\u2014yes. What is your name?\u201d \u201cCarrie Meeber.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said he. \u201cYou come with me.\u201d He led the way through dark, box-lined aisles which had the smell of new shoes, until they came to an iron door which opened into the factory proper. There was a large, low-ceiled room, with clacking, rattling machines at which men in white shirt sleeves and blue gingham aprons were working. She followed him diffidently through the clattering automatons, keeping her eyes straight before her, and flushing slightly. They crossed to a far corner and took an elevator to the sixth floor. Out of the array of machines and benches, Mr. Brown signalled a foreman. \u201cThis is the girl,\u201d he said, and turning to Carrie, \u201cYou go with him.\u201d He then returned, and Carrie followed her new superior to a little desk in a corner, which he used as a kind of official centre. \u201cYou\u2019ve never worked at anything like this before, have you?\u201d he questioned, rather sternly.", " Minnie tried to talk with her during breakfast, but there was not much of interest which they could mutually discuss. As on the previous morning, Carrie walked down town, for she began to realise now that her four-fifty would not even allow her car fare after she paid her board. This seemed a miserable arrangement. But the morning light swept away the first misgivings of the day, as morning light is ever wont to do. At the shoe factory she put in a long day, scarcely so wearisome as the preceding, but considerably less novel. The head foreman, on his round, stopped by her machine. \u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d he inquired. \u201cMr. Brown hired me,\u201d she replied. \u201cOh, he did, eh!\u201d and then, \u201cSee that you keep things going.\u201d The machine girls impressed her even less favourably. They seemed satisfied with their lot, and were in a sense \u201ccommon.\u201d Carrie had more imagination than they. She was not used to slang.", " It disposed her pleasantly toward all he might do. He took out a neat business card, on which was engraved Bartlett, Caryoe & Company, and down in the left-hand corner, Chas. H. Drouet. \u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d he said, putting the card in her hand and touching his name. \u201cIt\u2019s pronounced Drew-eh. Our family was French, on my father\u2019s side.\u201d She looked at it while he put up his purse. Then he got out a letter from a bunch in his coat pocket. \u201cThis is the house I travel for,\u201d he went on, pointing to a picture on it, \u201ccorner of State and Lake.\u201d There was pride in his voice. He felt that it was something to be connected with such a place, and he made her feel that way. \u201cWhat is your address?\u201d he began again, fixing his pencil to write. She looked at his hand. \u201cCarrie Meeber,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cThree hundred and fifty-four West Van Buren Street, care S. C. Hanson.\u201d He wrote it carefully down and got out the purse again.", " It was on the third floor, the front windows looking down into the street, where, at night, the lights of grocery stores were shining and children were playing. To Carrie, the sound of the little bells upon the horse-cars, as they tinkled in and out of hearing, was as pleasing as it was novel. She gazed into the lighted street when Minnie brought her into the front room, and wondered at the sounds, the movement, the murmur of the vast city which stretched for miles and miles in every direction. Mrs. Hanson, after the first greetings were over, gave Carrie the baby and proceeded to get supper. Her husband asked a few questions and sat down to read the evening paper. He was a silent man, American born, of a Swede father, and now employed as a cleaner of refrigerator cars at the stock-yards. To him the presence or absence of his wife\u2019s sister was a matter of indifference. Her personal appearance did not affect him one way or the other."], "What is George Hurstwood\u2019s social status by the end of the novel?": [" Hurstwood nodded to the politicians and went into his office. About ten o\u2019clock a friend of his, Mr. Frank L. Taintor, a local sport and racing man, dropped in, and seeing Hurstwood alone in his office came to the door. \u201cHello, George!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cHow are you, Frank?\u201d said Hurstwood, somewhat relieved by the sight of him. \u201cSit down,\u201d and he motioned him to one of the chairs in the little room. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, George?\u201d asked Taintor. \u201cYou look a little glum. Haven\u2019t lost at the track, have you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not feeling very well to-night. I had a slight cold the other day.\u201d \u201cTake whiskey, George,\u201d said Taintor. \u201cYou ought to know that.\u201d Hurstwood smiled. While they were still conferring there, several other of Hurstwood\u2019s friends entered, and not long after eleven, the theatres being out, some actors began to drop in\u2014among them some notabilities. Then began one of those pointless social conversations so common in American resorts where the would-be _gilded_ attempt to rub off gilt from those who have it in abundance.", " Perhaps she would be happy. These thoughts raised her above the level of erring. She was saved in that she was hopeful. The following morning the train pulled safely into Montreal and they stepped down, Hurstwood glad to be out of danger, Carrie wondering at the novel atmosphere of the northern city. Long before, Hurstwood had been here, and now he remembered the name of the hotel at which he had stopped. As they came out of the main entrance of the depot he heard it called anew by a busman. \u201cWe\u2019ll go right up and get rooms,\u201d he said. At the clerk\u2019s office Hurstwood swung the register about while the clerk came forward. He was thinking what name he would put down. With the latter before him he found no time for hesitation. A name he had seen out of the car window came swiftly to him. It was pleasing enough. With an easy hand he wrote, \u201cG. W. Murdock and wife.\u201d It was the largest concession to necessity he felt like making.", " \u201cYes,\u201d said young George. \u201cWho with?\u201d \u201cMiss Carmichael.\u201d Mrs. Hurstwood directed an inquiring glance at her husband, but could not judge from his appearance whether it was any more than a casual look into the theatre which was referred to. \u201cHow was the play?\u201d she inquired. \u201cVery good,\u201d returned Hurstwood, \u201conly it\u2019s the same old thing, \u2018Rip Van Winkle.\u2019\u201d \u201cWhom did you go with?\u201d queried his wife, with assumed indifference. \u201cCharlie Drouet and his wife. They are friends of Moy\u2019s, visiting here.\u201d Owing to the peculiar nature of his position, such a disclosure as this would ordinarily create no difficulty. His wife took it for granted that his situation called for certain social movements in which she might not be included. But of late he had pleaded office duty on several occasions when his wife asked for his company to any evening entertainment. He had done so in regard to the very evening in question only the morning before.", " \u201cOh, all right.\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in six weeks. When did you get in?\u201d \u201cFriday,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cHad a fine trip.\u201d \u201cGlad of it,\u201d said Hurstwood, his black eyes lit with a warmth which half displaced the cold make-believe that usually dwelt in them. \u201cWhat are you going to take?\u201d he added, as the barkeeper, in snowy jacket and tie, leaned toward them from behind the bar. \u201cOld Pepper,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cA little of the same for me,\u201d put in Hurstwood. \u201cHow long are you in town this time?\u201d inquired Hurstwood. \u201cOnly until Wednesday. I\u2019m going up to St. Paul.\u201d \u201cGeorge Evans was in here Saturday and said he saw you in Milwaukee last week.\u201d \u201cYes, I saw George,\u201d returned Drouet. \u201cGreat old boy, isn\u2019t he? We had quite a time there together.\u201d The barkeeper was setting out the glasses and bottle before them, and they now poured out the draught as they talked, Drouet filling his to within a third of full, as was considered proper, and Hurstwood taking the barest suggestion of whiskey and modifying it with seltzer."], "What factor most determines the fortunes of Carrie and Hurstwood?": [" You\u2019ll let me tell you, won\u2019t you?\u201d Carrie seemed not to listen. She only turned her head toward the window, where outside all was black. The train was speeding with steady grace across the fields and through patches of wood. The long whistles came with sad, musical effect as the lonely woodland crossings were approached. Now the conductor entered the car and took up the one or two fares that had been added at Chicago. He approached Hurstwood, who handed out the tickets. Poised as she was to act, Carrie made no move. She did not look about. When the conductor had gone again Hurstwood felt relieved. \u201cYou\u2019re angry at me because I deceived you,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to, Carrie. As I live I didn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t help it. I couldn\u2019t stay away from you after the first time I saw you.\u201d He was ignoring the last deception as something that might go by the board. He wanted to convince her that his wife could no longer be a factor in their relationship.", " \u201cIt seems to be such a large company,\u201d she said, at one place. \u201cGreat big plate-glass windows and lots of clerks. The man I saw said they hired ever so many people.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not very hard to get work now,\u201d put in Hanson, \u201cif you look right.\u201d Minnie, under the warming influence of Carrie\u2019s good spirits and her husband\u2019s somewhat conversational mood, began to tell Carrie of some of the well-known things to see\u2014things the enjoyment of which cost nothing. \u201cYou\u2019d like to see Michigan Avenue. There are such fine houses. It is such a fine street.\u201d \u201cWhere is H. R. Jacob\u2019s?\u201d interrupted Carrie, mentioning one of the theatres devoted to melodrama which went by that name at the time. \u201cOh, it\u2019s not very far from here,\u201d answered Minnie. \u201cIt\u2019s in Halstead Street, right up here.\u201d \u201cHow I\u2019d like to go there. I crossed Halstead Street to-day, didn\u2019t I?\u201d At this there was a slight halt in the natural reply. Thoughts are a strangely permeating factor.", " The thought had taken a mighty hold upon her. It hummed in her ears as the melody of an old song. Outside in the little lobby another scene was being enacted. Without the interest of Hurstwood, the little hall would probably have been comfortably filled, for the members of the lodge were moderately interested in its welfare. Hurstwood\u2019s word, however, had gone the rounds. It was to be a full-dress affair. The four boxes had been taken. Dr. Norman McNeill Hale and his wife were to occupy one. This was quite a card. C. R. Walker, dry-goods merchant and possessor of at least two hundred thousand dollars, had taken another; a well-known coal merchant had been induced to take the third, and Hurstwood and his friends the fourth. Among the latter was Drouet. The people who were now pouring here were not celebrities, nor even local notabilities, in a general sense. They were the lights of a certain circle\u2014the circle of small fortunes and secret order distinctions.", " He had been seen at the theatre with people whom he called Moy\u2019s friends; now he was seen driving, and, most likely, would have an excuse for that. Perhaps there were others of whom she did not hear, or why should he be so busy, so indifferent, of late? In the last six weeks he had become strangely irritable\u2014strangely satisfied to pick up and go out, whether things were right or wrong in the house. Why? She recalled, with more subtle emotions, that he did not look at her now with any of the old light of satisfaction or approval in his eye. Evidently, along with other things, he was taking her to be getting old and uninteresting. He saw her wrinkles, perhaps. She was fading, while he was still preening himself in his elegance and youth. He was still an interested factor in the merry-makings of the world, while she\u2014but she did not pursue the thought. She only found the whole situation bitter, and hated him for it thoroughly."], "In Dreiser\u2019s depiction, what element of social life is subject to constant change?": [" Constant comparison between his old state and his new showed a balance for the worse, which produced a constant state of gloom or, at least, depression. Now, it has been shown experimentally that a constantly subdued frame of mind produces certain poisons in the blood, called katastates, just as virtuous feelings of pleasure and delight produce helpful chemicals called anastates. The poisons generated by remorse inveigh against the system, and eventually produce marked physical deterioration. To these Hurstwood was subject. In the course of time it told upon his temper. His eye no longer possessed that buoyant, searching shrewdness which had characterised it in Adams Street. His step was not as sharp and firm. He was given to thinking, thinking, thinking. The new friends he made were not celebrities. They were of a cheaper, a slightly more sensual and cruder, grade. He could not possibly take the pleasure in this company that he had in that of those fine frequenters of the Chicago resort.", " On this occasion, the ex-manager ate his as he went plodding the dark streets in silence to his bed. By January he had about concluded that the game was up with him. Life had always seemed a precious thing, but now constant want and weakened vitality had made the charms of earth rather dull and inconspicuous. Several times, when fortune pressed most harshly, he thought he would end his troubles; but with a change of weather, or the arrival of a quarter or a dime, his mood would change, and he would wait. Each day he would find some old paper lying about and look into it, to see if there was any trace of Carrie, but all summer and fall he had looked in vain. Then he noticed that his eyes were beginning to hurt him, and this ailment rapidly increased until, in the dark chambers of the lodgings he frequented, he did not attempt to read. Bad and irregular eating was weakening every function of his body.", " They were people of a sort very common in America to-day, who live respectably from hand to mouth. Hale received a salary of forty-five dollars a week. His wife, quite attractive, affected the feeling of youth, and objected to that sort of home life which means the care of a house and the raising of a family. Like Drouet and Carrie, they also occupied three rooms on the floor above. Not long after she arrived Mrs. Hale established social relations with her, and together they went about. For a long time this was her only companionship, and the gossip of the manager\u2019s wife formed the medium through which she saw the world. Such trivialities, such praises of wealth, such conventional expression of morals as sifted through this passive creature\u2019s mind, fell upon Carrie and for the while confused her. On the other hand, her own feelings were a corrective influence. The constant drag to something better was not to be denied.", " There was no love lost between them. There was no great feeling of dissatisfaction. Her opinion on any subject was not startling. They did not talk enough together to come to the argument of any one point. In the accepted and popular phrase, she had her ideas and he had his. Once in a while he would meet a woman whose youth, sprightliness, and humour would make his wife seem rather deficient by contrast, but the temporary dissatisfaction which such an encounter might arouse would be counterbalanced by his social position and a certain matter of policy. He could not complicate his home life, because it might affect his relations with his employers. They wanted no scandals. A man, to hold his position, must have a dignified manner, a clean record, a respectable home anchorage. Therefore he was circumspect in all he did, and whenever he appeared in the public ways in the afternoon, or on Sunday, it was with his wife, and sometimes his children."], "How much information does Dreiser provide about his characters\u2019 personal histories before the start of the novel?": [" It was on the third floor, the front windows looking down into the street, where, at night, the lights of grocery stores were shining and children were playing.

What is it makes you continually war with your happiness?\u201d The last question was asked so simply that it came to the audience and the lover as a personal thing. At last it came to the part where the lover exclaimed, \u201cBe to me as you used to be.\u201d Carrie answered, with affecting sweetness, \u201cI cannot be that to you, but I can speak in the spirit of the Laura who is dead to you forever.\u201d \u201cBe it as you will,\u201d said Patton. Hurstwood leaned forward. The whole audience was silent and intent. \u201cLet the woman you look upon be wise or vain,\u201d said Carrie, her eyes bent sadly upon the lover, who had sunk into a seat, \u201cbeautiful or homely, rich or poor, she has but one thing she can really give or refuse\u2014her heart.\u201d Drouet felt a scratch in his throat. \u201cHer beauty, her wit, her accomplishments, she may sell to you; but her love is the treasure without money and without price.\u201d The manager suffered this as a personal appeal.", " What was it? A very dull round indeed. What did she have? Nothing but this narrow, little flat. The Vances could travel, they could do the things worth doing, and here she was. For what was she made, anyhow? More thought followed, and then tears\u2014tears seemed justified, and the only relief in the world. For another period this state continued, the twain leading a rather monotonous life, and then there was a slight change for the worse. One evening, Hurstwood, after thinking about a way to modify Carrie\u2019s desire for clothes and the general strain upon his ability to provide, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to do much with Shaughnessy.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cOh, he\u2019s a slow, greedy \u2018mick\u2019! He won\u2019t agree to anything to improve the place, and it won\u2019t ever pay without it.\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t you make him?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cNo; I\u2019ve tried. The only thing I can see, if I want to improve, is to get hold of a place of my own.\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you?\u201d said Carrie.", " \u201cNow, this handle here regulates your speed. To here,\u201d he said, pointing with his finger, \u201cgives you about four miles an hour. This is eight. When it\u2019s full on, you make about fourteen miles an hour.\u201d Hurstwood watched him calmly. He had seen motormen work before. He knew just about how they did it, and was sure he could do as well, with a very little practice. The instructor explained a few more details, and then said: \u201cNow, we\u2019ll back her up.\u201d Hurstwood stood placidly by, while the car rolled back into the yard. \u201cOne thing you want to be careful about, and that is to start easy. Give one degree time to act before you start another. The one fault of most men is that they always want to throw her wide open. That\u2019s bad. It\u2019s dangerous, too. Wears out the motor. You don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d \u201cI see,\u201d said Hurstwood. He waited and waited, while the man talked on. \u201cNow you take it,\u201d he said, finally."], "Who is the protagonist of the novel?": [" Minnie tried to talk with her during breakfast, but there was not much of interest which they could mutually discuss.

THE FEAST OF BELSHAZZAR: A SEER TO TRANSLATE Such feelings as were generated in Carrie by this walk put her in an exceedingly receptive mood for the pathos which followed in the play. The actor whom they had gone to see had achieved his popularity by presenting a mellow type of comedy, in which sufficient sorrow was introduced to lend contrast and relief to humour. For Carrie, as we well know, the stage had a great attraction. She had never forgotten her one histrionic achievement in Chicago. It dwelt in her mind and occupied her consciousness during many long afternoons in which her rocking-chair and her latest novel contributed the only pleasures of her state. Never could she witness a play without having her own ability vividly brought to consciousness. Some scenes made her long to be a part of them\u2014to give expression to the feelings which she, in the place of the character represented, would feel."], "What phrase best describes Charlie Drouet\u2019s attitude toward his romantic affairs?": [" The wavering of a mind under such circumstances is an almost inexplicable thing, and yet it is absolutely true. Hurstwood could not bring himself to act definitely. He wanted to think about it\u2014to ponder over it, to decide whether it were best. He was drawn by such a keen desire for Carrie, driven by such a state of turmoil in his own affairs that he thought constantly it would be best, and yet he wavered. He did not know what evil might result from it to him\u2014how soon he might come to grief. The true ethics of the situation never once occurred to him, and never would have, under any circumstances. After he had all the money in the handbag, a revulsion of feeling seized him. He would not do it\u2014no! Think of what a scandal it would make. The police! They would be after him. He would have to fly, and where? Oh, the terror of being a fugitive from justice! He took out the two boxes and put all the money back.", " True to his nature, Drouet clung to this idea as an easy way out. \u201cThat\u2019s nothing. You can act all you have to down there.\u201d \u201cNo, I can\u2019t,\u201d said Carrie weakly, very much drawn toward the proposition and yet fearful. \u201cYes, you can. Now, why don\u2019t you do it? They need some one, and it will be lots of fun for you.\u201d \u201cOh, no, it won\u2019t,\u201d said Carrie seriously. \u201cYou\u2019d like that. I know you would.

There was something in his manner that showed that he was pleased to be there. Drouet felt really closer to him than ever before. It gave him more respect for Carrie. Her appearance came into a new light, under Hurstwood\u2019s appreciation. The situation livened considerably. \u201cNow, let me see,\u201d said Hurstwood, looking over Carrie\u2019s shoulder very deferentially. \u201cWhat have you?\u201d He studied for a moment. \u201cThat\u2019s rather good,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky.

He thought he was going to be held up for free tickets. Carrie summoned up all her courage, which was little at best. She realised that she was a novice, and felt as if a rebuff were certain. Of this she was so sure that she only wished now to pretend she had called for advice. \u201cCan you tell me how to go about getting on the stage?\u201d It was the best way after all to have gone about the matter. She was interesting, in a manner, to the occupant of the chair, and the simplicity of her request and attitude took his fancy.

She wished she knew a way out. Her recent experiences with the Vances had wholly unfitted her to view her own state with complacence. The glamour of the high life of the city had, in the few experiences afforded her by the former, seized her completely. She had been taught how to dress and where to go without having ample means to do either. Now, these things\u2014ever-present realities as they were\u2014filled her eyes and mind. The more circumscribed became her state, the more entrancing seemed this other. And now poverty threatened to seize her entirely and to remove this other world far upward like a heaven to which any Lazarus might extend, appealingly, his hands. So, too, the ideal brought into her life by Ames remained. He had gone, but here was his word that riches were not everything; that there was a great deal more in the world than she knew; that the stage was good, and the literature she read poor.", " Hurstwood nodded to the politicians and went into his office. About ten o\u2019clock a friend of his, Mr. Frank L. Taintor, a local sport and racing man, dropped in, and seeing Hurstwood alone in his office came to the door. \u201cHello, George!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cHow are you, Frank?\u201d said Hurstwood, somewhat relieved by the sight of him. \u201cSit down,\u201d and he motioned him to one of the chairs in the little room. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, George?\u201d asked Taintor. \u201cYou look a little glum. Haven\u2019t lost at the track, have you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not feeling very well to-night. I had a slight cold the other day.\u201d \u201cTake whiskey, George,\u201d said Taintor. \u201cYou ought to know that.\u201d Hurstwood smiled. While they were still conferring there, several other of Hurstwood\u2019s friends entered, and not long after eleven, the theatres being out, some actors began to drop in\u2014among them some notabilities. Then began one of those pointless social conversations so common in American resorts where the would-be _gilded_ attempt to rub off gilt from those who have it in abundance.", " She was not going to be dragged into poverty and something worse to suit him. She could act. She could get something and then work up. What would he say then? She pictured herself already appearing in some fine performance on Broadway; of going every evening to her dressing-room and making up. Then she would come out at eleven o\u2019clock and see the carriages ranged about, waiting for the people. It did not matter whether she was the star or not. If she were only once in, getting a decent salary, wearing the kind of clothes she liked, having the money to do with, going here and there as she pleased, how delightful it would all be. Her mind ran over this picture all the day long. Hurstwood\u2019s dreary state made its beauty become more and more vivid. Curiously this idea soon took hold of Hurstwood. His vanishing sum suggested that he would need sustenance. Why could not Carrie assist him a little until he could get something?", " \u201cLast two weeks of the Great Comic Opera success\u2014The \u2014\u2014,\u201d etc., was upon all billboards and in the newspapers, before she acted. \u201cI\u2019m not going out on the road,\u201d said Miss Osborne. Carrie went with her to apply to another manager. \u201cEver had any experience?\u201d was one of his questions. \u201cI\u2019m with the company at the Casino now.\u201d \u201cOh, you are?\u201d he said. The end of this was another engagement at twenty per week. Carrie was delighted. She began to feel that she had a place in the world. People recognised ability. So changed was her state that the home atmosphere became intolerable. It was all poverty and trouble there, or seemed to be, because it was a load to bear. It became a place to keep away from. Still she slept there, and did a fair amount of work, keeping it in order. It was a sitting place for Hurstwood. He sat and rocked, rocked and read, enveloped in the gloom of his own fate. October went by, and November."], "Which hardworking and frugal couple acts as Carrie\u2019s hosts when she first arrives in Chicago?": [" \u201cHe probably could be happy,\u201d she thought to herself, \u201call alone. He\u2019s so strong.\u201d Mr. and Mrs. Vance kept up a running fire of interruptions, and these impressive things by Ames came at odd moments. They were sufficient, however, for the atmosphere that went with this youth impressed itself upon Carrie without words. There was something in him, or the world he moved in, which appealed to her. He reminded her of scenes she had seen on the stage\u2014the sorrows and sacrifices that always went with she knew not what. He had taken away some of the bitterness of the contrast between this life and her life, and all by a certain calm indifference which concerned only him. As they went out, he took her arm and helped her into the coach, and then they were off again, and so to the show. During the acts Carrie found herself listening to him very attentively. He mentioned things in the play which she most approved of\u2014things which swayed her deeply.", " Across wide stretches of flat, open prairie they could see lines of telegraph poles stalking across the fields toward the great city. Far away were indications of suburban towns, some big smokestacks towering high in the air. Frequently there were two-story frame houses standing out in the open fields, without fence or trees, lone outposts of the approaching army of homes. To the child, the genius with imagination, or the wholly untravelled, the approach to a great city for the first time is a wonderful thing. Particularly if it be evening\u2014that mystic period between the glare and gloom of the world when life is changing from one sphere or condition to another. Ah, the promise of the night. What does it not hold for the weary! What old illusion of hope is not here forever repeated! Says the soul of the toiler to itself, \u201cI shall soon be free. I shall be in the ways and the hosts of the merry.", " \u201c\u2019Tis a foine couple,\u201d he observed to himself. \u201cThey must be rich.\u201d Chapter XVI. A WITLESS ALADDIN: THE GATE TO THE WORLD In the course of his present stay in Chicago, Drouet paid some slight attention to the secret order to which he belonged. During his last trip he had received a new light on its importance. \u201cI tell you,\u201d said another drummer to him, \u201cit\u2019s a great thing. Look at Hazenstab. He isn\u2019t so deuced clever. Of course he\u2019s got a good house behind him, but that won\u2019t do alone. I tell you it\u2019s his degree. He\u2019s a way-up Mason, and that goes a long way. He\u2019s got a secret sign that stands for something.\u201d Drouet resolved then and there that he would take more interest in such matters. So when he got back to Chicago he repaired to his local lodge headquarters. \u201cI say, Drouet,\u201d said Mr. Harry Quincel, an individual who was very prominent in this local branch of the Elks, \u201cyou\u2019re the man that can help us out.\u201d It was after the business meeting and things were going socially with a hum.", " Grief under such circumstances becomes an enticing thing. Carrie longed to be of it. She wanted to take her sufferings, whatever they were, in such a world, or failing that, at least to simulate them under such charming conditions upon the stage. So affected was her mind by what she had seen, that the play now seemed an extraordinarily beautiful thing. She was soon lost in the world it represented, and wished that she might never return. Between the acts she studied the galaxy of matin\u00e9e attendants in front rows and boxes, and conceived a new idea of the possibilities of New York. She was sure she had not seen it all\u2014that the city was one whirl of pleasure and delight. Going out, the same Broadway taught her a sharper lesson. The scene she had witnessed coming down was now augmented and at its height. Such a crush of finery and folly she had never seen. It clinched her convictions concerning her state."], "What phrase best describes the social status of Carrie\u2019s friend Mrs. Vance?": [" Of all times, this was the worst to encounter Mrs. Vance. \u201cWhy, I\u2019m living down town here. I\u2019ve been intending to come and see you. Where are you living now?\u201d \u201cIn Fifty-eighth Street,\u201d said Mrs. Vance, \u201cjust off Seventh Avenue\u2014218. Why don\u2019t you come and see me?\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cReally, I\u2019ve been wanting to come. I know I ought to. It\u2019s a shame. But you know\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s your number?\u201d said Mrs. Vance. \u201cThirteenth Street,\u201d said Carrie, reluctantly. \u201c112 West.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said Mrs. Vance, \u201cthat\u2019s right near here, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cYou must come down and see me some time.\u201d \u201cWell, you\u2019re a fine one,\u201d said Mrs. Vance, laughing, the while noting that Carrie\u2019s appearance had modified somewhat. \u201cThe address, too,\u201d she added to herself. \u201cThey must be hard up.\u201d Still she liked Carrie well enough to take her in tow. \u201cCome with me in here a minute,\u201d she exclaimed, turning into a store.", " Mrs. Vance played some upon the piano, and at last Hurstwood came. \u201cI am very glad to meet you,\u201d he said to Mrs. Vance when Carrie introduced him, showing much of the old grace which had captivated Carrie. \u201cDid you think your wife had run away?\u201d said Mr. Vance, extending his hand upon introduction. \u201cI didn\u2019t know but what she might have found a better husband,\u201d said Hurstwood. He now turned his attention to Mrs. Vance, and in a flash Carrie saw again what she for some time had subconsciously missed in Hurstwood\u2014the adroitness and flattery of which he was capable. She also saw that she was not well dressed\u2014not nearly as well dressed\u2014as Mrs. Vance. These were not vague ideas any longer. Her situation was cleared up for her. She felt that her life was becoming stale, and therein she felt cause for gloom. The old helpful, urging melancholy was restored. The desirous Carrie was whispered to concerning her possibilities.", " \u201cWell, I guess we\u2019re ready now. The coach is outside.\u201d \u201cCome on, people,\u201d said Mrs. Vance, coming in smiling. \u201cBob, you\u2019ll have to look after Mrs. Wheeler.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll try to,\u201d said Bob smiling, and edging closer to Carrie. \u201cYou won\u2019t need much watching, will you?\u201d he volunteered, in a sort of ingratiating and help-me-out kind of way. \u201cNot very, I hope,\u201d said Carrie. They descended the stairs, Mrs. Vance offering suggestions, and climbed into the open coach. \u201cAll right,\u201d said Vance, slamming the coach door, and the conveyance rolled away. \u201cWhat is it we\u2019re going to see?\u201d asked Ames. \u201cSothern,\u201d said Vance, \u201cin \u2018Lord Chumley.\u2019\u201d \u201cOh, he is so good!\u201d said Mrs. Vance. \u201cHe\u2019s just the funniest man.\u201d \u201cI notice the papers praise it,\u201d said Ames. \u201cI haven\u2019t any doubt,\u201d put in Vance, \u201cbut we\u2019ll all enjoy it very much.\u201d Ames had taken a seat beside Carrie, and accordingly he felt it his bounden duty to pay her some attention.", " There were no immediate results to this awakening, for Carrie had little power of initiative; but, nevertheless, she seemed ever capable of getting herself into the tide of change where she would be easily borne along. Hurstwood noticed nothing. He had been unconscious of the marked contrasts which Carrie had observed. He did not even detect the shade of melancholy which settled in her eyes. Worst of all, she now began to feel the loneliness of the flat and seek the company of Mrs. Vance, who liked her exceedingly. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the matin\u00e9e this afternoon,\u201d said Mrs. Vance, who had stepped across into Carrie\u2019s flat one morning, still arrayed in a soft pink dressing-gown, which she had donned upon rising. Hurstwood and Vance had gone their separate ways nearly an hour before. \u201cAll right,\u201d said Carrie, noticing the air of the petted and well-groomed woman in Mrs. Vance\u2019s general appearance."], "What is the destination of Carrie\u2019s train in the novel\u2019s opening chapter?": [" THE KINGDOM OF GREATNESS: THE PILGRIM ADREAM Chapter XXXI.

If she showed any tendency to coquetry he would be apt to straighten her tie, or if she \u201ctook up\u201d with him at all, to call her by her first name. If he visited a department store it was to lounge familiarly over the counter and ask some leading questions. In more exclusive circles, on the train or in waiting stations, he went slower. If some seemingly vulnerable object appeared he was all attention\u2014to pass the compliments of the day, to lead the way to the parlor car, carrying her grip, or, failing that, to take a seat next her with the hope of being able to court her to her destination. Pillows, books, a footstool, the shade lowered; all these figured in the things which he could do. If, when she reached her destination he did not alight and attend her baggage for her, it was because, in his own estimation, he had signally failed."], "Who does Carrie meet on the train from Waukesha, Wisconsin, to Chicago?": [" Books were beyond her interest\u2014knowledge a sealed book. In the intuitive graces she was still crude. She could scarcely toss her head gracefully. Her hands were almost ineffectual. The feet, though small, were set flatly. And yet she was interested in her charms, quick to understand the keener pleasures of life, ambitious to gain in material things. A half-equipped little knight she was, venturing to reconnoitre the mysterious city and dreaming wild dreams of some vague, far-off supremacy, which should make it prey and subject\u2014the proper penitent, grovelling at a woman\u2019s slipper. \u201cThat,\u201d said a voice in her ear, \u201cis one of the prettiest little resorts in Wisconsin.\u201d \u201cIs it?\u201d she answered nervously. The train was just pulling out of Waukesha. For some time she had been conscious of a man behind. She felt him observing her mass of hair. He had been fidgetting, and with natural intuition she felt a certain interest growing in that quarter.", " \u201cYes, the next sleeper back does.\u201d He would have asked more, but it did not seem wise, so he decided to inquire at the depot. The train rolled into the yards, clanging and puffing. \u201cI think we had better go right on through to Montreal,\u201d he said to Carrie. \u201cI\u2019ll see what the connections are when we get off.\u201d He was exceedingly nervous, but did his best to put on a calm exterior. Carrie only looked at him with large, troubled eyes. She was drifting mentally, unable to say to herself what to do. The train stopped and Hurstwood led the way out. He looked warily around him, pretending to look after Carrie. Seeing nothing that indicated studied observation, he made his way to the ticket office. \u201cThe next train for Montreal leaves when?\u201d he asked. \u201cIn twenty minutes,\u201d said the man. He bought two tickets and Pullman berths. Then he hastened back to Carrie. \u201cWe go right out again,\u201d he said, scarcely noticing that Carrie looked tired and weary.", " He would visit the local resorts, or those near by in Wisconsin, and spend a few stiff, polished days strolling about conventional places doing conventional things. He knew the need of it. When some one of the many middle-class individuals whom he knew, who had money, would get into trouble, he would shake his head. It didn\u2019t do to talk about those things. If it came up for discussion among such friends as with him passed for close, he would deprecate the folly of the thing. \u201cIt was all right to do it\u2014all men do those things\u2014but why wasn\u2019t he careful? A man can\u2019t be too careful.\u201d He lost sympathy for the man that made a mistake and was found out. On this account he still devoted some time to showing his wife about\u2014time which would have been wearisome indeed if it had not been for the people he would meet and the little enjoyments which did not depend upon her presence or absence. He watched her with considerable curiosity at times, for she was still attractive in a way and men looked at her.", " He was interested to find her so young a wife, and so pretty, though it was only a respectful interest. There was nothing of the dashing lady\u2019s man about him. He had respect for the married state, and thought only of some pretty marriageable girls in Indianapolis. \u201cAre you a born New Yorker?\u201d asked Ames of Carrie. \u201cOh, no; I\u2019ve only been here for two years.\u201d \u201cOh, well, you\u2019ve had time to see a great deal of it, anyhow.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t seem to have,\u201d answered Carrie. \u201cIt\u2019s about as strange to me as when I first came here.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not from the West, are you?\u201d \u201cYes. I\u2019m from Wisconsin,\u201d she answered. \u201cWell, it does seem as if most people in this town haven\u2019t been here so very long. I hear of lots of Indiana people in my line who are here.\u201d \u201cWhat is your line?\u201d asked Carrie. \u201cI\u2019m connected with an electrical company,\u201d said the youth. Carrie followed up this desultory conversation with occasional interruptions from the Vances."], "What emotion does Carrie\u2019s presence at the apartment seem to evoke in Hanson?": [" She never wearied of wondering where the people in the cars were going or what their enjoyments were. Her imagination trod a very narrow round, always winding up at points which concerned money, looks, clothes, or enjoyment. She would have a far-off thought of Columbia City now and then, or an irritating rush of feeling concerning her experiences of the present day, but, on the whole, the little world about her enlisted her whole attention. The first floor of the building, of which Hanson\u2019s flat was the third, was occupied by a bakery, and to this, while she was standing there, Hanson came down to buy a loaf of bread. She was not aware of his presence until he was quite near her. \u201cI\u2019m after bread,\u201d was all he said as he passed. The contagion of thought here demonstrated itself. While Hanson really came for bread, the thought dwelt with him that now he would see what Carrie was doing. No sooner did he draw near her with that in mind than she felt it.", " Of course, she had no understanding of what put it into her head, but, nevertheless, it aroused in her the first shade of real antipathy to him. She knew now that she did not like him. He was suspicious. A thought will colour a world for us. The flow of Carrie\u2019s meditations had been disturbed, and Hanson had not long gone upstairs before she followed. She had realised with the lapse of the quarter hours that Drouet was not coming, and somehow she felt a little resentful, a little as if she had been forsaken\u2014was not good enough. She went upstairs, where everything was silent. Minnie was sewing by a lamp at the table. Hanson had already turned in for the night. In her weariness and disappointment Carrie did no more than announce that she was going to bed. \u201cYes, you\u2019d better,\u201d returned Minnie. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get up early, you know.\u201d The morning was no better. Hanson was just going out the door as Carrie came from her room.", " She was not going to be a common shop-girl, she thought; they need not think it, either. On the first Saturday night Carrie paid her board, four dollars. Minnie had a quaver of conscience as she took it, but did not know how to explain to Hanson if she took less. That worthy gave up just four dollars less toward the household expenses with a smile of satisfaction. He contemplated increasing his Building and Loan payments. As for Carrie, she studied over the problem of finding clothes and amusement on fifty cents a week. She brooded over this until she was in a state of mental rebellion. \u201cI\u2019m going up the street for a walk,\u201d she said after supper. \u201cNot alone, are you?\u201d asked Hanson. \u201cYes,\u201d returned Carrie. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t,\u201d said Minnie. \u201cI want to see _something_,\u201d said Carrie, and by the tone she put into the last word they realised for the first time she was not pleased with them. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with her?\u201d asked Hanson, when she went into the front room to get her hat.", " Carrie was afraid of what she was going to do, but she was relieved to know that this condition was ending. They would not care. Hanson particularly would be glad when she went. He would not care what became of her. After dinner she went into the bathroom, where they could not disturb her, and wrote a little note. \u201cGood-bye, Minnie,\u201d it read. \u201cI\u2019m not going home. I\u2019m going to stay in Chicago a little while and look for work. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be all right.\u201d In the front room Hanson was reading his paper. As usual, she helped Minnie clear away the dishes and straighten up. Then she said: \u201cI guess I\u2019ll stand down at the door a little while.\u201d She could scarcely prevent her voice from trembling. Minnie remembered Hanson\u2019s remonstrance. \u201cSven doesn\u2019t think it looks good to stand down there,\u201d she said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t he?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cI won\u2019t do it any more after this.\u201d She put on her hat and fidgeted around the table in the little bedroom, wondering where to slip the note."], "Where does Carrie get a job on her first day in Chicago?": [" Their gabbling was feverish\u2014things said to quiet their own minds. He looked out into the yard and waited. Two of the men got around quite near him, but behind his back. They were rather social, and he listened to what they said. \u201cAre you a railroad man?\u201d said one. \u201cMe? No. I\u2019ve always worked in a paper factory.\u201d \u201cI had a job in Newark until last October,\u201d returned the other, with reciprocal feeling. There were some words which passed too low to hear. Then the conversation became strong again. \u201cI don\u2019t blame these fellers for striking,\u201d said one. \u201cThey\u2019ve got the right of it, all right, but I had to get something to do.\u201d \u201cSame here,\u201d said the other. \u201cIf I had any job in Newark I wouldn\u2019t be over here takin\u2019 chances like these.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hell these days, ain\u2019t it?\u201d said the man. \u201cA poor man ain\u2019t nowhere. You could starve, by God, right in the streets, and there ain\u2019t most no one would help you.\u201d \u201cRight you are,\u201d said the other.", " He came in one day with something of this idea in his mind. \u201cI met John B. Drake to-day,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to open a hotel here in the fall. He says that he can make a place for me then.\u201d \u201cWho is he?\u201d asked Carrie. \u201cHe\u2019s the man that runs the Grand Pacific in Chicago.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cI\u2019d get about fourteen hundred a year out of that.\u201d \u201cThat would be good, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d she said, sympathetically. \u201cIf I can only get over this summer,\u201d he added, \u201cI think I\u2019ll be all right. I\u2019m hearing from some of my friends again.\u201d Carrie swallowed this story in all its pristine beauty. She sincerely wished he could get through the summer. He looked so hopeless. \u201cHow much money have you left?\u201d \u201cOnly fifty dollars.\u201d \u201cOh, mercy,\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cwhat will we do? It\u2019s only twenty days until the rent will be due again.\u201d Hurstwood rested his head on his hands and looked blankly at the floor. \u201cMaybe you could get something in the stage line?\u201d he blandly suggested.", " Are you stopping here?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Mr. Kenny, and then, turning the word again added: \u201cHow are things out in Chicago?\u201d \u201cAbout the same as usual,\u201d said Hurstwood, smiling genially. \u201cWife with you?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cWell, I must see more of you to-day. I\u2019m just going in here for breakfast. Come in when you\u2019re through.\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d said Hurstwood, moving away. The whole conversation was a trial to him. It seemed to add complications with every word. This man called up a thousand memories. He represented everything he had left. Chicago, his wife, the elegant resort\u2014all these were in his greeting and inquiries. And here he was in this same hotel expecting to confer with him, unquestionably waiting to have a good time with him. All at once the Chicago papers would arrive. The local papers would have accounts in them this very day. He forgot his triumph with Carrie in the possibility of soon being known for what he was, in this man\u2019s eyes, a safe-breaker.", " She seemed too simple, too yielding. His idea of the art was that it involved something more pompous. If she tried to get on the stage she would fall into the hands of some cheap manager and become like the rest of them. He had a good idea of what he meant by _them_. Carrie was pretty. She would get along all right, but where would he be? \u201cI\u2019d get that idea out of my head, if I were you. It\u2019s a lot more difficult than you think.\u201d Carrie felt this to contain, in some way, an aspersion upon her ability. \u201cYou said I did real well in Chicago,\u201d she rejoined. \u201cYou did,\u201d he answered, seeing that he was arousing opposition, \u201cbut Chicago isn\u2019t New York, by a big jump.\u201d Carrie did not answer this at all. It hurt her. \u201cThe stage,\u201d he went on, \u201cis all right if you can be one of the big guns, but there\u2019s nothing to the rest of it. It takes a long while to get up.\u201d \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Carrie, slightly aroused."], "What does Carrie propose doing that elicits disapproval from Minnie and Hanson?": [" At her suggestion of going to the theatre, the unspoken shade of disapproval to the doing of those things which involved the expenditure of money\u2014shades of feeling which arose in the mind of Hanson and then in Minnie\u2014slightly affected the atmosphere of the table. Minnie answered \u201cyes,\u201d but Carrie could feel that going to the theatre was poorly advocated here. The subject was put off for a little while until Hanson, through with his meal, took his paper and went into the front room. When they were alone, the two sisters began a somewhat freer conversation, Carrie interrupting it to hum a little, as they worked at the dishes. \u201cI should like to walk up and see Halstead Street, if it isn\u2019t too far,\u201d said Carrie, after a time. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go to the theatre to-night?\u201d \u201cOh, I don\u2019t think Sven would want to go to-night,\u201d returned Minnie. \u201cHe has to get up so early.\u201d \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t mind\u2014he\u2019d enjoy it,\u201d said Carrie.", " She wandered about after the dishes were put away, talked a little with Minnie, and then decided to go down and stand in the door at the foot of the stairs. If Drouet came, she could meet him there. Her face took on the semblance of a look of happiness as she put on her hat to go below. \u201cCarrie doesn\u2019t seem to like her place very well,\u201d said Minnie to her husband when the latter came out, paper in hand, to sit in the dining-room a few minutes. \u201cShe ought to keep it for a time, anyhow,\u201d said Hanson. \u201cHas she gone downstairs?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Minnie. \u201cI\u2019d tell her to keep it if I were you. She might be here weeks without getting another one.\u201d Minnie said she would, and Hanson read his paper. \u201cIf I were you,\u201d he said a little later, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t let her stand in the door down there. It don\u2019t look good.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll tell her,\u201d said Minnie. The life of the streets continued for a long time to interest Carrie.", " When Minnie found the note next morning, after a night of mingled wonder and anxiety, which was not exactly touched by yearning, sorrow, or love, she exclaimed: \u201cWell, what do you think of that?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d said Hanson. \u201cSister Carrie has gone to live somewhere else.\u201d Hanson jumped out of bed with more celerity than he usually displayed and looked at the note. The only indication of his thoughts came in the form of a little clicking sound made by his tongue; the sound some people make when they wish to urge on a horse. \u201cWhere do you suppose she\u2019s gone to?\u201d said Minnie, thoroughly aroused. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d a touch of cynicism lighting his eye. \u201cNow she has gone and done it.\u201d Minnie moved her head in a puzzled way. \u201cOh, oh,\u201d she said, \u201cshe doesn\u2019t know what she has done.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Hanson, after a while, sticking his hands out before him, \u201cwhat can you do?\u201d Minnie\u2019s womanly nature was higher than this.", " So instead of complaining when she felt so good, she said: \u201cI have the promise of something.\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d \u201cAt the Boston Store.\u201d \u201cIs it sure promised?\u201d questioned Minnie. \u201cWell, I\u2019m to find out to-morrow,\u201d returned Carrie disliking to draw out a lie any longer than was necessary. Minnie felt the atmosphere of good feeling which Carrie brought with her. She felt now was the time to express to Carrie the state of Hanson\u2019s feeling about her entire Chicago venture. \u201cIf you shouldn\u2019t get it\u2014\u201d she paused, troubled for an easy way. \u201cIf I don\u2019t get something pretty soon, I think I\u2019ll go home.\u201d Minnie saw her chance. \u201cSven thinks it might be best for the winter, anyhow.\u201d The situation flashed on Carrie at once. They were unwilling to keep her any longer, out of work. She did not blame Minnie, she did not blame Hanson very much. Now, as she sat there digesting the remark, she was glad she had Drouet\u2019s money."], "What is the name of the club where Drouet passes the evening after receiving Carrie\u2019s letter?": [" Carrie turned her face to the west with a subdued heart. As she turned the corner, she saw through the great shiny window the small desk at which she had applied. There were the crowds, hurrying with the same buzz and energy-yielding enthusiasm. She felt a slight relief, but it was only at her escape. She felt ashamed in the face of better dressed girls who went by. She felt as though she should be better served, and her heart revolted. Chapter V. A GLITTERING NIGHT FLOWER: THE USE OF A NAME Drouet did not call that evening. After receiving the letter, he had laid aside all thought of Carrie for the time being and was floating around having what he considered a gay time. On this particular evening he dined at \u201cRector\u2019s,\u201d a restaurant of some local fame, which occupied a basement at Clark and Monroe Streets. There\u2014after he visited the resort of Fitzgerald and Moy\u2019s in Adams Street, opposite the imposing Federal Building.", " Chapter XXVII. WHEN WATERS ENGULF US WE REACH FOR A STAR It was when he returned from his disturbed stroll about the streets, after receiving the decisive note from McGregor, James and Hay, that Hurstwood found the letter Carrie had written him that morning. He thrilled intensely as he noted the handwriting, and rapidly tore it open. \u201cThen,\u201d he thought, \u201cshe loves me or she would not have written to me at all.\u201d He was slightly depressed at the tenor of the note for the first few minutes, but soon recovered. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t write at all if she didn\u2019t care for me.\u201d This was his one resource against the depression which held him. He could extract little from the wording of the letter, but the spirit he thought he knew. There was really something exceedingly human\u2014if not pathetic\u2014in his being thus relieved by a clearly worded reproof. He who had for so long remained satisfied with himself now looked outside of himself for comfort\u2014and to such a source.", " He decided to write her care of the West Side Post-office and ask for an explanation, as well as to have her meet him. The thought that this letter would probably not reach her until Monday chafed him exceedingly. He must get some speedier method\u2014but how? He thought upon it for a half-hour, not contemplating a messenger or a cab direct to the house, owing to the exposure of it, but finding that time was slipping away to no purpose, he wrote the letter and then began to think again. The hours slipped by, and with them the possibility of the union he had contemplated. He had thought to be joyously aiding Carrie by now in the task of joining her interests to his, and here it was afternoon and nothing done. Three o\u2019clock came, four, five, six, and no letter. The helpless manager paced the floor and grimly endured the gloom of defeat. He saw a busy Saturday ushered out, the Sabbath in, and nothing done.", " Back, now.\u201d \u201cWhat the hell!\u201d cried another of the strikers, pushing the other way, adding at the same time some lusty oaths. Crack came an officer\u2019s club on his forehead. He blinked his eyes blindly a few times, wabbled on his legs, threw up his hands, and staggered back. In return, a swift fist landed on the officer\u2019s neck. Infuriated by this, the latter plunged left and right, laying about madly with his club. He was ably assisted by his brother of the blue, who poured ponderous oaths upon the troubled waters. No severe damage was done, owing to the agility of the strikers in keeping out of reach. They stood about the sidewalk now and jeered. \u201cWhere is the conductor?\u201d yelled one of the officers, getting his eye on that individual, who had come nervously forward to stand by Hurstwood. The latter had stood gazing upon the scene with more astonishment than fear. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come down here and get these stones off the track?\u201d inquired the officer."], "What aspect of the factory women\u2019s behavior does Carrie disapprove of?": [" \u201cAh, yes,\u201d said the latter, when she applied; \u201cMiss Madenda\u2014one hundred and fifty dollars. Quite a success the show seems to have made.\u201d \u201cYes, indeed,\u201d returned Carrie. Right after came one of the insignificant members of the company, and she heard the changed tone of address. \u201cHow much?\u201d said the same cashier, sharply. One, such as she had only recently been, was waiting for her modest salary. It took her back to the few weeks in which she had collected\u2014or rather had received\u2014almost with the air of a domestic, four-fifty per week from a lordly foreman in a shoe factory\u2014a man who, in distributing the envelopes, had the manner of a prince doling out favours to a servile group of petitioners. She knew that out in Chicago this very day the same factory chamber was full of poor homely-clad girls working in long lines at clattering machines; that at noon they would eat a miserable lunch in a half-hour; that Saturday they would gather, as they had when she was one of them, and accept the small pay for work a hundred times harder than she was now doing.", " \u201cHave you ever been employed in a shoe factory before?\u201d \u201cNo, sir,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d he inquired, and being informed, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know as I have anything for you. Would you work for four and a half a week?\u201d Carrie was too worn by defeat not to feel that it was considerable. She had not expected that he would offer her less than six. She acquiesced, however, and he took her name and address. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, finally, \u201cyou report here at eight o\u2019clock Monday morning. I think I can find something for you to do.\u201d He left her revived by the possibilities, sure that she had found something at last. Instantly the blood crept warmly over her body. Her nervous tension relaxed. She walked out into the busy street and discovered a new atmosphere. Behold, the throng was moving with a lightsome step. She noticed that men and women were smiling. Scraps of conversation and notes of laughter floated to her.", " I was going off to dine when I saw you.\u201d Carrie smiled and smiled. \u201cWhat have you been doing?\u201d he went on. \u201cTell me all about yourself. How is your sister?\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s well,\u201d returned Carrie, answering the last query. He looked at her hard. \u201cSay,\u201d he said, \u201cyou haven\u2019t been sick, have you?\u201d Carrie nodded. \u201cWell, now, that\u2019s a blooming shame, isn\u2019t it? You don\u2019t look very well. I thought you looked a little pale. What have you been doing?\u201d \u201cWorking,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cYou don\u2019t say so! At what?\u201d She told him. \u201cRhodes, Morgenthau and Scott\u2014why, I know that house over here on Fifth Avenue, isn\u2019t it? They\u2019re a close-fisted concern. What made you go there?\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t get anything else,\u201d said Carrie frankly. \u201cWell, that\u2019s an outrage,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cYou oughtn\u2019t to be working for those people. Have the factory right back of the store, don\u2019t they?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cThat isn\u2019t a good house,\u201d said Drouet.", " \u201cWe couldn\u2019t get another corner around here.\u201d \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t pay anywhere else, do you think?\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t try it,\u201d said the other. The approaching change now took on a most serious aspect to Hurstwood. Dissolution meant the loss of his thousand dollars, and he could not save another thousand in the time. He understood that Shaughnessy was merely tired of the arrangement, and would probably lease the new corner, when completed, alone. He began to worry about the necessity of a new connection and to see impending serious financial straits unless something turned up. This left him in no mood to enjoy his flat or Carrie, and consequently the depression invaded that quarter. Meanwhile, he took such time as he could to look about, but opportunities were not numerous. More, he had not the same impressive personality which he had when he first came to New York. Bad thoughts had put a shade into his eyes which did not impress others favourably."], "Why does Carrie despair during her walk with Minnie and Hanson in Garfield Park?": [" She wandered about after the dishes were put away, talked a little with Minnie, and then decided to go down and stand in the door at the foot of the stairs.

On the first Saturday night Carrie paid her board, four dollars. Minnie had a quaver of conscience as she took it, but did not know how to explain to Hanson if she took less. That worthy gave up just four dollars less toward the household expenses with a smile of satisfaction. He contemplated increasing his Building and Loan payments. As for Carrie, she studied over the problem of finding clothes and amusement on fifty cents a week. She brooded over this until she was in a state of mental rebellion. \u201cI\u2019m going up the street for a walk,\u201d she said after supper. \u201cNot alone, are you?\u201d asked Hanson. \u201cYes,\u201d returned Carrie. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t,\u201d said Minnie. \u201cI want to see _something_,\u201d said Carrie, and by the tone she put into the last word they realised for the first time she was not pleased with them. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with her?\u201d asked Hanson, when she went into the front room to get her hat.", " When Minnie found the note next morning, after a night of mingled wonder and anxiety, which was not exactly touched by yearning, sorrow, or love, she exclaimed: \u201cWell, what do you think of that?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d said Hanson. \u201cSister Carrie has gone to live somewhere else.\u201d Hanson jumped out of bed with more celerity than he usually displayed and looked at the note.

Its leader was most stunningly arrayed in the same colours, elaborated, however, with epaulets and a belt of silver, with a short sword dangling at one side. Carrie was fitted for this costume, and a few days later appeared, proud of her new laurels. She was especially gratified to find that her salary was now eighteen instead of twelve. Hurstwood heard nothing about this. \u201cI\u2019ll not give him the rest of my money,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cI do enough. I am going to get me something to wear.\u201d As a matter of fact, during this second month she had been buying for herself as recklessly as she dared, regardless of the consequences. There were impending more complications rent day, and more extension of the credit system in the neighbourhood. Now, however, she proposed to do better by herself. Her first move was to buy a shirt waist, and in studying these she found how little her money would buy\u2014how much, if she could only use all.", " Carrie was too much astonished and delighted to think of mentioning forty. She was nearly beside herself, and almost hugged Lola, who clung to her at the news. \u201cIt isn\u2019t as much as you ought to get,\u201d said the latter, \u201cespecially when you\u2019ve got to buy clothes.\u201d Carrie remembered this with a start. Where to get the money? She had none laid up for such an emergency. Rent day was drawing near. \u201cI\u2019ll not do it,\u201d she said, remembering her necessity. \u201cI don\u2019t use the flat. I\u2019m not going to give up my money this time. I\u2019ll move.\u201d Fitting into this came another appeal from Miss Osborne, more urgent than ever. \u201cCome live with me, won\u2019t you?\u201d she pleaded. \u201cWe can have the loveliest room. It won\u2019t cost you hardly anything that way.\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like to,\u201d said Carrie, frankly. \u201cOh, do,\u201d said Lola. \u201cWe\u2019ll have such a good time.\u201d Carrie thought a while. \u201cI believe I will,\u201d she said, and then added: \u201cI\u2019ll have to see first, though.\u201d With the idea thus grounded, rent day approaching, and clothes calling for instant purchase, she soon found excuse in Hurstwood\u2019s lassitude.", " When Carrie had gone, he felicitated himself upon her good opinion. By George, it was a shame young girls had to be knocked around like that. Cold weather coming on and no clothes. Tough. He would go around to Fitzgerald and Moy\u2019s and get a cigar. It made him feel light of foot as he thought about her. Carrie reached home in high good spirits, which she could scarcely conceal. The possession of the money involved a number of points which perplexed her seriously. How should she buy any clothes when Minnie knew that she had no money? She had no sooner entered the flat than this point was settled for her. It could not be done. She could think of no way of explaining. \u201cHow did you come out?\u201d asked Minnie, referring to the day. Carrie had none of the small deception which could feel one thing and say something directly opposed. She would prevaricate, but it would be in the line of her feelings at least.", " \u201cNever!\u201d she thought. Who would furnish the money to move? To think of being in two rooms with him! She resolved to spend her money for clothes quickly, before something terrible happened. That very day she did it. Having done so, there was but one other thing to do. \u201cLola,\u201d she said, visiting her friend, \u201cI think I\u2019ll come.\u201d \u201cOh, jolly!\u201d cried the latter. \u201cCan we get it right away?\u201d she asked, meaning the room. \u201cCertainly,\u201d cried Lola. They went to look at it. Carrie had saved ten dollars from her expenditures\u2014enough for this and her board beside. Her enlarged salary would not begin for ten days yet\u2014would not reach her for seventeen. She paid half of the six dollars with her friend. \u201cNow, I\u2019ve just enough to get on to the end of the week,\u201d she confided. \u201cOh, I\u2019ve got some,\u201d said Lola. \u201cI\u2019ve got twenty-five dollars, if you need it.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll get along.\u201d They decided to move Friday, which was two days away."], "What is the real reason that Drouet invites George Hurstwood over to his apartment?": [" \u201cOh, all right.\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in six weeks. When did you get in?\u201d \u201cFriday,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cHad a fine trip.\u201d \u201cGlad of it,\u201d said Hurstwood, his black eyes lit with a warmth which half displaced the cold make-believe that usually dwelt in them. \u201cWhat are you going to take?\u201d he added, as the barkeeper, in snowy jacket and tie, leaned toward them from behind the bar. \u201cOld Pepper,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cA little of the same for me,\u201d put in Hurstwood. \u201cHow long are you in town this time?\u201d inquired Hurstwood. \u201cOnly until Wednesday. I\u2019m going up to St. Paul.\u201d \u201cGeorge Evans was in here Saturday and said he saw you in Milwaukee last week.\u201d \u201cYes, I saw George,\u201d returned Drouet. \u201cGreat old boy, isn\u2019t he? We had quite a time there together.\u201d The barkeeper was setting out the glasses and bottle before them, and they now poured out the draught as they talked, Drouet filling his to within a third of full, as was considered proper, and Hurstwood taking the barest suggestion of whiskey and modifying it with seltzer.", " Only the newspapers and his own thoughts were worth while. The delight of love had again slipped away. It was a case of live, now, making the best you can out of a very commonplace station in life. The road downward has but few landings and level places. The very state of his mind, superinduced by his condition, caused the breach to widen between him and his partner. At last that individual began to wish that Hurstwood was out of it. It so happened, however, that a real estate deal on the part of the owner of the land arranged things even more effectually than ill-will could have schemed. \u201cDid you see that?\u201d said Shaughnessy one morning to Hurstwood, pointing to the real estate column in a copy of the \u201cHerald,\u201d which he held. \u201cNo, what is it?\u201d said Hurstwood, looking down the items of news. \u201cThe man who owns this ground has sold it.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t say so?\u201d said Hurstwood. He looked, and there was the notice.", " Unfortunately for the smooth progression of this affair, Drouet returned. Hurstwood was sitting in his imposing little office the next afternoon when he saw Drouet enter. \u201cWhy, hello, Charles,\u201d he called affably; \u201cback again?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d smiled Drouet, approaching and looking in at the door. Hurstwood arose. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, looking the drummer over, \u201crosy as ever, eh?\u201d They began talking of the people they knew and things that had happened. \u201cBeen home yet?\u201d finally asked Hurstwood. \u201cNo, I am going, though,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cI remembered the little girl out there,\u201d said Hurstwood, \u201cand called once. Thought you wouldn\u2019t want her left quite alone.\u201d \u201cRight you are,\u201d agreed Drouet. \u201cHow is she?\u201d \u201cVery well,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cRather anxious about you though. You\u2019d better go out now and cheer her up.\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d said Drouet, smilingly. \u201cLike to have you both come down and go to the show with me Wednesday,\u201d concluded Hurstwood at parting.", " \u201cYes, I will,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cCome around after the show. I have something I want to show you,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cSure,\u201d said Drouet, elated. \u201cYou haven\u2019t anything on hand for the night, have you?\u201d added Hurstwood. \u201cNot a thing.\u201d \u201cWell, come round, then.\u201d \u201cI struck a little peach coming in on the train Friday,\u201d remarked Drouet, by way of parting. \u201cBy George, that\u2019s so, I must go and call on her before I go away.\u201d \u201cOh, never mind her,\u201d Hurstwood remarked. \u201cSay, she was a little dandy, I tell you,\u201d went on Drouet confidentially, and trying to impress his friend. \u201cTwelve o\u2019clock,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Drouet, going out. Thus was Carrie\u2019s name bandied about in the most frivolous and gay of places, and that also when the little toiler was bemoaning her narrow lot, which was almost inseparable from the early stages of this, her unfolding fate. Chapter VI. THE MACHINE AND THE MAIDEN: A KNIGHT OF TO-DAY At the flat that evening Carrie felt a new phase of its atmosphere."], "What wish does Julia Hurstwood harbor for her children?": [" He got back to his office and joined in a conversation with friends. It was as if idle chatter deadened the sense of misery. That night he dined at Rector\u2019s and returned at once to his office. In the bustle and show of the latter was his only relief. He troubled over many little details and talked perfunctorily to everybody. He stayed at his desk long after all others had gone, and only quitted it when the night watchman on his round pulled at the front door to see if it was safely locked. On Wednesday he received another polite note from McGregor, James and Hay. It read: \u201c_Dear Sir:_ We beg to inform you that we are instructed to wait until to-morrow (Thursday) at one o\u2019clock, before filing suit against you, on behalf of Mrs. Julia Hurstwood, for divorce and alimony. If we do not hear from you before that time we shall consider that you do not wish to compromise the matter in any way and act accordingly.", " \u201cDid you notice,\u201d he said, at last, breaking forth concerning another item which he had found, \u201cthat they have entered suit to compel the Illinois Central to get off the lake front, Julia?\u201d he asked. She could scarcely force herself to answer, but managed to say \u201cNo,\u201d sharply. Hurstwood pricked up his ears. There was a note in her voice which vibrated keenly. \u201cIt would be a good thing if they did,\u201d he went on, half to himself, half to her, though he felt that something was amiss in that quarter. He withdrew his attention to his paper very circumspectly, listening mentally for the little sounds which should show him what was on foot. As a matter of fact, no man as clever as Hurstwood\u2014as observant and sensitive to atmospheres of many sorts, particularly upon his own plane of thought\u2014would have made the mistake which he did in regard to his wife, wrought up as she was, had he not been occupied mentally with a very different train of thought.", " \u201cI\u2019m going away, Julia,\u201d he said, \u201cfor a few days.\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d she asked, looking up. \u201cTo Philadelphia, on business.\u201d She looked at him consciously, expecting something else. \u201cI\u2019ll have to leave you behind this time.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d she replied, but he could see that she was thinking that it was a curious thing. Before he went she asked him a few more questions, and that irritated him. He began to feel that she was a disagreeable attachment. On this trip he enjoyed himself thoroughly, and when it was over he was sorry to get back. He was not willingly a prevaricator, and hated thoroughly to make explanations concerning it. The whole incident was glossed over with general remarks, but Mrs. Hurstwood gave the subject considerable thought. She drove out more, dressed better, and attended theatres freely to make up for it. Such an atmosphere could hardly come under the category of home life. It ran along by force of habit, by force of conventional opinion.", " He broke up the dinner by becoming dull, and saw his companion on her car. Then he went home. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t talked to me about any of these later flames,\u201d thought Hurstwood to himself. \u201cHe thinks I think he cares for the girl out there.\u201d \u201cHe ought not to think I\u2019m knocking around, since I have just introduced him out there,\u201d thought Drouet. \u201cI saw you,\u201d Hurstwood said, genially, the next time Drouet drifted in to his polished resort, from which he could not stay away. He raised his forefinger indicatively, as parents do to children. \u201cAn old acquaintance of mine that I ran into just as I was coming up from the station,\u201d explained Drouet. \u201cShe used to be quite a beauty.\u201d \u201cStill attracts a little, eh?\u201d returned the other, affecting to jest. \u201cOh, no,\u201d said Drouet, \u201cjust couldn\u2019t escape her this time.\u201d \u201cHow long are you here?\u201d asked Hurstwood. \u201cOnly a few days.\u201d \u201cYou must bring the girl down and take dinner with me,\u201d he said."], "What causes Carrie to begin noticing small deficiencies in Drouet\u2019s personality and demeanor?": [" Both Hurstwood and Drouet viewed her pretty figure with rising feelings. The fact that such ability should reveal itself in her, that they should see it set forth under such effective circumstances, framed almost in massy gold and shone upon by the appropriate lights of sentiment and personality, heightened her charm for them. She was more than the old Carrie to Drouet. He longed to be at home with her until he could tell her. He awaited impatiently the end, when they should go home alone. Hurstwood, on the contrary, saw in the strength of her new attractiveness his miserable predicament. He could have cursed the man beside him. By the Lord, he could not even applaud feelingly as he would. For once he must simulate when it left a taste in his mouth. It was in the last act that Carrie\u2019s fascination for her lovers assumed its most effective character. Hurstwood listened to its progress, wondering when Carrie would come on.", " Your mouth will change. Your power to act will disappear. You may think they won\u2019t, but they will. Nature takes care of that.\u201d He was so interested in forwarding all good causes that he sometimes became enthusiastic, giving vent to these preachments. Something in Carrie appealed to him. He wanted to stir her up. \u201cI know,\u201d she said, absently, feeling slightly guilty of neglect. \u201cIf I were you,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019d change.\u201d The effect of this was like roiling helpless waters. Carrie troubled over it in her rocking-chair for days. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ll stay in comedy so very much longer,\u201d she eventually remarked to Lola. \u201cOh, why not?\u201d said the latter. \u201cI think,\u201d she said, \u201cI can do better in a serious play.\u201d \u201cWhat put that idea in your head?\u201d \u201cOh, nothing,\u201d she answered; \u201cI\u2019ve always thought so.\u201d Still, she did nothing\u2014grieving. It was a long way to this better thing\u2014or seemed so\u2014and comfort was about her; hence the inactivity and longing.", " It so happened that on the night when Hurstwood, Carrie, and Drouet were in the box at McVickar\u2019s, George, Jr., was in the sixth row of the parquet with the daughter of H. B. Carmichael, the third partner of a wholesale dry-goods house of that city. Hurstwood did not see his son, for he sat, as was his wont, as far back as possible, leaving himself just partially visible, when he bent forward, to those within the first six rows in question. It was his wont to sit this way in every theatre\u2014to make his personality as inconspicuous as possible where it would be no advantage to him to have it otherwise. He never moved but what, if there was any danger of his conduct being misconstrued or ill-reported, he looked carefully about him and counted the cost of every inch of conspicuity. The next morning at breakfast his son said: \u201cI saw you, Governor, last night.\u201d \u201cWere you at McVickar\u2019s?\u201d said Hurstwood, with the best grace in the world.", " He was acknowledged, fawned upon, in a way lionised. Through it all one could see the standing of the man. It was greatness in a way, small as it was. Chapter XIX. AN HOUR IN ELFLAND: A CLAMOUR HALF HEARD At last the curtain was ready to go up. All the details of the make-up had been completed, and the company settled down as the leader of the small, hired orchestra tapped significantly upon his music rack with his baton and began the soft curtain-raising strain. Hurstwood ceased talking, and went with Drouet and his friend Sagar Morrison around to the box. \u201cNow, we\u2019ll see how the little girl does,\u201d he said to Drouet, in a tone which no one else could hear. On the stage, six of the characters had already appeared in the opening parlour scene. Drouet and Hurstwood saw at a glance that Carrie was not among them, and went on talking in a whisper. Mrs. Morgan, Mrs. Hoagland, and the actor who had taken Bamberger\u2019s part were representing the principal r\u00f4les in this scene."], "What causes Carrie to realize that Drouet cannot sympathize with her feelings?": [" It came to him as if they were alone, and he could hardly restrain the tears for sorrow over the hopeless, pathetic, and yet dainty and appealing woman whom he loved. Drouet also was beside himself. He was resolving that he would be to Carrie what he had never been before. He would marry her, by George! She was worth it. \u201cShe asks only in return,\u201d said Carrie, scarcely hearing the small, scheduled reply of her lover, and putting herself even more in harmony with the plaintive melody now issuing from the orchestra, \u201cthat when you look upon her your eyes shall speak devotion; that when you address her your voice shall be gentle, loving, and kind; that you shall not despise her because she cannot understand all at once your vigorous thoughts and ambitious designs; for, when misfortune and evil have defeated your greatest purposes, her love remains to console you. You look to the trees,\u201d she continued, while Hurstwood restrained his feelings only by the grimmest repression, \u201cfor strength and grandeur; do not despise the flowers because their fragrance is all they have to give.", " \u201cWhy, certainly, dear. Why didn\u2019t you tell me before?\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t necessary,\u201d said Hurstwood. For all her acquiescence, there was something about the way Hurstwood spoke which reminded Carrie of Drouet and his little deal which he was always about to put through. It was only the thought of a second, but it was a beginning. It was something new in her thinking of Hurstwood. Other things followed from time to time, little things of the same sort, which in their cumulative effect were eventually equal to a full revelation. Carrie was not dull by any means. Two persons cannot long dwell together without coming to an understanding of one another. The mental difficulties of an individual reveal themselves whether he voluntarily confesses them or not. Trouble gets in the air and contributes gloom, which speaks for itself. Hurstwood dressed as nicely as usual, but they were the same clothes he had in Canada.", " Your mouth will change.

Then, with a pathos which struck home because of its utter simplicity, \u201cHe shall not suffer long.\u201d Hurstwood realised that he was seeing something extraordinarily good. It was heightened for him by the applause of the audience as the curtain descended and the fact that it was Carrie. He thought now that she was beautiful. She had done something which was above his sphere. He felt a keen delight in realising that she was his. \u201cFine,\u201d he said, and then, seized by a sudden impulse, arose and went about to the stage door. When he came in upon Carrie she was still with Drouet. His feelings for her were most exuberant. He was almost swept away by the strength and feeling she exhibited. His desire was to pour forth his praise with the unbounded feelings of a lover, but here was Drouet, whose affection was also rapidly reviving."], "Who contributes to the tension of Hurstwood\u2019s marriage by spotting him at the theater with Carrie and Drouet?": [" \u201cWhy, certainly, dear. Why didn\u2019t you tell me before?\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t necessary,\u201d said Hurstwood.

We\u2019ll go, won\u2019t we?\u201d \u201cIf you think so,\u201d she answered, her manner being so enforcedly reserved as to almost excite suspicion. Drouet noticed something but he thought it was due to her feelings concerning their talk about marriage. \u201cHe called once, he said.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Carrie, \u201che was out here Sunday evening.\u201d \u201cWas he?\u201d said Drouet. \u201cI thought from what he said that he had called a week or so ago.\u201d \u201cSo he did,\u201d answered Carrie, who was wholly unaware of what conversation her lovers might have held. She was all at sea mentally, and fearful of some entanglement which might ensue from what she would answer. \u201cOh, then he called twice?\u201d said Drouet, the first shade of misunderstanding showing in his face. \u201cYes,\u201d said Carrie innocently, feeling now that Hurstwood must have mentioned but one call. Drouet imagined that he must have misunderstood his friend. He did not attach particular importance to the information, after all.", " Unfortunately for the smooth progression of this affair, Drouet returned. Hurstwood was sitting in his imposing little office the next afternoon when he saw Drouet enter. \u201cWhy, hello, Charles,\u201d he called affably; \u201cback again?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d smiled Drouet, approaching and looking in at the door. Hurstwood arose. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, looking the drummer over, \u201crosy as ever, eh?\u201d They began talking of the people they knew and things that had happened. \u201cBeen home yet?\u201d finally asked Hurstwood. \u201cNo, I am going, though,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cI remembered the little girl out there,\u201d said Hurstwood, \u201cand called once. Thought you wouldn\u2019t want her left quite alone.\u201d \u201cRight you are,\u201d agreed Drouet. \u201cHow is she?\u201d \u201cVery well,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cRather anxious about you though. You\u2019d better go out now and cheer her up.\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d said Drouet, smilingly. \u201cLike to have you both come down and go to the show with me Wednesday,\u201d concluded Hurstwood at parting.", " \u201cWe can\u2019t stay in Chicago,\u201d she replied. He had no thought that this was in her mind\u2014that any removal would be suggested. \u201cWhy not?\u201d he asked softly. \u201cOh, because,\u201d she said, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to.\u201d He listened to this with but dull perception of what it meant. It had no serious ring to it. The question was not up for immediate decision. \u201cI would have to give up my position,\u201d he said. The tone he used made it seem as if the matter deserved only slight consideration. Carrie thought a little, the while enjoying the pretty scene. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t like to live in Chicago and him here,\u201d she said, thinking of Drouet. \u201cIt\u2019s a big town, dearest,\u201d Hurstwood answered. \u201cIt would be as good as moving to another part of the country to move to the South Side.\u201d He had fixed upon that region as an objective point. \u201cAnyhow,\u201d said Carrie, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t want to get married as long as he is here. I wouldn\u2019t want to run away.\u201d The suggestion of marriage struck Hurstwood forcibly."], "Who does Carrie imitate to make herself into a woman of \u201cconsiderable taste\u201d?": [" In short, her knowledge of grace doubled, and with it her appearance changed. She became a girl of considerable taste. Drouet noticed this. He saw the new bow in her hair and the new way of arranging her locks which she affected one morning. \u201cYou look fine that way, Cad,\u201d he said. \u201cDo I?\u201d she replied, sweetly. It made her try for other effects that selfsame day. She used her feet less heavily, a thing that was brought about by her attempting to imitate the treasurer\u2019s daughter\u2019s graceful carriage. How much influence the presence of that young woman in the same house had upon her it would be difficult to say. But, because of all these things, when Hurstwood called he had found a young woman who was much more than the Carrie to whom Drouet had first spoken. The primary defects of dress and manner had passed. She was pretty, graceful, rich in the timidity born of uncertainty, and with a something childlike in her large eyes which captured the fancy of this starched and conventional poser among men.", " He would turn and follow the disappearing vision with his eyes. He would thrill as a child with the unhindered passion that was in him. He loved the thing that women love in themselves, grace. At this, their own shrine, he knelt with them, an ardent devotee. \u201cDid you see that woman who went by just now?\u201d he said to Carrie on the first day they took a walk together. \u201cFine stepper, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d Carrie looked, and observed the grace commended. \u201cYes, she is,\u201d she returned, cheerfully, a little suggestion of possible defect in herself awakening in her mind. If that was so fine, she must look at it more closely. Instinctively, she felt a desire to imitate it. Surely she could do that too. When one of her mind sees many things emphasized and re-emphasized and admired, she gathers the logic of it and applies accordingly. Drouet was not shrewd enough to see that this was not tactful. He could not see that it would be better to make her feel that she was competing with herself, not others better than herself.", " \u201cI\u2019m going away, Julia,\u201d he said, \u201cfor a few days.\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d she asked, looking up. \u201cTo Philadelphia, on business.\u201d She looked at him consciously, expecting something else. \u201cI\u2019ll have to leave you behind this time.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d she replied, but he could see that she was thinking that it was a curious thing.

I\u2019ve often thought you\u2019d make a corking good actress.\u201d \u201cDid you really?\u201d asked Carrie. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said the drummer. He little knew as he went out of the door that night what a secret flame he had kindled in the bosom of the girl he left behind. Carrie was possessed of that sympathetic, impressionable nature which, ever in the most developed form, has been the glory of the drama. She was created with that passivity of soul which is always the mirror of the active world. She possessed an innate taste for imitation and no small ability. Even without practice, she could sometimes restore dramatic situations she had witnessed by re-creating, before her mirror, the expressions of the various faces taking part in the scene. She loved to modulate her voice after the conventional manner of the distressed heroine, and repeat such pathetic fragments as appealed most to her sympathies."], "What are Hurstwood and Carrie doing when he first confesses his love for her?": [" \u201cWhy, certainly, dear. Why didn\u2019t you tell me before?\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t necessary,\u201d said Hurstwood.

He would not care. \u201cCarrie,\u201d he said, getting up once and coming over to her, \u201care you going to stay with me from now on?\u201d She looked at him quizzically, but melted with sympathy as the value of the look upon his face forced itself upon her. It was love now, keen and strong\u2014love enhanced by difficulty and worry. She could not help smiling. \u201cLet me be everything to you from now on,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t make me worry any more. I\u2019ll be true to you. We\u2019ll go to New York and get a nice flat. I\u2019ll go into business again, and we\u2019ll be happy. Won\u2019t you be mine?\u201d Carrie listened quite solemnly. There was no great passion in her, but the drift of things and this man\u2019s proximity created a semblance of affection. She felt rather sorry for him\u2014a sorrow born of what had only recently been a great admiration. True love she had never felt for him.", " \u201cThen why not settle the whole thing, once and for all?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cDon\u2019t know! Ah, Carrie, what makes you say that? Don\u2019t torment me. Be serious.\u201d \u201cI am,\u201d said Carrie, softly. \u201cYou can\u2019t be, dearest, and say that. Not when you know how I love you. Look at last night.\u201d His manner as he said this was the most quiet imaginable. His face and body retained utter composure. Only his eyes moved, and they flashed a subtle, dissolving fire. In them the whole intensity of the man\u2019s nature was distilling itself. Carrie made no answer. \u201cHow can you act this way, dearest?\u201d he inquired, after a time. \u201cYou love me, don\u2019t you?\u201d He turned on her such a storm of feeling that she was overwhelmed. For the moment all doubts were cleared away. \u201cYes,\u201d she answered, frankly and tenderly. \u201cWell, then you\u2019ll come, won\u2019t you\u2014come to-night?\u201d Carrie shook her head in spite of her distress. \u201cI can\u2019t wait any longer,\u201d urged Hurstwood.", " This majesty of passion is possessed by nearly every man once in his life, but it is usually an attribute of youth and conduces to the first successful mating. Hurstwood, being an older man, could scarcely be said to retain the fire of youth, though he did possess a passion warm and unreasoning. It was strong enough to induce the leaning toward him which, on Carrie\u2019s part, we have seen. She might have been said to be imagining herself in love, when she was not. Women frequently do this. It flows from the fact that in each exists a bias toward affection, a craving for the pleasure of being loved. The longing to be shielded, bettered, sympathised with, is one of the attributes of the sex. This, coupled with sentiment and a natural tendency to emotion, often makes refusing difficult. It persuades them that they are in love. Once at home, she changed her clothes and straightened the rooms for herself."], "Who takes special note of the time Hurstwood and Carrie spend together during Drouet\u2019s absence?": [" He would visit the local resorts, or those near by in Wisconsin, and spend a few stiff, polished days strolling about conventional places doing conventional things. He knew the need of it. When some one of the many middle-class individuals whom he knew, who had money, would get into trouble, he would shake his head. It didn\u2019t do to talk about those things. If it came up for discussion among such friends as with him passed for close, he would deprecate the folly of the thing. \u201cIt was all right to do it\u2014all men do those things\u2014but why wasn\u2019t he careful? A man can\u2019t be too careful.\u201d He lost sympathy for the man that made a mistake and was found out. On this account he still devoted some time to showing his wife about\u2014time which would have been wearisome indeed if it had not been for the people he would meet and the little enjoyments which did not depend upon her presence or absence. He watched her with considerable curiosity at times, for she was still attractive in a way and men looked at her.", " He had a good, wide, well-shaped mouth, and his dark-brown hair was parted slightly on one side. He seemed to have the least touch of boyishness to Carrie, and yet he was a man full grown. \u201cDo you know,\u201d he said, turning back to Carrie, after his reflection, \u201cI sometimes think it is a shame for people to spend so much money this way.\u201d Carrie looked at him a moment with the faintest touch of surprise at his seriousness. He seemed to be thinking about something over which she had never pondered. \u201cDo you?\u201d she answered, interestedly. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cthey pay so much more than these things are worth. They put on so much show.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know why people shouldn\u2019t spend when they have it,\u201d said Mrs. Vance. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t do any harm,\u201d said Vance, who was still studying the bill of fare, though he had ordered. Ames was looking away again, and Carrie was again looking at his forehead. To her he seemed to be thinking about strange things.", " He pretended to be seriously interested in all she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to play,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cCharlie, you are neglecting a part of your duty,\u201d he observed to Drouet most affably. \u201cBetween us, though,\u201d he went on, \u201cwe can show you.\u201d By his tact he made Drouet feel that he admired his choice. There was something in his manner that showed that he was pleased to be there. Drouet felt really closer to him than ever before. It gave him more respect for Carrie. Her appearance came into a new light, under Hurstwood\u2019s appreciation. The situation livened considerably. \u201cNow, let me see,\u201d said Hurstwood, looking over Carrie\u2019s shoulder very deferentially. \u201cWhat have you?\u201d He studied for a moment. \u201cThat\u2019s rather good,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky. Now, I\u2019ll show you how to trounce your husband. You take my advice.\u201d \u201cHere,\u201d said Drouet, \u201cif you two are going to scheme together, I won\u2019t stand a ghost of a show.", " The second time, also, he sent word, but at the last moment. The third time he forgot entirely and explained afterwards. These events were months apart, each. \u201cWhere were you, George?\u201d asked Carrie, after the first absence. \u201cTied up at the office,\u201d he said genially. \u201cThere were some accounts I had to straighten.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry you couldn\u2019t get home,\u201d she said kindly. \u201cI was fixing to have such a nice dinner.\u201d The second time he gave a similar excuse, but the third time the feeling about it in Carrie\u2019s mind was a little bit out of the ordinary. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get home,\u201d he said, when he came in later in the evening, \u201cI was so busy.\u201d \u201cCouldn\u2019t you have sent me word?\u201d asked Carrie. \u201cI meant to,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you know I forgot it until it was too late to do any good.\u201d \u201cAnd I had such a good dinner!\u201d said Carrie. Now, it so happened that from his observations of Carrie he began to imagine that she was of the thoroughly domestic type of mind."], "What does Carrie mention that shocks Hurstwood and prompts him to suggest that they go on a trip?": [" \u201cThanks, old man,\u201d said his friend, \u201cI\u2019ll see what the girl says and let you know.\u201d They separated in the most cordial manner. \u201cThere\u2019s a nice fellow,\u201d Drouet thought to himself as he turned the corner towards Madison. \u201cDrouet is a good fellow,\u201d Hurstwood thought to himself as he went back into his office, \u201cbut he\u2019s no man for Carrie.\u201d The thought of the latter turned his mind into a most pleasant vein, and he wandered how he would get ahead of the drummer. When Drouet entered Carrie\u2019s presence, he caught her in his arms as usual, but she responded to his kiss with a tremour of opposition. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI had a great trip.\u201d \u201cDid you? How did you come out with that La Crosse man you were telling me about?\u201d \u201cOh, fine; sold him a complete line. There was another fellow there, representing Burnstein, a regular hook-nosed sheeny, but he wasn\u2019t in it. I made him look like nothing at all.\u201d As he undid his collar and unfastened his studs, preparatory to washing his face and changing his clothes, he dilated upon his trip.", " I say this, not because I want to speak of my money, but because I love you and wish to gratify your every desire. It is love that prompts me to write. Will you not give me one half-hour in which to plead my cause?\u201d Such of these letters as came while Carrie was still in the Seventeenth Street place were read with more interest\u2014though never delight\u2014than those which arrived after she was installed in her luxurious quarters at the Wellington. Even there her vanity\u2014or that self-appreciation which, in its more rabid form, is called vanity\u2014was not sufficiently cloyed to make these things wearisome. Adulation, being new in any form, pleased her. Only she was sufficiently wise to distinguish between her old condition and her new one. She had not had fame or money before. Now they had come. She had not had adulation and affectionate propositions before. Now they had come. Wherefore? She smiled to think that men should suddenly find her so much more attractive.", " What he wore did not strike the eye so forcibly as that which Drouet had on, but Carrie could see the elegance of the material. Hurstwood\u2019s shoes were of soft, black calf, polished only to a dull shine. Drouet wore patent leather but Carrie could not help feeling that there was a distinction in favour of the soft leather, where all else was so rich. She noticed these things almost unconsciously. They were things which would naturally flow from the situation. She was used to Drouet\u2019s appearance. \u201cSuppose we have a little game of euchre?\u201d suggested Hurstwood, after a light round of conversation. He was rather dexterous in avoiding everything that would suggest that he knew anything of Carrie\u2019s past. He kept away from personalities altogether, and confined himself to those things which did not concern individuals at all. By his manner, he put Carrie at her ease, and by his deference and pleasantries he amused her.", " They have some of the loveliest patterns. I saw one there that I know would look stunning on you. I said so when I saw it.\u201d Carrie listened to these things with considerable interest, for they were suggested with more of friendliness than is usually common between pretty women. Mrs. Vance liked Carrie\u2019s stable good-nature so well that she really took pleasure in suggesting to her the latest things. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you get yourself one of those nice serge skirts they\u2019re selling at Lord & Taylor\u2019s?\u201d she said one day. \u201cThey\u2019re the circular style, and they\u2019re going to be worn from now on. A dark blue one would look so nice on you.\u201d Carrie listened with eager ears. These things never came up between her and Hurstwood. Nevertheless, she began to suggest one thing and another, which Hurstwood agreed to without any expression of opinion. He noticed the new tendency on Carrie\u2019s part, and finally, hearing much of Mrs. Vance and her delightful ways, suspected whence the change came."], "What do Hurstwood\u2019s responsibilities at the Elk lodge prompt him to ask Carrie to do?": [" Hurstwood was charmed by the development of the fact that the girl had capabilities. There is nothing so inspiring in life as the sight of a legitimate ambition, no matter how incipient. It gives colour, force, and beauty to the possessor. Carrie was now lightened by a touch of this divine afflatus. She drew to herself commendation from her two admirers which she had not earned. Their affection for her naturally heightened their perception of what she was trying to do and their approval of what she did. Her inexperience conserved her own exuberant fancy, which ran riot with every straw of opportunity, making of it a golden divining rod whereby the treasure of life was to be discovered. \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d said Hurstwood, \u201cI ought to know some of the boys in the lodge. I\u2019m an Elk myself.\u201d \u201cOh, you mustn\u2019t let him know I told you.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s so,\u201d said the manager. \u201cI\u2019d like for you to be there, if you want to come, but I don\u2019t see how you can unless he asks you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d said Hurstwood affectionately.", " \u201cGeorge!\u201d exclaimed Drouet, \u201cI forgot that.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d inquired Carrie. They were at their little table in the room which might have been used for a kitchen, where Carrie occasionally served a meal. To-night the fancy had caught her, and the little table was spread with a pleasing repast. \u201cWhy, my lodge entertainment. They\u2019re going to give a play, and they wanted me to get them some young lady to take a part.\u201d \u201cWhat is it they\u2019re going to play?\u201d \u201c\u2018Under the Gaslight.\u2019\u201d \u201cWhen?\u201d \u201cOn the 16th.\u201d \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you?\u201d asked Carrie. \u201cI don\u2019t know any one,\u201d he replied.

Her eyes brightened, for if there was anything that enlisted her sympathies it was the art of the stage.", " He might hunt her out at the show and hound her in that way. She did not wholly believe that he would, but he might. This, she knew, would be an embarrassing thing if he made himself conspicuous in any way. It troubled her greatly. Things were precipitated by the offer of a better part. One of the actresses playing the part of a modest sweetheart gave notice of leaving and Carrie was selected. \u201cHow much are you going to get?\u201d asked Miss Osborne, on hearing the good news. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask him,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cWell, find out. Goodness, you\u2019ll never get anything if you don\u2019t ask. Tell them you must have forty dollars, anyhow.\u201d \u201cOh, no,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cCertainly!\u201d exclaimed Lola. \u201cAsk \u2019em, anyway.\u201d Carrie succumbed to this prompting, waiting, however, until the manager gave her notice of what clothing she must have to fit the part. \u201cHow much do I get?\u201d she inquired. \u201cThirty-five dollars,\u201d he replied.", " Drouet dropped in at the lodge when he went down town, and swashed around with a great _air_, as Quincel met him. \u201cWhere is that young lady you were going to get for us?\u201d asked the latter. \u201cI\u2019ve got her,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cHave you?\u201d said Quincel, rather surprised by his promptness; \u201cthat\u2019s good.

She encountered a very similar experience in the office of Mr. Jenks, only he varied it by saying at the close: \u201cIf you could play at some local house, or had a programme with your name on it, I might do something.\u201d In the third place the individual asked: \u201cWhat sort of work do you want to do?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cWell, do you want to get in a comedy or on the vaudeville stage or in the chorus?\u201d \u201cOh, I\u2019d like to get a part in a play,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cWell,\u201d said the man, \u201cit\u2019ll cost you something to do that.\u201d \u201cHow much?\u201d said Carrie, who, ridiculous as it may seem, had not thought of this before. \u201cWell, that\u2019s for you to say,\u201d he answered shrewdly. Carrie looked at him curiously. She hardly knew how to continue the inquiry. \u201cCould you get me a part if I paid?\u201d \u201cIf we didn\u2019t you\u2019d get your money back.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d she said.", " Though older, he was but slightly changed.

Say, you\u2019ve got a great show. You do your part fine. I knew you would. I just happened to be passing to-night and thought I\u2019d drop in for a few minutes. I saw your name on the programme, but I didn\u2019t remember it until you came on the stage. Then it struck me all at once. Say, you could have knocked me down with a feather. That\u2019s the same name you used out there in Chicago, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d answered Carrie, mildly, overwhelmed by the man\u2019s assurance. \u201cI knew it was, the moment I saw you. Well, how have you been, anyhow?\u201d \u201cOh, very well,\u201d said Carrie, lingering in her dressing-room. She was rather dazed by the assault. \u201cHow have you been?\u201d \u201cMe? Oh, fine. I\u2019m here now.\u201d \u201cIs that so?\u201d said Carrie.", " Ah, then she would be happy! Chapter XXXII. THE FEAST OF BELSHAZZAR: A SEER TO TRANSLATE Such feelings as were generated in Carrie by this walk put her in an exceedingly receptive mood for the pathos which followed in the play. The actor whom they had gone to see had achieved his popularity by presenting a mellow type of comedy, in which sufficient sorrow was introduced to lend contrast and relief to humour. For Carrie, as we well know, the stage had a great attraction. She had never forgotten her one histrionic achievement in Chicago. It dwelt in her mind and occupied her consciousness during many long afternoons in which her rocking-chair and her latest novel contributed the only pleasures of her state. Never could she witness a play without having her own ability vividly brought to consciousness. Some scenes made her long to be a part of them\u2014to give expression to the feelings which she, in the place of the character represented, would feel."], "What does Drouet think of Hurstwood\u2019s offer to buy flowers for Carrie?": [" \u201cWell, now, just how much money would it take to buy a half interest here?\u201d said Hurstwood, who saw seven hundred dollars as his limit. \u201cThree thousand,\u201d said the man. Hurstwood\u2019s jaw fell. \u201cCash?\u201d he said. \u201cCash.\u201d He tried to put on an air of deliberation, as one who might really buy; but his eyes showed gloom. He wound up by saying he would think it over, and came away. The man he had been talking to sensed his condition in a vague way. \u201cI don\u2019t think he wants to buy,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t talk right.\u201d The afternoon was as grey as lead and cold. It was blowing up a disagreeable winter wind. He visited a place far up on the east side, near Sixty-ninth Street, and it was five o\u2019clock, and growing dim, when he reached there. A portly German kept this place. \u201cHow about this ad of yours?\u201d asked Hurstwood, who rather objected to the looks of the place. \u201cOh, dat iss all over,\u201d said the German.", " Drouet stood by, and when he saw how nice they looked, said, \u201cWear them.\u201d Carrie shook her head, however. She was thinking of returning to the flat. He bought her a purse for one thing, and a pair of gloves for another, and let her buy the stockings. \u201cTo-morrow,\u201d he said, \u201cyou come down here and buy yourself a skirt.\u201d In all of Carrie\u2019s actions there was a touch of misgiving. The deeper she sank into the entanglement, the more she imagined that the thing hung upon the few remaining things she had not done. Since she had not done these, there was a way out. Drouet knew a place in Wabash Avenue where there were rooms. He showed Carrie the outside of these, and said: \u201cNow, you\u2019re my sister.\u201d He carried the arrangement off with an easy hand when it came to the selection, looking around, criticising, opining. \u201cHer trunk will be here in a day or so,\u201d he observed to the landlady, who was very pleased.", " Unfortunately for the smooth progression of this affair, Drouet returned. Hurstwood was sitting in his imposing little office the next afternoon when he saw Drouet enter. \u201cWhy, hello, Charles,\u201d he called affably; \u201cback again?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d smiled Drouet, approaching and looking in at the door. Hurstwood arose. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, looking the drummer over, \u201crosy as ever, eh?\u201d They began talking of the people they knew and things that had happened. \u201cBeen home yet?\u201d finally asked Hurstwood. \u201cNo, I am going, though,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cI remembered the little girl out there,\u201d said Hurstwood, \u201cand called once. Thought you wouldn\u2019t want her left quite alone.\u201d \u201cRight you are,\u201d agreed Drouet. \u201cHow is she?\u201d \u201cVery well,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cRather anxious about you though. You\u2019d better go out now and cheer her up.\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d said Drouet, smilingly. \u201cLike to have you both come down and go to the show with me Wednesday,\u201d concluded Hurstwood at parting.", " He almost jerked the old subtle light to his eyes. \u201cI thought,\u201d he said, looking at Carrie, \u201cI would come around and tell you how well you did, Mrs. Drouet. It was delightful.\u201d Carrie took the cue, and replied: \u201cOh, thank you.\u201d \u201cI was just telling her,\u201d put in Drouet, now delighted with his possession, \u201cthat I thought she did fine.\u201d \u201cIndeed you did,\u201d said Hurstwood, turning upon Carrie eyes in which she read more than the words. Carrie laughed luxuriantly. \u201cIf you do as well in the rest of the play, you will make us all think you are a born actress.\u201d Carrie smiled again. She felt the acuteness of Hurstwood\u2019s position, and wished deeply that she could be alone with him, but she did not understand the change in Drouet. Hurstwood found that he could not talk, repressed as he was, and grudging Drouet every moment of his presence, he bowed himself out with the elegance of a Faust. Outside he set his teeth with envy."], "Why do the tickets to Carrie\u2019s Elk lodge premiere sell so well?": [" Hurstwood was charmed by the development of the fact that the girl had capabilities.

The dressy manager was shaken by the hand three times in as many minutes. \u201cI hear your lodge is going to give a performance,\u201d observed Hurstwood, in the most offhand manner. \u201cYes, who told you?\u201d \u201cNo one,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cThey just sent me a couple of tickets, which I can have for two dollars. Is it going to be any good?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d replied the drummer. \u201cThey\u2019ve been trying to get me to get some woman to take a part.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t intending to go,\u201d said the manager easily. \u201cI\u2019ll subscribe, of course.

Almost immediately, \u201cAll aboard,\u201d resounded faintly from the outside, and the train started. Carrie began to think it was a little bit curious\u2014this going to a depot\u2014but said nothing.

The lodge members knew him to be single. \u201cThat sounds like somebody that can act, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d said Quincel. \u201cYes, it does.\u201d He took the part home to Carrie and handed it to her with the manner of one who does a favour."], "How does Hurstwood feel when he returns home after Carrie\u2019s successful premiere?": [" \u201cMy Lord! what can you do with a man who drawls out a sentence like that?\u201d \u201cDo the best you can,\u201d said Quincel consolingly. The rendition ran on in this wise until it came to where Carrie, as Laura, comes into the room to explain to Ray, who, after hearing Pearl\u2019s statement about her birth, had written the letter repudiating her, which, however, he did not deliver. Bamberger was just concluding the words of Ray, \u201cI must go before she returns. Her step! Too late,\u201d and was cramming the letter in his pocket, when she began sweetly with: \u201cRay!\u201d \u201cMiss\u2014Miss Courtland,\u201d Bamberger faltered weakly. Carrie looked at him a moment and forgot all about the company present. She began to feel the part, and summoned an indifferent smile to her lips, turning as the lines directed and going to a window, as if he were not present. She did it with a grace which was fascinating to look upon. \u201cWho is that woman?\u201d asked the director, watching Carrie in her little scene with Bamberger.", " There he leaned over the splendid bar and swallowed a glass of plain whiskey and purchased a couple of cigars, one of which he lighted. This to him represented in part high life\u2014a fair sample of what the whole must be. Drouet was not a drinker in excess. He was not a moneyed man. He only craved the best, as his mind conceived it, and such doings seemed to him a part of the best. Rector\u2019s, with its polished marble walls and floor, its profusion of lights, its show of china and silverware, and, above all, its reputation as a resort for actors and professional men, seemed to him the proper place for a successful man to go. He loved fine clothes, good eating, and particularly the company and acquaintanceship of successful men. When dining, it was a source of keen satisfaction to him to know that Joseph Jefferson was wont to come to this same place, or that Henry E. Dixie, a well-known performer of the day, was then only a few tables off.", " They caused her to cling closer to things she possessed. One short song the young lady played in a most soulful and tender mood. Carrie heard it through the open door from the parlour below. It was at that hour between afternoon and night when, for the idle, the wanderer, things are apt to take on a wistful aspect. The mind wanders forth on far journeys and returns with sheaves of withered and departed joys. Carrie sat at her window looking out. Drouet had been away since ten in the morning. She had amused herself with a walk, a book by Bertha M. Clay which Drouet had left there, though she did not wholly enjoy the latter, and by changing her dress for the evening. Now she sat looking out across the park as wistful and depressed as the nature which craves variety and life can be under such circumstances. As she contemplated her new state, the strain from the parlour below stole upward. With it her thoughts became coloured and enmeshed.", " For the most part he lounged about, dressed in excellent tailored suits of imported goods, a solitaire ring, a fine blue diamond in his tie, a striking vest of some new pattern, and a watch-chain of solid gold, which held a charm of rich design, and a watch of the latest make and engraving. He knew by name, and could greet personally with a \u201cWell, old fellow,\u201d hundreds of actors, merchants, politicians, and the general run of successful characters about town, and it was part of his success to do so. He had a finely graduated scale of informality and friendship, which improved from the \u201cHow do you do?\u201d addressed to the fifteen-dollar-a-week clerks and office attaches, who, by long frequenting of the place, became aware of his position, to the \u201cWhy, old man, how are you?\u201d which he addressed to those noted or rich individuals who knew him and were inclined to be friendly. There was a class, however, too rich, too famous, or too successful, with whom he could not attempt any familiarity of address, and with these he was professionally tactful, assuming a grave and dignified attitude, paying them the deference which would win their good feeling without in the least compromising his own bearing and opinions."], "Who is Drouet flirting with when he feels the first inklings of suspicion toward Hurstwood?": [" \u201cWednesday. We\u2019ll go, won\u2019t we?\u201d \u201cIf you think so,\u201d she answered, her manner being so enforcedly reserved as to almost excite suspicion. Drouet noticed something but he thought it was due to her feelings concerning their talk about marriage. \u201cHe called once, he said.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Carrie, \u201che was out here Sunday evening.\u201d \u201cWas he?\u201d said Drouet. \u201cI thought from what he said that he had called a week or so ago.\u201d \u201cSo he did,\u201d answered Carrie, who was wholly unaware of what conversation her lovers might have held. She was all at sea mentally, and fearful of some entanglement which might ensue from what she would answer. \u201cOh, then he called twice?\u201d said Drouet, the first shade of misunderstanding showing in his face. \u201cYes,\u201d said Carrie innocently, feeling now that Hurstwood must have mentioned but one call. Drouet imagined that he must have misunderstood his friend. He did not attach particular importance to the information, after all.", " \u201cShe just feels a little curious, I guess,\u201d ventured Minnie. \u201cEverything is so new.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Hanson, and went over to the baby, his forehead slightly wrinkled. He was thinking of a full career of vanity and wastefulness which a young girl might indulge in, and wondering how Carrie could contemplate such a course when she had so little, as yet, with which to do. On Saturday Carrie went out by herself\u2014first toward the river, which interested her, and then back along Jackson Street, which was then lined by the pretty houses and fine lawns which subsequently caused it to be made into a boulevard. She was struck with the evidences of wealth, although there was, perhaps, not a person on the street worth more than a hundred thousand dollars. She was glad to be out of the flat, because already she felt that it was a narrow, humdrum place, and that interest and joy lay elsewhere. Her thoughts now were of a more liberal character, and she punctuated them with speculations as to the whereabouts of Drouet.", " Unfortunately for the smooth progression of this affair, Drouet returned. Hurstwood was sitting in his imposing little office the next afternoon when he saw Drouet enter. \u201cWhy, hello, Charles,\u201d he called affably; \u201cback again?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d smiled Drouet, approaching and looking in at the door. Hurstwood arose. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, looking the drummer over, \u201crosy as ever, eh?\u201d They began talking of the people they knew and things that had happened. \u201cBeen home yet?\u201d finally asked Hurstwood. \u201cNo, I am going, though,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cI remembered the little girl out there,\u201d said Hurstwood, \u201cand called once. Thought you wouldn\u2019t want her left quite alone.\u201d \u201cRight you are,\u201d agreed Drouet. \u201cHow is she?\u201d \u201cVery well,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cRather anxious about you though. You\u2019d better go out now and cheer her up.\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d said Drouet, smilingly. \u201cLike to have you both come down and go to the show with me Wednesday,\u201d concluded Hurstwood at parting.", " \u201cWake up,\u201d he said, \u201cand turn over. You\u2019re talking in your sleep.\u201d A week or so later Drouet strolled into Fitzgerald and Moy\u2019s, spruce in dress and manner. \u201cHello, Charley,\u201d said Hurstwood, looking out from his office door. Drouet strolled over and looked in upon the manager at his desk. \u201cWhen do you go out on the road again?\u201d he inquired. \u201cPretty soon,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen much of you this trip,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve been busy,\u201d said Drouet. They talked some few minutes on general topics. \u201cSay,\u201d said Drouet, as if struck by a sudden idea, \u201cI want you to come out some evening.\u201d \u201cOut where?\u201d inquired Hurstwood. \u201cOut to my house, of course,\u201d said Drouet, smiling. Hurstwood looked up quizzically, the least suggestion of a smile hovering about his lips. He studied the face of Drouet in his wise way, and then with the demeanour of a gentleman, said: \u201cCertainly; glad to.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll have a nice game of euchre.\u201d \u201cMay I bring a nice little bottle of Sec?\u201d asked Hurstwood."], "On what condition does Carrie promise to leave Chicago with Hurstwood?": [" The remembrance of how this individual brought up his wife to shake hands on that occasion was also on the instant clear. Hurstwood was greatly abashed. His eyes expressed the difficulty he felt. \u201cWhy, it\u2019s Hurstwood!\u201d said Cargill, remembering now, and sorry that he had not recognised him quickly enough in the beginning to have avoided this meeting. \u201cYes,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cHow are you?\u201d \u201cVery well,\u201d said Cargill, troubled for something to talk about. \u201cStopping here?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Hurstwood, \u201cjust keeping an appointment.\u201d \u201cI knew you had left Chicago. I was wondering what had become of you.\u201d \u201cOh, I\u2019m here now,\u201d answered Hurstwood, anxious to get away. \u201cDoing well, I suppose?\u201d \u201cExcellent.\u201d \u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d They looked at one another, rather embarrassed. \u201cWell, I have an engagement with a friend upstairs. I\u2019ll leave you. So long.\u201d Hurstwood nodded his head. \u201cDamn it all,\u201d he murmured, turning toward the door.", " Hurstwood could scarcely refrain from showing that he knew of this chap\u2019s presence. The insolence in the fellow\u2019s eye was galling. Still they passed, and he explained to Carrie concerning the city. Another restaurant was not long in showing itself, and here they entered. \u201cWhat a queer town this is,\u201d said Carrie, who marvelled at it solely because it was not like Chicago. \u201cIt isn\u2019t as lively as Chicago,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Carrie, whose feelings were already localised in the great Western city. \u201cWell, it isn\u2019t as interesting,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cWhat\u2019s here?\u201d asked Carrie, wondering at his choosing to visit this town. \u201cNothing much,\u201d returned Hurstwood. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a resort. There\u2019s some pretty scenery about here.\u201d Carrie listened, but with a feeling of unrest. There was much about her situation which destroyed the possibility of appreciation. \u201cWe won\u2019t stay here long,\u201d said Hurstwood, who was now really glad to note her dissatisfaction.", " When Carrie returned home, there was Hurstwood, reading as usual. He seemed to take his condition with the utmost nonchalance. His beard was at least four days old. \u201cOh,\u201d thought Carrie, \u201cif she were to come here and see him?\u201d She shook her head in absolute misery. It looked as if her situation was becoming unbearable. Driven to desperation, she asked at dinner: \u201cDid you ever hear any more from that wholesale house?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want an inexperienced man.\u201d Carrie dropped the subject, feeling unable to say more. \u201cI met Mrs. Vance this afternoon,\u201d she said, after a time. \u201cDid, eh?\u201d he answered. \u201cThey\u2019re back in New York now,\u201d Carrie went on. \u201cShe did look so nice.\u201d \u201cWell, she can afford it as long as he puts up for it,\u201d returned Hurstwood. \u201cHe\u2019s got a soft job.\u201d Hurstwood was looking into the paper. He could not see the look of infinite weariness and discontent Carrie gave him.", " Are you stopping here?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Mr. Kenny, and then, turning the word again added: \u201cHow are things out in Chicago?\u201d \u201cAbout the same as usual,\u201d said Hurstwood, smiling genially. \u201cWife with you?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cWell, I must see more of you to-day. I\u2019m just going in here for breakfast. Come in when you\u2019re through.\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d said Hurstwood, moving away. The whole conversation was a trial to him. It seemed to add complications with every word. This man called up a thousand memories. He represented everything he had left. Chicago, his wife, the elegant resort\u2014all these were in his greeting and inquiries. And here he was in this same hotel expecting to confer with him, unquestionably waiting to have a good time with him. All at once the Chicago papers would arrive. The local papers would have accounts in them this very day. He forgot his triumph with Carrie in the possibility of soon being known for what he was, in this man\u2019s eyes, a safe-breaker."], "Whose comments incite Julia\u2019s suspicions of Hurstwood?": [" Dr. Beale, coming east on the same drive, had recognised Hurstwood, but not before he was quite past him. He was not so sure of Carrie\u2014did not know whether it was Hurstwood\u2019s wife or daughter. \u201cYou don\u2019t speak to your friends when you meet them out driving, do you?\u201d he said, jocosely, to Mrs. Hurstwood. \u201cIf I see them, I do. Where was I?\u201d \u201cOn Washington Boulevard.\u201d he answered, expecting her eye to light with immediate remembrance. She shook her head. \u201cYes, out near Hoyne Avenue. You were with your husband.\u201d \u201cI guess you\u2019re mistaken,\u201d she answered. Then, remembering her husband\u2019s part in the affair, she immediately fell a prey to a host of young suspicions, of which, however, she gave no sign. \u201cI know I saw your husband,\u201d he went on. \u201cI wasn\u2019t so sure about you. Perhaps it was your daughter.\u201d \u201cPerhaps it was,\u201d said Mrs. Hurstwood, knowing full well that such was not the case, as Jessica had been her companion for weeks.", " He was still gloomy and disheartened. There, minutes seemed to go very slowly. An hour was a long, long time in passing. It was filled for him with observations and mental comments concerning the actual guests of the hotel, who passed in and out, and those more prosperous pedestrians whose good fortune showed in their clothes and spirits as they passed along Broadway, outside. It was nearly the first time since he had arrived in the city that his leisure afforded him ample opportunity to contemplate this spectacle. Now, being, perforce, idle himself, he wondered at the activity of others. How gay were the youths he saw, how pretty the women. Such fine clothes they all wore. They were so intent upon getting somewhere. He saw coquettish glances cast by magnificent girls. Ah, the money it required to train with such\u2014how well he knew! How long it had been since he had had the opportunity to do so!", " Such an atmosphere could not incite in him the cravings of a boy of eighteen, but in so far as they were excited, the lack of hope made them proportionately bitter. He could not fail to notice the signs of affluence and luxury on every hand. He had been to New York before and knew the resources of its folly. In part it was an awesome place to him, for here gathered all that he most respected on this earth\u2014wealth, place, and fame. The majority of the celebrities with whom he had tipped glasses in his day as manager hailed from this self-centred and populous spot. The most inviting stories of pleasure and luxury had been told of places and individuals here. He knew it to be true that unconsciously he was brushing elbows with fortune the livelong day; that a hundred or five hundred thousand gave no one the privilege of living more than comfortably in so wealthy a place. Fashion and pomp required more ample sums, so that the poor man was nowhere.", " Not finding him, her dread lifted, and she felt more kindly toward him. She quite forgot him until about to come out, after the show, when the chance of his being there frightened her. As day after day passed and she heard nothing at all, the thought of being bothered by him passed. In a little while she was, except for occasional thoughts, wholly free of the gloom with which her life had been weighed in the flat. It is curious to note how quickly a profession absorbs one. Carrie became wise in theatrical lore, hearing the gossip of little Lola. She learned what the theatrical papers were, which ones published items about actresses and the like. She began to read the newspaper notices, not only of the opera in which she had so small a part, but of others. Gradually the desire for notice took hold of her. She longed to be renowned like others, and read with avidity all the complimentary or critical comments made concerning others high in her profession."], "What does Hurstwood remember regretfully as Julia confronts him over his affair with Carrie?": [" Indeed, the shining sword of her wrath was but weakly suspended by a thread of thought. In the meanwhile Hurstwood encountered a humorous item concerning a stranger who had arrived in the city and became entangled with a bunco-steerer. It amused him immensely, and at last he stirred and chuckled to himself. He wished that he might enlist his wife\u2019s attention and read it to her. \u201cHa, ha,\u201d he exclaimed softly, as if to himself, \u201cthat\u2019s funny.\u201d Mrs. Hurstwood kept on arranging her hair, not so much as deigning a glance. He stirred again and went on to another subject. At last he felt as if his good-humour must find some outlet. Julia was probably still out of humour over that affair of this morning, but that could easily be straightened. As a matter of fact, she was in the wrong, but he didn\u2019t care. She could go to Waukesha right away if she wanted to. The sooner the better. He would tell her that as soon as he got a chance, and the whole thing would blow over.", " \u201cCertainly,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cI\u2019ll introduce you.\u201d Chapter IX. CONVENTION\u2019S OWN TINDER-BOX: THE EYE THAT IS GREEN Hurstwood\u2019s residence on the North Side, near Lincoln Park, was a brick building of a very popular type then, a three-story affair with the first floor sunk a very little below the level of the street. It had a large bay window bulging out from the second floor, and was graced in front by a small grassy plot, twenty-five feet wide and ten feet deep. There was also a small rear yard, walled in by the fences of the neighbours and holding a stable where he kept his horse and trap. The ten rooms of the house were occupied by himself, his wife Julia, and his son and daughter, George, Jr., and Jessica. There were besides these a maid-servant, represented from time to time by girls of various extraction, for Mrs. Hurstwood was not always easy to please. \u201cGeorge, I let Mary go yesterday,\u201d was not an unfrequent salutation at the dinner table.", " His many sins, however, were for the moment all forgotten. He pressed her closer and kissed her, and she felt that further opposition was useless. \u201cWill you marry me?\u201d she asked, forgetting _how_. \u201cThis very day,\u201d he said, with all delight. Now the hall-boy pounded on the door and he released his hold upon her regretfully. \u201cYou get ready now, will you,\u201d he said, \u201cat once?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d she answered. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in three-quarters of an hour.\u201d Carrie, flushed and excited, moved away as he admitted the boy. Below stairs, he halted in the lobby to look for a barber shop. For the moment, he was in fine feather. His recent victory over Carrie seemed to atone for much he had endured during the last few days. Life seemed worth fighting for. This eastward flight from all things customary and attached seemed as if it might have happiness in store. The storm showed a rainbow at the end of which might be a pot of gold.", " \u201cWho\u2019s here?\u201d said Hurstwood, passing into the theatre proper, where the lights were turned up and a company of gentlemen were laughing and talking in the open space back of the seats. \u201cWhy, how do you do, Mr. Hurstwood?\u201d came from the first individual recognised. \u201cGlad to see you,\u201d said the latter, grasping his hand lightly. \u201cLooks quite an affair, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cYes, indeed,\u201d said the manager. \u201cCuster seems to have the backing of its members,\u201d observed the friend. \u201cSo it should,\u201d said the knowing manager. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see it.\u201d \u201cWell, George,\u201d said another rotund citizen, whose avoirdupois made necessary an almost alarming display of starched shirt bosom, \u201chow goes it with you?\u201d \u201cExcellent,\u201d said the manager. \u201cWhat brings you over here?

It must be that Carrie had got rid of him\u2014as well she ought, he thought. \u201cA man always makes a mistake when he does anything like that,\u201d he observed. \u201cLike what?\u201d said Carrie, unwitting of what was coming. \u201cOh, you know,\u201d and Drouet waved her intelligence, as it were, with his hand. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d she answered. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cWhy that affair in Chicago\u2014the time he left.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what you are talking about,\u201d said Carrie.

He studied the face of Drouet in his wise way, and then with the demeanour of a gentleman, said: \u201cCertainly; glad to.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll have a nice game of euchre.\u201d \u201cMay I bring a nice little bottle of Sec?\u201d asked Hurstwood."], "Following his confrontation with Julia, who does Hurstwood encounter when he looks for Carrie at their usual meeting place?": [" Besides, he had the disagreeable fear of meeting old-time friends, ever since one such encounter which he made shortly after his arrival in the city. It was in Broadway that he saw a man approaching him whom he knew. There was no time for simulating non-recognition. The exchange of glances had been too sharp, the knowledge of each other too apparent. So the friend, a buyer for one of the Chicago wholesale houses, felt, perforce, the necessity of stopping. \u201cHow are you?\u201d he said, extending his hand with an evident mixture of feeling and a lack of plausible interest. \u201cVery well,\u201d said Hurstwood, equally embarrassed. \u201cHow is it with you?\u201d \u201cAll right; I\u2019m down here doing a little buying. Are you located here now?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Hurstwood, \u201cI have a place down in Warren Street.\u201d \u201cIs that so?\u201d said the friend. \u201cGlad to hear it. I\u2019ll come down and see you.\u201d \u201cDo,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cSo long,\u201d said the other, smiling affably and going on.", " I was talking with Mosher about that yesterday.\u201d \u201cNo, you won\u2019t,\u201d said Carrie, who was coming to feel a certain faint power to jest with the drummer. \u201cYes, I will,\u201d he exclaimed, more feelingly than usual, adding, with the tone of one who pleads, \u201cDon\u2019t you believe what I\u2019ve told you?\u201d Carrie laughed a little. \u201cOf course I do,\u201d she answered. Drouet\u2019s assurance now misgave him. Shallow as was his mental observation, there was that in the things which had happened which made his little power of analysis useless. Carrie was still with him, but not helpless and pleading. There was a lilt in her voice which was new. She did not study him with eyes expressive of dependence. The drummer was feeling the shadow of something which was coming. It coloured his feelings and made him develop those little attentions and say those little words which were mere forefendations against danger. Shortly afterward he departed, and Carrie prepared for her meeting with Hurstwood.", " \u201cWell, now, just how much money would it take to buy a half interest here?\u201d said Hurstwood, who saw seven hundred dollars as his limit. \u201cThree thousand,\u201d said the man. Hurstwood\u2019s jaw fell. \u201cCash?\u201d he said. \u201cCash.\u201d He tried to put on an air of deliberation, as one who might really buy; but his eyes showed gloom. He wound up by saying he would think it over, and came away. The man he had been talking to sensed his condition in a vague way. \u201cI don\u2019t think he wants to buy,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t talk right.\u201d The afternoon was as grey as lead and cold. It was blowing up a disagreeable winter wind. He visited a place far up on the east side, near Sixty-ninth Street, and it was five o\u2019clock, and growing dim, when he reached there. A portly German kept this place. \u201cHow about this ad of yours?\u201d asked Hurstwood, who rather objected to the looks of the place. \u201cOh, dat iss all over,\u201d said the German.", " The first month had scarcely passed before Carrie said in a very natural way: \u201cI think I\u2019ll go down this week and buy a dress.\u2019 \u201cWhat kind?\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cOh, something for street wear.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d he answered, smiling, although he noted mentally that it would be more agreeable to his finances if she didn\u2019t. Nothing was said about it the next day, but the following morning he asked: \u201cHave you done anything about your dress?\u201d \u201cNot yet,\u201d said Carrie. He paused a few moments, as if in thought, and then said: \u201cWould you mind putting it off a few days?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d replied Carrie, who did not catch the drift of his remarks. She had never thought of him in connection with money troubles before. \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019ll tell you,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cThis investment of mine is taking a lot of money just now. I expect to get it all back shortly, but just at present I am running close.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d answered Carrie."], "What does Hurstwood assume when Carrie fails to show up at their meeting place or send him a message?": [" Drouet dropped in at the lodge when he went down town, and swashed around with a great _air_, as Quincel met him. \u201cWhere is that young lady you were going to get for us?\u201d asked the latter. \u201cI\u2019ve got her,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cHave you?\u201d said Quincel, rather surprised by his promptness; \u201cthat\u2019s good. What\u2019s her address?\u201d and he pulled out his notebook in order to be able to send her part to her. \u201cYou want to send her her part?\u201d asked the drummer. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019ll take it. I\u2019m going right by her house in the morning. \u201cWhat did you say her address was? We only want it in case we have any information to send her.\u201d \u201cTwenty-nine Ogden Place.\u201d \u201cAnd her name?\u201d \u201cCarrie Madenda,\u201d said the drummer, firing at random. The lodge members knew him to be single. \u201cThat sounds like somebody that can act, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d said Quincel. \u201cYes, it does.\u201d He took the part home to Carrie and handed it to her with the manner of one who does a favour.", " \u201cThey say this show is going on the road next month.\u201d \u201cIs it?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cYes; do you think you\u2019ll go?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know; I guess so, if they\u2019ll take me.\u201d \u201cOh, they\u2019ll take you. I wouldn\u2019t go. They won\u2019t give you any more, and it will cost you everything you make to live. I never leave New York. There are too many shows going on here.\u201d \u201cCan you always get in another show?\u201d \u201cI always have. There\u2019s one going on up at the Broadway this month. I\u2019m going to try and get in that if this one really goes.\u201d Carrie heard this with aroused intelligence. Evidently it wasn\u2019t so very difficult to get on. Maybe she also could get a place if this show went away. \u201cDo they all pay about the same?\u201d she asked. \u201cYes. Sometimes you get a little more. This show doesn\u2019t pay very much.\u201d \u201cI get twelve,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cDo you?\u201d said the girl. \u201cThey pay me fifteen, and you do more work than I do. I wouldn\u2019t stand it if I were you.", " Hurstwood naturally abandoned his show of fine manners with her and modified his attitude to one of easy familiarity. There were no misunderstandings, no apparent differences of opinion. In fact, without money or visiting friends, he led a life which could neither arouse jealousy nor comment. Carrie rather sympathised with his efforts and thought nothing upon her lack of entertainment such as she had enjoyed in Chicago. New York as a corporate entity and her flat temporarily seemed sufficient. However, as Hurstwood\u2019s business increased, he, as stated, began to pick up acquaintances. He also began to allow himself more clothes. He convinced himself that his home life was very precious to him, but allowed that he could occasionally stay away from dinner. The first time he did this he sent a message saying that he would be detained. Carrie ate alone, and wished that it might not happen again.", " Fortunately, there was nothing from his wife either. He thanked his stars that he did not have to confront that proposition just now when he needed to think so much. He walked the floor again, pretending to be in an ordinary mood, but secretly troubled beyond the expression of words. At one-thirty he went to Rector\u2019s for lunch, and when he returned a messenger was waiting for him. He looked at the little chap with a feeling of doubt. \u201cI\u2019m to bring an answer,\u201d said the boy. Hurstwood recognised his wife\u2019s writing. He tore it open and read without a show of feeling. It began in the most formal manner and was sharply and coldly worded throughout. \u201cI want you to send the money I asked for at once. I need it to carry out my plans. You can stay away if you want to. It doesn\u2019t matter in the least. But I must have some money. So don\u2019t delay, but send it by the boy.\u201d When he had finished it, he stood holding it in his hands."], "Where does Hurstwood get ten thousand dollars in cash?": [" \u201cCount them,\u201d said a voice in his ear. He put his hand into the first of the boxes and lifted the stack, letting the separate parcels fall. They were bills of fifty and one hundred dollars done in packages of a thousand. He thought he counted ten such. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I shut the safe?\u201d his mind said to itself, lingering. \u201cWhat makes me pause here?\u201d For answer there came the strangest words: \u201cDid you ever have ten thousand dollars in ready money?\u201d Lo, the manager remembered that he had never had so much. All his property had been slowly accumulated, and now his wife owned that. He was worth more than forty thousand, all told\u2014but she would get that. He puzzled as he thought of these things, then pushed in the drawers and closed the door, pausing with his hand upon the knob, which might so easily lock it all beyond temptation. Still he paused. Finally he went to the windows and pulled down the curtains.", " \u201cWell, now, just how much money would it take to buy a half interest here?\u201d said Hurstwood, who saw seven hundred dollars as his limit. \u201cThree thousand,\u201d said the man. Hurstwood\u2019s jaw fell. \u201cCash?\u201d he said. \u201cCash.\u201d He tried to put on an air of deliberation, as one who might really buy; but his eyes showed gloom.

It was blowing up a disagreeable winter wind. He visited a place far up on the east side, near Sixty-ninth Street, and it was five o\u2019clock, and growing dim, when he reached there. A portly German kept this place. \u201cHow about this ad of yours?\u201d asked Hurstwood, who rather objected to the looks of the place. \u201cOh, dat iss all over,\u201d said the German.", " \u201cI have three of a kind,\u201d said one of the players to himself. \u201cI\u2019ll just stay with that fellow to the finish.\u201d The result was that bidding began. \u201cI raise you ten.\u201d \u201cGood.\u201d \u201cTen more.\u201d \u201cGood.\u201d \u201cTen again.\u201d \u201cRight you are.\u201d It got to where Hurstwood had seventy-five dollars up. The other man really became serious. Perhaps this individual (Hurstwood) really did have a stiff hand. \u201cI call,\u201d he said. Hurstwood showed his hand. He was done. The bitter fact that he had lost seventy-five dollars made him desperate. \u201cLet\u2019s have another pot,\u201d he said, grimly. \u201cAll right,\u201d said the man. Some of the other players quit, but observant loungers took their places. Time passed, and it came to twelve o\u2019clock. Hurstwood held on, neither winning nor losing much. Then he grew weary, and on a last hand lost twenty more. He was sick at heart. At a quarter after one in the morning he came out of the place. The chill, bare streets seemed a mockery of his state.", " \u201cNever!\u201d she thought. Who would furnish the money to move? To think of being in two rooms with him! She resolved to spend her money for clothes quickly, before something terrible happened. That very day she did it. Having done so, there was but one other thing to do. \u201cLola,\u201d she said, visiting her friend, \u201cI think I\u2019ll come.\u201d \u201cOh, jolly!\u201d cried the latter. \u201cCan we get it right away?\u201d she asked, meaning the room. \u201cCertainly,\u201d cried Lola. They went to look at it. Carrie had saved ten dollars from her expenditures\u2014enough for this and her board beside. Her enlarged salary would not begin for ten days yet\u2014would not reach her for seventeen. She paid half of the six dollars with her friend. \u201cNow, I\u2019ve just enough to get on to the end of the week,\u201d she confided. \u201cOh, I\u2019ve got some,\u201d said Lola. \u201cI\u2019ve got twenty-five dollars, if you need it.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll get along.\u201d They decided to move Friday, which was two days away."], "Under what pretense does Hurstwood make Carrie follow him onto a train bound for Detroit?": [" He hated to lie any more than necessary, and yet he wanted no protests until he was out of danger. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just called me up to go and get you and bring you out. They said there wasn\u2019t any need for alarm, but that I shouldn\u2019t fail to bring you.\u201d The man\u2019s serious manner convinced Carrie, and she became silent, wondering. Hurstwood examined his watch and urged the man to hurry. For one in so delicate a position he was exceedingly cool. He could only think of how needful it was to make the train and get quietly away. Carrie seemed quite tractable, and he congratulated himself. In due time they reached the depot, and after helping her out he handed the man a five-dollar bill and hurried on. \u201cYou wait here,\u201d he said to Carrie, when they reached the waiting-room, \u201cwhile I get the tickets.\u201d \u201cHave I much time to catch that train for Detroit?\u201d he asked of the agent.", " Perhaps Moy would understand. Perhaps they would forgive him and let him come back. By noontime the train rolled into Detroit and he began to feel exceedingly nervous. The police must be on his track by now. They had probably notified all the police of the big cities, and detectives would be watching for him. He remembered instances in which defaulters had been captured. Consequently, he breathed heavily and paled somewhat. His hands felt as if they must have something to do. He simulated interest in several scenes without which he did not feel. He repeatedly beat his foot upon the floor. Carrie noticed his agitation, but said nothing. She had no idea what it meant or that it was important. He wondered now why he had not asked whether this train went on through to Montreal or some Canadian point. Perhaps he could have saved time. He jumped up and sought the conductor. \u201cDoes any part of this train go to Montreal?\u201d he asked.", " The man explained the hours. \u201cNo more to-night?\u201d \u201cNothing with a sleeper. Yes, there is, too,\u201d he added. \u201cThere is a mail train out of here at three o\u2019clock.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cWhat time does that get to Detroit?\u201d He was thinking if he could only get there and cross the river into Canada, he could take his time about getting to Montreal. He was relieved to learn that it would reach there by noon. \u201cMayhew won\u2019t open the safe till nine,\u201d he thought. \u201cThey can\u2019t get on my track before noon.\u201d Then he thought of Carrie. With what speed must he get her, if he got her at all. She would have to come along. He jumped into the nearest cab standing by. \u201cTo Ogden Place,\u201d he said sharply. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a dollar more if you make good time.\u201d The cabby beat his horse into a sort of imitation gallop which was fairly fast, however. On the way Hurstwood thought what to do. Reaching the number, he hurried up the steps and did not spare the bell in waking the servant.", " \u201cYes, the next sleeper back does.\u201d He would have asked more, but it did not seem wise, so he decided to inquire at the depot. The train rolled into the yards, clanging and puffing. \u201cI think we had better go right on through to Montreal,\u201d he said to Carrie. \u201cI\u2019ll see what the connections are when we get off.\u201d He was exceedingly nervous, but did his best to put on a calm exterior. Carrie only looked at him with large, troubled eyes. She was drifting mentally, unable to say to herself what to do. The train stopped and Hurstwood led the way out. He looked warily around him, pretending to look after Carrie. Seeing nothing that indicated studied observation, he made his way to the ticket office. \u201cThe next train for Montreal leaves when?\u201d he asked. \u201cIn twenty minutes,\u201d said the man. He bought two tickets and Pullman berths. Then he hastened back to Carrie. \u201cWe go right out again,\u201d he said, scarcely noticing that Carrie looked tired and weary."], "Who accosts Hurstwood in a Montreal hotel, prompting him to send back most of the money he stole?": [" I want to go to Montreal for a while, and then anywhere you want to. We\u2019ll go and live in New York, if you say.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll not have anything to do with you,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cI want to get off this train. Where are we going?\u201d \u201cTo Detroit,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cOh!\u201d said Carrie, in a burst of anguish. So distant and definite a point seemed to increase the difficulty. \u201cWon\u2019t you come along with me?\u201d he said, as if there was great danger that she would not. \u201cYou won\u2019t need to do anything but travel with me. I\u2019ll not trouble you in any way. You can see Montreal and New York, and then if you don\u2019t want to stay you can go back. It will be better than trying to go back to-night.\u201d The first gleam of fairness shone in this proposition for Carrie. It seemed a plausible thing to do, much as she feared his opposition if she tried to carry it out. Montreal and New York! Even now she was speeding toward those great, strange lands, and could see them if she liked.", " Still he went on and into the room. \u201cWho was it?\u201d asked Carrie. \u201cA friend of mine from Chicago.\u201d The whole of this conversation was such a shock that, coming as it did after all the other worry of the past week, it sufficed to induce a deep gloom and moral revulsion in Hurstwood. What hurt him most was the fact that he was being pursued as a thief. He began to see the nature of that social injustice which sees but one side\u2014often but a single point in a long tragedy. All the newspapers noted but one thing, his taking the money. How and wherefore were but indifferently dealt with. All the complications which led up to it were unknown. He was accused without being understood. Sitting in his room with Carrie the same day, he decided to send the money back. He would write Fitzgerald and Moy, explain all, and then send it by express. Maybe they would forgive him. Perhaps they would ask him back.", " I\u2019ve had bad luck in a way but I\u2019m not here to tell you that. I want something to do, if only for a week.\u201d The man imagined he saw a feverish gleam in the applicant\u2019s eye. \u201cWhat hotel did you manage?\u201d he inquired. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a hotel,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cI was manager of Fitzgerald and Moy\u2019s place in Chicago for fifteen years.\u201d \u201cIs that so?\u201d said the hotel man. \u201cHow did you come to get out of that?\u201d The figure of Hurstwood was rather surprising in contrast to the fact. \u201cWell, by foolishness of my own. It isn\u2019t anything to talk about now. You could find out if you wanted to. I\u2019m \u2018broke\u2019 now and, if you will believe me, I haven\u2019t eaten anything to-day.\u201d The hotel man was slightly interested in this story. He could hardly tell what to do with such a figure, and yet Hurstwood\u2019s earnestness made him wish to do something. \u201cCall Olsen,\u201d he said, turning to the clerk. In reply to a bell and a disappearing hall-boy, Olsen, the head porter, appeared.", " \u201cYes, the next sleeper back does.\u201d He would have asked more, but it did not seem wise, so he decided to inquire at the depot.

She was saved in that she was hopeful. The following morning the train pulled safely into Montreal and they stepped down, Hurstwood glad to be out of danger, Carrie wondering at the novel atmosphere of the northern city. Long before, Hurstwood had been here, and now he remembered the name of the hotel at which he had stopped. As they came out of the main entrance of the depot he heard it called anew by a busman. \u201cWe\u2019ll go right up and get rooms,\u201d he said. At the clerk\u2019s office Hurstwood swung the register about while the clerk came forward. He was thinking what name he would put down. With the latter before him he found no time for hesitation. A name he had seen out of the car window came swiftly to him. It was pleasing enough. With an easy hand he wrote, \u201cG. W. Murdock and wife.\u201d It was the largest concession to necessity he felt like making.", " She would have known as much if she could have analysed her feelings, but this thing which she now felt aroused by his great feeling broke down the barriers between them. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay with me, won\u2019t you?\u201d he asked. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, nodding her head. He gathered her to himself, imprinting kisses upon her lips and cheeks. \u201cYou must marry me, though,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll get a license to-day,\u201d he answered. \u201cHow?\u201d she asked. \u201cUnder a new name,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019ll take a new name and live a new life.

Then he hastened back to Carrie. \u201cWe go right out again,\u201d he said, scarcely noticing that Carrie looked tired and weary."], "In what city does Hurstwood purchase a one third share in a small saloon?": [" If I had some one who knew the business thoroughly I wouldn\u2019t mind sharing with him in this one and letting him manage it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve had experience enough,\u201d said Hurstwood blandly, but he felt a little diffident about referring to Fitzgerald and Moy. \u201cWell, you can suit yourself, Mr. Wheeler,\u201d said the proprietor. He only offered a third interest in the stock, fixtures, and good-will, and this in return for a thousand dollars and managerial ability on the part of the one who should come in. There was no property involved, because the owner of the saloon merely rented from an estate. The offer was genuine enough, but it was a question with Hurstwood whether a third interest in that locality could be made to yield one hundred and fifty dollars a month, which he figured he must have in order to meet the ordinary family expenses and be comfortable. It was not the time, however, after many failures to find what he wanted, to hesitate.", " He had never thought of the latter. At once he decided to look that up. The firm in question was Alsbery & Co., whiskey brokers. He was admitted almost at once to the manager on his appearance. \u201cGood-morning, sir,\u201d said the latter, thinking at first that he was encountering one of his out-of-town customers. \u201cGood-morning,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cYou advertised, I believe, for a salesman?\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said the man, showing plainly the enlightenment which had come to him. \u201cYes. Yes, I did.\u201d \u201cI thought I\u2019d drop in,\u201d said Hurstwood, with dignity. \u201cI\u2019ve had some experience in that line myself.\u201d \u201cOh, have you?\u201d said the man. \u201cWhat experience have you had?\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019ve managed several liquor houses in my time. Recently I owned a third-interest in a saloon at Warren and Hudson streets.\u201d \u201cI see,\u201d said the man. Hurstwood ceased, waiting for some suggestion. \u201cWe did want a salesman,\u201d said the man. \u201cI don\u2019t know as it\u2019s anything you\u2019d care to take hold of, though.\u201d \u201cI see,\u201d said Hurstwood.", " Across Fifth Avenue, through Madison Square by the winding paths, east on Twenty-third Street, and down Third Avenue wound the long, serpentine company. Midnight pedestrians and loiterers stopped and stared as the company passed. Chatting policemen, at various corners, stared indifferently or nodded to the leader, whom they had seen before. On Third Avenue they marched, a seemingly weary way, to Eighth Street, where there was a lodging-house, closed, apparently, for the night. They were expected, however. Outside in the gloom they stood, while the leader parleyed within. Then doors swung open and they were invited in with a \u201cSteady, now.\u201d Some one was at the head showing rooms, so that there was no delay for keys. Toiling up the creaky stairs, Hurstwood looked back and saw the captain, watching; the last one of the line being included in his broad solicitude. Then he gathered his cloak about him and strolled out into the night.", " This was really a gorgeous saloon from a Chicago standpoint. Like Rector\u2019s, it was also ornamented with a blaze of incandescent lights, held in handsome chandeliers. The floors were of brightly coloured tiles, the walls a composition of rich, dark, polished wood, which reflected the light, and coloured stucco-work, which gave the place a very sumptuous appearance. The long bar was a blaze of lights, polished woodwork, coloured and cut glassware, and many fancy bottles. It was a truly swell saloon, with rich screens, fancy wines, and a line of bar goods unsurpassed in the country. At Rector\u2019s, Drouet had met Mr. G. W. Hurstwood, manager of Fitzgerald and Moy\u2019s. He had been pointed out as a very successful and well-known man about town. Hurstwood looked the part, for, besides being slightly under forty, he had a good, stout constitution, an active manner, and a solid, substantial air, which was composed in part of his fine clothes, his clean linen, his jewels, and, above all, his own sense of his importance."], "What does Hurstwood believe about Carrie that causes him to leave her at home while he goes out with friends?": [" Your mouth will change. Your power to act will disappear. You may think they won\u2019t, but they will. Nature takes care of that.\u201d He was so interested in forwarding all good causes that he sometimes became enthusiastic, giving vent to these preachments. Something in Carrie appealed to him. He wanted to stir her up. \u201cI know,\u201d she said, absently, feeling slightly guilty of neglect. \u201cIf I were you,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019d change.\u201d The effect of this was like roiling helpless waters. Carrie troubled over it in her rocking-chair for days. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ll stay in comedy so very much longer,\u201d she eventually remarked to Lola. \u201cOh, why not?\u201d said the latter. \u201cI think,\u201d she said, \u201cI can do better in a serious play.\u201d \u201cWhat put that idea in your head?\u201d \u201cOh, nothing,\u201d she answered; \u201cI\u2019ve always thought so.\u201d Still, she did nothing\u2014grieving. It was a long way to this better thing\u2014or seemed so\u2014and comfort was about her; hence the inactivity and longing.", " \u201cThey say this show is going on the road next month.\u201d \u201cIs it?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cYes; do you think you\u2019ll go?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know; I guess so, if they\u2019ll take me.\u201d \u201cOh, they\u2019ll take you. I wouldn\u2019t go. They won\u2019t give you any more, and it will cost you everything you make to live. I never leave New York. There are too many shows going on here.\u201d \u201cCan you always get in another show?\u201d \u201cI always have. There\u2019s one going on up at the Broadway this month. I\u2019m going to try and get in that if this one really goes.\u201d Carrie heard this with aroused intelligence. Evidently it wasn\u2019t so very difficult to get on. Maybe she also could get a place if this show went away. \u201cDo they all pay about the same?\u201d she asked. \u201cYes. Sometimes you get a little more. This show doesn\u2019t pay very much.\u201d \u201cI get twelve,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cDo you?\u201d said the girl. \u201cThey pay me fifteen, and you do more work than I do. I wouldn\u2019t stand it if I were you.", " They\u2014they wouldn\u2019t know where I got them.\u201d \u201cWhat do you want to do,\u201d he smiled, \u201cgo without them?\u201d \u201cI think I\u2019ll go home,\u201d she said, wearily. \u201cOh, come,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019ve been thinking it over too long. I\u2019ll tell you what you do. You say you can\u2019t wear them out there. Why don\u2019t you rent a furnished room and leave them in that for a week?\u201d Carrie shook her head. Like all women, she was there to object and be convinced. It was for him to brush the doubts away and clear the path if he could. \u201cWhy are you going home?\u201d he asked. \u201cOh, I can\u2019t get anything here.\u201d \u201cThey won\u2019t keep you?\u201d he remarked, intuitively. \u201cThey can\u2019t,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what you do,\u201d he said. \u201cYou come with me. I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d Carrie heard this passively. The peculiar state which she was in made it sound like the welcome breath of an open door. Drouet seemed of her own spirit and pleasing. He was clean, handsome, well-dressed, and sympathetic.", " Carrie could not help listening with amusement to his animated descriptions. \u201cI tell you,\u201d he said, \u201cI surprised the people at the office. I\u2019ve sold more goods this last quarter than any other man of our house on the road. I sold three thousand dollars\u2019 worth in La Crosse.\u201d He plunged his face in a basin of water, and puffed and blew as he rubbed his neck and ears with his hands, while Carrie gazed upon him with mingled thoughts of recollection and present judgment. He was still wiping his face, when he continued: \u201cI\u2019m going to strike for a raise in June. They can afford to pay it, as much business as I turn in. I\u2019ll get it too, don\u2019t you forget.\u201d \u201cI hope you do,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cAnd then if that little real estate deal I\u2019ve got on goes through, we\u2019ll get married,\u201d he said with a great show of earnestness, the while he took his place before the mirror and began brushing his hair. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you ever intend to marry me, Charlie,\u201d Carrie said ruefully."], "Who introduces Carrie to Mr. Ames?": [" \u201cMr. Ames is just down in New York for a few days,\u201d put in Vance, \u201cand we\u2019re trying to show him around a little.\u201d \u201cOh, are you?\u201d said Carrie, taking another glance at the newcomer. \u201cYes; I am just on here from Indianapolis for a week or so,\u201d said young Ames, seating himself on the edge of a chair to wait while Mrs. Vance completed the last touches of her toilet. \u201cI guess you find New York quite a thing to see, don\u2019t you?\u201d said Carrie, venturing something to avoid a possible deadly silence. \u201cIt is rather large to get around in a week,\u201d answered Ames, pleasantly. He was an exceedingly genial soul, this young man, and wholly free of affectation. It seemed to Carrie he was as yet only overcoming the last traces of the bashfulness of youth. He did not seem apt at conversation, but he had the merit of being well dressed and wholly courageous. Carrie felt as if it were not going to be hard to talk to him.", " It was threatening rain, and Mr. Vance, at his wife\u2019s request, had called a coach. \u201cYour husband isn\u2019t coming?\u201d suggested Mr. Vance, as he met Carrie in his little parlour. \u201cNo; he said he wouldn\u2019t be home for dinner.\u201d \u201cBetter leave a little note for him, telling him where we are. He might turn up.\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d said Carrie, who had not thought of it before. \u201cTell him we\u2019ll be at Sherry\u2019s until eight o\u2019clock. He knows, though I guess.\u201d Carrie crossed the hall with rustling skirts, and scrawled the note, gloves on. When she returned a newcomer was in the Vance flat. \u201cMrs. Wheeler, let me introduce Mr. Ames, a cousin of mine,\u201d said Mrs. Vance. \u201cHe\u2019s going along with us, aren\u2019t you, Bob?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very glad to meet you,\u201d said Ames, bowing politely to Carrie. The latter caught in a glance the dimensions of a very stalwart figure. She also noticed that he was smooth-shaven, good looking, and young, but nothing more.", " \u201cWell, I guess we\u2019re ready now. The coach is outside.\u201d \u201cCome on, people,\u201d said Mrs. Vance, coming in smiling. \u201cBob, you\u2019ll have to look after Mrs. Wheeler.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll try to,\u201d said Bob smiling, and edging closer to Carrie. \u201cYou won\u2019t need much watching, will you?\u201d he volunteered, in a sort of ingratiating and help-me-out kind of way. \u201cNot very, I hope,\u201d said Carrie. They descended the stairs, Mrs. Vance offering suggestions, and climbed into the open coach. \u201cAll right,\u201d said Vance, slamming the coach door, and the conveyance rolled away. \u201cWhat is it we\u2019re going to see?\u201d asked Ames. \u201cSothern,\u201d said Vance, \u201cin \u2018Lord Chumley.\u2019\u201d \u201cOh, he is so good!\u201d said Mrs. Vance. \u201cHe\u2019s just the funniest man.\u201d \u201cI notice the papers praise it,\u201d said Ames. \u201cI haven\u2019t any doubt,\u201d put in Vance, \u201cbut we\u2019ll all enjoy it very much.\u201d Ames had taken a seat beside Carrie, and accordingly he felt it his bounden duty to pay her some attention.", " \u201cWhat is it?\u201d he said. \u201cCan you give me something to do?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cNow, I really don\u2019t know,\u201d he said kindly. \u201cWhat kind of work is it you want\u2014you\u2019re not a typewriter, are you?\u201d \u201cOh, no,\u201d answered Carrie. \u201cWell, we only employ book-keepers and typewriters here. You might go around to the side and inquire upstairs. They did want some help upstairs a few days ago. Ask for Mr. Brown.\u201d She hastened around to the side entrance and was taken up by the elevator to the fourth floor. \u201cCall Mr. Brown, Willie,\u201d said the elevator man to a boy near by. Willie went off and presently returned with the information that Mr. Brown said she should sit down and that he would be around in a little while. It was a portion of the stock room which gave no idea of the general character of the place, and Carrie could form no opinion of the nature of the work. \u201cSo you want something to do,\u201d said Mr. Brown, after he inquired concerning the nature of her errand."], "What emotional state does the wealth of the Vances induce in Carrie?": [" Her reply was mild enough, but her thoughts were rebellious. He was not looking after her at all. She was depending for her enjoyment upon the Vances. And now the latter announced that they were going away. It was approaching spring, and they were going North. \u201cOh, yes,\u201d said Mrs. Vance to Carrie, \u201cwe think we might as well give up the flat and store our things. We\u2019ll be gone for the summer, and it would be a useless expense. I think we\u2019ll settle a little farther down town when we come back.\u201d Carrie heard this with genuine sorrow. She had enjoyed Mrs. Vance\u2019s companionship so much. There was no one else in the house whom she knew. Again she would be all alone. Hurstwood\u2019s gloom over the slight decrease in profits and the departure of the Vances came together. So Carrie had loneliness and this mood of her husband to enjoy at the same time. It was a grievous thing. She became restless and dissatisfied, not exactly, as she thought, with Hurstwood, but with life.", " He was interested to find her so young a wife, and so pretty, though it was only a respectful interest. There was nothing of the dashing lady\u2019s man about him. He had respect for the married state, and thought only of some pretty marriageable girls in Indianapolis. \u201cAre you a born New Yorker?\u201d asked Ames of Carrie. \u201cOh, no; I\u2019ve only been here for two years.\u201d \u201cOh, well, you\u2019ve had time to see a great deal of it, anyhow.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t seem to have,\u201d answered Carrie. \u201cIt\u2019s about as strange to me as when I first came here.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not from the West, are you?\u201d \u201cYes. I\u2019m from Wisconsin,\u201d she answered. \u201cWell, it does seem as if most people in this town haven\u2019t been here so very long. I hear of lots of Indiana people in my line who are here.\u201d \u201cWhat is your line?\u201d asked Carrie. \u201cI\u2019m connected with an electrical company,\u201d said the youth. Carrie followed up this desultory conversation with occasional interruptions from the Vances.", " What was it? A very dull round indeed. What did she have? Nothing but this narrow, little flat. The Vances could travel, they could do the things worth doing, and here she was. For what was she made, anyhow? More thought followed, and then tears\u2014tears seemed justified, and the only relief in the world. For another period this state continued, the twain leading a rather monotonous life, and then there was a slight change for the worse. One evening, Hurstwood, after thinking about a way to modify Carrie\u2019s desire for clothes and the general strain upon his ability to provide, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to do much with Shaughnessy.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cOh, he\u2019s a slow, greedy \u2018mick\u2019! He won\u2019t agree to anything to improve the place, and it won\u2019t ever pay without it.\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t you make him?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cNo; I\u2019ve tried. The only thing I can see, if I want to improve, is to get hold of a place of my own.\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you?\u201d said Carrie.", " The feeling of mutual antagonism was increased. On the other hand, his interest in Drouet\u2019s little shop-girl grew in an almost evenly balanced proportion. That young lady, under the stress of her situation and the tutelage of her new friend, changed effectively. She had the aptitude of the struggler who seeks emancipation. The glow of a more showy life was not lost upon her. She did not grow in knowledge so much as she awakened in the matter of desire. Mrs. Hale\u2019s extended harangues upon the subjects of wealth and position taught her to distinguish between degrees of wealth. Mrs. Hale loved to drive in the afternoon in the sun when it was fine, and to satisfy her soul with a sight of those mansions and lawns which she could not afford. On the North Side had been erected a number of elegant mansions along what is now known as the North Shore Drive. The present lake wall of stone and granitoid was not then in place, but the road had been well laid out, the intermediate spaces of lawn were lovely to look upon, and the houses were thoroughly new and imposing."], "After two years in New York, why does Hurstwood begin looking for a new business to invest in?": [" He was a strong man and clean\u2014how much stronger and better than Hurstwood and Drouet she only half formulated to herself, but the difference was painful. It was something to which she voluntarily closed her eyes. During the last three months of the Warren Street connection, Hurstwood took parts of days off and hunted, tracking the business advertisements. It was a more or less depressing business, wholly because of the thought that he must soon get something or he would begin to live on the few hundred dollars he was saving, and then he would have nothing to invest\u2014he would have to hire out as a clerk. Everything he discovered in his line advertised as an opportunity, was either too expensive or too wretched for him. Besides, winter was coming, the papers were announcing hardships, and there was a general feeling of hard times in the air, or, at least, he thought so. In his worry, other people\u2019s worries became apparent.", " I want to go to Montreal for a while, and then anywhere you want to. We\u2019ll go and live in New York, if you say.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll not have anything to do with you,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cI want to get off this train. Where are we going?\u201d \u201cTo Detroit,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cOh!\u201d said Carrie, in a burst of anguish. So distant and definite a point seemed to increase the difficulty. \u201cWon\u2019t you come along with me?\u201d he said, as if there was great danger that she would not. \u201cYou won\u2019t need to do anything but travel with me. I\u2019ll not trouble you in any way. You can see Montreal and New York, and then if you don\u2019t want to stay you can go back. It will be better than trying to go back to-night.\u201d The first gleam of fairness shone in this proposition for Carrie. It seemed a plausible thing to do, much as she feared his opposition if she tried to carry it out. Montreal and New York! Even now she was speeding toward those great, strange lands, and could see them if she liked.", " He was slightly depressed over this newest move at the time he began to make it, but eventually restored himself. He feared that even yet he might be seized and taken back, so he tried to conceal his movements, but it was scarcely possible. He ordered Carrie\u2019s trunk sent to the depot, where he had it sent by express to New York. No one seemed to be observing him, but he left at night. He was greatly agitated lest at the first station across the border or at the depot in New York there should be waiting for him an officer of the law. Carrie, ignorant of his theft and his fears, enjoyed the entry into the latter city in the morning. The round green hills sentinelling the broad, expansive bosom of the Hudson held her attention by their beauty as the train followed the line of the stream. She had heard of the Hudson River, the great city of New York, and now she looked out, filling her mind with the wonder of it.", " \u201cI\u2019ll get him yet for that.\u201d \u201cI thought we were in for it sure, once there,\u201d said the second. Hurstwood, warmed and excited, gazed steadily ahead. It was an astonishing experience for him. He had read of these things, but the reality seemed something altogether new. He was no coward in spirit. The fact that he had suffered this much now rather operated to arouse a stolid determination to stick it out. He did not recur in thought to New York or the flat. This one trip seemed a consuming thing. They now ran into the business heart of Brooklyn uninterrupted. People gazed at the broken windows of the car and at Hurstwood in his plain clothes. Voices called \u201cscab\u201d now and then, as well as other epithets, but no crowd attacked the car. At the downtown end of the line, one of the officers went to call up his station and report the trouble. \u201cThere\u2019s a gang out there,\u201d he said, \u201claying for us yet."], "What does Hurstwood waste time doing while he is supposed to be looking for businesses to invest in?": [" She was in the high school, and had notions of life which were decidedly those of a patrician. She liked nice clothes and urged for them constantly. Thoughts of love and elegant individual establishments were running in her head. She met girls at the high school whose parents were truly rich and whose fathers had standing locally as partners or owners of solid businesses. These girls gave themselves the airs befitting the thriving domestic establishments from whence they issued. They were the only ones of the school about whom Jessica concerned herself. Young Hurstwood, Jr., was in his twentieth year, and was already connected in a promising capacity with a large real estate firm. He contributed nothing for the domestic expenses of the family, but was thought to be saving his money to invest in real estate. He had some ability, considerable vanity, and a love of pleasure that had not, as yet, infringed upon his duties, whatever they were.", " \u201cYou can get it at the news-stands,\u201d he added politely, seeing how pretty the inquirer was. Carrie proceeded to get the \u201cClipper,\u201d and tried to find the agents by looking over it as she stood beside the stand. This could not be done so easily. Thirteenth Street was a number of blocks off, but she went back, carrying the precious paper and regretting the waste of time. Hurstwood was already there, sitting in his place. \u201cWhere were you?\u201d he asked. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to find some dramatic agents.\u201d He felt a little diffident about asking concerning her success. The paper she began to scan attracted his attention. \u201cWhat have you got there?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe \u2018Clipper.\u2019 The man said I\u2019d find their addresses in here.\u201d \u201cHave you been all the way over to Broadway to find that out? I could have told you.\u201d \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you?\u201d she asked, without looking up. \u201cYou never asked me,\u201d he returned. She went hunting aimlessly through the crowded columns.", " He thought of other lines suggested by large buildings or businesses which he knew of\u2014wholesale groceries, hardware, insurance concerns, and the like\u2014but he had had no experience. How to go about getting anything was a bitter thought. Would he have to go personally and ask; wait outside an office door, and, then, distinguished and affluent looking, announce that he was looking for something to do? He strained painfully at the thought. No, he could not do that. He really strolled about, thinking, and then, the weather being cold, stepped into a hotel. He knew hotels well enough to know that any decent individual was welcome to a chair in the lobby. This was in the Broadway Central, which was then one of the most important hotels in the city. Taking a chair here was a painful thing to him. To think he should come to this! He had heard loungers about hotels called chairwarmers. He had called them that himself in his day.", " She was bound up completely in the man\u2019s atmosphere. He would have churchlike silence in order to express his feelings, and she kept it. She did not move her eyes from the flat, open scene before her. Hurstwood waited for a few moments, and then repeated the words. \u201cYou must not say that,\u201d she said, weakly. Her words were not convincing at all. They were the result of a feeble thought that something ought to be said. He paid no attention to them whatever. \u201cCarrie,\u201d he said, using her first name with sympathetic familiarity, \u201cI want you to love me. You don\u2019t know how much I need some one to waste a little affection on me. I am practically alone. There is nothing in my life that is pleasant or delightful. It\u2019s all work and worry with people who are nothing to me.\u201d As he said this, Hurstwood really imagined that his state was pitiful. He had the ability to get off at a distance and view himself objectively\u2014of seeing what he wanted to see in the things which made up his existence."], "What causes Mrs. Vance to retreat in shock when she calls to visit on Carrie at her apartment?": [" Of all times, this was the worst to encounter Mrs. Vance. \u201cWhy, I\u2019m living down town here. I\u2019ve been intending to come and see you. Where are you living now?\u201d \u201cIn Fifty-eighth Street,\u201d said Mrs. Vance, \u201cjust off Seventh Avenue\u2014218. Why don\u2019t you come and see me?\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cReally, I\u2019ve been wanting to come. I know I ought to. It\u2019s a shame. But you know\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s your number?\u201d said Mrs. Vance. \u201cThirteenth Street,\u201d said Carrie, reluctantly. \u201c112 West.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said Mrs. Vance, \u201cthat\u2019s right near here, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cYou must come down and see me some time.\u201d \u201cWell, you\u2019re a fine one,\u201d said Mrs. Vance, laughing, the while noting that Carrie\u2019s appearance had modified somewhat. \u201cThe address, too,\u201d she added to herself. \u201cThey must be hard up.\u201d Still she liked Carrie well enough to take her in tow. \u201cCome with me in here a minute,\u201d she exclaimed, turning into a store.", " Mrs. Vance played some upon the piano, and at last Hurstwood came. \u201cI am very glad to meet you,\u201d he said to Mrs. Vance when Carrie introduced him, showing much of the old grace which had captivated Carrie. \u201cDid you think your wife had run away?\u201d said Mr. Vance, extending his hand upon introduction. \u201cI didn\u2019t know but what she might have found a better husband,\u201d said Hurstwood. He now turned his attention to Mrs. Vance, and in a flash Carrie saw again what she for some time had subconsciously missed in Hurstwood\u2014the adroitness and flattery of which he was capable. She also saw that she was not well dressed\u2014not nearly as well dressed\u2014as Mrs. Vance. These were not vague ideas any longer. Her situation was cleared up for her. She felt that her life was becoming stale, and therein she felt cause for gloom. The old helpful, urging melancholy was restored. The desirous Carrie was whispered to concerning her possibilities.", " \u201cWell, I guess we\u2019re ready now. The coach is outside.\u201d \u201cCome on, people,\u201d said Mrs. Vance, coming in smiling. \u201cBob, you\u2019ll have to look after Mrs. Wheeler.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll try to,\u201d said Bob smiling, and edging closer to Carrie. \u201cYou won\u2019t need much watching, will you?\u201d he volunteered, in a sort of ingratiating and help-me-out kind of way. \u201cNot very, I hope,\u201d said Carrie. They descended the stairs, Mrs. Vance offering suggestions, and climbed into the open coach. \u201cAll right,\u201d said Vance, slamming the coach door, and the conveyance rolled away. \u201cWhat is it we\u2019re going to see?\u201d asked Ames. \u201cSothern,\u201d said Vance, \u201cin \u2018Lord Chumley.\u2019\u201d \u201cOh, he is so good!\u201d said Mrs. Vance. \u201cHe\u2019s just the funniest man.\u201d \u201cI notice the papers praise it,\u201d said Ames. \u201cI haven\u2019t any doubt,\u201d put in Vance, \u201cbut we\u2019ll all enjoy it very much.\u201d Ames had taken a seat beside Carrie, and accordingly he felt it his bounden duty to pay her some attention.", " There were no immediate results to this awakening, for Carrie had little power of initiative; but, nevertheless, she seemed ever capable of getting herself into the tide of change where she would be easily borne along. Hurstwood noticed nothing. He had been unconscious of the marked contrasts which Carrie had observed. He did not even detect the shade of melancholy which settled in her eyes. Worst of all, she now began to feel the loneliness of the flat and seek the company of Mrs. Vance, who liked her exceedingly. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the matin\u00e9e this afternoon,\u201d said Mrs. Vance, who had stepped across into Carrie\u2019s flat one morning, still arrayed in a soft pink dressing-gown, which she had donned upon rising. Hurstwood and Vance had gone their separate ways nearly an hour before. \u201cAll right,\u201d said Carrie, noticing the air of the petted and well-groomed woman in Mrs. Vance\u2019s general appearance."], "What job does Carrie first get in New York?": [" I want to go to Montreal for a while, and then anywhere you want to. We\u2019ll go and live in New York, if you say.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll not have anything to do with you,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cI want to get off this train. Where are we going?\u201d \u201cTo Detroit,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cOh!\u201d said Carrie, in a burst of anguish. So distant and definite a point seemed to increase the difficulty. \u201cWon\u2019t you come along with me?\u201d he said, as if there was great danger that she would not. \u201cYou won\u2019t need to do anything but travel with me. I\u2019ll not trouble you in any way. You can see Montreal and New York, and then if you don\u2019t want to stay you can go back. It will be better than trying to go back to-night.\u201d The first gleam of fairness shone in this proposition for Carrie. It seemed a plausible thing to do, much as she feared his opposition if she tried to carry it out. Montreal and New York! Even now she was speeding toward those great, strange lands, and could see them if she liked.", " When Carrie returned home, there was Hurstwood, reading as usual. He seemed to take his condition with the utmost nonchalance. His beard was at least four days old. \u201cOh,\u201d thought Carrie, \u201cif she were to come here and see him?\u201d She shook her head in absolute misery. It looked as if her situation was becoming unbearable. Driven to desperation, she asked at dinner: \u201cDid you ever hear any more from that wholesale house?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want an inexperienced man.\u201d Carrie dropped the subject, feeling unable to say more. \u201cI met Mrs. Vance this afternoon,\u201d she said, after a time. \u201cDid, eh?\u201d he answered. \u201cThey\u2019re back in New York now,\u201d Carrie went on. \u201cShe did look so nice.\u201d \u201cWell, she can afford it as long as he puts up for it,\u201d returned Hurstwood. \u201cHe\u2019s got a soft job.\u201d Hurstwood was looking into the paper. He could not see the look of infinite weariness and discontent Carrie gave him.", " He was slightly depressed over this newest move at the time he began to make it, but eventually restored himself. He feared that even yet he might be seized and taken back, so he tried to conceal his movements, but it was scarcely possible. He ordered Carrie\u2019s trunk sent to the depot, where he had it sent by express to New York. No one seemed to be observing him, but he left at night. He was greatly agitated lest at the first station across the border or at the depot in New York there should be waiting for him an officer of the law. Carrie, ignorant of his theft and his fears, enjoyed the entry into the latter city in the morning. The round green hills sentinelling the broad, expansive bosom of the Hudson held her attention by their beauty as the train followed the line of the stream. She had heard of the Hudson River, the great city of New York, and now she looked out, filling her mind with the wonder of it.", " Their gabbling was feverish\u2014things said to quiet their own minds. He looked out into the yard and waited. Two of the men got around quite near him, but behind his back. They were rather social, and he listened to what they said. \u201cAre you a railroad man?\u201d said one. \u201cMe? No. I\u2019ve always worked in a paper factory.\u201d \u201cI had a job in Newark until last October,\u201d returned the other, with reciprocal feeling. There were some words which passed too low to hear. Then the conversation became strong again. \u201cI don\u2019t blame these fellers for striking,\u201d said one. \u201cThey\u2019ve got the right of it, all right, but I had to get something to do.\u201d \u201cSame here,\u201d said the other. \u201cIf I had any job in Newark I wouldn\u2019t be over here takin\u2019 chances like these.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hell these days, ain\u2019t it?\u201d said the man. \u201cA poor man ain\u2019t nowhere. You could starve, by God, right in the streets, and there ain\u2019t most no one would help you.\u201d \u201cRight you are,\u201d said the other."], "What does Carrie feel toward Hurstwood after she finds work as a chorus girl?": [" \u201cHave you ever tried to get in as a chorus girl?\u201d he asked, assuming a more confidential air. Carrie began to feel that there was something exuberant and unnatural in his manner. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way most girls begin,\u201d he went on, \u201cwho go on the stage. It\u2019s a good way to get experience.\u201d He was turning on her a glance of the companionable and persuasive manner. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult thing,\u201d he went on, \u201cbut there\u2019s always a chance, you know.\u201d Then, as if he suddenly remembered, he pulled out his watch and consulted it. \u201cI\u2019ve an appointment at two,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019ve got to go to lunch now. Would you care to come and dine with me? We can talk it over there.\u201d \u201cOh, no,\u201d said Carrie, the whole motive of the man flashing on her at once. \u201cI have an engagement myself.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s too bad,\u201d he said, realising that he had been a little beforehand in his offer and that Carrie was about to go away.", " The young woman wore a fine bunch of violets and seemed in high spirits. She smiled at Carrie good-naturedly as she passed, showing pretty, even teeth, and Carrie smiled back. \u201cShe can afford to dress well,\u201d thought Carrie, \u201cand so could I, if I could only keep my money. I haven\u2019t a decent tie of any kind to wear.\u201d She put out her foot and looked at her shoe reflectively. \u201cI\u2019ll get a pair of shoes Saturday, anyhow; I don\u2019t care what happens.\u201d One of the sweetest and most sympathetic little chorus girls in the company made friends with her because in Carrie she found nothing to frighten her away. She was a gay little Manon, unwitting of society\u2019s fierce conception of morality, but, nevertheless, good to her neighbour and charitable. Little license was allowed the chorus in the matter of conversation, but, nevertheless, some was indulged in. \u201cIt\u2019s warm to-night, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said this girl, arrayed in pink fleshings and an imitation golden helmet.", " She also carried a shining shield. \u201cYes; it is,\u201d said Carrie, pleased that some one should talk to her. \u201cI\u2019m almost roasting,\u201d said the girl. Carrie looked into her pretty face, with its large blue eyes, and saw little beads of moisture. \u201cThere\u2019s more marching in this opera than ever I did before,\u201d added the girl. \u201cHave you been in others?\u201d asked Carrie, surprised at her experience. \u201cLots of them,\u201d said the girl; \u201chaven\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cThis is my first experience.\u201d \u201cOh, is it? I thought I saw you the time they ran \u2018The Queen\u2019s Mate\u2019 here.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Carrie, shaking her head; \u201cnot me.\u201d This conversation was interrupted by the blare of the orchestra and the sputtering of the calcium lights in the wings as the line was called to form for a new entrance. No further opportunity for conversation occurred, but the next evening, when they were getting ready for the stage, this girl appeared anew at her side.", " After observing a few times, the girl let her work at it alone. Seeing that it was fairly well done, she went away. The pieces of leather came from the girl at the machine to her right, and were passed on to the girl at her left. Carrie saw at once that an average speed was necessary or the work would pile up on her and all those below would be delayed. She had no time to look about, and bent anxiously to her task. The girls at her left and right realised her predicament and feelings, and, in a way, tried to aid her, as much as they dared, by working slower. At this task she laboured incessantly for some time, finding relief from her own nervous fears and imaginings in the humdrum, mechanical movement of the machine. She felt, as the minutes passed, that the room was not very light. It had a thick odour of fresh leather, but that did not worry her. She felt the eyes of the other help upon her, and troubled lest she was not working fast enough."], "What term do crowds of people shout at Hurstwood when he attempts to drive a trolley?": [" They called once to get Miss Osborne for an afternoon drive. Carrie was with her at the time. \u201cCome and go along,\u201d said Lola. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cOh, yes, come and go. What have you got to do?\u201d \u201cI have to be home by five,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cWhat for?\u201d \u201cOh, dinner.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ll take us to dinner,\u201d said Lola. \u201cOh, no,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cI won\u2019t go. I can\u2019t.\u201d \u201cOh, do come. They\u2019re awful nice boys. We\u2019ll get you back in time. We\u2019re only going for a drive in Central Park.\u201d Carrie thought a while, and at last yielded. \u201cNow, I must be back by half-past four,\u201d she said. The information went in one ear of Lola and out the other. After Drouet and Hurstwood, there was the least touch of cynicism in her attitude toward young men\u2014especially of the gay and frivolous sort. She felt a little older than they. Some of their pretty compliments seemed silly. Still, she was young in heart and body and youth appealed to her.", " One or two windows were smashed and Hurstwood dodged a stone. Both policemen ran out toward the crowd, but the latter replied by running toward the car. A woman\u2014a mere girl in appearance\u2014was among these, bearing a rough stick. She was exceedingly wrathful and struck at Hurstwood, who dodged. Thereupon, her companions, duly encouraged, jumped on the car and pulled Hurstwood over. He had hardly time to speak or shout before he fell. \u201cLet go of me,\u201d he said, falling on his side. \u201cAh, you sucker,\u201d he heard some one say. Kicks and blows rained on him. He seemed to be suffocating. Then two men seemed to be dragging him off and he wrestled for freedom. \u201cLet up,\u201d said a voice, \u201cyou\u2019re all right. Stand up.\u201d He was let loose and recovered himself. Now he recognised two officers. He felt as if he would faint from exhaustion. Something was wet on his chin. He put up his hand and felt, then looked. It was red.", " \u201cSure,\u201d he returned, pleasantly. She was relieved to see that he felt nothing. She did not credit her willingness to go to any fascination Hurstwood held for her. It seemed that the combination of Hurstwood, Drouet, and herself was more agreeable than anything else that had been suggested. She arrayed herself most carefully and they started off, extending excuses upstairs. \u201cI say,\u201d said Hurstwood, as they came up the theatre lobby, \u201cwe are exceedingly charming this evening.\u201d Carrie fluttered under his approving glance. \u201cNow, then,\u201d he said, leading the way up the foyer into the theatre. If ever there was dressiness it was here. It was the personification of the old term spick and span. \u201cDid you ever see Jefferson?\u201d he questioned, as he leaned toward Carrie in the box. \u201cI never did,\u201d she returned. \u201cHe\u2019s delightful, delightful,\u201d he went on, giving the commonplace rendition of approval which such men know.", " He\u2019ll have to wait.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t see how we ran up such a bill as that,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cWell, we ate it,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d she replied, still doubting. \u201cWhat\u2019s the use of your standing there and talking like that, now?\u201d he asked. \u201cDo you think I\u2019ve had it alone? You talk as if I\u2019d taken something.\u201d \u201cWell, it\u2019s too much, anyhow,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cI oughtn\u2019t to be made to pay for it. I\u2019ve got more than I can pay for now.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d replied Hurstwood, sitting down in silence. He was sick of the grind of this thing. Carrie went out and there he sat, determining to do something. There had been appearing in the papers about this time rumours and notices of an approaching strike on the trolley lines in Brooklyn. There was general dissatisfaction as to the hours of labour required and the wages paid. As usual\u2014and for some inexplicable reason\u2014the men chose the winter for the forcing of the hand of their employers and the settlement of their difficulties."], "Who does Carrie decide to move in with after getting her first speaking part in New York?": [" He was slightly depressed over this newest move at the time he began to make it, but eventually restored himself.

You\u2019ll like that. It\u2019s a lot more like a city than any place outside Chicago.\u201d He was really planning to slip out and away. He would see what these detectives would do\u2014what move his employers at Chicago would make\u2014then he would slip away\u2014down to New York, where it was easy to hide. He knew enough about that city to know that its mysteries and possibilities of mystification were infinite. The more he thought, however, the more wretched his situation became. He saw that getting here did not exactly clear up the ground. The firm would probably employ detectives to watch him\u2014Pinkerton men or agents of Mooney and Boland. They might arrest him the moment he tried to leave Canada. So he might be compelled to remain here months, and in what a state! Back at the hotel Hurstwood was anxious and yet fearful to see the morning papers.", " He gave her a silent part at thirty dollars a week. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you?\u201d said Lola. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t do you any good to go away from New York. They forget all about you if you do.\u201d Now, because Carrie was pretty, the gentlemen who made up the advance illustrations of shows about to appear for the Sunday papers selected Carrie\u2019s photo along with others to illustrate the announcement. Because she was very pretty, they gave it excellent space and drew scrolls about it. Carrie was delighted. Still, the management did not seem to have seen anything of it. At least, no more attention was paid to her than before. At the same time there seemed very little in her part. It consisted of standing around in all sorts of scenes, a silent little Quakeress. The author of the skit had fancied that a great deal could be made of such a part, given to the right actress, but now, since it had been doled out to Carrie, he would as leave have had it cut out."], "How does Hurstwood learn about Carrie\u2019s acting success?": [" \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me all about this thing,\u201d he said, after a time, \u201cand let\u2019s call it off? You don\u2019t really care for Hurstwood, do you?\u201d \u201cWhy do you want to start on that again?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cYou were to blame.\u201d \u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t,\u201d he answered. \u201cYes, you were, too,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have ever told me such a story as that.\u201d \u201cBut you didn\u2019t have much to do with him, did you?\u201d went on Drouet, anxious for his own peace of mind to get some direct denial from her. \u201cI won\u2019t talk about it,\u201d said Carrie, pained at the quizzical turn the peace arrangement had taken. \u201cWhat\u2019s the use of acting like that now, Cad?\u201d insisted the drummer, stopping in his work and putting up a hand expressively. \u201cYou might let me know where I stand, at least.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d said Carrie, feeling no refuge but in anger. \u201cWhatever has happened is your own fault.\u201d \u201cThen you do care for him?\u201d said Drouet, stopping completely and experiencing a rush of feeling.", " \u201cWell, sir?\u201d said a middle-aged man, looking up at him from the long desk. \u201cDo you want to hire any men?\u201d inquired Hurstwood. \u201cWhat are you\u2014a motorman?\u201d \u201cNo; I\u2019m not anything,\u201d said Hurstwood. He was not at all abashed by his position. He knew these people needed men. If one didn\u2019t take him, another would. This man could take him or leave him, just as he chose. \u201cWell, we prefer experienced men, of course,\u201d said the man. He paused, while Hurstwood smiled indifferently. Then he added: \u201cStill, I guess you can learn. What is your name?\u201d \u201cWheeler,\u201d said Hurstwood. The man wrote an order on a small card. \u201cTake that to our barns,\u201d he said, \u201cand give it to the foreman. He\u2019ll show you what to do.\u201d Hurstwood went down and out. He walked straight away in the direction indicated, while the policemen looked after. \u201cThere\u2019s another wants to try it,\u201d said Officer Kiely to Officer Macey. \u201cI have my mind he\u2019ll get his fill,\u201d returned the latter, quietly.", " The man explained the hours. \u201cNo more to-night?\u201d \u201cNothing with a sleeper. Yes, there is, too,\u201d he added. \u201cThere is a mail train out of here at three o\u2019clock.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cWhat time does that get to Detroit?\u201d He was thinking if he could only get there and cross the river into Canada, he could take his time about getting to Montreal. He was relieved to learn that it would reach there by noon. \u201cMayhew won\u2019t open the safe till nine,\u201d he thought. \u201cThey can\u2019t get on my track before noon.\u201d Then he thought of Carrie. With what speed must he get her, if he got her at all. She would have to come along. He jumped into the nearest cab standing by. \u201cTo Ogden Place,\u201d he said sharply. \u201cI\u2019ll give you a dollar more if you make good time.\u201d The cabby beat his horse into a sort of imitation gallop which was fairly fast, however. On the way Hurstwood thought what to do. Reaching the number, he hurried up the steps and did not spare the bell in waking the servant.", " Where that is not, both parties count two and two and make a problem after a while. Chapter XXXI. A PET OF GOOD FORTUNE: BROADWAY FLAUNTS ITS JOYS The effect of the city and his own situation on Hurstwood was paralleled in the case of Carrie, who accepted the things which fortune provided with the most genial good-nature. New York, despite her first expression of disapproval, soon interested her exceedingly. Its clear atmosphere, more populous thoroughfares, and peculiar indifference struck her forcibly. She had never seen such a little flat as hers, and yet it soon enlisted her affection. The new furniture made an excellent showing, the sideboard which Hurstwood himself arranged gleamed brightly. The furniture for each room was appropriate, and in the so-called parlour, or front room, was installed a piano, because Carrie said she would like to learn to play. She kept a servant and developed rapidly in household tactics and information."], "How does Hurstwood begin generating income after spending three weeks in a hospital with pneumonia?": [" In the afternoon some boxes were to be moved to make room for new culinary supplies. He was ordered to handle a truck. Encountering a big box, he could not lift it. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter there?\u201d said the head porter. \u201cCan\u2019t you handle it?\u201d He was straining to lift it, but now he quit. \u201cNo,\u201d he said, weakly. The man looked at him and saw that he was deathly pale. \u201cNot sick, are you?\u201d he asked. \u201cI think I am,\u201d returned Hurstwood. \u201cWell, you\u2019d better go sit down, then.\u201d This he did, but soon grew rapidly worse. It seemed all he could do to crawl to his room, where he remained for a day. \u201cThat man Wheeler\u2019s sick,\u201d reported one of the lackeys to the night clerk. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with him?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. He\u2019s got a high fever.\u201d The hotel physician looked at him. \u201cBetter send him to Bellevue,\u201d he recommended. \u201cHe\u2019s got pneumonia.\u201d Accordingly, he was carted away. In three weeks the worst was over, but it was nearly the first of May before his strength permitted him to be turned out.", " \u201cIs Mrs. Drouet in?\u201d he asked. \u201cYes,\u201d said the astonished girl. \u201cTell her to dress and come to the door at once. Her husband is in the hospital, injured, and wants to see her.\u201d The servant girl hurried upstairs, convinced by the man\u2019s strained and emphatic manner. \u201cWhat!\u201d said Carrie, lighting the gas and searching for her clothes. \u201cMr. Drouet is hurt and in the hospital. He wants to see you. The cab\u2019s downstairs.\u201d Carrie dressed very rapidly, and soon appeared below, forgetting everything save the necessities. \u201cDrouet is hurt,\u201d said Hurstwood quickly. \u201cHe wants to see you. Come quickly.\u201d Carrie was so bewildered that she swallowed the whole story. \u201cGet in,\u201d said Hurstwood, helping her and jumping after. The cabby began to turn the horse around. \u201cMichigan Central depot,\u201d he said, standing up and speaking so low that Carrie could not hear, \u201cas fast as you can go.\u201d Chapter XXVIII. A PILGRIM, AN OUTLAW: THE SPIRIT DETAINED The cab had not travelled a short block before Carrie, settling herself and thoroughly waking in the night atmosphere, asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with him?", " \u201cWell, I know that I didn\u2019t tell you any such thing as that,\u201d said Carrie, recovering herself. \u201cIf I were you,\u201d went on Drouet, ignoring her last remark, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with him. He\u2019s a married man, you know.\u201d \u201cWho\u2014who is?\u201d said Carrie, stumbling at the word. \u201cWhy, Hurstwood,\u201d said Drouet, noting the effect and feeling that he was delivering a telling blow. \u201cHurstwood!\u201d exclaimed Carrie, rising. Her face had changed several shades since this announcement was made. She looked within and without herself in a half-dazed way. \u201cWho told you this?\u201d she asked, forgetting that her interest was out of order and exceedingly incriminating. \u201cWhy, I know it. I\u2019ve always known it,\u201d said Drouet. Carrie was feeling about for a right thought. She was making a most miserable showing, and yet feelings were generating within her which were anything but crumbling cowardice. \u201cI thought I told you,\u201d he added.", " \u201cShe said she thought she\u2019d call here some day.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s been long getting round to it, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d said Hurstwood, with a kind of sarcasm. The woman didn\u2019t appeal to him from her spending side. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Carrie, angered by the man\u2019s attitude. \u201cPerhaps I didn\u2019t want her to come.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s too gay,\u201d said Hurstwood, significantly. \u201cNo one can keep up with her pace unless they\u2019ve got a lot of money.\u201d \u201cMr. Vance doesn\u2019t seem to find it very hard.\u201d \u201cHe may not now,\u201d answered Hurstwood, doggedly, well understanding the inference; \u201cbut his life isn\u2019t done yet. You can\u2019t tell what\u2019ll happen. He may get down like anybody else.\u201d There was something quite knavish in the man\u2019s attitude. His eye seemed to be cocked with a twinkle upon the fortunate, expecting their defeat. His own state seemed a thing apart\u2014not considered. This thing was the remains of his old-time cocksureness and independence."], "What does the homeless man known as \u201cthe captain\u201d solicit donations for?": [" He was now first, and already the captain was talking for him. \u201cTwelve cents, gentlemen\u2014twelve cents puts this man to bed. He wouldn\u2019t stand here in the cold if he had any place to go.\u201d Hurstwood swallowed something that rose to his throat. Hunger and weakness had made a coward of him. \u201cHere you are,\u201d said a stranger, handing money to the captain. Now the latter put a kindly hand on the ex-manager\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLine up over there,\u201d he said. Once there, Hurstwood breathed easier. He felt as if the world were not quite so bad with such a good man in it. Others seemed to feel like himself about this. \u201cCaptain\u2019s a great feller, ain\u2019t he?\u201d said the man ahead\u2014a little, woebegone, helpless-looking sort of individual, who looked as though he had ever been the sport and care of fortune. \u201cYes,\u201d said Hurstwood, indifferently. \u201cHuh! there\u2019s a lot back there yet,\u201d said a man farther up, leaning out and looking back at the applicants for whom the captain was pleading.", " \u201cYes. Must be over a hundred to-night,\u201d said another. \u201cLook at the guy in the cab,\u201d observed a third. A cab had stopped. Some gentleman in evening dress reached out a bill to the captain, who took it with simple thanks and turned away to his line. There was a general craning of necks as the jewel in the white shirt front sparkled and the cab moved off. Even the crowd gaped in awe. \u201cThat fixes up nine men for the night,\u201d said the captain, counting out as many of the line near him. \u201cLine up over there. Now, then, there are only seven. I need twelve cents.\u201d Money came slowly. In the course of time the crowd thinned out to a meagre handful. Fifth Avenue, save for an occasional cab or foot passenger, was bare. Broadway was thinly peopled with pedestrians. Only now and then a stranger passing noticed the small group, handed out a coin, and went away, unheeding. The captain remained stolid and determined.", " He had no food and no bed. When he neared Broadway, he noticed the captain\u2019s gathering of wanderers, but thinking it to be the result of a street preacher or some patent medicine fakir, was about to pass on. However, in crossing the street toward Madison Square Park, he noticed the line of men whose beds were already secured, stretching out from the main body of the crowd. In the glare of the neighbouring electric light he recognised a type of his own kind\u2014the figures whom he saw about the streets and in the lodging-houses, drifting in mind and body like himself. He wondered what it could be and turned back. There was the captain curtly pleading as before. He heard with astonishment and a sense of relief the oft-repeated words: \u201cThese men must have a bed.\u201d Before him was the line of unfortunates whose beds were yet to be had, and seeing a newcomer quietly edge up and take a position at the end of the line, he decided to do likewise.", " On Fifth Avenue were loungers\u2014a few wealthy strollers, a gentleman in evening dress with his lady on his arm, some club-men passing from one smoking-room to another. Across the way the great hotels showed a hundred gleaming windows, their caf\u00e9s and billiard-rooms filled with a comfortable, well-dressed, and pleasure-loving throng. All about was the night, pulsating with the thoughts of pleasure and exhilaration\u2014the curious enthusiasm of a great city bent upon finding joy in a thousand different ways. This unique individual was no less than an ex-soldier turned religionist, who, having suffered the whips and privations of our peculiar social system, had concluded that his duty to the God which he conceived lay in aiding his fellow-man. The form of aid which he chose to administer was entirely original with himself. It consisted of securing a bed for all such homeless wayfarers as should apply to him at this particular spot, though he had scarcely the wherewithal to provide a comfortable habitation for himself."], "Who tells Carrie about the theft Hurstwood perpetrated before the two of them left Chicago?": [" Are you stopping here?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Mr. Kenny, and then, turning the word again added: \u201cHow are things out in Chicago?\u201d \u201cAbout the same as usual,\u201d said Hurstwood, smiling genially. \u201cWife with you?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cWell, I must see more of you to-day. I\u2019m just going in here for breakfast. Come in when you\u2019re through.\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d said Hurstwood, moving away. The whole conversation was a trial to him. It seemed to add complications with every word. This man called up a thousand memories. He represented everything he had left. Chicago, his wife, the elegant resort\u2014all these were in his greeting and inquiries. And here he was in this same hotel expecting to confer with him, unquestionably waiting to have a good time with him. All at once the Chicago papers would arrive. The local papers would have accounts in them this very day. He forgot his triumph with Carrie in the possibility of soon being known for what he was, in this man\u2019s eyes, a safe-breaker.", " He was slightly depressed over this newest move at the time he began to make it, but eventually restored himself. He feared that even yet he might be seized and taken back, so he tried to conceal his movements, but it was scarcely possible. He ordered Carrie\u2019s trunk sent to the depot, where he had it sent by express to New York. No one seemed to be observing him, but he left at night. He was greatly agitated lest at the first station across the border or at the depot in New York there should be waiting for him an officer of the law. Carrie, ignorant of his theft and his fears, enjoyed the entry into the latter city in the morning. The round green hills sentinelling the broad, expansive bosom of the Hudson held her attention by their beauty as the train followed the line of the stream. She had heard of the Hudson River, the great city of New York, and now she looked out, filling her mind with the wonder of it.", " It did not take so very much to feed them under Hurstwood\u2019s close-measured buying, and there would possibly be enough for rent, but it left nothing else. Carrie bought the shoes and some other things, which complicated the rent problem very seriously. Suddenly, a week from the fatal day, Carrie realised that they were going to run short. \u201cI don\u2019t believe,\u201d she exclaimed, looking into her purse at breakfast, \u201cthat I\u2019ll have enough to pay the rent.\u201d \u201cHow much have you?\u201d inquired Hurstwood. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got twenty-two dollars, but there\u2019s everything to be paid for this week yet, and if I use all I get Saturday to pay this, there won\u2019t be any left for next week. Do you think your hotel man will open his hotel this month?\u201d \u201cI think so,\u201d returned Hurstwood. \u201cHe said he would.\u201d After a while, Hurstwood said: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Maybe the grocer will wait. He can do that. We\u2019ve traded there long enough to make him trust us for a week or two.\u201d \u201cDo you think he will?\u201d she asked.", " He imagined not; but this assurance relieved him. It must be that Carrie had got rid of him\u2014as well she ought, he thought. \u201cA man always makes a mistake when he does anything like that,\u201d he observed. \u201cLike what?\u201d said Carrie, unwitting of what was coming. \u201cOh, you know,\u201d and Drouet waved her intelligence, as it were, with his hand. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d she answered. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cWhy that affair in Chicago\u2014the time he left.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what you are talking about,\u201d said Carrie. Could it be he would refer so rudely to Hurstwood\u2019s flight with her? \u201cOho!\u201d said Drouet, incredulously. \u201cYou knew he took ten thousand dollars with him when he left, didn\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cWhat!\u201d said Carrie. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean to say he stole money, do you?\u201d \u201cWhy,\u201d said Drouet, puzzled at her tone, \u201cyou knew that, didn\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cWhy, no,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cOf course I didn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWell, that\u2019s funny,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cHe did, you know."], "How does Hurstwood die, unbeknownst to Carrie?": [" The manager was beside himself with affection. He could have sold his soul to be with her alone. \u201cAh,\u201d he thought, \u201cthe agony of it.\u201d Drouet hung on, thinking he was all in all. The dinner was spoiled by his enthusiasm. Hurstwood went home feeling as if he should die if he did not find affectionate relief. He whispered \u201cto-morrow\u201d passionately to Carrie, and she understood. He walked away from the drummer and his prize at parting feeling as if he could slay him and not regret. Carrie also felt the misery of it. \u201cGood-night,\u201d he said, simulating an easy friendliness. \u201cGood-night,\u201d said the little actress, tenderly. \u201cThe fool!\u201d he said, now hating Drouet. \u201cThe idiot! I\u2019ll do him yet, and that quick! We\u2019ll see to-morrow.\u201d \u201cWell, if you aren\u2019t a wonder,\u201d Drouet was saying, complacently, squeezing Carrie\u2019s arm. \u201cYou are the dandiest little girl on earth.\u201d Chapter XX. THE LURE OF THE SPIRIT: THE FLESH IN PURSUIT Passion in a man of Hurstwood\u2019s nature takes a vigorous form.", " \u201cI can\u2019t stand much of this,\u201d said Hurstwood, whose legs ached him painfully, as he sat down upon the miserable bunk in the small, lightless chamber allotted to him. \u201cI\u2019ve got to eat, or I\u2019ll die.\u201d Chapter XLVI. STIRRING TROUBLED WATERS Playing in New York one evening on this her return, Carrie was putting the finishing touches to her toilet before leaving for the night, when a commotion near the stage door caught her ear. It included a familiar voice. \u201cNever mind, now. I want to see Miss Madenda.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll have to send in your card.\u201d \u201cOh, come off! Here.\u201d A half-dollar was passed over, and now a knock came at her dressing-room door. Carrie opened it. \u201cWell, well!\u201d said Drouet. \u201cI do swear! Why, how are you? I knew that was you the moment I saw you.\u201d Carrie fell back a pace, expecting a most embarrassing conversation. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to shake hands with me? Well, you\u2019re a dandy! That\u2019s all right, shake hands.\u201d Carrie put out her hand, smiling, if for nothing more than the man\u2019s exuberant good-nature.", " \u201cHave you ever had any experience at this kind of work?\u201d he inquired. She answered that she had not. \u201cWell,\u201d said the foreman, scratching his ear meditatively, \u201cwe do need a stitcher. We like experienced help, though. We\u2019ve hardly got time to break people in.\u201d He paused and looked away out of the window. \u201cWe might, though, put you at finishing,\u201d he concluded reflectively. \u201cHow much do you pay a week?\u201d ventured Carrie, emboldened by a certain softness in the man\u2019s manner and his simplicity of address. \u201cThree and a half,\u201d he answered. \u201cOh,\u201d she was about to exclaim, but checked herself and allowed her thoughts to die without expression. \u201cWe\u2019re not exactly in need of anybody,\u201d he went on vaguely, looking her over as one would a package. \u201cYou can come on Monday morning, though,\u201d he added, \u201cand I\u2019ll put you to work.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d said Carrie weakly. \u201cIf you come, bring an apron,\u201d he added. He walked away and left her standing by the elevator, never so much as inquiring her name.", " Hurstwood could scarcely refrain from showing that he knew of this chap\u2019s presence. The insolence in the fellow\u2019s eye was galling. Still they passed, and he explained to Carrie concerning the city. Another restaurant was not long in showing itself, and here they entered. \u201cWhat a queer town this is,\u201d said Carrie, who marvelled at it solely because it was not like Chicago. \u201cIt isn\u2019t as lively as Chicago,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Carrie, whose feelings were already localised in the great Western city. \u201cWell, it isn\u2019t as interesting,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cWhat\u2019s here?\u201d asked Carrie, wondering at his choosing to visit this town. \u201cNothing much,\u201d returned Hurstwood. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a resort. There\u2019s some pretty scenery about here.\u201d Carrie listened, but with a feeling of unrest. There was much about her situation which destroyed the possibility of appreciation. \u201cWe won\u2019t stay here long,\u201d said Hurstwood, who was now really glad to note her dissatisfaction."]}
