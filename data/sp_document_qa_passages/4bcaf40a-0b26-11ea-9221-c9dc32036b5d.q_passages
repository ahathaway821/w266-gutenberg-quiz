{"What is Carrie Meeber\u2019s social status by the end of the novel?": [" Presently Mr. Brown came up. He did not seem to recognise her. \u201cWhat is it you want?\u201d he inquired. Carrie\u2019s heart sank. \u201cYou said I should come this morning to see about work\u2014\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d he interrupted. \u201cUm\u2014yes. What is your name?\u201d \u201cCarrie Meeber.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said he. \u201cYou come with me.\u201d He led the way through dark, box-lined aisles which had the smell of new shoes, until they came to an iron door which opened into the factory proper. There was a large, low-ceiled room, with clacking, rattling machines at which men in white shirt sleeves and blue gingham aprons were working. She followed him diffidently through the clattering automatons, keeping her eyes straight before her, and flushing slightly. They crossed to a far corner and took an elevator to the sixth floor. Out of the array of machines and benches, Mr. Brown signalled a foreman. \u201cThis is the girl,\u201d he said, and turning to Carrie, \u201cYou go with him.\u201d He then returned, and Carrie followed her new superior to a little desk in a corner, which he used as a kind of official centre. \u201cYou\u2019ve never worked at anything like this before, have you?\u201d he questioned, rather sternly. \u201cNo, sir,\u201d she answered. He seemed rather annoyed at having to bother with such help, but put down her name and then led her across to where a line of girls occupied stools in front of clacking machines. On the shoulder of one of the girls who was punching eye-holes in one piece of the upper, by the aid of the machine, he put his hand.", " It disposed her pleasantly toward all he might do. He took out a neat business card, on which was engraved Bartlett, Caryoe & Company, and down in the left-hand corner, Chas. H. Drouet. \u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d he said, putting the card in her hand and touching his name. \u201cIt\u2019s pronounced Drew-eh. Our family was French, on my father\u2019s side.\u201d She looked at it while he put up his purse. Then he got out a letter from a bunch in his coat pocket. \u201cThis is the house I travel for,\u201d he went on, pointing to a picture on it, \u201ccorner of State and Lake.\u201d There was pride in his voice. He felt that it was something to be connected with such a place, and he made her feel that way. \u201cWhat is your address?\u201d he began again, fixing his pencil to write. She looked at his hand. \u201cCarrie Meeber,\u201d she said slowly. \u201cThree hundred and fifty-four West Van Buren Street, care S. C. Hanson.\u201d He wrote it carefully down and got out the purse again. \u201cYou\u2019ll be at home if I come around Monday night?\u201d he said. \u201cI think so,\u201d she answered. How true it is that words are but the vague shadows of the volumes we mean. Little audible links, they are, chaining together great inaudible feelings and purposes. Here were these two, bandying little phrases, drawing purses, looking at cards, and both unconscious of how inarticulate all their real feelings were. Neither was wise enough to be sure of the working of the mind of the other. He could not tell how his luring succeeded.", " She quite forgot Hurstwood\u2019s presence at times, and looked away to homely farmhouses and cosey cottages in villages with wondering eyes. It was an interesting world to her. Her life had just begun. She did not feel herself defeated at all. Neither was she blasted in hope. The great city held much. Possibly she would come out of bondage into freedom\u2014who knows? Perhaps she would be happy. These thoughts raised her above the level of erring. She was saved in that she was hopeful. The following morning the train pulled safely into Montreal and they stepped down, Hurstwood glad to be out of danger, Carrie wondering at the novel atmosphere of the northern city. Long before, Hurstwood had been here, and now he remembered the name of the hotel at which he had stopped. As they came out of the main entrance of the depot he heard it called anew by a busman. \u201cWe\u2019ll go right up and get rooms,\u201d he said. At the clerk\u2019s office Hurstwood swung the register about while the clerk came forward. He was thinking what name he would put down. With the latter before him he found no time for hesitation. A name he had seen out of the car window came swiftly to him. It was pleasing enough. With an easy hand he wrote, \u201cG. W. Murdock and wife.\u201d It was the largest concession to necessity he felt like making. His initials he could not spare. When they were shown their room Carrie saw at once that he had secured her a lovely chamber.", " Down the aisle, toward the gate leading into the waiting-room and the street, stood Drouet. He was looking back. When he saw that she saw him and was safe with her sister he turned to go, sending back the shadow of a smile. Only Carrie saw it. She felt something lost to her when he moved away. When he disappeared she felt his absence thoroughly. With her sister she was much alone, a lone figure in a tossing, thoughtless sea. Chapter II. WHAT POVERTY THREATENED: OF GRANITE AND BRASS Minnie\u2019s flat, as the one-floor resident apartments were then being called, was in a part of West Van Buren Street inhabited by families of labourers and clerks, men who had come, and were still coming, with the rush of population pouring in at the rate of 50,000 a year. It was on the third floor, the front windows looking down into the street, where, at night, the lights of grocery stores were shining and children were playing. To Carrie, the sound of the little bells upon the horse-cars, as they tinkled in and out of hearing, was as pleasing as it was novel. She gazed into the lighted street when Minnie brought her into the front room, and wondered at the sounds, the movement, the murmur of the vast city which stretched for miles and miles in every direction. Mrs. Hanson, after the first greetings were over, gave Carrie the baby and proceeded to get supper. Her husband asked a few questions and sat down to read the evening paper."], "What is George Hurstwood\u2019s social status by the end of the novel?": [" He was soon down again to his old worry, and reached the resort anxious to find relief. Quite a company of gentlemen were making the place lively with their conversation. A group of Cook County politicians were conferring about a round cherry-wood table in the rear portion of the room. Several young merrymakers were chattering at the bar before making a belated visit to the theatre. A shabbily-genteel individual, with a red nose and an old high hat, was sipping a quiet glass of ale alone at one end of the bar. Hurstwood nodded to the politicians and went into his office. About ten o\u2019clock a friend of his, Mr. Frank L. Taintor, a local sport and racing man, dropped in, and seeing Hurstwood alone in his office came to the door. \u201cHello, George!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cHow are you, Frank?\u201d said Hurstwood, somewhat relieved by the sight of him. \u201cSit down,\u201d and he motioned him to one of the chairs in the little room. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, George?\u201d asked Taintor. \u201cYou look a little glum. Haven\u2019t lost at the track, have you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not feeling very well to-night. I had a slight cold the other day.\u201d \u201cTake whiskey, George,\u201d said Taintor. \u201cYou ought to know that.\u201d Hurstwood smiled. While they were still conferring there, several other of Hurstwood\u2019s friends entered, and not long after eleven, the theatres being out, some actors began to drop in\u2014among them some notabilities. Then began one of those pointless social conversations so common in American resorts where the would-be _gilded_ attempt to rub off gilt from those who have it in abundance.", " She quite forgot Hurstwood\u2019s presence at times, and looked away to homely farmhouses and cosey cottages in villages with wondering eyes. It was an interesting world to her. Her life had just begun. She did not feel herself defeated at all. Neither was she blasted in hope. The great city held much.

Murdock and wife.\u201d It was the largest concession to necessity he felt like making. His initials he could not spare. When they were shown their room Carrie saw at once that he had secured her a lovely chamber.", " He dwelt with her in peace and some satisfaction. He did not fear her in the least\u2014there was no cause for it. She still took a faint pride in him, which was augmented by her desire to have her social integrity maintained. She was secretly somewhat pleased by the fact that much of her husband\u2019s property was in her name, a precaution which Hurstwood had taken when his home interests were somewhat more alluring than at present. His wife had not the slightest reason to feel that anything would ever go amiss with their household, and yet the shadows which run before gave her a thought of the good of it now and then. She was in a position to become refractory with considerable advantage, and Hurstwood conducted himself circumspectly because he felt that he could not be sure of anything once she became dissatisfied. It so happened that on the night when Hurstwood, Carrie, and Drouet were in the box at McVickar\u2019s, George, Jr., was in the sixth row of the parquet with the daughter of H. B. Carmichael, the third partner of a wholesale dry-goods house of that city. Hurstwood did not see his son, for he sat, as was his wont, as far back as possible, leaving himself just partially visible, when he bent forward, to those within the first six rows in question. It was his wont to sit this way in every theatre\u2014to make his personality as inconspicuous as possible where it would be no advantage to him to have it otherwise.", " He never moved but what, if there was any danger of his conduct being misconstrued or ill-reported, he looked carefully about him and counted the cost of every inch of conspicuity. The next morning at breakfast his son said: \u201cI saw you, Governor, last night.\u201d \u201cWere you at McVickar\u2019s?\u201d said Hurstwood, with the best grace in the world. \u201cYes,\u201d said young George. \u201cWho with?\u201d \u201cMiss Carmichael.\u201d Mrs. Hurstwood directed an inquiring glance at her husband, but could not judge from his appearance whether it was any more than a casual look into the theatre which was referred to. \u201cHow was the play?\u201d she inquired. \u201cVery good,\u201d returned Hurstwood, \u201conly it\u2019s the same old thing, \u2018Rip Van Winkle.\u2019\u201d \u201cWhom did you go with?\u201d queried his wife, with assumed indifference. \u201cCharlie Drouet and his wife. They are friends of Moy\u2019s, visiting here.\u201d Owing to the peculiar nature of his position, such a disclosure as this would ordinarily create no difficulty. His wife took it for granted that his situation called for certain social movements in which she might not be included. But of late he had pleaded office duty on several occasions when his wife asked for his company to any evening entertainment. He had done so in regard to the very evening in question only the morning before. \u201cI thought you were going to be busy,\u201d she remarked, very carefully. \u201cSo I was,\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cI couldn\u2019t help the interruption, but I made up for it afterward by working until two.\u201d This settled the discussion for the time being, but there was a residue of opinion which was not satisfactory."], "What factor most determines the fortunes of Carrie and Hurstwood?": [" He approached Hurstwood, who handed out the tickets. Poised as she was to act, Carrie made no move. She did not look about. When the conductor had gone again Hurstwood felt relieved. \u201cYou\u2019re angry at me because I deceived you,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to, Carrie. As I live I didn\u2019t. I couldn\u2019t help it. I couldn\u2019t stay away from you after the first time I saw you.\u201d He was ignoring the last deception as something that might go by the board. He wanted to convince her that his wife could no longer be a factor in their relationship. The money he had stolen he tried to shut out of his mind. \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me,\u201d said Carrie, \u201cI hate you. I want you to go away from me. I am going to get out at the very next station.\u201d She was in a tremble of excitement and opposition as she spoke. \u201cAll right,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you\u2019ll hear me out, won\u2019t you? After all you have said about loving me, you might hear me. I don\u2019t want to do you any harm. I\u2019ll give you the money to go back with when you go. I merely want to tell you, Carrie. You can\u2019t stop me from loving you, whatever you may think.\u201d He looked at her tenderly, but received no reply. \u201cYou think I have deceived you badly, but I haven\u2019t. I didn\u2019t do it willingly. I\u2019m through with my wife. She hasn\u2019t any claims on me. I\u2019ll never see her any more. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here to-night. That\u2019s why I came and got you.\u201d \u201cYou said Charlie was hurt,\u201d said Carrie, savagely.", " Tell me when you\u2019re coming up, if at all.\u201d \u201cWhy, any time you like,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cWell, to-morrow then. I\u2019m living at the Chelsea now.\u201d \u201cMoved again?\u201d exclaimed Carrie, laughing. \u201cYes. You know I can\u2019t stay six months in one place. I just have to move. Remember now\u2014half-past five.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t forget,\u201d said Carrie, casting a glance at her as she went away. Then it came to her that she was as good as this woman now\u2014perhaps better. Something in the other\u2019s solicitude and interest made her feel as if she were the one to condescend. Now, as on each preceding day, letters were handed her by the doorman at the Casino. This was a feature which had rapidly developed since Monday. What they contained she well knew. _Mash notes_ were old affairs in their mildest form. She remembered having received her first one far back in Columbia City. Since then, as a chorus girl, she had received others\u2014gentlemen who prayed for an engagement. They were common sport between her and Lola, who received some also. They both frequently made light of them. Now, however, they came thick and fast. Gentlemen with fortunes did not hesitate to note, as an addition to their own amiable collection of virtues, that they had their horses and carriages. Thus one: \u201cI have a million in my own right. I could give you every luxury. There isn\u2019t anything you could ask for that you couldn\u2019t have. I say this, not because I want to speak of my money, but because I love you and wish to gratify your every desire.", " \u201cIt\u2019s in Halstead Street, right up here.\u201d \u201cHow I\u2019d like to go there. I crossed Halstead Street to-day, didn\u2019t I?\u201d At this there was a slight halt in the natural reply. Thoughts are a strangely permeating factor. At her suggestion of going to the theatre, the unspoken shade of disapproval to the doing of those things which involved the expenditure of money\u2014shades of feeling which arose in the mind of Hanson and then in Minnie\u2014slightly affected the atmosphere of the table. Minnie answered \u201cyes,\u201d but Carrie could feel that going to the theatre was poorly advocated here. The subject was put off for a little while until Hanson, through with his meal, took his paper and went into the front room. When they were alone, the two sisters began a somewhat freer conversation, Carrie interrupting it to hum a little, as they worked at the dishes. \u201cI should like to walk up and see Halstead Street, if it isn\u2019t too far,\u201d said Carrie, after a time. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go to the theatre to-night?\u201d \u201cOh, I don\u2019t think Sven would want to go to-night,\u201d returned Minnie. \u201cHe has to get up so early.\u201d \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t mind\u2014he\u2019d enjoy it,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t go very often,\u201d returned Minnie. \u201cWell, I\u2019d like to go,\u201d rejoined Carrie. \u201cLet\u2019s you and me go.\u201d Minnie pondered a while, not upon whether she could or would go\u2014for that point was already negatively settled with her\u2014but upon some means of diverting the thoughts of her sister to some other topic.", " The thought had taken a mighty hold upon her. It hummed in her ears as the melody of an old song. Outside in the little lobby another scene was being enacted. Without the interest of Hurstwood, the little hall would probably have been comfortably filled, for the members of the lodge were moderately interested in its welfare. Hurstwood\u2019s word, however, had gone the rounds. It was to be a full-dress affair. The four boxes had been taken. Dr. Norman McNeill Hale and his wife were to occupy one. This was quite a card. C. R. Walker, dry-goods merchant and possessor of at least two hundred thousand dollars, had taken another; a well-known coal merchant had been induced to take the third, and Hurstwood and his friends the fourth. Among the latter was Drouet. The people who were now pouring here were not celebrities, nor even local notabilities, in a general sense. They were the lights of a certain circle\u2014the circle of small fortunes and secret order distinctions. These gentlemen Elks knew the standing of one another. They had regard for the ability which could amass a small fortune, own a nice home, keep a barouche or carriage, perhaps, wear fine clothes, and maintain a good mercantile position. Naturally, Hurstwood, who was a little above the order of mind which accepted this standard as perfect, who had shrewdness and much assumption of dignity, who held an imposing and authoritative position, and commanded friendship by intuitive tact in handling people, was quite a figure."], "In Dreiser\u2019s depiction, what element of social life is subject to constant change?": [" It may be conserved by the growth of a community or of a state. It may be involved in providing something for which there is a growing demand. This removes it at once beyond the special care of the founder. It needs not so much foresight now as direction. The man wanes, the need continues or grows, and the fortune, fallen into whose hands it may, continues. Hence, some men never recognise the turning in the tide of their abilities. It is only in chance cases, where a fortune or a state of success is wrested from them, that the lack of ability to do as they did formerly becomes apparent. Hurstwood, set down under new conditions, was in a position to see that he was no longer young. If he did not, it was due wholly to the fact that his state was so well balanced that an absolute change for the worse did not show. Not trained to reason or introspect himself, he could not analyse the change that was taking place in his mind, and hence his body, but he felt the depression of it. Constant comparison between his old state and his new showed a balance for the worse, which produced a constant state of gloom or, at least, depression. Now, it has been shown experimentally that a constantly subdued frame of mind produces certain poisons in the blood, called katastates, just as virtuous feelings of pleasure and delight produce helpful chemicals called anastates. The poisons generated by remorse inveigh against the system, and eventually produce marked physical deterioration.", " Then she interposed a stout arm, and the line halted, with six men on the steps. Of these the ex-manager was one. Waiting thus, some talked, some ejaculated concerning the misery of it; some brooded, as did Hurstwood. At last he was admitted, and, having eaten, came away, almost angered because of his pains in getting it. At eleven o\u2019clock of another evening, perhaps two weeks later, he was at the midnight offering of a loaf\u2014waiting patiently. It had been an unfortunate day with him, but now he took his fate with a touch of philosophy. If he could secure no supper, or was hungry late in the evening, here was a place he could come. A few minutes before twelve, a great box of bread was pushed out, and exactly on the hour a portly, round-faced German took position by it, calling \u201cReady.\u201d The whole line at once moved forward each taking his loaf in turn and going his separate way. On this occasion, the ex-manager ate his as he went plodding the dark streets in silence to his bed. By January he had about concluded that the game was up with him. Life had always seemed a precious thing, but now constant want and weakened vitality had made the charms of earth rather dull and inconspicuous. Several times, when fortune pressed most harshly, he thought he would end his troubles; but with a change of weather, or the arrival of a quarter or a dime, his mood would change, and he would wait. Each day he would find some old paper lying about and look into it, to see if there was any trace of Carrie, but all summer and fall he had looked in vain.", " Nevertheless, the fact that here men gather, here chatter, here love to pass and rub elbows, must be explained upon some grounds. It must be that a strange bundle of passions and vague desires give rise to such a curious social institution or it would not be. Drouet, for one, was lured as much by his longing for pleasure as by his desire to shine among his betters. The many friends he met here dropped in because they craved, without, perhaps, consciously analysing it, the company, the glow, the atmosphere which they found. One might take it, after all, as an augur of the better social order, for the things which they satisfied here, though sensory, were not evil. No evil could come out of the contemplation of an expensively decorated chamber. The worst effect of such a thing would be, perhaps, to stir up in the material-minded an ambition to arrange their lives upon a similarly splendid basis. In the last analysis, that would scarcely be called the fault of the decorations, but rather of the innate trend of the mind. That such a scene might stir the less expensively dressed to emulate the more expensively dressed could scarcely be laid at the door of anything save the false ambition of the minds of those so affected. Remove the element so thoroughly and solely complained of\u2014liquor\u2014and there would not be one to gainsay the qualities of beauty and enthusiasm which would remain. The pleased eye with which our modern restaurants of fashion are looked upon is proof of this assertion.", " \u201cIt\u2019s Mr. Blyford, mamma,\u201d she replied. \u201cIs it?\u201d said Mrs. Hurstwood. \u201cYes, and he wants me to stroll over into the park with him,\u201d explained Jessica, a little flushed with running up the stairs. \u201cAll right, my dear,\u201d said Mrs. Hurstwood. \u201cDon\u2019t be gone long.\u201d As the two went down the street, she glanced interestedly out of the window. It was a most satisfactory spectacle indeed, most satisfactory. In this atmosphere Hurstwood had moved for a number of years, not thinking deeply concerning it. His was not the order of nature to trouble for something better, unless the better was immediately and sharply contrasted. As it was, he received and gave, irritated sometimes by the little displays of selfish indifference, pleased at times by some show of finery which supposedly made for dignity and social distinction. The life of the resort which he managed was his life. There he spent most of his time. When he went home evenings the house looked nice. With rare exceptions the meals were acceptable, being the kind that an ordinary servant can arrange. In part, he was interested in the talk of his son and daughter, who always looked well. The vanity of Mrs. Hurstwood caused her to keep her person rather showily arrayed, but to Hurstwood this was much better than plainness. There was no love lost between them. There was no great feeling of dissatisfaction. Her opinion on any subject was not startling."], "How much information does Dreiser provide about his characters\u2019 personal histories before the start of the novel?": [" This unique individual was no less than an ex-soldier turned religionist, who, having suffered the whips and privations of our peculiar social system, had concluded that his duty to the God which he conceived lay in aiding his fellow-man. The form of aid which he chose to administer was entirely original with himself. It consisted of securing a bed for all such homeless wayfarers as should apply to him at this particular spot, though he had scarcely the wherewithal to provide a comfortable habitation for himself. Taking his place amid this lightsome atmosphere, he would stand, his stocky figure cloaked in a great cape overcoat, his head protected by a broad slouch hat, awaiting the applicants who had in various ways learned the nature of his charity. For a while he would stand alone, gazing like any idler upon an ever-fascinating scene. On the evening in question, a policeman passing saluted him as \u201ccaptain,\u201d in a friendly way. An urchin who had frequently seen him before, stopped to gaze. All others took him for nothing out of the ordinary, save in the matter of dress, and conceived of him as a stranger whistling and idling for his own amusement. As the first half-hour waned, certain characters appeared. Here and there in the passing crowds one might see, now and then, a loiterer edging interestedly near. A slouchy figure crossed the opposite corner and glanced furtively in his direction.", " The business may come to an end.\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t you start somewhere else?\u201d \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any place. Shaughnessy doesn\u2019t want to.\u201d \u201cDo you lose what you put in?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Hurstwood, whose face was a study. \u201cOh, isn\u2019t that too bad?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cIt\u2019s a trick,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cThat\u2019s all. They\u2019ll start another place there all right.\u201d Carrie looked at him, and gathered from his whole demeanour what it meant. It was serious, very serious. \u201cDo you think you can get something else?\u201d she ventured, timidly. Hurstwood thought a while. It was all up with the bluff about money and investment. She could see now that he was \u201cbroke.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said solemnly; \u201cI can try.\u201d Chapter XXXIV. THE GRIND OF THE MILLSTONES: A SAMPLE OF CHAFF Carrie pondered over this situation as consistently as Hurstwood, once she got the facts adjusted in her mind. It took several days for her to fully realise that the approach of the dissolution of her husband\u2019s business meant commonplace struggle and privation. Her mind went back to her early venture in Chicago, the Hansons and their flat, and her heart revolted. That was terrible! Everything about poverty was terrible. She wished she knew a way out. Her recent experiences with the Vances had wholly unfitted her to view her own state with complacence. The glamour of the high life of the city had, in the few experiences afforded her by the former, seized her completely.", " He had seen motormen work before. He knew just about how they did it, and was sure he could do as well, with a very little practice. The instructor explained a few more details, and then said: \u201cNow, we\u2019ll back her up.\u201d Hurstwood stood placidly by, while the car rolled back into the yard. \u201cOne thing you want to be careful about, and that is to start easy. Give one degree time to act before you start another. The one fault of most men is that they always want to throw her wide open. That\u2019s bad. It\u2019s dangerous, too. Wears out the motor. You don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d \u201cI see,\u201d said Hurstwood. He waited and waited, while the man talked on. \u201cNow you take it,\u201d he said, finally. The ex-manager laid hand to the lever and pushed it gently, as he thought. It worked much easier than he imagined, however, with the result that the car jerked quickly forward, throwing him back against the door. He straightened up sheepishly, while the instructor stopped the car with the brake. \u201cYou want to be careful about that,\u201d was all he said. Hurstwood found, however, that handling a brake and regulating speed were not so instantly mastered as he had imagined. Once or twice he would have ploughed through the rear fence if it had not been for the hand and word of his companion. The latter was rather patient with him, but he never smiled. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get the knack of working both arms at once,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes a little practice.\u201d One o\u2019clock came while he was still on the car practising, and he began to feel hungry.", " What was it? A very dull round indeed. What did she have? Nothing but this narrow, little flat. The Vances could travel, they could do the things worth doing, and here she was. For what was she made, anyhow? More thought followed, and then tears\u2014tears seemed justified, and the only relief in the world. For another period this state continued, the twain leading a rather monotonous life, and then there was a slight change for the worse. One evening, Hurstwood, after thinking about a way to modify Carrie\u2019s desire for clothes and the general strain upon his ability to provide, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to do much with Shaughnessy.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cOh, he\u2019s a slow, greedy \u2018mick\u2019! He won\u2019t agree to anything to improve the place, and it won\u2019t ever pay without it.\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t you make him?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cNo; I\u2019ve tried. The only thing I can see, if I want to improve, is to get hold of a place of my own.\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cWell, all I have is tied up in there just now. If I had a chance to save a while I think I could open a place that would give us plenty of money.\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t we save?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cWe might try it,\u201d he suggested. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking that if we\u2019d take a smaller flat down town and live economically for a year, I would have enough, with what I have invested, to open a good place. Then we could arrange to live as you want to.\u201d \u201cIt would suit me all right,\u201d said Carrie, who, nevertheless, felt badly to think it had come to this."], "Who is the protagonist of the novel?": [" She quite forgot Hurstwood\u2019s presence at times, and looked away to homely farmhouses and cosey cottages in villages with wondering eyes. It was an interesting world to her. Her life had just begun. She did not feel herself defeated at all. Neither was she blasted in hope. The great city held much. Possibly she would come out of bondage into freedom\u2014who knows? Perhaps she would be happy. These thoughts raised her above the level of erring. She was saved in that she was hopeful. The following morning the train pulled safely into Montreal and they stepped down, Hurstwood glad to be out of danger, Carrie wondering at the novel atmosphere of the northern city. Long before, Hurstwood had been here, and now he remembered the name of the hotel at which he had stopped. As they came out of the main entrance of the depot he heard it called anew by a busman. \u201cWe\u2019ll go right up and get rooms,\u201d he said. At the clerk\u2019s office Hurstwood swung the register about while the clerk came forward. He was thinking what name he would put down. With the latter before him he found no time for hesitation. A name he had seen out of the car window came swiftly to him. It was pleasing enough. With an easy hand he wrote, \u201cG. W. Murdock and wife.\u201d It was the largest concession to necessity he felt like making. His initials he could not spare. When they were shown their room Carrie saw at once that he had secured her a lovely chamber.", " This seemed a miserable arrangement. But the morning light swept away the first misgivings of the day, as morning light is ever wont to do. At the shoe factory she put in a long day, scarcely so wearisome as the preceding, but considerably less novel. The head foreman, on his round, stopped by her machine. \u201cWhere did you come from?\u201d he inquired. \u201cMr. Brown hired me,\u201d she replied. \u201cOh, he did, eh!\u201d and then, \u201cSee that you keep things going.\u201d The machine girls impressed her even less favourably. They seemed satisfied with their lot, and were in a sense \u201ccommon.\u201d Carrie had more imagination than they. She was not used to slang. Her instinct in the matter of dress was naturally better. She disliked to listen to the girl next to her, who was rather hardened by experience. \u201cI\u2019m going to quit this,\u201d she heard her remark to her neighbour. \u201cWhat with the stipend and being up late, it\u2019s too much for me health.\u201d They were free with the fellows, young and old, about the place, and exchanged banter in rude phrases, which at first shocked her. She saw that she was taken to be of the same sort and addressed accordingly. \u201cHello,\u201d remarked one of the stout-wristed sole-workers to her at noon. \u201cYou\u2019re a daisy.\u201d He really expected to hear the common \u201cAw! go chase yourself!\u201d in return, and was sufficiently abashed, by Carrie\u2019s silently moving away, to retreat, awkwardly grinning. That night at the flat she was even more lonely\u2014the dull situation was becoming harder to endure.", " At the same time she longed to feel the delight of parading here as an equal. Ah, then she would be happy! Chapter XXXII. THE FEAST OF BELSHAZZAR: A SEER TO TRANSLATE Such feelings as were generated in Carrie by this walk put her in an exceedingly receptive mood for the pathos which followed in the play. The actor whom they had gone to see had achieved his popularity by presenting a mellow type of comedy, in which sufficient sorrow was introduced to lend contrast and relief to humour. For Carrie, as we well know, the stage had a great attraction. She had never forgotten her one histrionic achievement in Chicago. It dwelt in her mind and occupied her consciousness during many long afternoons in which her rocking-chair and her latest novel contributed the only pleasures of her state. Never could she witness a play without having her own ability vividly brought to consciousness. Some scenes made her long to be a part of them\u2014to give expression to the feelings which she, in the place of the character represented, would feel. Almost invariably she would carry the vivid imaginations away with her and brood over them the next day alone. She lived as much in these things as in the realities which made up her daily life. It was not often that she came to the play stirred to her heart\u2019s core by actualities. To-day a low song of longing had been set singing in her heart by the finery, the merriment, the beauty she had seen.", " Down the aisle, toward the gate leading into the waiting-room and the street, stood Drouet. He was looking back. When he saw that she saw him and was safe with her sister he turned to go, sending back the shadow of a smile. Only Carrie saw it. She felt something lost to her when he moved away. When he disappeared she felt his absence thoroughly. With her sister she was much alone, a lone figure in a tossing, thoughtless sea. Chapter II. WHAT POVERTY THREATENED: OF GRANITE AND BRASS Minnie\u2019s flat, as the one-floor resident apartments were then being called, was in a part of West Van Buren Street inhabited by families of labourers and clerks, men who had come, and were still coming, with the rush of population pouring in at the rate of 50,000 a year. It was on the third floor, the front windows looking down into the street, where, at night, the lights of grocery stores were shining and children were playing. To Carrie, the sound of the little bells upon the horse-cars, as they tinkled in and out of hearing, was as pleasing as it was novel. She gazed into the lighted street when Minnie brought her into the front room, and wondered at the sounds, the movement, the murmur of the vast city which stretched for miles and miles in every direction. Mrs. Hanson, after the first greetings were over, gave Carrie the baby and proceeded to get supper. Her husband asked a few questions and sat down to read the evening paper."], "What phrase best describes Charlie Drouet\u2019s attitude toward his romantic affairs?": [" They were so smooth, so compact, so portable. How little they made, after all. He decided he would take them. Yes, he would. He would put them in his pocket. Then he looked at that and saw they would not go there. His hand satchel! To be sure, his hand satchel. They would go in that\u2014all of it would. No one would think anything of it either. He went into the little office and took it from the shelf in the corner. Now he set it upon his desk and went out toward the safe. For some reason he did not want to fill it out in the big room. First he brought the bills and then the loose receipts of the day. He would take it all. He put the empty drawers back and pushed the iron door almost to, then stood beside it meditating. The wavering of a mind under such circumstances is an almost inexplicable thing, and yet it is absolutely true. Hurstwood could not bring himself to act definitely. He wanted to think about it\u2014to ponder over it, to decide whether it were best. He was drawn by such a keen desire for Carrie, driven by such a state of turmoil in his own affairs that he thought constantly it would be best, and yet he wavered. He did not know what evil might result from it to him\u2014how soon he might come to grief. The true ethics of the situation never once occurred to him, and never would have, under any circumstances. After he had all the money in the handbag, a revulsion of feeling seized him.", " To-night he was particularly so, since his report to the company had been favourably commented upon, his new samples had been satisfactorily selected, and his trip marked out for the next six weeks. \u201cWhy, hello, Charlie, old man,\u201d said Hurstwood, as Drouet came in that evening about eight o\u2019clock. \u201cHow goes it?\u201d The room was crowded. Drouet shook hands, beaming good nature, and they strolled towards the bar. \u201cOh, all right.\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in six weeks. When did you get in?\u201d \u201cFriday,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cHad a fine trip.\u201d \u201cGlad of it,\u201d said Hurstwood, his black eyes lit with a warmth which half displaced the cold make-believe that usually dwelt in them. \u201cWhat are you going to take?\u201d he added, as the barkeeper, in snowy jacket and tie, leaned toward them from behind the bar. \u201cOld Pepper,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cA little of the same for me,\u201d put in Hurstwood. \u201cHow long are you in town this time?\u201d inquired Hurstwood. \u201cOnly until Wednesday. I\u2019m going up to St. Paul.\u201d \u201cGeorge Evans was in here Saturday and said he saw you in Milwaukee last week.\u201d \u201cYes, I saw George,\u201d returned Drouet. \u201cGreat old boy, isn\u2019t he? We had quite a time there together.\u201d The barkeeper was setting out the glasses and bottle before them, and they now poured out the draught as they talked, Drouet filling his to within a third of full, as was considered proper, and Hurstwood taking the barest suggestion of whiskey and modifying it with seltzer.", " \u201cYou had better decide, Charlie,\u201d she said, reservedly. \u201cI guess we had better go, if you can break that engagement upstairs,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cOh, I can,\u201d returned Carrie without thinking. Drouet selected writing paper while Carrie went to change her dress. She hardly explained to herself why this latest invitation appealed to her most. \u201cShall I wear my hair as I did yesterday?\u201d she asked, as she came out with several articles of apparel pending. \u201cSure,\u201d he returned, pleasantly. She was relieved to see that he felt nothing. She did not credit her willingness to go to any fascination Hurstwood held for her. It seemed that the combination of Hurstwood, Drouet, and herself was more agreeable than anything else that had been suggested. She arrayed herself most carefully and they started off, extending excuses upstairs. \u201cI say,\u201d said Hurstwood, as they came up the theatre lobby, \u201cwe are exceedingly charming this evening.\u201d Carrie fluttered under his approving glance. \u201cNow, then,\u201d he said, leading the way up the foyer into the theatre. If ever there was dressiness it was here. It was the personification of the old term spick and span. \u201cDid you ever see Jefferson?\u201d he questioned, as he leaned toward Carrie in the box. \u201cI never did,\u201d she returned. \u201cHe\u2019s delightful, delightful,\u201d he went on, giving the commonplace rendition of approval which such men know. He sent Drouet after a programme, and then discoursed to Carrie concerning Jefferson as he had heard of him.", " \u201cI don\u2019t know any one,\u201d he replied. Suddenly he looked up. \u201cSay,\u201d he said, \u201chow would you like to take the part?\u201d \u201cMe?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cI can\u2019t act.\u201d \u201cHow do you know?\u201d questioned Drouet reflectively. \u201cBecause,\u201d answered Carrie, \u201cI never did.\u201d Nevertheless, she was pleased to think he would ask. Her eyes brightened, for if there was anything that enlisted her sympathies it was the art of the stage. True to his nature, Drouet clung to this idea as an easy way out. \u201cThat\u2019s nothing. You can act all you have to down there.\u201d \u201cNo, I can\u2019t,\u201d said Carrie weakly, very much drawn toward the proposition and yet fearful. \u201cYes, you can. Now, why don\u2019t you do it? They need some one, and it will be lots of fun for you.\u201d \u201cOh, no, it won\u2019t,\u201d said Carrie seriously. \u201cYou\u2019d like that. I know you would. I\u2019ve seen you dancing around here and giving imitations and that\u2019s why I asked you. You\u2019re clever enough, all right.\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d said Carrie shyly. \u201cNow, I\u2019ll tell you what you do. You go down and see about it. It\u2019ll be fun for you. The rest of the company isn\u2019t going to be any good. They haven\u2019t any experience. What do they know about theatricals?\u201d He frowned as he thought of their ignorance. \u201cHand me the coffee,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I could act, Charlie,\u201d Carrie went on pettishly. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I could, do you?\u201d \u201cSure. Out o\u2019 sight. I bet you make a hit. Now you want to go, I know you do."], "What is George Hurstwood\u2019s emotional state as he descends into poverty?": [" It hurt her. \u201cThe stage,\u201d he went on, \u201cis all right if you can be one of the big guns, but there\u2019s nothing to the rest of it. It takes a long while to get up.\u201d \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Carrie, slightly aroused. In a flash, he thought he foresaw the result of this thing. Now, when the worst of his situation was approaching, she would get on the stage in some cheap way and forsake him. Strangely, he had not conceived well of her mental ability. That was because he did not understand the nature of emotional greatness. He had never learned that a person might be emotionally\u2014instead of intellectually\u2014great. Avery Hall was too far away for him to look back and sharply remember. He had lived with this woman too long. \u201cWell, I do,\u201d he answered. \u201cIf I were you I wouldn\u2019t think of it. It\u2019s not much of a profession for a woman.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s better than going hungry,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to do that, why don\u2019t you get work yourself?\u201d There was no answer ready for this. He had got used to the suggestion. \u201cOh, let up,\u201d he answered. The result of this was that she secretly resolved to try. It didn\u2019t matter about him. She was not going to be dragged into poverty and something worse to suit him. She could act. She could get something and then work up. What would he say then? She pictured herself already appearing in some fine performance on Broadway; of going every evening to her dressing-room and making up.", " The business may come to an end.\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t you start somewhere else?\u201d \u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any place. Shaughnessy doesn\u2019t want to.\u201d \u201cDo you lose what you put in?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Hurstwood, whose face was a study. \u201cOh, isn\u2019t that too bad?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cIt\u2019s a trick,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cThat\u2019s all. They\u2019ll start another place there all right.\u201d Carrie looked at him, and gathered from his whole demeanour what it meant. It was serious, very serious. \u201cDo you think you can get something else?\u201d she ventured, timidly. Hurstwood thought a while. It was all up with the bluff about money and investment. She could see now that he was \u201cbroke.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said solemnly; \u201cI can try.\u201d Chapter XXXIV. THE GRIND OF THE MILLSTONES: A SAMPLE OF CHAFF Carrie pondered over this situation as consistently as Hurstwood, once she got the facts adjusted in her mind. It took several days for her to fully realise that the approach of the dissolution of her husband\u2019s business meant commonplace struggle and privation. Her mind went back to her early venture in Chicago, the Hansons and their flat, and her heart revolted. That was terrible! Everything about poverty was terrible. She wished she knew a way out. Her recent experiences with the Vances had wholly unfitted her to view her own state with complacence. The glamour of the high life of the city had, in the few experiences afforded her by the former, seized her completely.", " He was soon down again to his old worry, and reached the resort anxious to find relief. Quite a company of gentlemen were making the place lively with their conversation. A group of Cook County politicians were conferring about a round cherry-wood table in the rear portion of the room. Several young merrymakers were chattering at the bar before making a belated visit to the theatre. A shabbily-genteel individual, with a red nose and an old high hat, was sipping a quiet glass of ale alone at one end of the bar. Hurstwood nodded to the politicians and went into his office. About ten o\u2019clock a friend of his, Mr. Frank L. Taintor, a local sport and racing man, dropped in, and seeing Hurstwood alone in his office came to the door. \u201cHello, George!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cHow are you, Frank?\u201d said Hurstwood, somewhat relieved by the sight of him. \u201cSit down,\u201d and he motioned him to one of the chairs in the little room. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, George?\u201d asked Taintor. \u201cYou look a little glum. Haven\u2019t lost at the track, have you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not feeling very well to-night. I had a slight cold the other day.\u201d \u201cTake whiskey, George,\u201d said Taintor. \u201cYou ought to know that.\u201d Hurstwood smiled. While they were still conferring there, several other of Hurstwood\u2019s friends entered, and not long after eleven, the theatres being out, some actors began to drop in\u2014among them some notabilities. Then began one of those pointless social conversations so common in American resorts where the would-be _gilded_ attempt to rub off gilt from those who have it in abundance.", " She had been taught how to dress and where to go without having ample means to do either. Now, these things\u2014ever-present realities as they were\u2014filled her eyes and mind. The more circumscribed became her state, the more entrancing seemed this other. And now poverty threatened to seize her entirely and to remove this other world far upward like a heaven to which any Lazarus might extend, appealingly, his hands. So, too, the ideal brought into her life by Ames remained. He had gone, but here was his word that riches were not everything; that there was a great deal more in the world than she knew; that the stage was good, and the literature she read poor. He was a strong man and clean\u2014how much stronger and better than Hurstwood and Drouet she only half formulated to herself, but the difference was painful. It was something to which she voluntarily closed her eyes. During the last three months of the Warren Street connection, Hurstwood took parts of days off and hunted, tracking the business advertisements. It was a more or less depressing business, wholly because of the thought that he must soon get something or he would begin to live on the few hundred dollars he was saving, and then he would have nothing to invest\u2014he would have to hire out as a clerk. Everything he discovered in his line advertised as an opportunity, was either too expensive or too wretched for him. Besides, winter was coming, the papers were announcing hardships, and there was a general feeling of hard times in the air, or, at least, he thought so."], "Which hardworking and frugal couple acts as Carrie\u2019s hosts when she first arrives in Chicago?": [" She could not realise that she was drifting, until he secured her address. Now she felt that she had yielded something\u2014he, that he had gained a victory. Already they felt that they were somehow associated. Already he took control in directing the conversation. His words were easy. Her manner was relaxed. They were nearing Chicago. Signs were everywhere numerous. Trains flashed by them. Across wide stretches of flat, open prairie they could see lines of telegraph poles stalking across the fields toward the great city. Far away were indications of suburban towns, some big smokestacks towering high in the air. Frequently there were two-story frame houses standing out in the open fields, without fence or trees, lone outposts of the approaching army of homes. To the child, the genius with imagination, or the wholly untravelled, the approach to a great city for the first time is a wonderful thing. Particularly if it be evening\u2014that mystic period between the glare and gloom of the world when life is changing from one sphere or condition to another. Ah, the promise of the night. What does it not hold for the weary! What old illusion of hope is not here forever repeated! Says the soul of the toiler to itself, \u201cI shall soon be free. I shall be in the ways and the hosts of the merry. The streets, the lamps, the lighted chamber set for dining, are for me. The theatre, the halls, the parties, the ways of rest and the paths of song\u2014these are mine in the night.\u201d Though all humanity be still enclosed in the shops, the thrill runs abroad.", " They went out, and at the corner the commonplace Irish individual was standing, eyeing him. Hurstwood could scarcely refrain from showing that he knew of this chap\u2019s presence. The insolence in the fellow\u2019s eye was galling. Still they passed, and he explained to Carrie concerning the city. Another restaurant was not long in showing itself, and here they entered. \u201cWhat a queer town this is,\u201d said Carrie, who marvelled at it solely because it was not like Chicago. \u201cIt isn\u2019t as lively as Chicago,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Carrie, whose feelings were already localised in the great Western city. \u201cWell, it isn\u2019t as interesting,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cWhat\u2019s here?\u201d asked Carrie, wondering at his choosing to visit this town. \u201cNothing much,\u201d returned Hurstwood. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a resort. There\u2019s some pretty scenery about here.\u201d Carrie listened, but with a feeling of unrest. There was much about her situation which destroyed the possibility of appreciation. \u201cWe won\u2019t stay here long,\u201d said Hurstwood, who was now really glad to note her dissatisfaction. \u201cYou pick out your clothes as soon as breakfast is over and we\u2019ll run down to New York soon. You\u2019ll like that. It\u2019s a lot more like a city than any place outside Chicago.\u201d He was really planning to slip out and away. He would see what these detectives would do\u2014what move his employers at Chicago would make\u2014then he would slip away\u2014down to New York, where it was easy to hide.", " \u201cHe probably could be happy,\u201d she thought to herself, \u201call alone. He\u2019s so strong.\u201d Mr. and Mrs. Vance kept up a running fire of interruptions, and these impressive things by Ames came at odd moments. They were sufficient, however, for the atmosphere that went with this youth impressed itself upon Carrie without words. There was something in him, or the world he moved in, which appealed to her. He reminded her of scenes she had seen on the stage\u2014the sorrows and sacrifices that always went with she knew not what. He had taken away some of the bitterness of the contrast between this life and her life, and all by a certain calm indifference which concerned only him. As they went out, he took her arm and helped her into the coach, and then they were off again, and so to the show. During the acts Carrie found herself listening to him very attentively. He mentioned things in the play which she most approved of\u2014things which swayed her deeply. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it rather fine to be an actor?\u201d she asked once. \u201cYes, I do,\u201d he said, \u201cto be a good one. I think the theatre a great thing.\u201d Just this little approval set Carrie\u2019s heart bounding. Ah, if she could only be an actress\u2014a good one! This man was wise\u2014he knew\u2014and he approved of it. If she were a fine actress, such men as he would approve of her. She felt that he was good to speak as he had, although it did not concern her at all. She did not know why she felt this way.", " It is in the air. The dullest feel something which they may not always express or describe. It is the lifting of the burden of toil. Sister Carrie gazed out of the window. Her companion, affected by her wonder, so contagious are all things, felt anew some interest in the city and pointed out its marvels. \u201cThis is Northwest Chicago,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cThis is the Chicago River,\u201d and he pointed to a little muddy creek, crowded with the huge masted wanderers from far-off waters nosing the black-posted banks. With a puff, a clang, and a clatter of rails it was gone. \u201cChicago is getting to be a great town,\u201d he went on. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonder. You\u2019ll find lots to see here.\u201d She did not hear this very well. Her heart was troubled by a kind of terror. The fact that she was alone, away from home, rushing into a great sea of life and endeavour, began to tell. She could not help but feel a little choked for breath\u2014a little sick as her heart beat so fast. She half closed her eyes and tried to think it was nothing, that Columbia City was only a little way off. \u201cChicago! Chicago!\u201d called the brakeman, slamming open the door. They were rushing into a more crowded yard, alive with the clatter and clang of life. She began to gather up her poor little grip and closed her hand firmly upon her purse. Drouet arose, kicked his legs to straighten his trousers, and seized his clean yellow grip. \u201cI suppose your people will be here to meet you?\u201d he said."], "What phrase best describes the social status of Carrie\u2019s friend Mrs. Vance?": [" So she was thoroughly surprised to encounter her in Fourteenth Street, where she had gone shopping. Carrie was there for the same purpose. \u201cWhy, Mrs. Wheeler,\u201d said Mrs. Vance, looking Carrie over in a glance, \u201cwhere have you been? Why haven\u2019t you been to see me? I\u2019ve been wondering all this time what had become of you. Really, I\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019m so glad to see you,\u201d said Carrie, pleased and yet nonplussed. Of all times, this was the worst to encounter Mrs. Vance. \u201cWhy, I\u2019m living down town here. I\u2019ve been intending to come and see you. Where are you living now?\u201d \u201cIn Fifty-eighth Street,\u201d said Mrs. Vance, \u201cjust off Seventh Avenue\u2014218. Why don\u2019t you come and see me?\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cReally, I\u2019ve been wanting to come. I know I ought to. It\u2019s a shame. But you know\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s your number?\u201d said Mrs. Vance. \u201cThirteenth Street,\u201d said Carrie, reluctantly. \u201c112 West.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said Mrs. Vance, \u201cthat\u2019s right near here, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cYou must come down and see me some time.\u201d \u201cWell, you\u2019re a fine one,\u201d said Mrs. Vance, laughing, the while noting that Carrie\u2019s appearance had modified somewhat. \u201cThe address, too,\u201d she added to herself. \u201cThey must be hard up.\u201d Still she liked Carrie well enough to take her in tow. \u201cCome with me in here a minute,\u201d she exclaimed, turning into a store. When Carrie returned home, there was Hurstwood, reading as usual. He seemed to take his condition with the utmost nonchalance.", " This did not appeal to him exactly, but he cared for her in his own way, and so the thing stood. Still, there was something in the details of the transactions which caused Carrie to feel that her requests were not a delight to him. He did not enthuse over the purchases. This led her to believe that neglect was creeping in, and so another small wedge was entered. Nevertheless, one of the results of Mrs. Vance\u2019s suggestions was the fact that on this occasion Carrie was dressed somewhat to her own satisfaction. She had on her best, but there was comfort in the thought that if she must confine herself to a _best_, it was neat and fitting. She looked the well-groomed woman of twenty-one, and Mrs. Vance praised her, which brought colour to her plump cheeks and a noticeable brightness into her large eyes. It was threatening rain, and Mr. Vance, at his wife\u2019s request, had called a coach. \u201cYour husband isn\u2019t coming?\u201d suggested Mr. Vance, as he met Carrie in his little parlour. \u201cNo; he said he wouldn\u2019t be home for dinner.\u201d \u201cBetter leave a little note for him, telling him where we are. He might turn up.\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d said Carrie, who had not thought of it before. \u201cTell him we\u2019ll be at Sherry\u2019s until eight o\u2019clock. He knows, though I guess.\u201d Carrie crossed the hall with rustling skirts, and scrawled the note, gloves on. When she returned a newcomer was in the Vance flat. \u201cMrs. Wheeler, let me introduce Mr. Ames, a cousin of mine,\u201d said Mrs. Vance.", " The old helpful, urging melancholy was restored. The desirous Carrie was whispered to concerning her possibilities. There were no immediate results to this awakening, for Carrie had little power of initiative; but, nevertheless, she seemed ever capable of getting herself into the tide of change where she would be easily borne along. Hurstwood noticed nothing. He had been unconscious of the marked contrasts which Carrie had observed. He did not even detect the shade of melancholy which settled in her eyes. Worst of all, she now began to feel the loneliness of the flat and seek the company of Mrs. Vance, who liked her exceedingly. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the matin\u00e9e this afternoon,\u201d said Mrs. Vance, who had stepped across into Carrie\u2019s flat one morning, still arrayed in a soft pink dressing-gown, which she had donned upon rising. Hurstwood and Vance had gone their separate ways nearly an hour before. \u201cAll right,\u201d said Carrie, noticing the air of the petted and well-groomed woman in Mrs. Vance\u2019s general appearance. She looked as though she was dearly loved and her every wish gratified. \u201cWhat shall we see?\u201d \u201cOh, I do want to see Nat Goodwin,\u201d said Mrs. Vance. \u201cI do think he is the jolliest actor. The papers say this is such a good play.\u201d \u201cWhat time will we have to start?\u201d asked Carrie. \u201cLet\u2019s go at once and walk down Broadway from Thirty-fourth Street,\u201d said Mrs. Vance. \u201cIt\u2019s such an interesting walk.", " You play cards, don\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cA little,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll have a game of cards. If your husband comes home bring him over.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s not coming to dinner to-night,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cWell, when he does come we\u2019ll call him in.\u201d Carrie acquiesced, and that evening met the portly Vance, an individual a few years younger than Hurstwood, and who owed his seemingly comfortable matrimonial state much more to his money than to his good looks. He thought well of Carrie upon the first glance and laid himself out to be genial, teaching her a new game of cards and talking to her about New York and its pleasures. Mrs. Vance played some upon the piano, and at last Hurstwood came. \u201cI am very glad to meet you,\u201d he said to Mrs. Vance when Carrie introduced him, showing much of the old grace which had captivated Carrie. \u201cDid you think your wife had run away?\u201d said Mr. Vance, extending his hand upon introduction. \u201cI didn\u2019t know but what she might have found a better husband,\u201d said Hurstwood. He now turned his attention to Mrs. Vance, and in a flash Carrie saw again what she for some time had subconsciously missed in Hurstwood\u2014the adroitness and flattery of which he was capable. She also saw that she was not well dressed\u2014not nearly as well dressed\u2014as Mrs. Vance. These were not vague ideas any longer. Her situation was cleared up for her. She felt that her life was becoming stale, and therein she felt cause for gloom."], "What is the destination of Carrie\u2019s train in the novel\u2019s opening chapter?": [" THE BLAZE OF THE TINDER: FLESH WARS WITH THE FLESH Chapter XXIII.

Carrie noticed his agitation, but said nothing. She had no idea what it meant or that it was important. He wondered now why he had not asked whether this train went on through to Montreal or some Canadian point. Perhaps he could have saved time. He jumped up and sought the conductor. \u201cDoes any part of this train go to Montreal?\u201d he asked. \u201cYes, the next sleeper back does.\u201d He would have asked more, but it did not seem wise, so he decided to inquire at the depot. The train rolled into the yards, clanging and puffing. \u201cI think we had better go right on through to Montreal,\u201d he said to Carrie. \u201cI\u2019ll see what the connections are when we get off.\u201d He was exceedingly nervous, but did his best to put on a calm exterior. Carrie only looked at him with large, troubled eyes. She was drifting mentally, unable to say to herself what to do. The train stopped and Hurstwood led the way out. He looked warily around him, pretending to look after Carrie. Seeing nothing that indicated studied observation, he made his way to the ticket office. \u201cThe next train for Montreal leaves when?\u201d he asked. \u201cIn twenty minutes,\u201d said the man. He bought two tickets and Pullman berths. Then he hastened back to Carrie. \u201cWe go right out again,\u201d he said, scarcely noticing that Carrie looked tired and weary.", " If some seemingly vulnerable object appeared he was all attention\u2014to pass the compliments of the day, to lead the way to the parlor car, carrying her grip, or, failing that, to take a seat next her with the hope of being able to court her to her destination. Pillows, books, a footstool, the shade lowered; all these figured in the things which he could do. If, when she reached her destination he did not alight and attend her baggage for her, it was because, in his own estimation, he had signally failed. A woman should some day write the complete philosophy of clothes. No matter how young, it is one of the things she wholly comprehends. There is an indescribably faint line in the matter of man\u2019s apparel which somehow divides for her those who are worth glancing at and those who are not. Once an individual has passed this faint line on the way downward he will get no glance from her. There is another line at which the dress of a man will cause her to study her own. This line the individual at her elbow now marked for Carrie. She became conscious of an inequality. Her own plain blue dress, with its black cotton tape trimmings, now seemed to her shabby. She felt the worn state of her shoes. \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d he went on, \u201cI know quite a number of people in your town. Morgenroth the clothier and Gibson the dry goods man.\u201d \u201cOh, do you?\u201d she interrupted, aroused by memories of longings their show windows had cost her."], "Who does Carrie meet on the train from Waukesha, Wisconsin, to Chicago?": [" He simulated interest in several scenes without which he did not feel.

In the intuitive graces she was still crude. She could scarcely toss her head gracefully. Her hands were almost ineffectual. The feet, though small, were set flatly. And yet she was interested in her charms, quick to understand the keener pleasures of life, ambitious to gain in material things. A half-equipped little knight she was, venturing to reconnoitre the mysterious city and dreaming wild dreams of some vague, far-off supremacy, which should make it prey and subject\u2014the proper penitent, grovelling at a woman\u2019s slipper. \u201cThat,\u201d said a voice in her ear, \u201cis one of the prettiest little resorts in Wisconsin.\u201d \u201cIs it?\u201d she answered nervously. The train was just pulling out of Waukesha. For some time she had been conscious of a man behind. She felt him observing her mass of hair. He had been fidgetting, and with natural intuition she felt a certain interest growing in that quarter. Her maidenly reserve, and a certain sense of what was conventional under the circumstances, called her to forestall and deny this familiarity, but the daring and magnetism of the individual, born of past experiences and triumphs, prevailed. She answered. He leaned forward to put his elbows upon the back of her seat and proceeded to make himself volubly agreeable. \u201cYes, that is a great resort for Chicago people. The hotels are swell. You are not familiar with this part of the country, are you?\u201d \u201cOh, yes, I am,\u201d answered Carrie.", " \u201cLet me carry your grip.\u201d \u201cOh, no,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d rather you wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019d rather you wouldn\u2019t be with me when I meet my sister.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d he said in all kindness. \u201cI\u2019ll be near, though, in case she isn\u2019t here, and take you out there safely.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re so kind,\u201d said Carrie, feeling the goodness of such attention in her strange situation. \u201cChicago!\u201d called the brakeman, drawing the word out long. They were under a great shadowy train shed, where the lamps were already beginning to shine out, with passenger cars all about and the train moving at a snail\u2019s pace. The people in the car were all up and crowding about the door. \u201cWell, here we are,\u201d said Drouet, leading the way to the door. \u201cGood-bye, till I see you Monday.\u201d \u201cGood-bye,\u201d she answered, taking his proffered hand. \u201cRemember, I\u2019ll be looking till you find your sister.\u201d She smiled into his eyes. They filed out, and he affected to take no notice of her. A lean-faced, rather commonplace woman recognised Carrie on the platform and hurried forward. \u201cWhy, Sister Carrie!\u201d she began, and there was embrace of welcome. Carrie realised the change of affectional atmosphere at once. Amid all the maze, uproar, and novelty she felt cold reality taking her by the hand. No world of light and merriment. No round of amusement. Her sister carried with her most of the grimness of shift and toil. \u201cWhy, how are all the folks at home?\u201d she began; \u201chow is father, and mother?\u201d Carrie answered, but was looking away.", " In due time they reached the depot, and after helping her out he handed the man a five-dollar bill and hurried on. \u201cYou wait here,\u201d he said to Carrie, when they reached the waiting-room, \u201cwhile I get the tickets.\u201d \u201cHave I much time to catch that train for Detroit?\u201d he asked of the agent. \u201cFour minutes,\u201d said the latter. He paid for two tickets as circumspectly as possible. \u201cIs it far?\u201d said Carrie, as he hurried back. \u201cNot very,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must get right in.\u201d He pushed her before him at the gate, stood between her and the ticket man while the latter punched their tickets, so that she could not see, and then hurried after. There was a long line of express and passenger cars and one or two common day coaches. As the train had only recently been made up and few passengers were expected, there were only one or two brakemen waiting. They entered the rear day coach and sat down. Almost immediately, \u201cAll aboard,\u201d resounded faintly from the outside, and the train started. Carrie began to think it was a little bit curious\u2014this going to a depot\u2014but said nothing. The whole incident was so out of the natural that she did not attach too much weight to anything she imagined. \u201cHow have you been?\u201d asked Hurstwood gently, for he now breathed easier. \u201cVery well,\u201d said Carrie, who was so disturbed that she could not bring a proper attitude to bear in the matter. She was still nervous to reach Drouet and see what could be the matter."], "What emotion does Carrie\u2019s presence at the apartment seem to evoke in Hanson?": [" Her face took on the semblance of a look of happiness as she put on her hat to go below. \u201cCarrie doesn\u2019t seem to like her place very well,\u201d said Minnie to her husband when the latter came out, paper in hand, to sit in the dining-room a few minutes. \u201cShe ought to keep it for a time, anyhow,\u201d said Hanson. \u201cHas she gone downstairs?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Minnie. \u201cI\u2019d tell her to keep it if I were you. She might be here weeks without getting another one.\u201d Minnie said she would, and Hanson read his paper. \u201cIf I were you,\u201d he said a little later, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t let her stand in the door down there. It don\u2019t look good.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll tell her,\u201d said Minnie. The life of the streets continued for a long time to interest Carrie. She never wearied of wondering where the people in the cars were going or what their enjoyments were. Her imagination trod a very narrow round, always winding up at points which concerned money, looks, clothes, or enjoyment. She would have a far-off thought of Columbia City now and then, or an irritating rush of feeling concerning her experiences of the present day, but, on the whole, the little world about her enlisted her whole attention. The first floor of the building, of which Hanson\u2019s flat was the third, was occupied by a bakery, and to this, while she was standing there, Hanson came down to buy a loaf of bread. She was not aware of his presence until he was quite near her. \u201cI\u2019m after bread,\u201d was all he said as he passed.", " The contagion of thought here demonstrated itself. While Hanson really came for bread, the thought dwelt with him that now he would see what Carrie was doing. No sooner did he draw near her with that in mind than she felt it. Of course, she had no understanding of what put it into her head, but, nevertheless, it aroused in her the first shade of real antipathy to him. She knew now that she did not like him. He was suspicious. A thought will colour a world for us. The flow of Carrie\u2019s meditations had been disturbed, and Hanson had not long gone upstairs before she followed. She had realised with the lapse of the quarter hours that Drouet was not coming, and somehow she felt a little resentful, a little as if she had been forsaken\u2014was not good enough. She went upstairs, where everything was silent. Minnie was sewing by a lamp at the table. Hanson had already turned in for the night. In her weariness and disappointment Carrie did no more than announce that she was going to bed. \u201cYes, you\u2019d better,\u201d returned Minnie. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get up early, you know.\u201d The morning was no better. Hanson was just going out the door as Carrie came from her room. Minnie tried to talk with her during breakfast, but there was not much of interest which they could mutually discuss. As on the previous morning, Carrie walked down town, for she began to realise now that her four-fifty would not even allow her car fare after she paid her board.", " At dinner Carrie felt a little nervous. The strain of her own plans were considerable, and the feeling that she was not welcome here was strong. \u201cDidn\u2019t find anything, eh?\u201d said Hanson. \u201cNo.\u201d He turned to his eating again, the thought that it was a burden to have her here dwelling in his mind. She would have to go home, that was all. Once she was away, there would be no more coming back in the spring. Carrie was afraid of what she was going to do, but she was relieved to know that this condition was ending. They would not care. Hanson particularly would be glad when she went. He would not care what became of her. After dinner she went into the bathroom, where they could not disturb her, and wrote a little note. \u201cGood-bye, Minnie,\u201d it read. \u201cI\u2019m not going home. I\u2019m going to stay in Chicago a little while and look for work. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be all right.\u201d In the front room Hanson was reading his paper. As usual, she helped Minnie clear away the dishes and straighten up. Then she said: \u201cI guess I\u2019ll stand down at the door a little while.\u201d She could scarcely prevent her voice from trembling. Minnie remembered Hanson\u2019s remonstrance. \u201cSven doesn\u2019t think it looks good to stand down there,\u201d she said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t he?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cI won\u2019t do it any more after this.\u201d She put on her hat and fidgeted around the table in the little bedroom, wondering where to slip the note. Finally she put it under Minnie\u2019s hair-brush.", " At last she yielded enough to ask Hanson. It was a half-hearted procedure without a shade of desire on her part. \u201cCarrie wants us to go to the theatre,\u201d she said, looking in upon her husband. Hanson looked up from his paper, and they exchanged a mild look, which said as plainly as anything: \u201cThis isn\u2019t what we expected.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care to go,\u201d he returned. \u201cWhat does she want to see?\u201d \u201cH. R. Jacob\u2019s,\u201d said Minnie. He looked down at his paper and shook his head negatively. When Carrie saw how they looked upon her proposition, she gained a still clearer feeling of their way of life. It weighed on her, but took no definite form of opposition. \u201cI think I\u2019ll go down and stand at the foot of the stairs,\u201d she said, after a time. Minnie made no objection to this, and Carrie put on her hat and went below. \u201cWhere has Carrie gone?\u201d asked Hanson, coming back into the dining-room when he heard the door close. \u201cShe said she was going down to the foot of the stairs,\u201d answered Minnie. \u201cI guess she just wants to look out a while.\u201d \u201cShe oughtn\u2019t to be thinking about spending her money on theatres already, do you think?\u201d he said. \u201cShe just feels a little curious, I guess,\u201d ventured Minnie. \u201cEverything is so new.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Hanson, and went over to the baby, his forehead slightly wrinkled. He was thinking of a full career of vanity and wastefulness which a young girl might indulge in, and wondering how Carrie could contemplate such a course when she had so little, as yet, with which to do."], "Where does Carrie get a job on her first day in Chicago?": [" \u201cIf I had any job in Newark I wouldn\u2019t be over here takin\u2019 chances like these.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s hell these days, ain\u2019t it?\u201d said the man. \u201cA poor man ain\u2019t nowhere. You could starve, by God, right in the streets, and there ain\u2019t most no one would help you.\u201d \u201cRight you are,\u201d said the other. \u201cThe job I had I lost \u2019cause they shut down. They run all summer and lay up a big stock, and then shut down.\u201d Hurstwood paid some little attention to this. Somehow, he felt a little superior to these two\u2014a little better off. To him these were ignorant and commonplace, poor sheep in a driver\u2019s hand. \u201cPoor devils,\u201d he thought, speaking out of the thoughts and feelings of a bygone period of success. \u201cNext,\u201d said one of the instructors. \u201cYou\u2019re next,\u201d said a neighbour, touching him. He went out and climbed on the platform. The instructor took it for granted that no preliminaries were needed. \u201cYou see this handle,\u201d he said, reaching up to an electric cut-off, which was fastened to the roof. \u201cThis throws the current off or on. If you want to reverse the car you turn it over here. If you want to send it forward, you put it over here. If you want to cut off the power, you keep it in the middle.\u201d Hurstwood smiled at the simple information. \u201cNow, this handle here regulates your speed. To here,\u201d he said, pointing with his finger, \u201cgives you about four miles an hour. This is eight. When it\u2019s full on, you make about fourteen miles an hour.\u201d Hurstwood watched him calmly.", " His beard was at least four days old. \u201cOh,\u201d thought Carrie, \u201cif she were to come here and see him?\u201d She shook her head in absolute misery. It looked as if her situation was becoming unbearable. Driven to desperation, she asked at dinner: \u201cDid you ever hear any more from that wholesale house?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want an inexperienced man.\u201d Carrie dropped the subject, feeling unable to say more. \u201cI met Mrs. Vance this afternoon,\u201d she said, after a time. \u201cDid, eh?\u201d he answered. \u201cThey\u2019re back in New York now,\u201d Carrie went on. \u201cShe did look so nice.\u201d \u201cWell, she can afford it as long as he puts up for it,\u201d returned Hurstwood. \u201cHe\u2019s got a soft job.\u201d Hurstwood was looking into the paper. He could not see the look of infinite weariness and discontent Carrie gave him. \u201cShe said she thought she\u2019d call here some day.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s been long getting round to it, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d said Hurstwood, with a kind of sarcasm. The woman didn\u2019t appeal to him from her spending side. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Carrie, angered by the man\u2019s attitude. \u201cPerhaps I didn\u2019t want her to come.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s too gay,\u201d said Hurstwood, significantly. \u201cNo one can keep up with her pace unless they\u2019ve got a lot of money.\u201d \u201cMr. Vance doesn\u2019t seem to find it very hard.\u201d \u201cHe may not now,\u201d answered Hurstwood, doggedly, well understanding the inference; \u201cbut his life isn\u2019t done yet. You can\u2019t tell what\u2019ll happen. He may get down like anybody else.\u201d There was something quite knavish in the man\u2019s attitude.", " They were talking at the breakfast table, a morning or two later, when she brought up the dramatic subject by saying that she saw that Sarah Bernhardt was coming to this country. Hurstwood had seen it, too. \u201cHow do people get on the stage, George?\u201d she finally asked, innocently. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cThere must be dramatic agents.\u201d Carrie was sipping coffee, and did not look up. \u201cRegular people who get you a place?\u201d \u201cYes, I think so,\u201d he answered. Suddenly the air with which she asked attracted his attention. \u201cYou\u2019re not still thinking about being an actress, are you?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo,\u201d she answered, \u201cI was just wondering.\u201d Without being clear, there was something in the thought which he objected to. He did not believe any more, after three years of observation, that Carrie would ever do anything great in that line. She seemed too simple, too yielding. His idea of the art was that it involved something more pompous. If she tried to get on the stage she would fall into the hands of some cheap manager and become like the rest of them. He had a good idea of what he meant by _them_. Carrie was pretty. She would get along all right, but where would he be? \u201cI\u2019d get that idea out of my head, if I were you. It\u2019s a lot more difficult than you think.\u201d Carrie felt this to contain, in some way, an aspersion upon her ability. \u201cYou said I did real well in Chicago,\u201d she rejoined. \u201cYou did,\u201d he answered, seeing that he was arousing opposition, \u201cbut Chicago isn\u2019t New York, by a big jump.\u201d Carrie did not answer this at all.", " Then she would come out at eleven o\u2019clock and see the carriages ranged about, waiting for the people. It did not matter whether she was the star or not. If she were only once in, getting a decent salary, wearing the kind of clothes she liked, having the money to do with, going here and there as she pleased, how delightful it would all be. Her mind ran over this picture all the day long. Hurstwood\u2019s dreary state made its beauty become more and more vivid. Curiously this idea soon took hold of Hurstwood. His vanishing sum suggested that he would need sustenance. Why could not Carrie assist him a little until he could get something? He came in one day with something of this idea in his mind. \u201cI met John B. Drake to-day,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to open a hotel here in the fall. He says that he can make a place for me then.\u201d \u201cWho is he?\u201d asked Carrie. \u201cHe\u2019s the man that runs the Grand Pacific in Chicago.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cI\u2019d get about fourteen hundred a year out of that.\u201d \u201cThat would be good, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d she said, sympathetically. \u201cIf I can only get over this summer,\u201d he added, \u201cI think I\u2019ll be all right. I\u2019m hearing from some of my friends again.\u201d Carrie swallowed this story in all its pristine beauty. She sincerely wished he could get through the summer. He looked so hopeless. \u201cHow much money have you left?\u201d \u201cOnly fifty dollars.\u201d \u201cOh, mercy,\u201d she exclaimed, \u201cwhat will we do? It\u2019s only twenty days until the rent will be due again.\u201d Hurstwood rested his head on his hands and looked blankly at the floor."], "What does Carrie propose doing that elicits disapproval from Minnie and Hanson?": [" \u201cIt\u2019s in Halstead Street, right up here.\u201d \u201cHow I\u2019d like to go there. I crossed Halstead Street to-day, didn\u2019t I?\u201d At this there was a slight halt in the natural reply. Thoughts are a strangely permeating factor. At her suggestion of going to the theatre, the unspoken shade of disapproval to the doing of those things which involved the expenditure of money\u2014shades of feeling which arose in the mind of Hanson and then in Minnie\u2014slightly affected the atmosphere of the table. Minnie answered \u201cyes,\u201d but Carrie could feel that going to the theatre was poorly advocated here. The subject was put off for a little while until Hanson, through with his meal, took his paper and went into the front room. When they were alone, the two sisters began a somewhat freer conversation, Carrie interrupting it to hum a little, as they worked at the dishes. \u201cI should like to walk up and see Halstead Street, if it isn\u2019t too far,\u201d said Carrie, after a time. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go to the theatre to-night?\u201d \u201cOh, I don\u2019t think Sven would want to go to-night,\u201d returned Minnie. \u201cHe has to get up so early.\u201d \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t mind\u2014he\u2019d enjoy it,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cNo, he doesn\u2019t go very often,\u201d returned Minnie. \u201cWell, I\u2019d like to go,\u201d rejoined Carrie. \u201cLet\u2019s you and me go.\u201d Minnie pondered a while, not upon whether she could or would go\u2014for that point was already negatively settled with her\u2014but upon some means of diverting the thoughts of her sister to some other topic.", " Her face took on the semblance of a look of happiness as she put on her hat to go below. \u201cCarrie doesn\u2019t seem to like her place very well,\u201d said Minnie to her husband when the latter came out, paper in hand, to sit in the dining-room a few minutes. \u201cShe ought to keep it for a time, anyhow,\u201d said Hanson. \u201cHas she gone downstairs?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Minnie. \u201cI\u2019d tell her to keep it if I were you. She might be here weeks without getting another one.\u201d Minnie said she would, and Hanson read his paper. \u201cIf I were you,\u201d he said a little later, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t let her stand in the door down there. It don\u2019t look good.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll tell her,\u201d said Minnie. The life of the streets continued for a long time to interest Carrie. She never wearied of wondering where the people in the cars were going or what their enjoyments were. Her imagination trod a very narrow round, always winding up at points which concerned money, looks, clothes, or enjoyment. She would have a far-off thought of Columbia City now and then, or an irritating rush of feeling concerning her experiences of the present day, but, on the whole, the little world about her enlisted her whole attention. The first floor of the building, of which Hanson\u2019s flat was the third, was occupied by a bakery, and to this, while she was standing there, Hanson came down to buy a loaf of bread. She was not aware of his presence until he was quite near her. \u201cI\u2019m after bread,\u201d was all he said as he passed.", " At dinner Carrie felt a little nervous. The strain of her own plans were considerable, and the feeling that she was not welcome here was strong. \u201cDidn\u2019t find anything, eh?\u201d said Hanson. \u201cNo.\u201d He turned to his eating again, the thought that it was a burden to have her here dwelling in his mind. She would have to go home, that was all. Once she was away, there would be no more coming back in the spring. Carrie was afraid of what she was going to do, but she was relieved to know that this condition was ending. They would not care. Hanson particularly would be glad when she went. He would not care what became of her. After dinner she went into the bathroom, where they could not disturb her, and wrote a little note. \u201cGood-bye, Minnie,\u201d it read. \u201cI\u2019m not going home. I\u2019m going to stay in Chicago a little while and look for work. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be all right.\u201d In the front room Hanson was reading his paper. As usual, she helped Minnie clear away the dishes and straighten up. Then she said: \u201cI guess I\u2019ll stand down at the door a little while.\u201d She could scarcely prevent her voice from trembling. Minnie remembered Hanson\u2019s remonstrance. \u201cSven doesn\u2019t think it looks good to stand down there,\u201d she said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t he?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cI won\u2019t do it any more after this.\u201d She put on her hat and fidgeted around the table in the little bedroom, wondering where to slip the note. Finally she put it under Minnie\u2019s hair-brush.", " At last she yielded enough to ask Hanson. It was a half-hearted procedure without a shade of desire on her part. \u201cCarrie wants us to go to the theatre,\u201d she said, looking in upon her husband. Hanson looked up from his paper, and they exchanged a mild look, which said as plainly as anything: \u201cThis isn\u2019t what we expected.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care to go,\u201d he returned. \u201cWhat does she want to see?\u201d \u201cH. R. Jacob\u2019s,\u201d said Minnie. He looked down at his paper and shook his head negatively. When Carrie saw how they looked upon her proposition, she gained a still clearer feeling of their way of life. It weighed on her, but took no definite form of opposition. \u201cI think I\u2019ll go down and stand at the foot of the stairs,\u201d she said, after a time. Minnie made no objection to this, and Carrie put on her hat and went below. \u201cWhere has Carrie gone?\u201d asked Hanson, coming back into the dining-room when he heard the door close. \u201cShe said she was going down to the foot of the stairs,\u201d answered Minnie. \u201cI guess she just wants to look out a while.\u201d \u201cShe oughtn\u2019t to be thinking about spending her money on theatres already, do you think?\u201d he said. \u201cShe just feels a little curious, I guess,\u201d ventured Minnie. \u201cEverything is so new.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Hanson, and went over to the baby, his forehead slightly wrinkled. He was thinking of a full career of vanity and wastefulness which a young girl might indulge in, and wondering how Carrie could contemplate such a course when she had so little, as yet, with which to do."], "What is the name of the club where Drouet passes the evening after receiving Carrie\u2019s letter?": [" \u201cAin\u2019t going my way, are you?\u201d he called jocosely. Carrie turned her face to the west with a subdued heart. As she turned the corner, she saw through the great shiny window the small desk at which she had applied. There were the crowds, hurrying with the same buzz and energy-yielding enthusiasm. She felt a slight relief, but it was only at her escape. She felt ashamed in the face of better dressed girls who went by. She felt as though she should be better served, and her heart revolted. Chapter V. A GLITTERING NIGHT FLOWER: THE USE OF A NAME Drouet did not call that evening. After receiving the letter, he had laid aside all thought of Carrie for the time being and was floating around having what he considered a gay time. On this particular evening he dined at \u201cRector\u2019s,\u201d a restaurant of some local fame, which occupied a basement at Clark and Monroe Streets. There\u2014after he visited the resort of Fitzgerald and Moy\u2019s in Adams Street, opposite the imposing Federal Building. There he leaned over the splendid bar and swallowed a glass of plain whiskey and purchased a couple of cigars, one of which he lighted. This to him represented in part high life\u2014a fair sample of what the whole must be. Drouet was not a drinker in excess. He was not a moneyed man. He only craved the best, as his mind conceived it, and such doings seemed to him a part of the best. Rector\u2019s, with its polished marble walls and floor, its profusion of lights, its show of china and silverware, and, above all, its reputation as a resort for actors and professional men, seemed to him the proper place for a successful man to go.", " \u201cWe\u2019re all working men, like yourself. If you were a regular motorman, and had been treated as we\u2019ve been, you wouldn\u2019t want any one to come in and take your place, would you? You wouldn\u2019t want any one to do you out of your chance to get your rights, would you?\u201d \u201cShut her off! shut her off!\u201d urged the other of the policemen, roughly. \u201cGet out of this, now,\u201d and he jumped the railing and landed before the crowd and began shoving. Instantly the other officer was down beside him. \u201cStand back, now,\u201d they yelled. \u201cGet out of this. What the hell do you mean? Out, now.\u201d It was like a small swarm of bees. \u201cDon\u2019t shove me,\u201d said one of the strikers, determinedly. \u201cI\u2019m not doing anything.\u201d \u201cGet out of this!\u201d cried the officer, swinging his club. \u201cI\u2019ll give ye a bat on the sconce. Back, now.\u201d \u201cWhat the hell!\u201d cried another of the strikers, pushing the other way, adding at the same time some lusty oaths. Crack came an officer\u2019s club on his forehead. He blinked his eyes blindly a few times, wabbled on his legs, threw up his hands, and staggered back. In return, a swift fist landed on the officer\u2019s neck. Infuriated by this, the latter plunged left and right, laying about madly with his club. He was ably assisted by his brother of the blue, who poured ponderous oaths upon the troubled waters. No severe damage was done, owing to the agility of the strikers in keeping out of reach. They stood about the sidewalk now and jeered.", " He remembered an appointment at three. He began to think that it would be useless to wait, and got hold of his umbrella and light coat, intending to take these things, any way. It would scare her, he hoped. To-morrow he would come back for the others. He would find out how things stood. As he started to go he felt truly sorry that he had missed her. There was a little picture of her on the wall, showing her arrayed in the little jacket he had first bought her\u2014her face a little more wistful than he had seen it lately. He was really touched by it, and looked into the eyes of it with a rather rare feeling for him. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do me right, Cad,\u201d he said, as if he were addressing her in the flesh. Then he went to the door, took a good look around and went out. Chapter XXVII. WHEN WATERS ENGULF US WE REACH FOR A STAR It was when he returned from his disturbed stroll about the streets, after receiving the decisive note from McGregor, James and Hay, that Hurstwood found the letter Carrie had written him that morning. He thrilled intensely as he noted the handwriting, and rapidly tore it open. \u201cThen,\u201d he thought, \u201cshe loves me or she would not have written to me at all.\u201d He was slightly depressed at the tenor of the note for the first few minutes, but soon recovered. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t write at all if she didn\u2019t care for me.\u201d This was his one resource against the depression which held him. He could extract little from the wording of the letter, but the spirit he thought he knew.", " \u201cAt about twenty minutes of five.\u201d Together they finished the labour of the day, Carrie washing the dishes while Minnie undressed the baby and put it to bed. Minnie\u2019s manner was one of trained industry, and Carrie could see that it was a steady round of toil with her. She began to see that her relations with Drouet would have to be abandoned. He could not come here. She read from the manner of Hanson, in the subdued air of Minnie, and, indeed, the whole atmosphere of the flat, a settled opposition to anything save a conservative round of toil. If Hanson sat every evening in the front room and read his paper, if he went to bed at nine, and Minnie a little later, what would they expect of her? She saw that she would first need to get work and establish herself on a paying basis before she could think of having company of any sort. Her little flirtation with Drouet seemed now an extraordinary thing. \u201cNo,\u201d she said to herself, \u201che can\u2019t come here.\u201d She asked Minnie for ink and paper, which were upon the mantel in the dining-room, and when the latter had gone to bed at ten, got out Drouet\u2019s card and wrote him. \u201cI cannot have you call on me here. You will have to wait until you hear from me again. My sister\u2019s place is so small.\u201d She troubled herself over what else to put in the letter. She wanted to make some reference to their relations upon the train, but was too timid. She concluded by thanking him for his kindness in a crude way, then puzzled over the formality of signing her name, and finally decided upon the severe, winding up with a \u201cVery truly,\u201d which she subsequently changed to \u201cSincerely.\u201d She scaled and addressed the letter, and going in the front room, the alcove of which contained her bed, drew the one small rocking-chair up to the open window, and sat looking out upon the night and streets in silent wonder."], "What aspect of the factory women\u2019s behavior does Carrie disapprove of?": [" Right after came one of the insignificant members of the company, and she heard the changed tone of address. \u201cHow much?\u201d said the same cashier, sharply. One, such as she had only recently been, was waiting for her modest salary. It took her back to the few weeks in which she had collected\u2014or rather had received\u2014almost with the air of a domestic, four-fifty per week from a lordly foreman in a shoe factory\u2014a man who, in distributing the envelopes, had the manner of a prince doling out favours to a servile group of petitioners. She knew that out in Chicago this very day the same factory chamber was full of poor homely-clad girls working in long lines at clattering machines; that at noon they would eat a miserable lunch in a half-hour; that Saturday they would gather, as they had when she was one of them, and accept the small pay for work a hundred times harder than she was now doing. Oh, it was so easy now! The world was so rosy and bright. She felt so thrilled that she must needs walk back to the hotel to think, wondering what she should do. It does not take money long to make plain its impotence, providing the desires are in the realm of affection. With her one hundred and fifty in hand, Carrie could think of nothing particularly to do. In itself, as a tangible, apparent thing which she could touch and look upon, it was a diverting thing for a few days, but this soon passed. Her hotel bill did not require its use.", " \u201cCall Mr. Brown, Willie,\u201d said the elevator man to a boy near by. Willie went off and presently returned with the information that Mr. Brown said she should sit down and that he would be around in a little while. It was a portion of the stock room which gave no idea of the general character of the place, and Carrie could form no opinion of the nature of the work. \u201cSo you want something to do,\u201d said Mr. Brown, after he inquired concerning the nature of her errand. \u201cHave you ever been employed in a shoe factory before?\u201d \u201cNo, sir,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d he inquired, and being informed, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know as I have anything for you. Would you work for four and a half a week?\u201d Carrie was too worn by defeat not to feel that it was considerable. She had not expected that he would offer her less than six. She acquiesced, however, and he took her name and address. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, finally, \u201cyou report here at eight o\u2019clock Monday morning. I think I can find something for you to do.\u201d He left her revived by the possibilities, sure that she had found something at last. Instantly the blood crept warmly over her body. Her nervous tension relaxed. She walked out into the busy street and discovered a new atmosphere. Behold, the throng was moving with a lightsome step. She noticed that men and women were smiling. Scraps of conversation and notes of laughter floated to her. The air was light.", " It was at that hour between afternoon and night when, for the idle, the wanderer, things are apt to take on a wistful aspect. The mind wanders forth on far journeys and returns with sheaves of withered and departed joys. Carrie sat at her window looking out. Drouet had been away since ten in the morning. She had amused herself with a walk, a book by Bertha M. Clay which Drouet had left there, though she did not wholly enjoy the latter, and by changing her dress for the evening. Now she sat looking out across the park as wistful and depressed as the nature which craves variety and life can be under such circumstances. As she contemplated her new state, the strain from the parlour below stole upward. With it her thoughts became coloured and enmeshed. She reverted to the things which were best and saddest within the small limit of her experience. She became for the moment a repentant. While she was in this mood Drouet came in, bringing with him an entirely different atmosphere. It was dusk and Carrie had neglected to light the lamp. The fire in the grate, too, had burned low. \u201cWhere are you, Cad?\u201d he said, using a pet name he had given her. \u201cHere,\u201d she answered. There was something delicate and lonely in her voice, but he could not hear it. He had not the poetry in him that would seek a woman out under such circumstances and console her for the tragedy of life. Instead, he struck a match and lighted the gas.", " He thought he saw Carrie, but it was so unexpected, so elegant and far away, he could hardly tell. He waited a while longer, growing feverish with want, and then seeing that the stage door no longer opened, and that a merry audience was arriving, he concluded it must have been Carrie and turned away. \u201cLord,\u201d he said, hastening out of the street into which the more fortunate were pouring, \u201cI\u2019ve got to get something.\u201d At that hour, when Broadway is wont to assume its most interesting aspect, a peculiar individual invariably took his stand at the corner of Twenty-sixth Street and Broadway\u2014a spot which is also intersected by Fifth Avenue. This was the hour when the theatres were just beginning to receive their patrons. Fire signs announcing the night\u2019s amusements blazed on every hand. Cabs and carriages, their lamps gleaming like yellow eyes, pattered by. Couples and parties of three and four freely mingled in the common crowd, which poured by in a thick stream, laughing and jesting. On Fifth Avenue were loungers\u2014a few wealthy strollers, a gentleman in evening dress with his lady on his arm, some club-men passing from one smoking-room to another. Across the way the great hotels showed a hundred gleaming windows, their caf\u00e9s and billiard-rooms filled with a comfortable, well-dressed, and pleasure-loving throng. All about was the night, pulsating with the thoughts of pleasure and exhilaration\u2014the curious enthusiasm of a great city bent upon finding joy in a thousand different ways."], "Why does Carrie despair during her walk with Minnie and Hanson in Garfield Park?": [" On the first morning it rained she found that she had no umbrella. Minnie loaned her one of hers, which was worn and faded. There was the kind of vanity in Carrie that troubled at this. She went to one of the great department stores and bought herself one, using a dollar and a quarter of her small store to pay for it. \u201cWhat did you do that for, Carrie?\u201d asked Minnie when she saw it. \u201cOh, I need one,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cYou foolish girl.\u201d Carrie resented this, though she did not reply. She was not going to be a common shop-girl, she thought; they need not think it, either. On the first Saturday night Carrie paid her board, four dollars. Minnie had a quaver of conscience as she took it, but did not know how to explain to Hanson if she took less. That worthy gave up just four dollars less toward the household expenses with a smile of satisfaction. He contemplated increasing his Building and Loan payments. As for Carrie, she studied over the problem of finding clothes and amusement on fifty cents a week. She brooded over this until she was in a state of mental rebellion. \u201cI\u2019m going up the street for a walk,\u201d she said after supper. \u201cNot alone, are you?\u201d asked Hanson. \u201cYes,\u201d returned Carrie. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t,\u201d said Minnie. \u201cI want to see _something_,\u201d said Carrie, and by the tone she put into the last word they realised for the first time she was not pleased with them. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with her?\u201d asked Hanson, when she went into the front room to get her hat.", " Her face took on the semblance of a look of happiness as she put on her hat to go below. \u201cCarrie doesn\u2019t seem to like her place very well,\u201d said Minnie to her husband when the latter came out, paper in hand, to sit in the dining-room a few minutes. \u201cShe ought to keep it for a time, anyhow,\u201d said Hanson. \u201cHas she gone downstairs?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Minnie. \u201cI\u2019d tell her to keep it if I were you. She might be here weeks without getting another one.\u201d Minnie said she would, and Hanson read his paper. \u201cIf I were you,\u201d he said a little later, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t let her stand in the door down there. It don\u2019t look good.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll tell her,\u201d said Minnie. The life of the streets continued for a long time to interest Carrie. She never wearied of wondering where the people in the cars were going or what their enjoyments were. Her imagination trod a very narrow round, always winding up at points which concerned money, looks, clothes, or enjoyment. She would have a far-off thought of Columbia City now and then, or an irritating rush of feeling concerning her experiences of the present day, but, on the whole, the little world about her enlisted her whole attention. The first floor of the building, of which Hanson\u2019s flat was the third, was occupied by a bakery, and to this, while she was standing there, Hanson came down to buy a loaf of bread. She was not aware of his presence until he was quite near her. \u201cI\u2019m after bread,\u201d was all he said as he passed.", " At dinner Carrie felt a little nervous. The strain of her own plans were considerable, and the feeling that she was not welcome here was strong. \u201cDidn\u2019t find anything, eh?\u201d said Hanson. \u201cNo.\u201d He turned to his eating again, the thought that it was a burden to have her here dwelling in his mind. She would have to go home, that was all. Once she was away, there would be no more coming back in the spring. Carrie was afraid of what she was going to do, but she was relieved to know that this condition was ending. They would not care. Hanson particularly would be glad when she went. He would not care what became of her. After dinner she went into the bathroom, where they could not disturb her, and wrote a little note. \u201cGood-bye, Minnie,\u201d it read. \u201cI\u2019m not going home. I\u2019m going to stay in Chicago a little while and look for work. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be all right.\u201d In the front room Hanson was reading his paper. As usual, she helped Minnie clear away the dishes and straighten up. Then she said: \u201cI guess I\u2019ll stand down at the door a little while.\u201d She could scarcely prevent her voice from trembling. Minnie remembered Hanson\u2019s remonstrance. \u201cSven doesn\u2019t think it looks good to stand down there,\u201d she said. \u201cDoesn\u2019t he?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cI won\u2019t do it any more after this.\u201d She put on her hat and fidgeted around the table in the little bedroom, wondering where to slip the note. Finally she put it under Minnie\u2019s hair-brush.", " At last she yielded enough to ask Hanson. It was a half-hearted procedure without a shade of desire on her part. \u201cCarrie wants us to go to the theatre,\u201d she said, looking in upon her husband. Hanson looked up from his paper, and they exchanged a mild look, which said as plainly as anything: \u201cThis isn\u2019t what we expected.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care to go,\u201d he returned. \u201cWhat does she want to see?\u201d \u201cH. R. Jacob\u2019s,\u201d said Minnie. He looked down at his paper and shook his head negatively. When Carrie saw how they looked upon her proposition, she gained a still clearer feeling of their way of life. It weighed on her, but took no definite form of opposition. \u201cI think I\u2019ll go down and stand at the foot of the stairs,\u201d she said, after a time. Minnie made no objection to this, and Carrie put on her hat and went below. \u201cWhere has Carrie gone?\u201d asked Hanson, coming back into the dining-room when he heard the door close. \u201cShe said she was going down to the foot of the stairs,\u201d answered Minnie. \u201cI guess she just wants to look out a while.\u201d \u201cShe oughtn\u2019t to be thinking about spending her money on theatres already, do you think?\u201d he said. \u201cShe just feels a little curious, I guess,\u201d ventured Minnie. \u201cEverything is so new.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Hanson, and went over to the baby, his forehead slightly wrinkled. He was thinking of a full career of vanity and wastefulness which a young girl might indulge in, and wondering how Carrie could contemplate such a course when she had so little, as yet, with which to do."], "Where does Carrie find the money to buy new clothes and move into her own apartment?": [" Carrie was fitted for this costume, and a few days later appeared, proud of her new laurels. She was especially gratified to find that her salary was now eighteen instead of twelve. Hurstwood heard nothing about this. \u201cI\u2019ll not give him the rest of my money,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cI do enough. I am going to get me something to wear.\u201d As a matter of fact, during this second month she had been buying for herself as recklessly as she dared, regardless of the consequences. There were impending more complications rent day, and more extension of the credit system in the neighbourhood. Now, however, she proposed to do better by herself. Her first move was to buy a shirt waist, and in studying these she found how little her money would buy\u2014how much, if she could only use all. She forgot that if she were alone she would have to pay for a room and board, and imagined that every cent of her eighteen could be spent for clothes and things that she liked. At last she picked upon something, which not only used up all her surplus above twelve, but invaded that sum. She knew she was going too far, but her feminine love of finery prevailed. The next day Hurstwood said: \u201cWe owe the grocer five dollars and forty cents this week.\u201d \u201cDo we?\u201d said Carrie, frowning a little. She looked in her purse to leave it. \u201cI\u2019ve only got eight dollars and twenty cents altogether.\u201d \u201cWe owe the milkman sixty cents,\u201d added Hurstwood.", " It was bright and commodious, with a bevelled mirror set in the wall at one end and incandescent lights arranged in three places. \u201cDo you find these satisfactory?\u201d observed Mr. Withers. \u201cOh, very,\u201d answered Carrie. \u201cWell, then, any time you find it convenient to move in, they are ready. The boy will bring you the keys at the door.\u201d Carrie noted the elegantly carpeted and decorated hall, the marbled lobby, and showy waiting-room. It was such a place as she had often dreamed of occupying. \u201cI guess we\u2019d better move right away, don\u2019t you think so?\u201d she observed to Lola, thinking of the commonplace chamber in Seventeenth Street. \u201cOh, by all means,\u201d said the latter. The next day her trunks left for the new abode. Dressing, after the matin\u00e9e on Wednesday, a knock came at her dressing-room door. Carrie looked at the card handed by the boy and suffered a shock of surprise. \u201cTell her I\u2019ll be right out,\u201d she said softly. Then, looking at the card, added: \u201cMrs. Vance.\u201d \u201cWhy, you little sinner,\u201d the latter exclaimed, as she saw Carrie coming toward her across the now vacant stage. \u201cHow in the world did this happen?\u201d Carrie laughed merrily. There was no trace of embarrassment in her friend\u2019s manner. You would have thought that the long separation had come about accidentally. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d returned Carrie, warming, in spite of her first troubled feelings, toward this handsome, good-natured young matron.", " Cold weather coming on and no clothes. Tough. He would go around to Fitzgerald and Moy\u2019s and get a cigar. It made him feel light of foot as he thought about her. Carrie reached home in high good spirits, which she could scarcely conceal. The possession of the money involved a number of points which perplexed her seriously. How should she buy any clothes when Minnie knew that she had no money? She had no sooner entered the flat than this point was settled for her. It could not be done. She could think of no way of explaining. \u201cHow did you come out?\u201d asked Minnie, referring to the day. Carrie had none of the small deception which could feel one thing and say something directly opposed. She would prevaricate, but it would be in the line of her feelings at least. So instead of complaining when she felt so good, she said: \u201cI have the promise of something.\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d \u201cAt the Boston Store.\u201d \u201cIs it sure promised?\u201d questioned Minnie. \u201cWell, I\u2019m to find out to-morrow,\u201d returned Carrie disliking to draw out a lie any longer than was necessary. Minnie felt the atmosphere of good feeling which Carrie brought with her. She felt now was the time to express to Carrie the state of Hanson\u2019s feeling about her entire Chicago venture. \u201cIf you shouldn\u2019t get it\u2014\u201d she paused, troubled for an easy way. \u201cIf I don\u2019t get something pretty soon, I think I\u2019ll go home.\u201d Minnie saw her chance. \u201cSven thinks it might be best for the winter, anyhow.\u201d The situation flashed on Carrie at once.", " \u201cNever!\u201d she thought. Who would furnish the money to move? To think of being in two rooms with him! She resolved to spend her money for clothes quickly, before something terrible happened. That very day she did it. Having done so, there was but one other thing to do. \u201cLola,\u201d she said, visiting her friend, \u201cI think I\u2019ll come.\u201d \u201cOh, jolly!\u201d cried the latter. \u201cCan we get it right away?\u201d she asked, meaning the room. \u201cCertainly,\u201d cried Lola. They went to look at it. Carrie had saved ten dollars from her expenditures\u2014enough for this and her board beside. Her enlarged salary would not begin for ten days yet\u2014would not reach her for seventeen. She paid half of the six dollars with her friend. \u201cNow, I\u2019ve just enough to get on to the end of the week,\u201d she confided. \u201cOh, I\u2019ve got some,\u201d said Lola. \u201cI\u2019ve got twenty-five dollars, if you need it.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll get along.\u201d They decided to move Friday, which was two days away. Now that the thing was settled, Carrie\u2019s heart misgave her. She felt very much like a criminal in the matter. Each day looking at Hurstwood, she had realised that, along with the disagreeableness of his attitude, there was something pathetic. She looked at him the same evening she had made up her mind to go, and now he seemed not so shiftless and worthless, but run down and beaten upon by chance. His eyes were not keen, his face marked, his hands flabby."], "What is the real reason that Drouet invites George Hurstwood over to his apartment?": [" To-night he was particularly so, since his report to the company had been favourably commented upon, his new samples had been satisfactorily selected, and his trip marked out for the next six weeks. \u201cWhy, hello, Charlie, old man,\u201d said Hurstwood, as Drouet came in that evening about eight o\u2019clock. \u201cHow goes it?\u201d The room was crowded. Drouet shook hands, beaming good nature, and they strolled towards the bar. \u201cOh, all right.\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in six weeks. When did you get in?\u201d \u201cFriday,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cHad a fine trip.\u201d \u201cGlad of it,\u201d said Hurstwood, his black eyes lit with a warmth which half displaced the cold make-believe that usually dwelt in them. \u201cWhat are you going to take?\u201d he added, as the barkeeper, in snowy jacket and tie, leaned toward them from behind the bar. \u201cOld Pepper,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cA little of the same for me,\u201d put in Hurstwood. \u201cHow long are you in town this time?\u201d inquired Hurstwood. \u201cOnly until Wednesday. I\u2019m going up to St. Paul.\u201d \u201cGeorge Evans was in here Saturday and said he saw you in Milwaukee last week.\u201d \u201cYes, I saw George,\u201d returned Drouet. \u201cGreat old boy, isn\u2019t he? We had quite a time there together.\u201d The barkeeper was setting out the glasses and bottle before them, and they now poured out the draught as they talked, Drouet filling his to within a third of full, as was considered proper, and Hurstwood taking the barest suggestion of whiskey and modifying it with seltzer.", " They were the only ones of the school about whom Jessica concerned herself. Young Hurstwood, Jr., was in his twentieth year, and was already connected in a promising capacity with a large real estate firm. He contributed nothing for the domestic expenses of the family, but was thought to be saving his money to invest in real estate. He had some ability, considerable vanity, and a love of pleasure that had not, as yet, infringed upon his duties, whatever they were. He came in and went out, pursuing his own plans and fancies, addressing a few words to his mother occasionally, relating some little incident to his father, but for the most part confining himself to those generalities with which most conversation concerns itself. He was not laying bare his desires for any one to see. He did not find any one in the house who particularly cared to see. Mrs. Hurstwood was the type of woman who has ever endeavoured to shine and has been more or less chagrined at the evidences of superior capability in this direction elsewhere. Her knowledge of life extended to that little conventional round of society of which she was not\u2014but longed to be\u2014a member. She was not without realisation already that this thing was impossible, so far as she was concerned. For her daughter, she hoped better things. Through Jessica she might rise a little. Through George, Jr.\u2019s, possible success she might draw to herself the privilege of pointing proudly.", " \u201cNot so soon,\u201d she answered. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019ll do,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ll write you, care of this West Side Post-office. Could you call next Tuesday?\u201d Carrie assented. The cab stopped one door out of the way according to his call. \u201cGood-night,\u201d he whispered, as the cab rolled away. Unfortunately for the smooth progression of this affair, Drouet returned. Hurstwood was sitting in his imposing little office the next afternoon when he saw Drouet enter. \u201cWhy, hello, Charles,\u201d he called affably; \u201cback again?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d smiled Drouet, approaching and looking in at the door. Hurstwood arose. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, looking the drummer over, \u201crosy as ever, eh?\u201d They began talking of the people they knew and things that had happened. \u201cBeen home yet?\u201d finally asked Hurstwood. \u201cNo, I am going, though,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cI remembered the little girl out there,\u201d said Hurstwood, \u201cand called once. Thought you wouldn\u2019t want her left quite alone.\u201d \u201cRight you are,\u201d agreed Drouet. \u201cHow is she?\u201d \u201cVery well,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cRather anxious about you though. You\u2019d better go out now and cheer her up.\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d said Drouet, smilingly. \u201cLike to have you both come down and go to the show with me Wednesday,\u201d concluded Hurstwood at parting. \u201cThanks, old man,\u201d said his friend, \u201cI\u2019ll see what the girl says and let you know.\u201d They separated in the most cordial manner. \u201cThere\u2019s a nice fellow,\u201d Drouet thought to himself as he turned the corner towards Madison.", " \u201cWell, you\u2019d better be going. It\u2019s half after eight already,\u201d and he drew out his watch. The crowd was already thinning out considerably\u2014some bound for the theatres, some to their clubs, and some to that most fascinating of all the pleasures\u2014for the type of man there represented, at least\u2014the ladies. \u201cYes, I will,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cCome around after the show. I have something I want to show you,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cSure,\u201d said Drouet, elated. \u201cYou haven\u2019t anything on hand for the night, have you?\u201d added Hurstwood. \u201cNot a thing.\u201d \u201cWell, come round, then.\u201d \u201cI struck a little peach coming in on the train Friday,\u201d remarked Drouet, by way of parting. \u201cBy George, that\u2019s so, I must go and call on her before I go away.\u201d \u201cOh, never mind her,\u201d Hurstwood remarked. \u201cSay, she was a little dandy, I tell you,\u201d went on Drouet confidentially, and trying to impress his friend. \u201cTwelve o\u2019clock,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said Drouet, going out. Thus was Carrie\u2019s name bandied about in the most frivolous and gay of places, and that also when the little toiler was bemoaning her narrow lot, which was almost inseparable from the early stages of this, her unfolding fate. Chapter VI. THE MACHINE AND THE MAIDEN: A KNIGHT OF TO-DAY At the flat that evening Carrie felt a new phase of its atmosphere. The fact that it was unchanged, while her feelings were different, increased her knowledge of its character."], "What wish does Julia Hurstwood harbor for her children?": [" His absence did not seem to be noticed by either of his children. Well, well, fortune plays a man queer tricks. He got back to his office and joined in a conversation with friends. It was as if idle chatter deadened the sense of misery. That night he dined at Rector\u2019s and returned at once to his office. In the bustle and show of the latter was his only relief. He troubled over many little details and talked perfunctorily to everybody. He stayed at his desk long after all others had gone, and only quitted it when the night watchman on his round pulled at the front door to see if it was safely locked. On Wednesday he received another polite note from McGregor, James and Hay. It read: \u201c_Dear Sir:_ We beg to inform you that we are instructed to wait until to-morrow (Thursday) at one o\u2019clock, before filing suit against you, on behalf of Mrs. Julia Hurstwood, for divorce and alimony. If we do not hear from you before that time we shall consider that you do not wish to compromise the matter in any way and act accordingly. \u201cVery truly yours, etc.\u201d \u201cCompromise!\u201d exclaimed Hurstwood bitterly. \u201cCompromise!\u201d Again he shook his head. So here it was spread out clear before him, and now he knew what to expect. If he didn\u2019t go and see them they would sue him promptly. If he did, he would be offered terms that would make his blood boil. He folded the letter and put it with the other one. Then he put on his hat and went for a turn about the block.", " She wondered how he could think to carry himself so in her presence after the cynicism, indifference, and neglect he had heretofore manifested and would continue to manifest so long as she would endure it. She thought how she should like to tell him\u2014what stress and emphasis she would lend her assertions, how she should drive over this whole affair until satisfaction should be rendered her. Indeed, the shining sword of her wrath was but weakly suspended by a thread of thought. In the meanwhile Hurstwood encountered a humorous item concerning a stranger who had arrived in the city and became entangled with a bunco-steerer. It amused him immensely, and at last he stirred and chuckled to himself. He wished that he might enlist his wife\u2019s attention and read it to her. \u201cHa, ha,\u201d he exclaimed softly, as if to himself, \u201cthat\u2019s funny.\u201d Mrs. Hurstwood kept on arranging her hair, not so much as deigning a glance. He stirred again and went on to another subject. At last he felt as if his good-humour must find some outlet. Julia was probably still out of humour over that affair of this morning, but that could easily be straightened. As a matter of fact, she was in the wrong, but he didn\u2019t care. She could go to Waukesha right away if she wanted to. The sooner the better. He would tell her that as soon as he got a chance, and the whole thing would blow over. \u201cDid you notice,\u201d he said, at last, breaking forth concerning another item which he had found, \u201cthat they have entered suit to compel the Illinois Central to get off the lake front, Julia?\u201d he asked.", " Before starting he thought it well to discover where Drouet would be, and returned to his hotel. \u201cHas Mr. Drouet gone out?\u201d he asked of the clerk. \u201cNo,\u201d answered the latter, \u201che\u2019s in his room. Do you wish to send up a card?\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019ll call around later,\u201d answered Hurstwood, and strolled out. He took a Madison car and went direct to Ogden Place this time walking boldly up to the door. The chambermaid answered his knock. \u201cIs Mr. Drouet in?\u201d said Hurstwood blandly. \u201cHe is out of the city,\u201d said the girl, who had heard Carrie tell this to Mrs. Hale. \u201cIs Mrs. Drouet in?\u201d \u201cNo, she has gone to the theatre.\u201d \u201cIs that so?\u201d said Hurstwood, considerably taken back; then, as if burdened with something important, \u201cYou don\u2019t know to which theatre?\u201d The girl really had no idea where she had gone, but not liking Hurstwood, and wishing to cause him trouble, answered: \u201cYes, Hooley\u2019s.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d returned the manager, and, tipping his hat slightly, went away. \u201cI\u2019ll look in at Hooley\u2019s,\u201d thought he, but as a matter of fact he did not. Before he had reached the central portion of the city he thought the whole matter over and decided it would be useless. As much as he longed to see Carrie, he knew she would be with some one and did not wish to intrude with his plea there. A little later he might do so\u2014in the morning. Only in the morning he had the lawyer question before him. This little pilgrimage threw quite a wet blanket upon his rising spirits.", " \u201cWell, I\u2019ve been busy,\u201d said Drouet. They talked some few minutes on general topics. \u201cSay,\u201d said Drouet, as if struck by a sudden idea, \u201cI want you to come out some evening.\u201d \u201cOut where?\u201d inquired Hurstwood. \u201cOut to my house, of course,\u201d said Drouet, smiling. Hurstwood looked up quizzically, the least suggestion of a smile hovering about his lips. He studied the face of Drouet in his wise way, and then with the demeanour of a gentleman, said: \u201cCertainly; glad to.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll have a nice game of euchre.\u201d \u201cMay I bring a nice little bottle of Sec?\u201d asked Hurstwood. \u201cCertainly,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cI\u2019ll introduce you.\u201d Chapter IX. CONVENTION\u2019S OWN TINDER-BOX: THE EYE THAT IS GREEN Hurstwood\u2019s residence on the North Side, near Lincoln Park, was a brick building of a very popular type then, a three-story affair with the first floor sunk a very little below the level of the street. It had a large bay window bulging out from the second floor, and was graced in front by a small grassy plot, twenty-five feet wide and ten feet deep. There was also a small rear yard, walled in by the fences of the neighbours and holding a stable where he kept his horse and trap. The ten rooms of the house were occupied by himself, his wife Julia, and his son and daughter, George, Jr., and Jessica. There were besides these a maid-servant, represented from time to time by girls of various extraction, for Mrs. Hurstwood was not always easy to please."], "What causes Carrie to begin noticing small deficiencies in Drouet\u2019s personality and demeanor?": [" Look at him any time within the half hour before the curtain was up, he was a member of an eminent group\u2014a rounded company of five or more whose stout figures, large white bosoms, and shining pins bespoke the character of their success. The gentlemen who brought their wives called him out to shake hands. Seats clicked, ushers bowed while he looked blandly on. He was evidently a light among them, reflecting in his personality the ambitions of those who greeted him. He was acknowledged, fawned upon, in a way lionised. Through it all one could see the standing of the man. It was greatness in a way, small as it was. Chapter XIX. AN HOUR IN ELFLAND: A CLAMOUR HALF HEARD At last the curtain was ready to go up. All the details of the make-up had been completed, and the company settled down as the leader of the small, hired orchestra tapped significantly upon his music rack with his baton and began the soft curtain-raising strain. Hurstwood ceased talking, and went with Drouet and his friend Sagar Morrison around to the box. \u201cNow, we\u2019ll see how the little girl does,\u201d he said to Drouet, in a tone which no one else could hear. On the stage, six of the characters had already appeared in the opening parlour scene. Drouet and Hurstwood saw at a glance that Carrie was not among them, and went on talking in a whisper. Mrs. Morgan, Mrs. Hoagland, and the actor who had taken Bamberger\u2019s part were representing the principal r\u00f4les in this scene.", " To-day she hardly noticed that it was in the wrong place, so absorbed was she in her own thoughts. She worked about the room until Drouet put in appearance at five o\u2019clock. The drummer was flushed and excited and full of determination to know all about her relations with Hurstwood. Nevertheless, after going over the subject in his mind the livelong day, he was rather weary of it and wished it over with. He did not foresee serious consequences of any sort, and yet he rather hesitated to begin. Carrie was sitting by the window when he came in, rocking and looking out. \u201cWell,\u201d she said innocently, weary of her own mental discussion and wondering at his haste and ill-concealed excitement, \u201cwhat makes you hurry so?\u201d Drouet hesitated, now that he was in her presence, uncertain as to what course to pursue. He was no diplomat. He could neither read nor see. \u201cWhen did you get home?\u201d he asked foolishly. \u201cOh, an hour or so ago. What makes you ask that?\u201d \u201cYou weren\u2019t here,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen I came back this morning, and I thought you had gone out.\u201d \u201cSo I did,\u201d said Carrie simply. \u201cI went for a walk.\u201d Drouet looked at her wonderingly. For all his lack of dignity in such matters he did not know how to begin. He stared at her in the most flagrant manner until at last she said: \u201cWhat makes you stare at me so? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d \u201cNothing,\u201d he answered. \u201cI was just thinking.\u201d \u201cJust thinking what?\u201d she returned smilingly, puzzled by his attitude.", " He was very much enlivened in temper and inclined to whisper, but Hurstwood pretended interest. He fixed his eyes on the stage, although Carrie was not there, a short bit of melodramatic comedy preceding her entrance. He did not see what was going on, however. He was thinking his own thoughts, and they were wretched. The progress of the play did not improve matters for him. Carrie, from now on, was easily the centre of interest. The audience, which had been inclined to feel that nothing could be good after the first gloomy impression, now went to the other extreme and saw power where it was not. The general feeling reacted on Carrie. She presented her part with some felicity, though nothing like the intensity which had aroused the feeling at the end of the long first act. Both Hurstwood and Drouet viewed her pretty figure with rising feelings. The fact that such ability should reveal itself in her, that they should see it set forth under such effective circumstances, framed almost in massy gold and shone upon by the appropriate lights of sentiment and personality, heightened her charm for them. She was more than the old Carrie to Drouet. He longed to be at home with her until he could tell her. He awaited impatiently the end, when they should go home alone. Hurstwood, on the contrary, saw in the strength of her new attractiveness his miserable predicament. He could have cursed the man beside him.", " At least, she got the idea that her look was something which represented the world\u2019s longing. She took it to heart as a creditable thing, until he added: \u201cThat puts a burden of duty on you. It so happens that you have this thing. It is no credit to you\u2014that is, I mean, you might not have had it. You paid nothing to get it. But now that you have it, you must do something with it.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d asked Carrie. \u201cI should say, turn to the dramatic field. You have so much sympathy and such a melodious voice. Make them valuable to others. It will make your powers endure.\u201d Carrie did not understand this last. All the rest showed her that her comedy success was little or nothing. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy, just this. You have this quality in your eyes and mouth and in your nature. You can lose it, you know. If you turn away from it and live to satisfy yourself alone, it will go fast enough. The look will leave your eyes. Your mouth will change. Your power to act will disappear. You may think they won\u2019t, but they will. Nature takes care of that.\u201d He was so interested in forwarding all good causes that he sometimes became enthusiastic, giving vent to these preachments. Something in Carrie appealed to him. He wanted to stir her up. \u201cI know,\u201d she said, absently, feeling slightly guilty of neglect. \u201cIf I were you,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019d change.\u201d The effect of this was like roiling helpless waters."], "What causes Carrie to realize that Drouet cannot sympathize with her feelings?": [" \u201cWhy, I know it. I\u2019ve always known it,\u201d said Drouet. Carrie was feeling about for a right thought. She was making a most miserable showing, and yet feelings were generating within her which were anything but crumbling cowardice. \u201cI thought I told you,\u201d he added. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t,\u201d she contradicted, suddenly recovering her voice. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything of the kind.\u201d Drouet listened to her in astonishment. This was something new. \u201cI thought I did,\u201d he said. Carrie looked around her very solemnly, and then went over to the window. \u201cYou oughtn\u2019t to have had anything to do with him,\u201d said Drouet in an injured tone, \u201cafter all I\u2019ve done for you.\u201d \u201cYou,\u201d said Carrie, \u201cyou! What have you done for me?\u201d Her little brain had been surging with contradictory feelings\u2014shame at exposure, shame at Hurstwood\u2019s perfidy, anger at Drouet\u2019s deception, the mockery he had made at her. Now one clear idea came into her head. He was at fault. There was no doubt about it. Why did he bring Hurstwood out\u2014Hurstwood, a married man, and never say a word to her? Never mind now about Hurstwood\u2019s perfidy\u2014why had he done this? Why hadn\u2019t he warned her? There he stood now, guilty of this miserable breach of confidence and talking about what he had done for her! \u201cWell, I like that,\u201d exclaimed Drouet, little realising the fire his remark had generated. \u201cI think I\u2019ve done a good deal.\u201d \u201cYou have, eh?\u201d she answered. \u201cYou\u2019ve deceived me\u2014that\u2019s what you\u2019ve done.", " Then, with a pathos which struck home because of its utter simplicity, \u201cHe shall not suffer long.\u201d Hurstwood realised that he was seeing something extraordinarily good. It was heightened for him by the applause of the audience as the curtain descended and the fact that it was Carrie. He thought now that she was beautiful. She had done something which was above his sphere. He felt a keen delight in realising that she was his. \u201cFine,\u201d he said, and then, seized by a sudden impulse, arose and went about to the stage door. When he came in upon Carrie she was still with Drouet. His feelings for her were most exuberant. He was almost swept away by the strength and feeling she exhibited. His desire was to pour forth his praise with the unbounded feelings of a lover, but here was Drouet, whose affection was also rapidly reviving. The latter was more fascinated, if anything, than Hurstwood. At least, in the nature of things, it took a more ruddy form. \u201cWell, well,\u201d said Drouet, \u201cyou did out of sight. That was simply great. I knew you could do it. Oh, but you\u2019re a little daisy!\u201d Carrie\u2019s eyes flamed with the light of achievement. \u201cDid I do all right?\u201d \u201cDid you? Well, I guess. Didn\u2019t you hear the applause?\u201d There was some faint sound of clapping yet. \u201cI thought I got it something like\u2014I felt it.\u201d Just then Hurstwood came in. Instinctively he felt the change in Drouet. He saw that the drummer was near to Carrie, and jealousy leaped alight in his bosom.", " Carrie, left alone since the scene in question, and having no one with whom to counsel, had at first wandered from one strange mental conclusion to another, until at last, tired out, she gave it up. She owed something to Drouet, she thought. It did not seem more than yesterday that he had aided her when she was worried and distressed. She had the kindliest feelings for him in every way. She gave him credit for his good looks, his generous feelings, and even, in fact, failed to recollect his egotism when he was absent; but she could not feel any binding influence keeping her for him as against all others. In fact, such a thought had never had any grounding, even in Drouet\u2019s desires. The truth is, that this goodly drummer carried the doom of all enduring relationships in his own lightsome manner and unstable fancy. He went merrily on, assured that he was alluring all, that affection followed tenderly in his wake, that things would endure unchangingly for his pleasure. When he missed some old face, or found some door finally shut to him, it did not grieve him deeply. He was too young, too successful. He would remain thus young in spirit until he was dead. As for Hurstwood, he was alive with thoughts and feelings concerning Carrie. He had no definite plans regarding her, but he was determined to make her confess an affection for him. He thought he saw in her drooping eye, her unstable glance, her wavering manner, the symptoms of a budding passion.", " Would that Drouet were only away! While he was thinking thus elatedly, he remembered that he wanted some clean linen in the morning. This he purchased, together with a half-dozen ties, and went to the Palmer House. As he entered he thought he saw Drouet ascending the stairs with a key. Surely not Drouet! Then he thought, perhaps they had changed their abode temporarily. He went straight up to the desk. \u201cIs Mr. Drouet stopping here?\u201d he asked of the clerk. \u201cI think he is,\u201d said the latter, consulting his private registry list. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cIs that so?\u201d exclaimed Hurstwood, otherwise concealing his astonishment. \u201cAlone?\u201d he added. \u201cYes,\u201d said the clerk. Hurstwood turned away and set his lips so as best to express and conceal his feelings. \u201cHow\u2019s that?\u201d he thought. \u201cThey\u2019ve had a row.\u201d He hastened to his room with rising spirits and changed his linen. As he did so, he made up his mind that if Carrie was alone, or if she had gone to another place, it behooved him to find out. He decided to call at once. \u201cI know what I\u2019ll do,\u201d he thought. \u201cI\u2019ll go to the door and ask if Mr. Drouet is at home. That will bring out whether he is there or not and where Carrie is.\u201d He was almost moved to some muscular display as he thought of it. He decided to go immediately after supper. On coming down from his room at six, he looked carefully about to see if Drouet was present and then went out to lunch. He could scarcely eat, however, he was so anxious to be about his errand."], "Who contributes to the tension of Hurstwood\u2019s marriage by spotting him at the theater with Carrie and Drouet?": [" \u201cOh, no,\u201d she said remorsefully, her tone reflecting some of her own success and more of her helplessness, \u201cyou never will.\u201d \u201cWell, you wait a little while and see,\u201d he concluded. \u201cI\u2019ll marry you all right.\u201d Carrie looked at him and felt justified. She was looking for something which would calm her conscience, and here it was, a light, airy disregard of her claims upon his justice. He had faithfully promised to marry her, and this was the way he fulfilled his promise. \u201cSay,\u201d he said, after he had, as he thought, pleasantly disposed of the marriage question, \u201cI saw Hurstwood to-day, and he wants us to go to the theatre with him.\u201d Carrie started at the name, but recovered quickly enough to avoid notice. \u201cWhen?\u201d she asked, with assumed indifference. \u201cWednesday. We\u2019ll go, won\u2019t we?\u201d \u201cIf you think so,\u201d she answered, her manner being so enforcedly reserved as to almost excite suspicion. Drouet noticed something but he thought it was due to her feelings concerning their talk about marriage. \u201cHe called once, he said.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Carrie, \u201che was out here Sunday evening.\u201d \u201cWas he?\u201d said Drouet. \u201cI thought from what he said that he had called a week or so ago.\u201d \u201cSo he did,\u201d answered Carrie, who was wholly unaware of what conversation her lovers might have held. She was all at sea mentally, and fearful of some entanglement which might ensue from what she would answer. \u201cOh, then he called twice?\u201d said Drouet, the first shade of misunderstanding showing in his face.", " I expect to get it all back shortly, but just at present I am running close.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d answered Carrie. \u201cWhy, certainly, dear. Why didn\u2019t you tell me before?\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t necessary,\u201d said Hurstwood. For all her acquiescence, there was something about the way Hurstwood spoke which reminded Carrie of Drouet and his little deal which he was always about to put through. It was only the thought of a second, but it was a beginning. It was something new in her thinking of Hurstwood. Other things followed from time to time, little things of the same sort, which in their cumulative effect were eventually equal to a full revelation. Carrie was not dull by any means. Two persons cannot long dwell together without coming to an understanding of one another. The mental difficulties of an individual reveal themselves whether he voluntarily confesses them or not. Trouble gets in the air and contributes gloom, which speaks for itself. Hurstwood dressed as nicely as usual, but they were the same clothes he had in Canada. Carrie noticed that he did not install a large wardrobe, though his own was anything but large. She noticed, also, that he did not suggest many amusements, said nothing about the food, seemed concerned about his business. This was not the easy Hurstwood of Chicago\u2014not the liberal, opulent Hurstwood she had known. The change was too obvious to escape detection. In time she began to feel that a change had come about, and that she was not in his confidence.", " \u201cIt\u2019s unfair to let such playing go without earning something,\u201d he said after a time, slipping his finger into the little coin pocket of his coat. \u201cLet\u2019s play for dimes.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d said Drouet, fishing for bills. Hurstwood was quicker. His fingers were full of new ten-cent pieces. \u201cHere we are,\u201d he said, supplying each one with a little stack. \u201cOh, this is gambling,\u201d smiled Carrie. \u201cIt\u2019s bad.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Drouet, \u201conly fun. If you never play for more than that, you will go to Heaven.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you moralise,\u201d said Hurstwood to Carrie gently, \u201cuntil you see what becomes of the money.\u201d Drouet smiled. \u201cIf your husband gets them, he\u2019ll tell you how bad it is.\u201d Drouet laughed loud. There was such an ingratiating tone about Hurstwood\u2019s voice, the insinuation was so perceptible that even Carrie got the humour of it. \u201cWhen do you leave?\u201d said Hurstwood to Drouet. \u201cOn Wednesday,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt\u2019s rather hard to have your husband running about like that, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Hurstwood, addressing Carrie. \u201cShe\u2019s going along with me this time,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cYou must both go with me to the theatre before you go.\u201d \u201cCertainly,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cEh, Carrie?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like it ever so much,\u201d she replied. Hurstwood did his best to see that Carrie won the money. He rejoiced in her success, kept counting her winnings, and finally gathered and put them in her extended hand. They spread a little lunch, at which he served the wine, and afterwards he used fine tact in going.", " \u201cNot so soon,\u201d she answered. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019ll do,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ll write you, care of this West Side Post-office. Could you call next Tuesday?\u201d Carrie assented. The cab stopped one door out of the way according to his call. \u201cGood-night,\u201d he whispered, as the cab rolled away. Unfortunately for the smooth progression of this affair, Drouet returned. Hurstwood was sitting in his imposing little office the next afternoon when he saw Drouet enter. \u201cWhy, hello, Charles,\u201d he called affably; \u201cback again?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d smiled Drouet, approaching and looking in at the door. Hurstwood arose. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, looking the drummer over, \u201crosy as ever, eh?\u201d They began talking of the people they knew and things that had happened. \u201cBeen home yet?\u201d finally asked Hurstwood. \u201cNo, I am going, though,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cI remembered the little girl out there,\u201d said Hurstwood, \u201cand called once. Thought you wouldn\u2019t want her left quite alone.\u201d \u201cRight you are,\u201d agreed Drouet. \u201cHow is she?\u201d \u201cVery well,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cRather anxious about you though. You\u2019d better go out now and cheer her up.\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d said Drouet, smilingly. \u201cLike to have you both come down and go to the show with me Wednesday,\u201d concluded Hurstwood at parting. \u201cThanks, old man,\u201d said his friend, \u201cI\u2019ll see what the girl says and let you know.\u201d They separated in the most cordial manner. \u201cThere\u2019s a nice fellow,\u201d Drouet thought to himself as he turned the corner towards Madison."], "Who does Carrie imitate to make herself into a woman of \u201cconsiderable taste\u201d?": [" \u201cDo you think I\u2019d come home here and urge you to do something that I didn\u2019t think you would make a success of? You can act all right. It\u2019ll be good for you.\u201d \u201cWhen must I go?\u201d said Carrie, reflectively. \u201cThe first rehearsal is Friday night. I\u2019ll get the part for you to-night.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d said Carrie resignedly, \u201cI\u2019ll do it, but if I make a failure now it\u2019s your fault.\u201d \u201cYou won\u2019t fail,\u201d assured Drouet. \u201cJust act as you do around here. Be natural. You\u2019re all right. I\u2019ve often thought you\u2019d make a corking good actress.\u201d \u201cDid you really?\u201d asked Carrie. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said the drummer. He little knew as he went out of the door that night what a secret flame he had kindled in the bosom of the girl he left behind. Carrie was possessed of that sympathetic, impressionable nature which, ever in the most developed form, has been the glory of the drama. She was created with that passivity of soul which is always the mirror of the active world. She possessed an innate taste for imitation and no small ability. Even without practice, she could sometimes restore dramatic situations she had witnessed by re-creating, before her mirror, the expressions of the various faces taking part in the scene. She loved to modulate her voice after the conventional manner of the distressed heroine, and repeat such pathetic fragments as appealed most to her sympathies. Of late, seeing the airy grace of the _ingenue_ in several well-constructed plays, she had been moved to secretly imitate it, and many were the little movements and expressions of the body in which she indulged from time to time in the privacy of her chamber.", " He had just enough of the feminine love of dress to be a good judge\u2014not of intellect, but of clothes. He saw how they set their little feet, how they carried their chins, with what grace and sinuosity they swung their bodies. A dainty, self-conscious swaying of the hips by a woman was to him as alluring as the glint of rare wine to a toper. He would turn and follow the disappearing vision with his eyes. He would thrill as a child with the unhindered passion that was in him. He loved the thing that women love in themselves, grace. At this, their own shrine, he knelt with them, an ardent devotee. \u201cDid you see that woman who went by just now?\u201d he said to Carrie on the first day they took a walk together. \u201cFine stepper, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d Carrie looked, and observed the grace commended. \u201cYes, she is,\u201d she returned, cheerfully, a little suggestion of possible defect in herself awakening in her mind. If that was so fine, she must look at it more closely. Instinctively, she felt a desire to imitate it. Surely she could do that too. When one of her mind sees many things emphasized and re-emphasized and admired, she gathers the logic of it and applies accordingly. Drouet was not shrewd enough to see that this was not tactful. He could not see that it would be better to make her feel that she was competing with herself, not others better than herself. He would not have done it with an older, wiser woman, but in Carrie he saw only the novice.", " \u201cHello,\u201d he exclaimed, \u201cyou\u2019ve been crying.\u201d Her eyes were still wet with a few vague tears. \u201cPshaw,\u201d he said, \u201cyou don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d He took her hand, feeling in his good-natured egotism that it was probably lack of his presence which had made her lonely. \u201cCome on, now,\u201d he went on; \u201cit\u2019s all right. Let\u2019s waltz a little to that music.\u201d He could not have introduced a more incongruous proposition. It made clear to Carrie that he could not sympathise with her. She could not have framed thoughts which would have expressed his defect or made clear the difference between them, but she felt it. It was his first great mistake. What Drouet said about the girl\u2019s grace, as she tripped out evenings accompanied by her mother, caused Carrie to perceive the nature and value of those little modish ways which women adopt when they would presume to be something. She looked in the mirror and pursed up her lips, accompanying it with a little toss of the head, as she had seen the railroad treasurer\u2019s daughter do. She caught up her skirts with an easy swing, for had not Drouet remarked that in her and several others, and Carrie was naturally imitative. She began to get the hang of those little things which the pretty woman who has vanity invariably adopts. In short, her knowledge of grace doubled, and with it her appearance changed. She became a girl of considerable taste. Drouet noticed this.", " He saw the new bow in her hair and the new way of arranging her locks which she affected one morning. \u201cYou look fine that way, Cad,\u201d he said. \u201cDo I?\u201d she replied, sweetly. It made her try for other effects that selfsame day. She used her feet less heavily, a thing that was brought about by her attempting to imitate the treasurer\u2019s daughter\u2019s graceful carriage. How much influence the presence of that young woman in the same house had upon her it would be difficult to say. But, because of all these things, when Hurstwood called he had found a young woman who was much more than the Carrie to whom Drouet had first spoken. The primary defects of dress and manner had passed. She was pretty, graceful, rich in the timidity born of uncertainty, and with a something childlike in her large eyes which captured the fancy of this starched and conventional poser among men. It was the ancient attraction of the fresh for the stale. If there was a touch of appreciation left in him for the bloom and unsophistication which is the charm of youth, it rekindled now. He looked into her pretty face and felt the subtle waves of young life radiating therefrom. In that large clear eye he could see nothing that his _blas\u00e9_ nature could understand as guile. The little vanity, if he could have perceived it there, would have touched him as a pleasant thing. \u201cI wonder,\u201d he said, as he rode away in his cab, \u201chow Drouet came to win her.\u201d He gave her credit for feelings superior to Drouet at the first glance."], "What are Hurstwood and Carrie doing when he first confesses his love for her?": [" I expect to get it all back shortly, but just at present I am running close.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d answered Carrie. \u201cWhy, certainly, dear. Why didn\u2019t you tell me before?\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t necessary,\u201d said Hurstwood. For all her acquiescence, there was something about the way Hurstwood spoke which reminded Carrie of Drouet and his little deal which he was always about to put through. It was only the thought of a second, but it was a beginning. It was something new in her thinking of Hurstwood.

This was not the easy Hurstwood of Chicago\u2014not the liberal, opulent Hurstwood she had known. The change was too obvious to escape detection. In time she began to feel that a change had come about, and that she was not in his confidence.", " \u201cCarrie,\u201d he said, getting up once and coming over to her, \u201care you going to stay with me from now on?\u201d She looked at him quizzically, but melted with sympathy as the value of the look upon his face forced itself upon her. It was love now, keen and strong\u2014love enhanced by difficulty and worry. She could not help smiling. \u201cLet me be everything to you from now on,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t make me worry any more. I\u2019ll be true to you. We\u2019ll go to New York and get a nice flat. I\u2019ll go into business again, and we\u2019ll be happy. Won\u2019t you be mine?\u201d Carrie listened quite solemnly. There was no great passion in her, but the drift of things and this man\u2019s proximity created a semblance of affection. She felt rather sorry for him\u2014a sorrow born of what had only recently been a great admiration. True love she had never felt for him. She would have known as much if she could have analysed her feelings, but this thing which she now felt aroused by his great feeling broke down the barriers between them. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay with me, won\u2019t you?\u201d he asked. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, nodding her head. He gathered her to himself, imprinting kisses upon her lips and cheeks. \u201cYou must marry me, though,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll get a license to-day,\u201d he answered. \u201cHow?\u201d she asked. \u201cUnder a new name,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019ll take a new name and live a new life. From now on I\u2019m Murdock.\u201d \u201cOh, don\u2019t take that name,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cWhy not?\u201d he said.", " \u201cI was going to tell you the other evening,\u201d he added, \u201cbut somehow the opportunity slipped away.\u201d Carrie was listening without attempting to reply. She could think of nothing worth while to say. Despite all the ideas concerning right which had troubled her vaguely since she had last seen him, she was now influenced again strongly in his favour. \u201cI came out here to-day,\u201d he went on, solemnly, \u201cto tell you just how I feel\u2014to see if you wouldn\u2019t listen to me.\u201d Hurstwood was something of a romanticist after his kind. He was capable of strong feelings\u2014often poetic ones\u2014and under a stress of desire, such as the present, he waxed eloquent. That is, his feelings and his voice were coloured with that seeming repression and pathos which is the essence of eloquence. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said, putting his hand on her arm, and keeping a strange silence while he formulated words, \u201cthat I love you?\u201d Carrie did not stir at the words. She was bound up completely in the man\u2019s atmosphere. He would have churchlike silence in order to express his feelings, and she kept it. She did not move her eyes from the flat, open scene before her. Hurstwood waited for a few moments, and then repeated the words. \u201cYou must not say that,\u201d she said, weakly. Her words were not convincing at all. They were the result of a feeble thought that something ought to be said. He paid no attention to them whatever. \u201cCarrie,\u201d he said, using her first name with sympathetic familiarity, \u201cI want you to love me.", " \u201cHer beauty, her wit, her accomplishments, she may sell to you; but her love is the treasure without money and without price.\u201d The manager suffered this as a personal appeal. It came to him as if they were alone, and he could hardly restrain the tears for sorrow over the hopeless, pathetic, and yet dainty and appealing woman whom he loved. Drouet also was beside himself. He was resolving that he would be to Carrie what he had never been before. He would marry her, by George! She was worth it. \u201cShe asks only in return,\u201d said Carrie, scarcely hearing the small, scheduled reply of her lover, and putting herself even more in harmony with the plaintive melody now issuing from the orchestra, \u201cthat when you look upon her your eyes shall speak devotion; that when you address her your voice shall be gentle, loving, and kind; that you shall not despise her because she cannot understand all at once your vigorous thoughts and ambitious designs; for, when misfortune and evil have defeated your greatest purposes, her love remains to console you. You look to the trees,\u201d she continued, while Hurstwood restrained his feelings only by the grimmest repression, \u201cfor strength and grandeur; do not despise the flowers because their fragrance is all they have to give. Remember,\u201d she concluded, tenderly, \u201clove is all a woman has to give,\u201d and she laid a strange, sweet accent on the all, \u201cbut it is the only thing which God permits us to carry beyond the grave.\u201d The two men were in the most harrowed state of affection."], "Who takes special note of the time Hurstwood and Carrie spend together during Drouet\u2019s absence?": [" When she could not find her way out of the labyrinth of ill-logic which thought upon the subject created, she would turn away entirely. Drouet, all the time, was conducting himself in a model way for one of his sort. He took her about a great deal, spent money upon her, and when he travelled took her with him. There were times when she would be alone for two or three days, while he made the shorter circuits of his business, but, as a rule, she saw a great deal of him. \u201cSay, Carrie,\u201d he said one morning, shortly after they had so established themselves, \u201cI\u2019ve invited my friend Hurstwood to come out some day and spend the evening with us.\u201d \u201cWho is he?\u201d asked Carrie doubtfully. \u201cOh, he\u2019s a nice man. He\u2019s manager of Fitzgerald and Moy\u2019s.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cThe finest resort in town. It\u2019s a way-up, swell place.\u201d Carrie puzzled a moment. She was wondering what Drouet had told him, what her attitude would be. \u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d said Drouet, feeling her thought. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know anything. You\u2019re Mrs. Drouet now.\u201d There was something about this which struck Carrie as slightly inconsiderate. She could see that Drouet did not have the keenest sensibilities. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we get married?\u201d she inquired, thinking of the voluble promises he had made. \u201cWell, we will,\u201d he said, \u201cjust as soon as I get this little deal of mine closed up.\u201d He was referring to some property which he said he had, and which required so much attention, adjustment, and what not, that somehow or other it interfered with his free moral, personal actions.", " \u201cIt\u2019s unfair to let such playing go without earning something,\u201d he said after a time, slipping his finger into the little coin pocket of his coat. \u201cLet\u2019s play for dimes.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d said Drouet, fishing for bills. Hurstwood was quicker. His fingers were full of new ten-cent pieces. \u201cHere we are,\u201d he said, supplying each one with a little stack. \u201cOh, this is gambling,\u201d smiled Carrie. \u201cIt\u2019s bad.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Drouet, \u201conly fun. If you never play for more than that, you will go to Heaven.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you moralise,\u201d said Hurstwood to Carrie gently, \u201cuntil you see what becomes of the money.\u201d Drouet smiled. \u201cIf your husband gets them, he\u2019ll tell you how bad it is.\u201d Drouet laughed loud. There was such an ingratiating tone about Hurstwood\u2019s voice, the insinuation was so perceptible that even Carrie got the humour of it. \u201cWhen do you leave?\u201d said Hurstwood to Drouet. \u201cOn Wednesday,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt\u2019s rather hard to have your husband running about like that, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Hurstwood, addressing Carrie. \u201cShe\u2019s going along with me this time,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cYou must both go with me to the theatre before you go.\u201d \u201cCertainly,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cEh, Carrie?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like it ever so much,\u201d she replied. Hurstwood did his best to see that Carrie won the money. He rejoiced in her success, kept counting her winnings, and finally gathered and put them in her extended hand. They spread a little lunch, at which he served the wine, and afterwards he used fine tact in going.", " To-night he was particularly so, since his report to the company had been favourably commented upon, his new samples had been satisfactorily selected, and his trip marked out for the next six weeks. \u201cWhy, hello, Charlie, old man,\u201d said Hurstwood, as Drouet came in that evening about eight o\u2019clock. \u201cHow goes it?\u201d The room was crowded. Drouet shook hands, beaming good nature, and they strolled towards the bar. \u201cOh, all right.\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in six weeks. When did you get in?\u201d \u201cFriday,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cHad a fine trip.\u201d \u201cGlad of it,\u201d said Hurstwood, his black eyes lit with a warmth which half displaced the cold make-believe that usually dwelt in them. \u201cWhat are you going to take?\u201d he added, as the barkeeper, in snowy jacket and tie, leaned toward them from behind the bar. \u201cOld Pepper,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cA little of the same for me,\u201d put in Hurstwood. \u201cHow long are you in town this time?\u201d inquired Hurstwood. \u201cOnly until Wednesday. I\u2019m going up to St. Paul.\u201d \u201cGeorge Evans was in here Saturday and said he saw you in Milwaukee last week.\u201d \u201cYes, I saw George,\u201d returned Drouet. \u201cGreat old boy, isn\u2019t he? We had quite a time there together.\u201d The barkeeper was setting out the glasses and bottle before them, and they now poured out the draught as they talked, Drouet filling his to within a third of full, as was considered proper, and Hurstwood taking the barest suggestion of whiskey and modifying it with seltzer.", " Put him up.\u201d He entered, and then began a scene which had as much to do with the creation of the tragedy of affection in Hurstwood as anything in his peculiar and involved career. For Carrie had resolved to make something of this scene, and, now that the cue had come, it began to take a feeling hold upon her. Both Hurstwood and Drouet noted the rising sentiment as she proceeded. \u201cI thought you had gone with Pearl,\u201d she said to her lover. \u201cI did go part of the way, but I left the party a mile down the road.\u201d \u201cYou and Pearl had no disagreement?\u201d \u201cNo\u2014yes; that is, we always have. Our social barometers always stand at \u2018cloudy\u2019 and \u2018overcast.\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd whose fault is that?\u201d she said, easily. \u201cNot mine,\u201d he answered, pettishly. \u201cI know I do all I can\u2014I say all I can\u2014but she\u2014\u2014\u201d This was rather awkwardly put by Patton, but Carrie redeemed it with a grace which was inspiring. \u201cBut she is your wife,\u201d she said, fixing her whole attention upon the stilled actor, and softening the quality of her voice until it was again low and musical. \u201cRay, my friend, courtship is the text from which the whole sermon of married life takes its theme. Do not let yours be discontented and unhappy.\u201d She put her two little hands together and pressed them appealingly. Hurstwood gazed with slightly parted lips. Drouet was fidgeting with satisfaction. \u201cTo be my wife, yes,\u201d went on the actor in a manner which was weak by comparison, but which could not now spoil the tender atmosphere which Carrie had created and maintained."], "What does Carrie mention that shocks Hurstwood and prompts him to suggest that they go on a trip?": [" I expect to get it all back shortly, but just at present I am running close.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d answered Carrie. \u201cWhy, certainly, dear. Why didn\u2019t you tell me before?\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t necessary,\u201d said Hurstwood. For all her acquiescence, there was something about the way Hurstwood spoke which reminded Carrie of Drouet and his little deal which he was always about to put through. It was only the thought of a second, but it was a beginning. It was something new in her thinking of Hurstwood. Other things followed from time to time, little things of the same sort, which in their cumulative effect were eventually equal to a full revelation. Carrie was not dull by any means. Two persons cannot long dwell together without coming to an understanding of one another. The mental difficulties of an individual reveal themselves whether he voluntarily confesses them or not. Trouble gets in the air and contributes gloom, which speaks for itself. Hurstwood dressed as nicely as usual, but they were the same clothes he had in Canada. Carrie noticed that he did not install a large wardrobe, though his own was anything but large. She noticed, also, that he did not suggest many amusements, said nothing about the food, seemed concerned about his business. This was not the easy Hurstwood of Chicago\u2014not the liberal, opulent Hurstwood she had known. The change was too obvious to escape detection. In time she began to feel that a change had come about, and that she was not in his confidence.", " To-night he was particularly so, since his report to the company had been favourably commented upon, his new samples had been satisfactorily selected, and his trip marked out for the next six weeks. \u201cWhy, hello, Charlie, old man,\u201d said Hurstwood, as Drouet came in that evening about eight o\u2019clock. \u201cHow goes it?\u201d The room was crowded.

When did you get in?\u201d \u201cFriday,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cHad a fine trip.\u201d \u201cGlad of it,\u201d said Hurstwood, his black eyes lit with a warmth which half displaced the cold make-believe that usually dwelt in them. \u201cWhat are you going to take?\u201d he added, as the barkeeper, in snowy jacket and tie, leaned toward them from behind the bar. \u201cOld Pepper,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cA little of the same for me,\u201d put in Hurstwood. \u201cHow long are you in town this time?\u201d inquired Hurstwood. \u201cOnly until Wednesday.

We had quite a time there together.\u201d The barkeeper was setting out the glasses and bottle before them, and they now poured out the draught as they talked, Drouet filling his to within a third of full, as was considered proper, and Hurstwood taking the barest suggestion of whiskey and modifying it with seltzer.", " That night the pretty little flat seemed a commonplace thing. It was not what the rest of the world was enjoying. She saw the servant working at dinner with an indifferent eye. In her mind were running scenes of the play. Particularly she remembered one beautiful actress\u2014the sweetheart who had been wooed and won. The grace of this woman had won Carrie\u2019s heart. Her dresses had been all that art could suggest, her sufferings had been so real. The anguish which she had portrayed Carrie could feel. It was done as she was sure she could do it. There were places in which she could even do better. Hence she repeated the lines to herself. Oh, if she could only have such a part, how broad would be her life! She, too, could act appealingly. When Hurstwood came, Carrie was moody. She was sitting, rocking and thinking, and did not care to have her enticing imaginations broken in upon; so she said little or nothing. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Carrie?\u201d said Hurstwood after a time, noticing her quiet, almost moody state. \u201cNothing,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cI don\u2019t feel very well to-night.\u201d \u201cNot sick, are you?\u201d he asked, approaching very close. \u201cOh, no,\u201d she said, almost pettishly, \u201cI just don\u2019t feel very good.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s too bad,\u201d he said, stepping away and adjusting his vest after his slight bending over. \u201cI was thinking we might go to a show to-night.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to go,\u201d said Carrie, annoyed that her fine visions should have thus been broken into and driven out of her mind.", " \u201cDrouet is a good fellow,\u201d Hurstwood thought to himself as he went back into his office, \u201cbut he\u2019s no man for Carrie.\u201d The thought of the latter turned his mind into a most pleasant vein, and he wandered how he would get ahead of the drummer. When Drouet entered Carrie\u2019s presence, he caught her in his arms as usual, but she responded to his kiss with a tremour of opposition. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cI had a great trip.\u201d \u201cDid you? How did you come out with that La Crosse man you were telling me about?\u201d \u201cOh, fine; sold him a complete line. There was another fellow there, representing Burnstein, a regular hook-nosed sheeny, but he wasn\u2019t in it. I made him look like nothing at all.\u201d As he undid his collar and unfastened his studs, preparatory to washing his face and changing his clothes, he dilated upon his trip. Carrie could not help listening with amusement to his animated descriptions. \u201cI tell you,\u201d he said, \u201cI surprised the people at the office. I\u2019ve sold more goods this last quarter than any other man of our house on the road. I sold three thousand dollars\u2019 worth in La Crosse.\u201d He plunged his face in a basin of water, and puffed and blew as he rubbed his neck and ears with his hands, while Carrie gazed upon him with mingled thoughts of recollection and present judgment. He was still wiping his face, when he continued: \u201cI\u2019m going to strike for a raise in June. They can afford to pay it, as much business as I turn in."], "What do Hurstwood\u2019s responsibilities at the Elk lodge prompt him to ask Carrie to do?": [" Her inexperience conserved her own exuberant fancy, which ran riot with every straw of opportunity, making of it a golden divining rod whereby the treasure of life was to be discovered. \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d said Hurstwood, \u201cI ought to know some of the boys in the lodge. I\u2019m an Elk myself.\u201d \u201cOh, you mustn\u2019t let him know I told you.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s so,\u201d said the manager. \u201cI\u2019d like for you to be there, if you want to come, but I don\u2019t see how you can unless he asks you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d said Hurstwood affectionately. \u201cI can fix it so he won\u2019t know you told me. You leave it to me.\u201d This interest of the manager was a large thing in itself for the performance, for his standing among the Elks was something worth talking about. Already he was thinking of a box with some friends, and flowers for Carrie. He would make it a dress-suit affair and give the little girl a chance. Within a day or two, Drouet dropped into the Adams Street resort, and he was at once spied by Hurstwood. It was at five in the afternoon and the place was crowded with merchants, actors, managers, politicians, a goodly company of rotund, rosy figures, silk-hatted, starchy-bosomed, beringed and bescarfpinned to the queen\u2019s taste. John L. Sullivan, the pugilist, was at one end of the glittering bar, surrounded by a company of loudly dressed sports, who were holding a most animated conversation. Drouet came across the floor with a festive stride, a new pair of tan shoes squeaking audibly at his progress.", " He had not even thought to ask the time or place. Drouet was reminded of his promise a day or two later by the receipt of a letter announcing that the first rehearsal was set for the following Friday evening, and urging him to kindly forward the young lady\u2019s address at once, in order that the part might be delivered to her. \u201cNow, who the deuce do I know?\u201d asked the drummer reflectively, scratching his rosy ear. \u201cI don\u2019t know any one that knows anything about amateur theatricals.\u201d He went over in memory the names of a number of women he knew, and finally fixed on one, largely because of the convenient location of her home on the West Side, and promised himself that as he came out that evening he would see her. When, however, he started west on the car he forgot, and was only reminded of his delinquency by an item in the \u201cEvening News\u201d\u2014a small three-line affair under the head of Secret Society Notes\u2014which stated the Custer Lodge of the Order of Elks would give a theatrical performance in Avery Hall on the 16th, when \u201cUnder the Gaslight\u201d would be produced. \u201cGeorge!\u201d exclaimed Drouet, \u201cI forgot that.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d inquired Carrie. They were at their little table in the room which might have been used for a kitchen, where Carrie occasionally served a meal. To-night the fancy had caught her, and the little table was spread with a pleasing repast. \u201cWhy, my lodge entertainment. They\u2019re going to give a play, and they wanted me to get them some young lady to take a part.\u201d \u201cWhat is it they\u2019re going to play?\u201d \u201c\u2018Under the Gaslight.\u2019\u201d \u201cWhen?\u201d \u201cOn the 16th.\u201d \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you?\u201d asked Carrie.", " He might hunt her out at the show and hound her in that way. She did not wholly believe that he would, but he might. This, she knew, would be an embarrassing thing if he made himself conspicuous in any way. It troubled her greatly. Things were precipitated by the offer of a better part. One of the actresses playing the part of a modest sweetheart gave notice of leaving and Carrie was selected. \u201cHow much are you going to get?\u201d asked Miss Osborne, on hearing the good news. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask him,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cWell, find out. Goodness, you\u2019ll never get anything if you don\u2019t ask. Tell them you must have forty dollars, anyhow.\u201d \u201cOh, no,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cCertainly!\u201d exclaimed Lola. \u201cAsk \u2019em, anyway.\u201d Carrie succumbed to this prompting, waiting, however, until the manager gave her notice of what clothing she must have to fit the part. \u201cHow much do I get?\u201d she inquired. \u201cThirty-five dollars,\u201d he replied. Carrie was too much astonished and delighted to think of mentioning forty. She was nearly beside herself, and almost hugged Lola, who clung to her at the news. \u201cIt isn\u2019t as much as you ought to get,\u201d said the latter, \u201cespecially when you\u2019ve got to buy clothes.\u201d Carrie remembered this with a start. Where to get the money? She had none laid up for such an emergency. Rent day was drawing near. \u201cI\u2019ll not do it,\u201d she said, remembering her necessity. \u201cI don\u2019t use the flat. I\u2019m not going to give up my money this time.", " \u201cJust remember that I want you to succeed. We will make the performance worth while. You do that now.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d said Carrie, brimming with affection and enthusiasm. \u201cThat\u2019s the girl,\u201d said Hurstwood fondly. \u201cNow, remember,\u201d shaking an affectionate finger at her, \u201cyour best.\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d she answered, looking back. The whole earth was brimming sunshine that morning. She tripped along, the clear sky pouring liquid blue into her soul. Oh, blessed are the children of endeavour in this, that they try and are hopeful. And blessed also are they who, knowing, smile and approve. Chapter XVIII. JUST OVER THE BORDER: A HAIL AND FAREWELL By the evening of the 16th the subtle hand of Hurstwood had made itself apparent. He had given the word among his friends\u2014and they were many and influential\u2014that here was something which they ought to attend, and, as a consequence, the sale of tickets by Mr. Quincel, acting for the lodge, had been large. Small four-line notes had appeared in all of the daily newspapers. These he had arranged for by the aid of one of his newspaper friends on the \u201cTimes,\u201d Mr. Harry McGarren, the managing editor. \u201cSay, Harry,\u201d Hurstwood said to him one evening, as the latter stood at the bar drinking before wending his belated way homeward, \u201cyou can help the boys out, I guess.\u201d \u201cWhat is it?\u201d said McGarren, pleased to be consulted by the opulent manager. \u201cThe Custer Lodge is getting up a little entertainment for their own good, and they\u2019d like a little newspaper notice."], "What stage name does Hurstwood give Carrie to protect her reputation in the event that the play fails?": [" \u201cNo, I don\u2019t know of anything now.\u201d Carrie\u2019s countenance fell. \u201cYou want to get some New York experience,\u201d concluded the affable Mrs. Bermudez. \u201cWe\u2019ll take your name, though.\u201d Carrie stood looking while the lady retired to her office. \u201cWhat is your address?\u201d inquired a young lady behind the counter, taking up the curtailed conversation. \u201cMrs. George Wheeler,\u201d said Carrie, moving over to where she was writing. The woman wrote her address in full and then allowed her to depart at her leisure. She encountered a very similar experience in the office of Mr. Jenks, only he varied it by saying at the close: \u201cIf you could play at some local house, or had a programme with your name on it, I might do something.\u201d In the third place the individual asked: \u201cWhat sort of work do you want to do?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cWell, do you want to get in a comedy or on the vaudeville stage or in the chorus?\u201d \u201cOh, I\u2019d like to get a part in a play,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cWell,\u201d said the man, \u201cit\u2019ll cost you something to do that.\u201d \u201cHow much?\u201d said Carrie, who, ridiculous as it may seem, had not thought of this before. \u201cWell, that\u2019s for you to say,\u201d he answered shrewdly. Carrie looked at him curiously. She hardly knew how to continue the inquiry. \u201cCould you get me a part if I paid?\u201d \u201cIf we didn\u2019t you\u2019d get your money back.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d she said. The agent saw he was dealing with an inexperienced soul, and continued accordingly.", " I saw your name on the programme, but I didn\u2019t remember it until you came on the stage. Then it struck me all at once. Say, you could have knocked me down with a feather. That\u2019s the same name you used out there in Chicago, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d answered Carrie, mildly, overwhelmed by the man\u2019s assurance. \u201cI knew it was, the moment I saw you. Well, how have you been, anyhow?\u201d \u201cOh, very well,\u201d said Carrie, lingering in her dressing-room. She was rather dazed by the assault. \u201cHow have you been?\u201d \u201cMe? Oh, fine. I\u2019m here now.\u201d \u201cIs that so?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cYes. I\u2019ve been here for six months. I\u2019ve got charge of a branch here.\u201d \u201cHow nice!\u201d \u201cWell, when did you go on the stage, anyhow?\u201d inquired Drouet. \u201cAbout three years ago,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cYou don\u2019t say so! Well, sir, this is the first I\u2019ve heard of it. I knew you would, though. I always said you could act\u2014didn\u2019t I?\u201d Carrie smiled. \u201cYes, you did,\u201d she said. \u201cWell, you do look great,\u201d he said. \u201cI never saw anybody improve so. You\u2019re taller, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cMe? Oh, a little, maybe.\u201d He gazed at her dress, then at her hair, where a becoming hat was set jauntily, then into her eyes, which she took all occasion to avert. Evidently he expected to restore their old friendship at once and without modification. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, seeing her gather up her purse, handkerchief, and the like, preparatory to departing, \u201cI want you to come out to dinner with me; won\u2019t you?", " At the same time she longed to feel the delight of parading here as an equal. Ah, then she would be happy! Chapter XXXII. THE FEAST OF BELSHAZZAR: A SEER TO TRANSLATE Such feelings as were generated in Carrie by this walk put her in an exceedingly receptive mood for the pathos which followed in the play. The actor whom they had gone to see had achieved his popularity by presenting a mellow type of comedy, in which sufficient sorrow was introduced to lend contrast and relief to humour. For Carrie, as we well know, the stage had a great attraction. She had never forgotten her one histrionic achievement in Chicago. It dwelt in her mind and occupied her consciousness during many long afternoons in which her rocking-chair and her latest novel contributed the only pleasures of her state. Never could she witness a play without having her own ability vividly brought to consciousness. Some scenes made her long to be a part of them\u2014to give expression to the feelings which she, in the place of the character represented, would feel. Almost invariably she would carry the vivid imaginations away with her and brood over them the next day alone. She lived as much in these things as in the realities which made up her daily life. It was not often that she came to the play stirred to her heart\u2019s core by actualities. To-day a low song of longing had been set singing in her heart by the finery, the merriment, the beauty she had seen.", " \u201cWho are they?\u201d asked Hurstwood. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cThe name on the bell is Vance. Some one over there plays beautifully. I guess it must be she.\u201d \u201cWell, you never can tell what sort of people you\u2019re living next to in this town, can you?\u201d said Hurstwood, expressing the customary New York opinion about neighbours. \u201cJust think,\u201d said Carrie, \u201cI have been in this house with nine other families for over a year and I don\u2019t know a soul. These people have been here over a month and I haven\u2019t seen any one before this morning.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s just as well,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cYou never know who you\u2019re going to get in with. Some of these people are pretty bad company.\u201d \u201cI expect so,\u201d said Carrie, agreeably. The conversation turned to other things, and Carrie thought no more upon the subject until a day or two later, when, going out to market, she encountered Mrs. Vance coming in. The latter recognised her and nodded, for which Carrie returned a smile. This settled the probability of acquaintanceship. If there had been no faint recognition on this occasion, there would have been no future association. Carrie saw no more of Mrs. Vance for several weeks, but she heard her play through the thin walls which divided the front rooms of the flats, and was pleased by the merry selection of pieces and the brilliance of their rendition. She could play only moderately herself, and such variety as Mrs. Vance exercised bordered, for Carrie, upon the verge of great art."], "What does Drouet think of Hurstwood\u2019s offer to buy flowers for Carrie?": [" \u201cThat\u2019s the thing,\u201d he said. Carrie turned before the glass. She could not help feeling pleased as she looked at herself. A warm glow crept into her cheeks. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cNow pay for it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s nine dollars,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cThat\u2019s all right\u2014take it,\u201d said Drouet. She reached in her purse and took out one of the bills. The woman asked if she would wear the coat and went off. In a few minutes she was back and the purchase was closed. From Partridge\u2019s they went to a shoe store, where Carrie was fitted for shoes. Drouet stood by, and when he saw how nice they looked, said, \u201cWear them.\u201d Carrie shook her head, however. She was thinking of returning to the flat. He bought her a purse for one thing, and a pair of gloves for another, and let her buy the stockings. \u201cTo-morrow,\u201d he said, \u201cyou come down here and buy yourself a skirt.\u201d In all of Carrie\u2019s actions there was a touch of misgiving. The deeper she sank into the entanglement, the more she imagined that the thing hung upon the few remaining things she had not done. Since she had not done these, there was a way out. Drouet knew a place in Wabash Avenue where there were rooms. He showed Carrie the outside of these, and said: \u201cNow, you\u2019re my sister.\u201d He carried the arrangement off with an easy hand when it came to the selection, looking around, criticising, opining. \u201cHer trunk will be here in a day or so,\u201d he observed to the landlady, who was very pleased.", " \u201cWell, now, just how much money would it take to buy a half interest here?\u201d said Hurstwood, who saw seven hundred dollars as his limit. \u201cThree thousand,\u201d said the man. Hurstwood\u2019s jaw fell. \u201cCash?\u201d he said. \u201cCash.\u201d He tried to put on an air of deliberation, as one who might really buy; but his eyes showed gloom. He wound up by saying he would think it over, and came away. The man he had been talking to sensed his condition in a vague way. \u201cI don\u2019t think he wants to buy,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t talk right.\u201d The afternoon was as grey as lead and cold. It was blowing up a disagreeable winter wind. He visited a place far up on the east side, near Sixty-ninth Street, and it was five o\u2019clock, and growing dim, when he reached there. A portly German kept this place. \u201cHow about this ad of yours?\u201d asked Hurstwood, who rather objected to the looks of the place. \u201cOh, dat iss all over,\u201d said the German. \u201cI vill not sell now.\u201d \u201cOh, is that so?\u201d \u201cYes; dere is nothing to dat. It iss all over.\u201d \u201cVery well,\u201d said Hurstwood, turning around. The German paid no more attention to him, and it made him angry. \u201cThe crazy ass!\u201d he said to himself. \u201cWhat does he want to advertise for?\u201d Wholly depressed, he started for Thirteenth Street. The flat had only a light in the kitchen, where Carrie was working. He struck a match and, lighting the gas, sat down in the dining-room without even greeting her.", " He might hunt her out at the show and hound her in that way. She did not wholly believe that he would, but he might. This, she knew, would be an embarrassing thing if he made himself conspicuous in any way. It troubled her greatly. Things were precipitated by the offer of a better part. One of the actresses playing the part of a modest sweetheart gave notice of leaving and Carrie was selected. \u201cHow much are you going to get?\u201d asked Miss Osborne, on hearing the good news. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask him,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cWell, find out. Goodness, you\u2019ll never get anything if you don\u2019t ask. Tell them you must have forty dollars, anyhow.\u201d \u201cOh, no,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cCertainly!\u201d exclaimed Lola. \u201cAsk \u2019em, anyway.\u201d Carrie succumbed to this prompting, waiting, however, until the manager gave her notice of what clothing she must have to fit the part. \u201cHow much do I get?\u201d she inquired. \u201cThirty-five dollars,\u201d he replied. Carrie was too much astonished and delighted to think of mentioning forty. She was nearly beside herself, and almost hugged Lola, who clung to her at the news. \u201cIt isn\u2019t as much as you ought to get,\u201d said the latter, \u201cespecially when you\u2019ve got to buy clothes.\u201d Carrie remembered this with a start. Where to get the money? She had none laid up for such an emergency. Rent day was drawing near. \u201cI\u2019ll not do it,\u201d she said, remembering her necessity. \u201cI don\u2019t use the flat. I\u2019m not going to give up my money this time.", " \u201cIt\u2019s unfair to let such playing go without earning something,\u201d he said after a time, slipping his finger into the little coin pocket of his coat. \u201cLet\u2019s play for dimes.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d said Drouet, fishing for bills. Hurstwood was quicker. His fingers were full of new ten-cent pieces. \u201cHere we are,\u201d he said, supplying each one with a little stack. \u201cOh, this is gambling,\u201d smiled Carrie. \u201cIt\u2019s bad.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Drouet, \u201conly fun. If you never play for more than that, you will go to Heaven.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you moralise,\u201d said Hurstwood to Carrie gently, \u201cuntil you see what becomes of the money.\u201d Drouet smiled. \u201cIf your husband gets them, he\u2019ll tell you how bad it is.\u201d Drouet laughed loud. There was such an ingratiating tone about Hurstwood\u2019s voice, the insinuation was so perceptible that even Carrie got the humour of it. \u201cWhen do you leave?\u201d said Hurstwood to Drouet. \u201cOn Wednesday,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt\u2019s rather hard to have your husband running about like that, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Hurstwood, addressing Carrie. \u201cShe\u2019s going along with me this time,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cYou must both go with me to the theatre before you go.\u201d \u201cCertainly,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cEh, Carrie?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like it ever so much,\u201d she replied. Hurstwood did his best to see that Carrie won the money. He rejoiced in her success, kept counting her winnings, and finally gathered and put them in her extended hand. They spread a little lunch, at which he served the wine, and afterwards he used fine tact in going."], "Why do the tickets to Carrie\u2019s Elk lodge premiere sell so well?": [" In due time they reached the depot, and after helping her out he handed the man a five-dollar bill and hurried on. \u201cYou wait here,\u201d he said to Carrie, when they reached the waiting-room, \u201cwhile I get the tickets.\u201d \u201cHave I much time to catch that train for Detroit?\u201d he asked of the agent. \u201cFour minutes,\u201d said the latter. He paid for two tickets as circumspectly as possible. \u201cIs it far?\u201d said Carrie, as he hurried back. \u201cNot very,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must get right in.\u201d He pushed her before him at the gate, stood between her and the ticket man while the latter punched their tickets, so that she could not see, and then hurried after. There was a long line of express and passenger cars and one or two common day coaches. As the train had only recently been made up and few passengers were expected, there were only one or two brakemen waiting. They entered the rear day coach and sat down. Almost immediately, \u201cAll aboard,\u201d resounded faintly from the outside, and the train started. Carrie began to think it was a little bit curious\u2014this going to a depot\u2014but said nothing. The whole incident was so out of the natural that she did not attach too much weight to anything she imagined. \u201cHow have you been?\u201d asked Hurstwood gently, for he now breathed easier. \u201cVery well,\u201d said Carrie, who was so disturbed that she could not bring a proper attitude to bear in the matter. She was still nervous to reach Drouet and see what could be the matter.", " \u201cWell, sir,\u201d said Hurstwood, \u201cI was wondering what had become of you. I thought you had gone out of town again.\u201d Drouet laughed. \u201cIf you don\u2019t report more regularly we\u2019ll have to cut you off the list.\u201d \u201cCouldn\u2019t help it,\u201d said the drummer, \u201cI\u2019ve been busy.\u201d They strolled over toward the bar amid the noisy, shifting company of notables. The dressy manager was shaken by the hand three times in as many minutes. \u201cI hear your lodge is going to give a performance,\u201d observed Hurstwood, in the most offhand manner. \u201cYes, who told you?\u201d \u201cNo one,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cThey just sent me a couple of tickets, which I can have for two dollars. Is it going to be any good?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d replied the drummer. \u201cThey\u2019ve been trying to get me to get some woman to take a part.\u201d \u201cI wasn\u2019t intending to go,\u201d said the manager easily. \u201cI\u2019ll subscribe, of course. How are things over there?\u201d \u201cAll right. They\u2019re going to fit things up out of the proceeds.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said the manager, \u201cI hope they make a success of it. Have another?\u201d He did not intend to say any more. Now, if he should appear on the scene with a few friends, he could say that he had been urged to come along. Drouet had a desire to wipe out the possibility of confusion. \u201cI think the girl is going to take a part in it,\u201d he said abruptly, after thinking it over. \u201cYou don\u2019t say so! How did that happen?\u201d \u201cWell, they were short and wanted me to find them some one.", " \u201cJust remember that I want you to succeed. We will make the performance worth while. You do that now.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll try,\u201d said Carrie, brimming with affection and enthusiasm. \u201cThat\u2019s the girl,\u201d said Hurstwood fondly. \u201cNow, remember,\u201d shaking an affectionate finger at her, \u201cyour best.\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d she answered, looking back. The whole earth was brimming sunshine that morning. She tripped along, the clear sky pouring liquid blue into her soul. Oh, blessed are the children of endeavour in this, that they try and are hopeful. And blessed also are they who, knowing, smile and approve. Chapter XVIII. JUST OVER THE BORDER: A HAIL AND FAREWELL By the evening of the 16th the subtle hand of Hurstwood had made itself apparent. He had given the word among his friends\u2014and they were many and influential\u2014that here was something which they ought to attend, and, as a consequence, the sale of tickets by Mr. Quincel, acting for the lodge, had been large. Small four-line notes had appeared in all of the daily newspapers. These he had arranged for by the aid of one of his newspaper friends on the \u201cTimes,\u201d Mr. Harry McGarren, the managing editor. \u201cSay, Harry,\u201d Hurstwood said to him one evening, as the latter stood at the bar drinking before wending his belated way homeward, \u201cyou can help the boys out, I guess.\u201d \u201cWhat is it?\u201d said McGarren, pleased to be consulted by the opulent manager. \u201cThe Custer Lodge is getting up a little entertainment for their own good, and they\u2019d like a little newspaper notice.", " Her inexperience conserved her own exuberant fancy, which ran riot with every straw of opportunity, making of it a golden divining rod whereby the treasure of life was to be discovered. \u201cLet\u2019s see,\u201d said Hurstwood, \u201cI ought to know some of the boys in the lodge. I\u2019m an Elk myself.\u201d \u201cOh, you mustn\u2019t let him know I told you.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s so,\u201d said the manager. \u201cI\u2019d like for you to be there, if you want to come, but I don\u2019t see how you can unless he asks you.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d said Hurstwood affectionately. \u201cI can fix it so he won\u2019t know you told me. You leave it to me.\u201d This interest of the manager was a large thing in itself for the performance, for his standing among the Elks was something worth talking about. Already he was thinking of a box with some friends, and flowers for Carrie. He would make it a dress-suit affair and give the little girl a chance. Within a day or two, Drouet dropped into the Adams Street resort, and he was at once spied by Hurstwood. It was at five in the afternoon and the place was crowded with merchants, actors, managers, politicians, a goodly company of rotund, rosy figures, silk-hatted, starchy-bosomed, beringed and bescarfpinned to the queen\u2019s taste. John L. Sullivan, the pugilist, was at one end of the glittering bar, surrounded by a company of loudly dressed sports, who were holding a most animated conversation. Drouet came across the floor with a festive stride, a new pair of tan shoes squeaking audibly at his progress."], "How does Hurstwood feel when he returns home after Carrie\u2019s successful premiere?": [" \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said the director. \u201cThat fellow Bamberger strikes me as being a pretty poor shift for a lover.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s all we\u2019ve got,\u201d said Quincel, rolling up his eyes. \u201cHarrison went back on me at the last minute. Who else can we get?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said the director. \u201cI\u2019m afraid he\u2019ll never pick up.\u201d At this moment Bamberger was exclaiming, \u201cPearl, you are joking with me.\u201d \u201cLook at that now,\u201d said the director, whispering behind his hand. \u201cMy Lord! what can you do with a man who drawls out a sentence like that?\u201d \u201cDo the best you can,\u201d said Quincel consolingly. The rendition ran on in this wise until it came to where Carrie, as Laura, comes into the room to explain to Ray, who, after hearing Pearl\u2019s statement about her birth, had written the letter repudiating her, which, however, he did not deliver. Bamberger was just concluding the words of Ray, \u201cI must go before she returns. Her step! Too late,\u201d and was cramming the letter in his pocket, when she began sweetly with: \u201cRay!\u201d \u201cMiss\u2014Miss Courtland,\u201d Bamberger faltered weakly. Carrie looked at him a moment and forgot all about the company present. She began to feel the part, and summoned an indifferent smile to her lips, turning as the lines directed and going to a window, as if he were not present. She did it with a grace which was fascinating to look upon. \u201cWho is that woman?\u201d asked the director, watching Carrie in her little scene with Bamberger.", " That night the pretty little flat seemed a commonplace thing. It was not what the rest of the world was enjoying. She saw the servant working at dinner with an indifferent eye. In her mind were running scenes of the play. Particularly she remembered one beautiful actress\u2014the sweetheart who had been wooed and won. The grace of this woman had won Carrie\u2019s heart. Her dresses had been all that art could suggest, her sufferings had been so real. The anguish which she had portrayed Carrie could feel. It was done as she was sure she could do it. There were places in which she could even do better. Hence she repeated the lines to herself. Oh, if she could only have such a part, how broad would be her life! She, too, could act appealingly. When Hurstwood came, Carrie was moody. She was sitting, rocking and thinking, and did not care to have her enticing imaginations broken in upon; so she said little or nothing. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Carrie?\u201d said Hurstwood after a time, noticing her quiet, almost moody state. \u201cNothing,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cI don\u2019t feel very well to-night.\u201d \u201cNot sick, are you?\u201d he asked, approaching very close. \u201cOh, no,\u201d she said, almost pettishly, \u201cI just don\u2019t feel very good.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s too bad,\u201d he said, stepping away and adjusting his vest after his slight bending over. \u201cI was thinking we might go to a show to-night.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to go,\u201d said Carrie, annoyed that her fine visions should have thus been broken into and driven out of her mind.", " Cold weather coming on and no clothes. Tough. He would go around to Fitzgerald and Moy\u2019s and get a cigar. It made him feel light of foot as he thought about her. Carrie reached home in high good spirits, which she could scarcely conceal. The possession of the money involved a number of points which perplexed her seriously. How should she buy any clothes when Minnie knew that she had no money? She had no sooner entered the flat than this point was settled for her. It could not be done. She could think of no way of explaining. \u201cHow did you come out?\u201d asked Minnie, referring to the day. Carrie had none of the small deception which could feel one thing and say something directly opposed. She would prevaricate, but it would be in the line of her feelings at least. So instead of complaining when she felt so good, she said: \u201cI have the promise of something.\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d \u201cAt the Boston Store.\u201d \u201cIs it sure promised?\u201d questioned Minnie. \u201cWell, I\u2019m to find out to-morrow,\u201d returned Carrie disliking to draw out a lie any longer than was necessary. Minnie felt the atmosphere of good feeling which Carrie brought with her. She felt now was the time to express to Carrie the state of Hanson\u2019s feeling about her entire Chicago venture. \u201cIf you shouldn\u2019t get it\u2014\u201d she paused, troubled for an easy way. \u201cIf I don\u2019t get something pretty soon, I think I\u2019ll go home.\u201d Minnie saw her chance. \u201cSven thinks it might be best for the winter, anyhow.\u201d The situation flashed on Carrie at once.", " It was at that hour between afternoon and night when, for the idle, the wanderer, things are apt to take on a wistful aspect. The mind wanders forth on far journeys and returns with sheaves of withered and departed joys. Carrie sat at her window looking out. Drouet had been away since ten in the morning. She had amused herself with a walk, a book by Bertha M. Clay which Drouet had left there, though she did not wholly enjoy the latter, and by changing her dress for the evening. Now she sat looking out across the park as wistful and depressed as the nature which craves variety and life can be under such circumstances. As she contemplated her new state, the strain from the parlour below stole upward. With it her thoughts became coloured and enmeshed. She reverted to the things which were best and saddest within the small limit of her experience. She became for the moment a repentant. While she was in this mood Drouet came in, bringing with him an entirely different atmosphere. It was dusk and Carrie had neglected to light the lamp. The fire in the grate, too, had burned low. \u201cWhere are you, Cad?\u201d he said, using a pet name he had given her. \u201cHere,\u201d she answered. There was something delicate and lonely in her voice, but he could not hear it. He had not the poetry in him that would seek a woman out under such circumstances and console her for the tragedy of life. Instead, he struck a match and lighted the gas."], "Who is Drouet flirting with when he feels the first inklings of suspicion toward Hurstwood?": [" \u201cOh, no,\u201d she said remorsefully, her tone reflecting some of her own success and more of her helplessness, \u201cyou never will.\u201d \u201cWell, you wait a little while and see,\u201d he concluded. \u201cI\u2019ll marry you all right.\u201d Carrie looked at him and felt justified. She was looking for something which would calm her conscience, and here it was, a light, airy disregard of her claims upon his justice. He had faithfully promised to marry her, and this was the way he fulfilled his promise. \u201cSay,\u201d he said, after he had, as he thought, pleasantly disposed of the marriage question, \u201cI saw Hurstwood to-day, and he wants us to go to the theatre with him.\u201d Carrie started at the name, but recovered quickly enough to avoid notice. \u201cWhen?\u201d she asked, with assumed indifference. \u201cWednesday. We\u2019ll go, won\u2019t we?\u201d \u201cIf you think so,\u201d she answered, her manner being so enforcedly reserved as to almost excite suspicion. Drouet noticed something but he thought it was due to her feelings concerning their talk about marriage. \u201cHe called once, he said.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Carrie, \u201che was out here Sunday evening.\u201d \u201cWas he?\u201d said Drouet. \u201cI thought from what he said that he had called a week or so ago.\u201d \u201cSo he did,\u201d answered Carrie, who was wholly unaware of what conversation her lovers might have held. She was all at sea mentally, and fearful of some entanglement which might ensue from what she would answer. \u201cOh, then he called twice?\u201d said Drouet, the first shade of misunderstanding showing in his face.", " \u201cNot so soon,\u201d she answered. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019ll do,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ll write you, care of this West Side Post-office. Could you call next Tuesday?\u201d Carrie assented. The cab stopped one door out of the way according to his call. \u201cGood-night,\u201d he whispered, as the cab rolled away. Unfortunately for the smooth progression of this affair, Drouet returned. Hurstwood was sitting in his imposing little office the next afternoon when he saw Drouet enter. \u201cWhy, hello, Charles,\u201d he called affably; \u201cback again?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d smiled Drouet, approaching and looking in at the door. Hurstwood arose. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, looking the drummer over, \u201crosy as ever, eh?\u201d They began talking of the people they knew and things that had happened. \u201cBeen home yet?\u201d finally asked Hurstwood. \u201cNo, I am going, though,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cI remembered the little girl out there,\u201d said Hurstwood, \u201cand called once. Thought you wouldn\u2019t want her left quite alone.\u201d \u201cRight you are,\u201d agreed Drouet. \u201cHow is she?\u201d \u201cVery well,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cRather anxious about you though. You\u2019d better go out now and cheer her up.\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d said Drouet, smilingly. \u201cLike to have you both come down and go to the show with me Wednesday,\u201d concluded Hurstwood at parting. \u201cThanks, old man,\u201d said his friend, \u201cI\u2019ll see what the girl says and let you know.\u201d They separated in the most cordial manner. \u201cThere\u2019s a nice fellow,\u201d Drouet thought to himself as he turned the corner towards Madison.", " To-night he was particularly so, since his report to the company had been favourably commented upon, his new samples had been satisfactorily selected, and his trip marked out for the next six weeks. \u201cWhy, hello, Charlie, old man,\u201d said Hurstwood, as Drouet came in that evening about eight o\u2019clock. \u201cHow goes it?\u201d The room was crowded. Drouet shook hands, beaming good nature, and they strolled towards the bar. \u201cOh, all right.\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in six weeks. When did you get in?\u201d \u201cFriday,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cHad a fine trip.\u201d \u201cGlad of it,\u201d said Hurstwood, his black eyes lit with a warmth which half displaced the cold make-believe that usually dwelt in them. \u201cWhat are you going to take?\u201d he added, as the barkeeper, in snowy jacket and tie, leaned toward them from behind the bar. \u201cOld Pepper,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cA little of the same for me,\u201d put in Hurstwood. \u201cHow long are you in town this time?\u201d inquired Hurstwood. \u201cOnly until Wednesday. I\u2019m going up to St. Paul.\u201d \u201cGeorge Evans was in here Saturday and said he saw you in Milwaukee last week.\u201d \u201cYes, I saw George,\u201d returned Drouet. \u201cGreat old boy, isn\u2019t he? We had quite a time there together.\u201d The barkeeper was setting out the glasses and bottle before them, and they now poured out the draught as they talked, Drouet filling his to within a third of full, as was considered proper, and Hurstwood taking the barest suggestion of whiskey and modifying it with seltzer.", " They scarcely heard the few remaining words with which the scene concluded. They only saw their idol, moving about with appealing grace, continuing a power which to them was a revelation. Hurstwood resolved a thousands things, Drouet as well. They joined equally in the burst of applause which called Carrie out. Drouet pounded his hands until they ached. Then he jumped up again and started out. As he went, Carrie came out, and, seeing an immense basket of flowers being hurried down the aisle toward her, she waited. They were Hurstwood\u2019s. She looked toward the manager\u2019s box for a moment, caught his eye, and smiled. He could have leaped out of the box to enfold her. He forgot the need of circumspectness which his married state enforced. He almost forgot that he had with him in the box those who knew him. By the Lord, he would have that lovely girl if it took his all. He would act at once. This should be the end of Drouet, and don\u2019t you forget it. He would not wait another day. The drummer should not have her. He was so excited that he could not stay in the box. He went into the lobby, and then into the street, thinking. Drouet did not return. In a few minutes the last act was over, and he was crazy to have Carrie alone. He cursed the luck that could keep him smiling, bowing, shamming, when he wanted to tell her that he loved her, when he wanted to whisper to her alone. He groaned as he saw that his hopes were futile."], "On what condition does Carrie promise to leave Chicago with Hurstwood?": [" They went out, and at the corner the commonplace Irish individual was standing, eyeing him. Hurstwood could scarcely refrain from showing that he knew of this chap\u2019s presence. The insolence in the fellow\u2019s eye was galling. Still they passed, and he explained to Carrie concerning the city. Another restaurant was not long in showing itself, and here they entered. \u201cWhat a queer town this is,\u201d said Carrie, who marvelled at it solely because it was not like Chicago. \u201cIt isn\u2019t as lively as Chicago,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Carrie, whose feelings were already localised in the great Western city. \u201cWell, it isn\u2019t as interesting,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cWhat\u2019s here?\u201d asked Carrie, wondering at his choosing to visit this town. \u201cNothing much,\u201d returned Hurstwood. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a resort. There\u2019s some pretty scenery about here.\u201d Carrie listened, but with a feeling of unrest. There was much about her situation which destroyed the possibility of appreciation. \u201cWe won\u2019t stay here long,\u201d said Hurstwood, who was now really glad to note her dissatisfaction. \u201cYou pick out your clothes as soon as breakfast is over and we\u2019ll run down to New York soon. You\u2019ll like that. It\u2019s a lot more like a city than any place outside Chicago.\u201d He was really planning to slip out and away. He would see what these detectives would do\u2014what move his employers at Chicago would make\u2014then he would slip away\u2014down to New York, where it was easy to hide.", " Hurstwood recognised Cargill, the owner of the large stables in Chicago of the same name, whom he had last seen at Avery Hall, the night Carrie appeared there. The remembrance of how this individual brought up his wife to shake hands on that occasion was also on the instant clear. Hurstwood was greatly abashed. His eyes expressed the difficulty he felt. \u201cWhy, it\u2019s Hurstwood!\u201d said Cargill, remembering now, and sorry that he had not recognised him quickly enough in the beginning to have avoided this meeting. \u201cYes,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cHow are you?\u201d \u201cVery well,\u201d said Cargill, troubled for something to talk about. \u201cStopping here?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Hurstwood, \u201cjust keeping an appointment.\u201d \u201cI knew you had left Chicago. I was wondering what had become of you.\u201d \u201cOh, I\u2019m here now,\u201d answered Hurstwood, anxious to get away. \u201cDoing well, I suppose?\u201d \u201cExcellent.\u201d \u201cGlad to hear it.\u201d They looked at one another, rather embarrassed. \u201cWell, I have an engagement with a friend upstairs. I\u2019ll leave you. So long.\u201d Hurstwood nodded his head. \u201cDamn it all,\u201d he murmured, turning toward the door. \u201cI knew that would happen.\u201d He walked several blocks up the street. His watch only registered 1.30. He tried to think of some place to go or something to do. The day was so bad he wanted only to be inside. Finally his feet began to feel wet and cold, and he boarded a car. This took him to Fifty-ninth Street, which was as good as anywhere else.", " She could not realise that she was drifting, until he secured her address. Now she felt that she had yielded something\u2014he, that he had gained a victory. Already they felt that they were somehow associated. Already he took control in directing the conversation. His words were easy. Her manner was relaxed. They were nearing Chicago. Signs were everywhere numerous. Trains flashed by them. Across wide stretches of flat, open prairie they could see lines of telegraph poles stalking across the fields toward the great city. Far away were indications of suburban towns, some big smokestacks towering high in the air. Frequently there were two-story frame houses standing out in the open fields, without fence or trees, lone outposts of the approaching army of homes. To the child, the genius with imagination, or the wholly untravelled, the approach to a great city for the first time is a wonderful thing. Particularly if it be evening\u2014that mystic period between the glare and gloom of the world when life is changing from one sphere or condition to another. Ah, the promise of the night. What does it not hold for the weary! What old illusion of hope is not here forever repeated! Says the soul of the toiler to itself, \u201cI shall soon be free. I shall be in the ways and the hosts of the merry. The streets, the lamps, the lighted chamber set for dining, are for me. The theatre, the halls, the parties, the ways of rest and the paths of song\u2014these are mine in the night.\u201d Though all humanity be still enclosed in the shops, the thrill runs abroad.", " \u201cI mustn\u2019t take the money,\u201d said Carrie, after they were settled in a cosey corner, and Drouet had ordered the lunch. \u201cI can\u2019t wear those things out there. They\u2014they wouldn\u2019t know where I got them.\u201d \u201cWhat do you want to do,\u201d he smiled, \u201cgo without them?\u201d \u201cI think I\u2019ll go home,\u201d she said, wearily. \u201cOh, come,\u201d he said, \u201cyou\u2019ve been thinking it over too long. I\u2019ll tell you what you do. You say you can\u2019t wear them out there. Why don\u2019t you rent a furnished room and leave them in that for a week?\u201d Carrie shook her head. Like all women, she was there to object and be convinced. It was for him to brush the doubts away and clear the path if he could. \u201cWhy are you going home?\u201d he asked. \u201cOh, I can\u2019t get anything here.\u201d \u201cThey won\u2019t keep you?\u201d he remarked, intuitively. \u201cThey can\u2019t,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what you do,\u201d he said. \u201cYou come with me. I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d Carrie heard this passively. The peculiar state which she was in made it sound like the welcome breath of an open door. Drouet seemed of her own spirit and pleasing. He was clean, handsome, well-dressed, and sympathetic. His voice was the voice of a friend. \u201cWhat can you do back at Columbia City?\u201d he went on, rousing by the words in Carrie\u2019s mind a picture of the dull world she had left. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anything down there. Chicago\u2019s the place. You can get a nice room here and some clothes, and then you can do something.\u201d Carrie looked out through the window into the busy street."], "Whose comments incite Julia\u2019s suspicions of Hurstwood?": [" She wondered how he could think to carry himself so in her presence after the cynicism, indifference, and neglect he had heretofore manifested and would continue to manifest so long as she would endure it. She thought how she should like to tell him\u2014what stress and emphasis she would lend her assertions, how she should drive over this whole affair until satisfaction should be rendered her. Indeed, the shining sword of her wrath was but weakly suspended by a thread of thought. In the meanwhile Hurstwood encountered a humorous item concerning a stranger who had arrived in the city and became entangled with a bunco-steerer. It amused him immensely, and at last he stirred and chuckled to himself. He wished that he might enlist his wife\u2019s attention and read it to her. \u201cHa, ha,\u201d he exclaimed softly, as if to himself, \u201cthat\u2019s funny.\u201d Mrs. Hurstwood kept on arranging her hair, not so much as deigning a glance. He stirred again and went on to another subject. At last he felt as if his good-humour must find some outlet. Julia was probably still out of humour over that affair of this morning, but that could easily be straightened. As a matter of fact, she was in the wrong, but he didn\u2019t care. She could go to Waukesha right away if she wanted to. The sooner the better. He would tell her that as soon as he got a chance, and the whole thing would blow over. \u201cDid you notice,\u201d he said, at last, breaking forth concerning another item which he had found, \u201cthat they have entered suit to compel the Illinois Central to get off the lake front, Julia?\u201d he asked.", " \u201cYes, out near Hoyne Avenue. You were with your husband.\u201d \u201cI guess you\u2019re mistaken,\u201d she answered. Then, remembering her husband\u2019s part in the affair, she immediately fell a prey to a host of young suspicions, of which, however, she gave no sign. \u201cI know I saw your husband,\u201d he went on. \u201cI wasn\u2019t so sure about you. Perhaps it was your daughter.\u201d \u201cPerhaps it was,\u201d said Mrs. Hurstwood, knowing full well that such was not the case, as Jessica had been her companion for weeks. She had recovered herself sufficiently to wish to know more of the details. \u201cWas it in the afternoon?\u201d she asked, artfully, assuming an air of acquaintanceship with the matter. \u201cYes, about two or three.\u201d \u201cIt must have been Jessica,\u201d said Mrs. Hurstwood, not wishing to seem to attach any importance to the incident. The physician had a thought or two of his own, but dismissed the matter as worthy of no further discussion on his part at least. Mrs. Hurstwood gave this bit of information considerable thought during the next few hours, and even days. She took it for granted that the doctor had really seen her husband, and that he had been riding, most likely, with some other woman, after announcing himself as _busy_ to her. As a consequence, she recalled, with rising feeling, how often he had refused to go to places with her, to share in little visits, or, indeed, take part in any of the social amenities which furnished the diversion of her existence.", " He was not a man who traveled much, but when he did, he had been accustomed to take her along. On one occasion recently a local aldermanic junket had been arranged to visit Philadelphia\u2014a junket that was to last ten days. Hurstwood had been invited. \u201cNobody knows us down there,\u201d said one, a gentleman whose face was a slight improvement over gross ignorance and sensuality. He always wore a silk hat of most imposing proportions. \u201cWe can have a good time.\u201d His left eye moved with just the semblance of a wink. \u201cYou want to come along, George.\u201d The next day Hurstwood announced his intention to his wife. \u201cI\u2019m going away, Julia,\u201d he said, \u201cfor a few days.\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d she asked, looking up. \u201cTo Philadelphia, on business.\u201d She looked at him consciously, expecting something else. \u201cI\u2019ll have to leave you behind this time.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d she replied, but he could see that she was thinking that it was a curious thing. Before he went she asked him a few more questions, and that irritated him. He began to feel that she was a disagreeable attachment. On this trip he enjoyed himself thoroughly, and when it was over he was sorry to get back. He was not willingly a prevaricator, and hated thoroughly to make explanations concerning it. The whole incident was glossed over with general remarks, but Mrs. Hurstwood gave the subject considerable thought. She drove out more, dressed better, and attended theatres freely to make up for it.", " He was tired. It was blowing up grey again. Across the way, through Madison Square Park, stood the great hotels, looking down upon a busy scene. He decided to go over to the lobby of one and sit a while. It was warm in there and bright. He had seen no one he knew at the Broadway Central. In all likelihood he would encounter no one here. Finding a seat on one of the red plush divans close to the great windows which look out on Broadway\u2019s busy rout, he sat musing. His state did not seem so bad in here. Sitting still and looking out, he could take some slight consolation in the few hundred dollars he had in his purse. He could forget, in a measure, the weariness of the street and his tiresome searches. Still, it was only escape from a severe to a less severe state. He was still gloomy and disheartened. There, minutes seemed to go very slowly. An hour was a long, long time in passing. It was filled for him with observations and mental comments concerning the actual guests of the hotel, who passed in and out, and those more prosperous pedestrians whose good fortune showed in their clothes and spirits as they passed along Broadway, outside. It was nearly the first time since he had arrived in the city that his leisure afforded him ample opportunity to contemplate this spectacle. Now, being, perforce, idle himself, he wondered at the activity of others. How gay were the youths he saw, how pretty the women."], "What does Hurstwood remember regretfully as Julia confronts him over his affair with Carrie?": [" She wondered how he could think to carry himself so in her presence after the cynicism, indifference, and neglect he had heretofore manifested and would continue to manifest so long as she would endure it.

They talked some few minutes on general topics. \u201cSay,\u201d said Drouet, as if struck by a sudden idea, \u201cI want you to come out some evening.\u201d \u201cOut where?\u201d inquired Hurstwood. \u201cOut to my house, of course,\u201d said Drouet, smiling. Hurstwood looked up quizzically, the least suggestion of a smile hovering about his lips. He studied the face of Drouet in his wise way, and then with the demeanour of a gentleman, said: \u201cCertainly; glad to.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll have a nice game of euchre.\u201d \u201cMay I bring a nice little bottle of Sec?\u201d asked Hurstwood. \u201cCertainly,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cI\u2019ll introduce you.\u201d Chapter IX. CONVENTION\u2019S OWN TINDER-BOX: THE EYE THAT IS GREEN Hurstwood\u2019s residence on the North Side, near Lincoln Park, was a brick building of a very popular type then, a three-story affair with the first floor sunk a very little below the level of the street. It had a large bay window bulging out from the second floor, and was graced in front by a small grassy plot, twenty-five feet wide and ten feet deep. There was also a small rear yard, walled in by the fences of the neighbours and holding a stable where he kept his horse and trap. The ten rooms of the house were occupied by himself, his wife Julia, and his son and daughter, George, Jr., and Jessica. There were besides these a maid-servant, represented from time to time by girls of various extraction, for Mrs. Hurstwood was not always easy to please.", " Now the hall-boy pounded on the door and he released his hold upon her regretfully. \u201cYou get ready now, will you,\u201d he said, \u201cat once?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d she answered. \u201cI\u2019ll be back in three-quarters of an hour.\u201d Carrie, flushed and excited, moved away as he admitted the boy. Below stairs, he halted in the lobby to look for a barber shop. For the moment, he was in fine feather. His recent victory over Carrie seemed to atone for much he had endured during the last few days. Life seemed worth fighting for. This eastward flight from all things customary and attached seemed as if it might have happiness in store. The storm showed a rainbow at the end of which might be a pot of gold. He was about to cross to a little red-and-white striped bar which was fastened up beside a door when a voice greeted him familiarly. Instantly his heart sank. \u201cWhy, hello, George, old man!\u201d said the voice. \u201cWhat are you doing down here?\u201d Hurstwood was already confronted, and recognised his friend Kenny, the stock-broker. \u201cJust attending to a little private matter,\u201d he answered, his mind working like a key-board of a telephone station. This man evidently did not know\u2014he had not read the papers. \u201cWell, it seems strange to see you way up here,\u201d said Mr. Kenny genially. \u201cStopping here?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Hurstwood uneasily, thinking of his handwriting on the register. \u201cGoing to be in town long?\u201d \u201cNo, only a day or so.\u201d \u201cIs that so?", " You know what I mean\u2014a squib or two saying that it\u2019s going to take place.\u201d \u201cCertainly,\u201d said McGarren, \u201cI can fix that for you, George.\u201d At the same time Hurstwood kept himself wholly in the background. The members of Custer Lodge could scarcely understand why their little affair was taking so well. Mr. Harry Quincel was looked upon as quite a star for this sort of work. By the time the 16th had arrived Hurstwood\u2019s friends had rallied like Romans to a senator\u2019s call. A well-dressed, good-natured, flatteringly-inclined audience was assured from the moment he thought of assisting Carrie. That little student had mastered her part to her own satisfaction, much as she trembled for her fate when she should once face the gathered throng, behind the glare of the footlights. She tried to console herself with the thought that a score of other persons, men and women, were equally tremulous concerning the outcome of their efforts, but she could not disassociate the general danger from her own individual liability. She feared that she would forget her lines, that she might be unable to master the feeling which she now felt concerning her own movements in the play. At times she wished that she had never gone into the affair; at others, she trembled lest she should be paralysed with fear and stand white and gasping, not knowing what to say and spoiling the entire performance. In the matter of the company, Mr. Bamberger had disappeared."], "How does Drouet conclude his confrontation of Carrie over her affair?": [" \u201cI\u2019m going to have a business of my own pretty soon,\u201d he observed in one place. \u201cI can get backing for two hundred thousand dollars.\u201d Carrie listened most good-naturedly. \u201cSay,\u201d he said, suddenly; \u201cwhere is Hurstwood now?\u201d Carrie flushed a little. \u201cHe\u2019s here in New York, I guess,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him for some time.\u201d Drouet mused for a moment. He had not been sure until now that the ex-manager was not an influential figure in the background. He imagined not; but this assurance relieved him. It must be that Carrie had got rid of him\u2014as well she ought, he thought. \u201cA man always makes a mistake when he does anything like that,\u201d he observed. \u201cLike what?\u201d said Carrie, unwitting of what was coming. \u201cOh, you know,\u201d and Drouet waved her intelligence, as it were, with his hand. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d she answered. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cWhy that affair in Chicago\u2014the time he left.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what you are talking about,\u201d said Carrie. Could it be he would refer so rudely to Hurstwood\u2019s flight with her? \u201cOho!\u201d said Drouet, incredulously. \u201cYou knew he took ten thousand dollars with him when he left, didn\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cWhat!\u201d said Carrie. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean to say he stole money, do you?\u201d \u201cWhy,\u201d said Drouet, puzzled at her tone, \u201cyou knew that, didn\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cWhy, no,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cOf course I didn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWell, that\u2019s funny,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cHe did, you know. It was in all the papers.\u201d \u201cHow much did you say he took?\u201d said Carrie.", " \u201cNot so soon,\u201d she answered. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019ll do,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ll write you, care of this West Side Post-office. Could you call next Tuesday?\u201d Carrie assented. The cab stopped one door out of the way according to his call. \u201cGood-night,\u201d he whispered, as the cab rolled away. Unfortunately for the smooth progression of this affair, Drouet returned. Hurstwood was sitting in his imposing little office the next afternoon when he saw Drouet enter. \u201cWhy, hello, Charles,\u201d he called affably; \u201cback again?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d smiled Drouet, approaching and looking in at the door. Hurstwood arose. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, looking the drummer over, \u201crosy as ever, eh?\u201d They began talking of the people they knew and things that had happened. \u201cBeen home yet?\u201d finally asked Hurstwood. \u201cNo, I am going, though,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cI remembered the little girl out there,\u201d said Hurstwood, \u201cand called once. Thought you wouldn\u2019t want her left quite alone.\u201d \u201cRight you are,\u201d agreed Drouet. \u201cHow is she?\u201d \u201cVery well,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cRather anxious about you though. You\u2019d better go out now and cheer her up.\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d said Drouet, smilingly. \u201cLike to have you both come down and go to the show with me Wednesday,\u201d concluded Hurstwood at parting. \u201cThanks, old man,\u201d said his friend, \u201cI\u2019ll see what the girl says and let you know.\u201d They separated in the most cordial manner. \u201cThere\u2019s a nice fellow,\u201d Drouet thought to himself as he turned the corner towards Madison.", " \u201cIt\u2019s unfair to let such playing go without earning something,\u201d he said after a time, slipping his finger into the little coin pocket of his coat. \u201cLet\u2019s play for dimes.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d said Drouet, fishing for bills. Hurstwood was quicker. His fingers were full of new ten-cent pieces. \u201cHere we are,\u201d he said, supplying each one with a little stack. \u201cOh, this is gambling,\u201d smiled Carrie. \u201cIt\u2019s bad.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Drouet, \u201conly fun. If you never play for more than that, you will go to Heaven.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you moralise,\u201d said Hurstwood to Carrie gently, \u201cuntil you see what becomes of the money.\u201d Drouet smiled. \u201cIf your husband gets them, he\u2019ll tell you how bad it is.\u201d Drouet laughed loud. There was such an ingratiating tone about Hurstwood\u2019s voice, the insinuation was so perceptible that even Carrie got the humour of it. \u201cWhen do you leave?\u201d said Hurstwood to Drouet. \u201cOn Wednesday,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt\u2019s rather hard to have your husband running about like that, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said Hurstwood, addressing Carrie. \u201cShe\u2019s going along with me this time,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cYou must both go with me to the theatre before you go.\u201d \u201cCertainly,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cEh, Carrie?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d like it ever so much,\u201d she replied. Hurstwood did his best to see that Carrie won the money. He rejoiced in her success, kept counting her winnings, and finally gathered and put them in her extended hand. They spread a little lunch, at which he served the wine, and afterwards he used fine tact in going.", " I told Carrie, and she seems to want to try.\u201d \u201cGood for her,\u201d said the manager. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a real nice affair. Do her good, too. Has she ever had any experience?\u201d \u201cNot a bit.\u201d \u201cOh, well, it isn\u2019t anything very serious.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s clever, though,\u201d said Drouet, casting off any imputation against Carrie\u2019s ability. \u201cShe picks up her part quick enough.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t say so!\u201d said the manager. \u201cYes, sir; she surprised me the other night. By George, if she didn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWe must give her a nice little send-off,\u201d said the manager. \u201cI\u2019ll look after the flowers.\u201d Drouet smiled at his good-nature. \u201cAfter the show you must come with me and we\u2019ll have a little supper.\u201d \u201cI think she\u2019ll do all right,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cI want to see her. She\u2019s got to do all right. We\u2019ll make her,\u201d and the manager gave one of his quick, steely half-smiles, which was a compound of good-nature and shrewdness. Carrie, meanwhile, attended the first rehearsal. At this performance Mr. Quincel presided, aided by Mr. Millice, a young man who had some qualifications of past experience, which were not exactly understood by any one. He was so experienced and so business-like, however, that he came very near being rude\u2014failing to remember, as he did, that the individuals he was trying to instruct were volunteer players and not salaried underlings. \u201cNow, Miss Madenda,\u201d he said, addressing Carrie, who stood in one part uncertain as to what move to make, \u201cyou don\u2019t want to stand like that."], "Following his confrontation with Julia, who does Hurstwood encounter when he looks for Carrie at their usual meeting place?": [" So she was thoroughly surprised to encounter her in Fourteenth Street, where she had gone shopping. Carrie was there for the same purpose. \u201cWhy, Mrs. Wheeler,\u201d said Mrs. Vance, looking Carrie over in a glance, \u201cwhere have you been? Why haven\u2019t you been to see me? I\u2019ve been wondering all this time what had become of you. Really, I\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019m so glad to see you,\u201d said Carrie, pleased and yet nonplussed. Of all times, this was the worst to encounter Mrs. Vance. \u201cWhy, I\u2019m living down town here. I\u2019ve been intending to come and see you. Where are you living now?\u201d \u201cIn Fifty-eighth Street,\u201d said Mrs. Vance, \u201cjust off Seventh Avenue\u2014218. Why don\u2019t you come and see me?\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cReally, I\u2019ve been wanting to come. I know I ought to. It\u2019s a shame. But you know\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s your number?\u201d said Mrs. Vance. \u201cThirteenth Street,\u201d said Carrie, reluctantly. \u201c112 West.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said Mrs. Vance, \u201cthat\u2019s right near here, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cYou must come down and see me some time.\u201d \u201cWell, you\u2019re a fine one,\u201d said Mrs. Vance, laughing, the while noting that Carrie\u2019s appearance had modified somewhat. \u201cThe address, too,\u201d she added to herself. \u201cThey must be hard up.\u201d Still she liked Carrie well enough to take her in tow. \u201cCome with me in here a minute,\u201d she exclaimed, turning into a store. When Carrie returned home, there was Hurstwood, reading as usual. He seemed to take his condition with the utmost nonchalance.", " He was evidently secretive and kept his own counsel. She found herself asking him questions about little things. This is a disagreeable state to a woman. Great love makes it seem reasonable, sometimes plausible, but never satisfactory. Where great love is not, a more definite and less satisfactory conclusion is reached. As for Hurstwood, he was making a great fight against the difficulties of a changed condition. He was too shrewd not to realise the tremendous mistake he had made, and appreciate that he had done well in getting where he was, and yet he could not help contrasting his present state with his former, hour after hour, and day after day. Besides, he had the disagreeable fear of meeting old-time friends, ever since one such encounter which he made shortly after his arrival in the city. It was in Broadway that he saw a man approaching him whom he knew. There was no time for simulating non-recognition. The exchange of glances had been too sharp, the knowledge of each other too apparent. So the friend, a buyer for one of the Chicago wholesale houses, felt, perforce, the necessity of stopping. \u201cHow are you?\u201d he said, extending his hand with an evident mixture of feeling and a lack of plausible interest. \u201cVery well,\u201d said Hurstwood, equally embarrassed. \u201cHow is it with you?\u201d \u201cAll right; I\u2019m down here doing a little buying. Are you located here now?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Hurstwood, \u201cI have a place down in Warren Street.\u201d \u201cIs that so?\u201d said the friend.", " She wondered how he could think to carry himself so in her presence after the cynicism, indifference, and neglect he had heretofore manifested and would continue to manifest so long as she would endure it. She thought how she should like to tell him\u2014what stress and emphasis she would lend her assertions, how she should drive over this whole affair until satisfaction should be rendered her. Indeed, the shining sword of her wrath was but weakly suspended by a thread of thought. In the meanwhile Hurstwood encountered a humorous item concerning a stranger who had arrived in the city and became entangled with a bunco-steerer. It amused him immensely, and at last he stirred and chuckled to himself. He wished that he might enlist his wife\u2019s attention and read it to her. \u201cHa, ha,\u201d he exclaimed softly, as if to himself, \u201cthat\u2019s funny.\u201d Mrs. Hurstwood kept on arranging her hair, not so much as deigning a glance. He stirred again and went on to another subject. At last he felt as if his good-humour must find some outlet. Julia was probably still out of humour over that affair of this morning, but that could easily be straightened. As a matter of fact, she was in the wrong, but he didn\u2019t care. She could go to Waukesha right away if she wanted to. The sooner the better. He would tell her that as soon as he got a chance, and the whole thing would blow over. \u201cDid you notice,\u201d he said, at last, breaking forth concerning another item which he had found, \u201cthat they have entered suit to compel the Illinois Central to get off the lake front, Julia?\u201d he asked.", " \u201cI think,\u201d he said, as he spruced around their chambers the next morning, preparatory to going down town, \u201cthat I\u2019ll straighten out that little deal of mine this month and then we\u2019ll get married. I was talking with Mosher about that yesterday.\u201d \u201cNo, you won\u2019t,\u201d said Carrie, who was coming to feel a certain faint power to jest with the drummer. \u201cYes, I will,\u201d he exclaimed, more feelingly than usual, adding, with the tone of one who pleads, \u201cDon\u2019t you believe what I\u2019ve told you?\u201d Carrie laughed a little. \u201cOf course I do,\u201d she answered. Drouet\u2019s assurance now misgave him. Shallow as was his mental observation, there was that in the things which had happened which made his little power of analysis useless. Carrie was still with him, but not helpless and pleading. There was a lilt in her voice which was new. She did not study him with eyes expressive of dependence. The drummer was feeling the shadow of something which was coming. It coloured his feelings and made him develop those little attentions and say those little words which were mere forefendations against danger. Shortly afterward he departed, and Carrie prepared for her meeting with Hurstwood. She hurried at her toilet, which was soon made, and hastened down the stairs. At the corner she passed Drouet, but they did not see each other. The drummer had forgotten some bills which he wished to turn into his house. He hastened up the stairs and burst into the room, but found only the chambermaid, who was cleaning up."], "What does Hurstwood assume when Carrie fails to show up at their meeting place or send him a message?": [" No further opportunity for conversation occurred, but the next evening, when they were getting ready for the stage, this girl appeared anew at her side. \u201cThey say this show is going on the road next month.\u201d \u201cIs it?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cYes; do you think you\u2019ll go?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know; I guess so, if they\u2019ll take me.\u201d \u201cOh, they\u2019ll take you. I wouldn\u2019t go. They won\u2019t give you any more, and it will cost you everything you make to live. I never leave New York. There are too many shows going on here.\u201d \u201cCan you always get in another show?\u201d \u201cI always have. There\u2019s one going on up at the Broadway this month. I\u2019m going to try and get in that if this one really goes.\u201d Carrie heard this with aroused intelligence. Evidently it wasn\u2019t so very difficult to get on. Maybe she also could get a place if this show went away. \u201cDo they all pay about the same?\u201d she asked. \u201cYes. Sometimes you get a little more. This show doesn\u2019t pay very much.\u201d \u201cI get twelve,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cDo you?\u201d said the girl. \u201cThey pay me fifteen, and you do more work than I do. I wouldn\u2019t stand it if I were you. They\u2019re just giving you less because they think you don\u2019t know. You ought to be making fifteen.\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019m not,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cWell, you\u2019ll get more at the next place if you want it,\u201d went on the girl, who admired Carrie very much. \u201cYou do fine, and the manager knows it.\u201d To say the truth, Carrie did unconsciously move about with an air pleasing and somewhat distinctive.", " To stare seemed the proper and natural thing. Carrie found herself stared at and ogled. Men in flawless top-coats, high hats, and silver-headed walking sticks elbowed near and looked too often into conscious eyes. Ladies rustled by in dresses of stiff cloth, shedding affected smiles and perfume. Carrie noticed among them the sprinkling of goodness and the heavy percentage of vice. The rouged and powdered cheeks and lips, the scented hair, the large, misty, and languorous eye, were common enough. With a start she awoke to find that she was in fashion\u2019s crowd, on parade in a show place\u2014and such a show place! Jewellers\u2019 windows gleamed along the path with remarkable frequency. Florist shops, furriers, haberdashers, confectioners\u2014all followed in rapid succession. The street was full of coaches. Pompous doormen in immense coats, shiny brass belts and buttons, waited in front of expensive salesrooms. Coachmen in tan boots, white tights, and blue jackets waited obsequiously for the mistresses of carriages who were shopping inside. The whole street bore the flavour of riches and show, and Carrie felt that she was not of it. She could not, for the life of her, assume the attitude and smartness of Mrs. Vance, who, in her beauty, was all assurance. She could only imagine that it must be evident to many that she was the less handsomely dressed of the two. It cut her to the quick, and she resolved that she would not come here again until she looked better.", " In the second year, the business which Hurstwood managed did increase somewhat. He got out of it regularly the $150 per month which he had anticipated. Unfortunately, by this time Carrie had reached certain conclusions, and he had scraped up a few acquaintances. Being of a passive and receptive rather than an active and aggressive nature, Carrie accepted the situation. Her state seemed satisfactory enough. Once in a while they would go to a theatre together, occasionally in season to the beaches and different points about the city, but they picked up no acquaintances. Hurstwood naturally abandoned his show of fine manners with her and modified his attitude to one of easy familiarity. There were no misunderstandings, no apparent differences of opinion. In fact, without money or visiting friends, he led a life which could neither arouse jealousy nor comment. Carrie rather sympathised with his efforts and thought nothing upon her lack of entertainment such as she had enjoyed in Chicago. New York as a corporate entity and her flat temporarily seemed sufficient. However, as Hurstwood\u2019s business increased, he, as stated, began to pick up acquaintances. He also began to allow himself more clothes. He convinced himself that his home life was very precious to him, but allowed that he could occasionally stay away from dinner. The first time he did this he sent a message saying that he would be detained.", " \u201cYou want to send her her part?\u201d asked the drummer. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019ll take it. I\u2019m going right by her house in the morning. \u201cWhat did you say her address was? We only want it in case we have any information to send her.\u201d \u201cTwenty-nine Ogden Place.\u201d \u201cAnd her name?\u201d \u201cCarrie Madenda,\u201d said the drummer, firing at random. The lodge members knew him to be single. \u201cThat sounds like somebody that can act, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d said Quincel. \u201cYes, it does.\u201d He took the part home to Carrie and handed it to her with the manner of one who does a favour. \u201cHe says that\u2019s the best part. Do you think you can do it?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know until I look it over. You know I\u2019m afraid, now that I\u2019ve said I would.\u201d \u201cOh, go on. What have you got to be afraid of? It\u2019s a cheap company. The rest of them aren\u2019t as good as you are.\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019ll see,\u201d said Carrie, pleased to have the part, for all her misgivings. He sidled around, dressing and fidgeting before he arranged to make his next remark. \u201cThey were getting ready to print the programmes,\u201d he said, \u201cand I gave them the name of Carrie Madenda. Was that all right?\u201d \u201cYes, I guess so,\u201d said his companion, looking up at him. She was thinking it was slightly strange. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t make a hit, you know,\u201d he went on. \u201cOh, yes,\u201d she answered, rather pleased now with his caution. It was clever for Drouet. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to introduce you as my wife, because you\u2019d feel worse then if you didn\u2019t _go_."], "Where does Hurstwood get ten thousand dollars in cash?": [" The latter had certainly imagined upon going out a half-hour before that he had turned the knob on the door so as to spring the lock. He had never failed to do so before. But to-night Mayhew had other thoughts. He had been revolving the problem of a business of his own. \u201cI\u2019ll look in here,\u201d thought the manager, pulling out the money drawers. He did not know why he wished to look in there. It was quite a superfluous action, which another time might not have happened at all. As he did so, a layer of bills, in parcels of a thousand, such as banks issue, caught his eye. He could not tell how much they represented, but paused to view them. Then he pulled out the second of the cash drawers. In that were the receipts of the day. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Fitzgerald and Moy ever left any money this way,\u201d his mind said to itself. \u201cThey must have forgotten it.\u201d He looked at the other drawer and paused again. \u201cCount them,\u201d said a voice in his ear. He put his hand into the first of the boxes and lifted the stack, letting the separate parcels fall. They were bills of fifty and one hundred dollars done in packages of a thousand. He thought he counted ten such. \u201cWhy don\u2019t I shut the safe?\u201d his mind said to itself, lingering. \u201cWhat makes me pause here?\u201d For answer there came the strangest words: \u201cDid you ever have ten thousand dollars in ready money?\u201d Lo, the manager remembered that he had never had so much.", " \u201cWell, now, just how much money would it take to buy a half interest here?\u201d said Hurstwood, who saw seven hundred dollars as his limit. \u201cThree thousand,\u201d said the man. Hurstwood\u2019s jaw fell. \u201cCash?\u201d he said. \u201cCash.\u201d He tried to put on an air of deliberation, as one who might really buy; but his eyes showed gloom. He wound up by saying he would think it over, and came away. The man he had been talking to sensed his condition in a vague way. \u201cI don\u2019t think he wants to buy,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t talk right.\u201d The afternoon was as grey as lead and cold. It was blowing up a disagreeable winter wind. He visited a place far up on the east side, near Sixty-ninth Street, and it was five o\u2019clock, and growing dim, when he reached there. A portly German kept this place. \u201cHow about this ad of yours?\u201d asked Hurstwood, who rather objected to the looks of the place. \u201cOh, dat iss all over,\u201d said the German. \u201cI vill not sell now.\u201d \u201cOh, is that so?\u201d \u201cYes; dere is nothing to dat. It iss all over.\u201d \u201cVery well,\u201d said Hurstwood, turning around. The German paid no more attention to him, and it made him angry. \u201cThe crazy ass!\u201d he said to himself. \u201cWhat does he want to advertise for?\u201d Wholly depressed, he started for Thirteenth Street. The flat had only a light in the kitchen, where Carrie was working. He struck a match and, lighting the gas, sat down in the dining-room without even greeting her.", " \u201cI\u2019m going to have a business of my own pretty soon,\u201d he observed in one place. \u201cI can get backing for two hundred thousand dollars.\u201d Carrie listened most good-naturedly. \u201cSay,\u201d he said, suddenly; \u201cwhere is Hurstwood now?\u201d Carrie flushed a little. \u201cHe\u2019s here in New York, I guess,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him for some time.\u201d Drouet mused for a moment. He had not been sure until now that the ex-manager was not an influential figure in the background. He imagined not; but this assurance relieved him. It must be that Carrie had got rid of him\u2014as well she ought, he thought. \u201cA man always makes a mistake when he does anything like that,\u201d he observed. \u201cLike what?\u201d said Carrie, unwitting of what was coming. \u201cOh, you know,\u201d and Drouet waved her intelligence, as it were, with his hand. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d she answered. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cWhy that affair in Chicago\u2014the time he left.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what you are talking about,\u201d said Carrie. Could it be he would refer so rudely to Hurstwood\u2019s flight with her? \u201cOho!\u201d said Drouet, incredulously. \u201cYou knew he took ten thousand dollars with him when he left, didn\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cWhat!\u201d said Carrie. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean to say he stole money, do you?\u201d \u201cWhy,\u201d said Drouet, puzzled at her tone, \u201cyou knew that, didn\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cWhy, no,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cOf course I didn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWell, that\u2019s funny,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cHe did, you know. It was in all the papers.\u201d \u201cHow much did you say he took?\u201d said Carrie.", " \u201cNever!\u201d she thought. Who would furnish the money to move? To think of being in two rooms with him! She resolved to spend her money for clothes quickly, before something terrible happened. That very day she did it. Having done so, there was but one other thing to do. \u201cLola,\u201d she said, visiting her friend, \u201cI think I\u2019ll come.\u201d \u201cOh, jolly!\u201d cried the latter. \u201cCan we get it right away?\u201d she asked, meaning the room. \u201cCertainly,\u201d cried Lola. They went to look at it. Carrie had saved ten dollars from her expenditures\u2014enough for this and her board beside. Her enlarged salary would not begin for ten days yet\u2014would not reach her for seventeen. She paid half of the six dollars with her friend. \u201cNow, I\u2019ve just enough to get on to the end of the week,\u201d she confided. \u201cOh, I\u2019ve got some,\u201d said Lola. \u201cI\u2019ve got twenty-five dollars, if you need it.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll get along.\u201d They decided to move Friday, which was two days away. Now that the thing was settled, Carrie\u2019s heart misgave her. She felt very much like a criminal in the matter. Each day looking at Hurstwood, she had realised that, along with the disagreeableness of his attitude, there was something pathetic. She looked at him the same evening she had made up her mind to go, and now he seemed not so shiftless and worthless, but run down and beaten upon by chance. His eyes were not keen, his face marked, his hands flabby."], "Under what pretense does Hurstwood make Carrie follow him onto a train bound for Detroit?": [" He simulated interest in several scenes without which he did not feel. He repeatedly beat his foot upon the floor. Carrie noticed his agitation, but said nothing. She had no idea what it meant or that it was important. He wondered now why he had not asked whether this train went on through to Montreal or some Canadian point. Perhaps he could have saved time. He jumped up and sought the conductor. \u201cDoes any part of this train go to Montreal?\u201d he asked. \u201cYes, the next sleeper back does.\u201d He would have asked more, but it did not seem wise, so he decided to inquire at the depot. The train rolled into the yards, clanging and puffing. \u201cI think we had better go right on through to Montreal,\u201d he said to Carrie. \u201cI\u2019ll see what the connections are when we get off.\u201d He was exceedingly nervous, but did his best to put on a calm exterior. Carrie only looked at him with large, troubled eyes. She was drifting mentally, unable to say to herself what to do. The train stopped and Hurstwood led the way out. He looked warily around him, pretending to look after Carrie. Seeing nothing that indicated studied observation, he made his way to the ticket office. \u201cThe next train for Montreal leaves when?\u201d he asked. \u201cIn twenty minutes,\u201d said the man. He bought two tickets and Pullman berths. Then he hastened back to Carrie. \u201cWe go right out again,\u201d he said, scarcely noticing that Carrie looked tired and weary.", " In due time they reached the depot, and after helping her out he handed the man a five-dollar bill and hurried on. \u201cYou wait here,\u201d he said to Carrie, when they reached the waiting-room, \u201cwhile I get the tickets.\u201d \u201cHave I much time to catch that train for Detroit?\u201d he asked of the agent. \u201cFour minutes,\u201d said the latter. He paid for two tickets as circumspectly as possible. \u201cIs it far?\u201d said Carrie, as he hurried back. \u201cNot very,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must get right in.\u201d He pushed her before him at the gate, stood between her and the ticket man while the latter punched their tickets, so that she could not see, and then hurried after. There was a long line of express and passenger cars and one or two common day coaches. As the train had only recently been made up and few passengers were expected, there were only one or two brakemen waiting. They entered the rear day coach and sat down. Almost immediately, \u201cAll aboard,\u201d resounded faintly from the outside, and the train started. Carrie began to think it was a little bit curious\u2014this going to a depot\u2014but said nothing. The whole incident was so out of the natural that she did not attach too much weight to anything she imagined. \u201cHow have you been?\u201d asked Hurstwood gently, for he now breathed easier. \u201cVery well,\u201d said Carrie, who was so disturbed that she could not bring a proper attitude to bear in the matter. She was still nervous to reach Drouet and see what could be the matter.", " \u201cThat was a mistake.\u201d He walked steadily down the street, greeting a night watchman whom he knew who was trying doors. He must get out of the city, and that quickly. \u201cI wonder how the trains run?\u201d he thought. Instantly he pulled out his watch and looked. It was nearly half-past one. At the first drugstore he stopped, seeing a long-distance telephone booth inside. It was a famous drugstore, and contained one of the first private telephone booths ever erected. \u201cI want to use your \u2019phone a minute,\u201d he said to the night clerk. The latter nodded. \u201cGive me 1643,\u201d he called to Central, after looking up the Michigan Central depot number. Soon he got the ticket agent. \u201cHow do the trains leave here for Detroit?\u201d he asked. The man explained the hours. \u201cNo more to-night?\u201d \u201cNothing with a sleeper. Yes, there is, too,\u201d he added. \u201cThere is a mail train out of here at three o\u2019clock.\u201d \u201cAll right,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cWhat time does that get to Detroit?\u201d He was thinking if he could only get there and cross the river into Canada, he could take his time about getting to Montreal. He was relieved to learn that it would reach there by noon. \u201cMayhew won\u2019t open the safe till nine,\u201d he thought. \u201cThey can\u2019t get on my track before noon.\u201d Then he thought of Carrie. With what speed must he get her, if he got her at all. She would have to come along. He jumped into the nearest cab standing by. \u201cTo Ogden Place,\u201d he said sharply.", " She felt at times as if she could cry out and make such a row that some one would come to her aid; at other times it seemed an almost useless thing\u2014so far was she from any aid, no matter what she did. All the while Hurstwood was endeavouring to formulate his plea in such a way that it would strike home and bring her into sympathy with him. \u201cI was simply put where I didn\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d Carrie deigned no suggestion of hearing this. \u201cWhen I say you wouldn\u2019t come unless I could marry you, I decided to put everything else behind me and get you to come away with me. I\u2019m going off now to another city. I want to go to Montreal for a while, and then anywhere you want to. We\u2019ll go and live in New York, if you say.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll not have anything to do with you,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cI want to get off this train. Where are we going?\u201d \u201cTo Detroit,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cOh!\u201d said Carrie, in a burst of anguish. So distant and definite a point seemed to increase the difficulty. \u201cWon\u2019t you come along with me?\u201d he said, as if there was great danger that she would not. \u201cYou won\u2019t need to do anything but travel with me. I\u2019ll not trouble you in any way. You can see Montreal and New York, and then if you don\u2019t want to stay you can go back. It will be better than trying to go back to-night.\u201d The first gleam of fairness shone in this proposition for Carrie.

He repeatedly beat his foot upon the floor. Carrie noticed his agitation, but said nothing. She had no idea what it meant or that it was important. He wondered now why he had not asked whether this train went on through to Montreal or some Canadian point. Perhaps he could have saved time. He jumped up and sought the conductor. \u201cDoes any part of this train go to Montreal?\u201d he asked. \u201cYes, the next sleeper back does.\u201d He would have asked more, but it did not seem wise, so he decided to inquire at the depot. The train rolled into the yards, clanging and puffing. \u201cI think we had better go right on through to Montreal,\u201d he said to Carrie. \u201cI\u2019ll see what the connections are when we get off.\u201d He was exceedingly nervous, but did his best to put on a calm exterior. Carrie only looked at him with large, troubled eyes. She was drifting mentally, unable to say to herself what to do. The train stopped and Hurstwood led the way out. He looked warily around him, pretending to look after Carrie. Seeing nothing that indicated studied observation, he made his way to the ticket office. \u201cThe next train for Montreal leaves when?\u201d he asked. \u201cIn twenty minutes,\u201d said the man. He bought two tickets and Pullman berths. Then he hastened back to Carrie. \u201cWe go right out again,\u201d he said, scarcely noticing that Carrie looked tired and weary.", " I don\u2019t care to talk about what I\u2019ve been, but if you\u2019d tell me how to get something to do, I\u2019d be much obliged to you. It wouldn\u2019t matter if it only lasted a few days just now. I\u2019ve got to have something.\u201d The porter still gazed, trying to look indifferent. Then, seeing that Hurstwood was about to go on, he said: \u201cI\u2019ve nothing to do with it. You\u2019ll have to ask inside.\u201d Curiously, this stirred Hurstwood to further effort. \u201cI thought you might tell me.\u201d The fellow shook his head irritably. Inside went the ex-manager and straight to an office off the clerk\u2019s desk. One of the managers of the hotel happened to be there. Hurstwood looked him straight in the eye. \u201cCould you give me something to do for a few days?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m in a position where I have to get something at once.\u201d The comfortable manager looked at him, as much as to say: \u201cWell, I should judge so.\u201d \u201cI came here,\u201d explained Hurstwood, nervously, \u201cbecause I\u2019ve been a manager myself in my day. I\u2019ve had bad luck in a way but I\u2019m not here to tell you that. I want something to do, if only for a week.\u201d The man imagined he saw a feverish gleam in the applicant\u2019s eye. \u201cWhat hotel did you manage?\u201d he inquired. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a hotel,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cI was manager of Fitzgerald and Moy\u2019s place in Chicago for fifteen years.\u201d \u201cIs that so?\u201d said the hotel man. \u201cHow did you come to get out of that?\u201d The figure of Hurstwood was rather surprising in contrast to the fact.", " It seemed an intolerable thing. Still he went on and into the room. \u201cWho was it?\u201d asked Carrie. \u201cA friend of mine from Chicago.\u201d The whole of this conversation was such a shock that, coming as it did after all the other worry of the past week, it sufficed to induce a deep gloom and moral revulsion in Hurstwood. What hurt him most was the fact that he was being pursued as a thief. He began to see the nature of that social injustice which sees but one side\u2014often but a single point in a long tragedy. All the newspapers noted but one thing, his taking the money. How and wherefore were but indifferently dealt with. All the complications which led up to it were unknown. He was accused without being understood. Sitting in his room with Carrie the same day, he decided to send the money back. He would write Fitzgerald and Moy, explain all, and then send it by express. Maybe they would forgive him. Perhaps they would ask him back. He would make good the false statement he had made about writing them. Then he would leave this peculiar town. For an hour he thought over this plausible statement of the tangle. He wanted to tell them about his wife, but couldn\u2019t. He finally narrowed it down to an assertion that he was light-headed from entertaining friends, had found the safe open, and having gone so far as to take the money out, had accidentally closed it. This act he regretted very much. He was sorry he had put them to so much trouble.", " She felt at times as if she could cry out and make such a row that some one would come to her aid; at other times it seemed an almost useless thing\u2014so far was she from any aid, no matter what she did. All the while Hurstwood was endeavouring to formulate his plea in such a way that it would strike home and bring her into sympathy with him. \u201cI was simply put where I didn\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d Carrie deigned no suggestion of hearing this. \u201cWhen I say you wouldn\u2019t come unless I could marry you, I decided to put everything else behind me and get you to come away with me. I\u2019m going off now to another city. I want to go to Montreal for a while, and then anywhere you want to. We\u2019ll go and live in New York, if you say.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll not have anything to do with you,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cI want to get off this train. Where are we going?\u201d \u201cTo Detroit,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cOh!\u201d said Carrie, in a burst of anguish. So distant and definite a point seemed to increase the difficulty. \u201cWon\u2019t you come along with me?\u201d he said, as if there was great danger that she would not. \u201cYou won\u2019t need to do anything but travel with me. I\u2019ll not trouble you in any way. You can see Montreal and New York, and then if you don\u2019t want to stay you can go back. It will be better than trying to go back to-night.\u201d The first gleam of fairness shone in this proposition for Carrie.

It was an interesting world to her. Her life had just begun. She did not feel herself defeated at all. Neither was she blasted in hope. The great city held much. Possibly she would come out of bondage into freedom\u2014who knows? Perhaps she would be happy. These thoughts raised her above the level of erring. She was saved in that she was hopeful. The following morning the train pulled safely into Montreal and they stepped down, Hurstwood glad to be out of danger, Carrie wondering at the novel atmosphere of the northern city. Long before, Hurstwood had been here, and now he remembered the name of the hotel at which he had stopped. As they came out of the main entrance of the depot he heard it called anew by a busman. \u201cWe\u2019ll go right up and get rooms,\u201d he said. At the clerk\u2019s office Hurstwood swung the register about while the clerk came forward. He was thinking what name he would put down. With the latter before him he found no time for hesitation. A name he had seen out of the car window came swiftly to him. It was pleasing enough. With an easy hand he wrote, \u201cG. W. Murdock and wife.\u201d It was the largest concession to necessity he felt like making. His initials he could not spare.

The woman wrote her address in full and then allowed her to depart at her leisure. She encountered a very similar experience in the office of Mr. Jenks, only he varied it by saying at the close: \u201cIf you could play at some local house, or had a programme with your name on it, I might do something.\u201d In the third place the individual asked: \u201cWhat sort of work do you want to do?\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cWell, do you want to get in a comedy or on the vaudeville stage or in the chorus?\u201d \u201cOh, I\u2019d like to get a part in a play,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cWell,\u201d said the man, \u201cit\u2019ll cost you something to do that.\u201d \u201cHow much?\u201d said Carrie, who, ridiculous as it may seem, had not thought of this before. \u201cWell, that\u2019s for you to say,\u201d he answered shrewdly. Carrie looked at him curiously. She hardly knew how to continue the inquiry. \u201cCould you get me a part if I paid?\u201d \u201cIf we didn\u2019t you\u2019d get your money back.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d she said.

Hurstwood ceased, waiting for some suggestion. \u201cWe did want a salesman,\u201d said the man. \u201cI don\u2019t know as it\u2019s anything you\u2019d care to take hold of, though.\u201d \u201cI see,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cWell, I\u2019m in no position to choose, just at present. If it were open, I should be glad to get it.\u201d The man did not take kindly at all to his \u201cNo position to choose.\u201d He wanted some one who wasn\u2019t thinking of a choice or something better. Especially not an old man. He wanted some one young, active, and glad to work actively for a moderate sum. Hurstwood did not please him at all. He had more of an air than his employers. \u201cWell,\u201d he said in answer, \u201cwe\u2019d be glad to consider your application. We shan\u2019t decide for a few days yet. Suppose you send us your references.\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d said Hurstwood. He nodded good-morning and came away. At the corner he looked at the furniture company\u2019s address, and saw that it was in West Twenty-third Street. Accordingly, he went up there. The place was not large enough, however. It looked moderate, the men in it idle and small salaried. He walked by, glancing in, and then decided not to go in there. \u201cThey want a girl, probably, at ten a week,\u201d he said. At one o\u2019clock he thought of eating, and went to a restaurant in Madison Square. There he pondered over places which he might look up.", " At last he found an individual who had a resort in Warren Street, which seemed an excellent venture. It was fairly well-appearing and susceptible of improvement. The owner claimed the business to be excellent, and it certainly looked so. \u201cWe deal with a very good class of people,\u201d he told Hurstwood. \u201cMerchants, salesmen, and professionals. It\u2019s a well-dressed class. No bums. We don\u2019t allow \u2019em in the place.\u201d Hurstwood listened to the cash-register ring, and watched the trade for a while. \u201cIt\u2019s profitable enough for two, is it?\u201d he asked. \u201cYou can see for yourself if you\u2019re any judge of the liquor trade,\u201d said the owner. \u201cThis is only one of the two places I have. The other is down in Nassau Street. I can\u2019t tend to them both alone. If I had some one who knew the business thoroughly I wouldn\u2019t mind sharing with him in this one and letting him manage it.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve had experience enough,\u201d said Hurstwood blandly, but he felt a little diffident about referring to Fitzgerald and Moy. \u201cWell, you can suit yourself, Mr. Wheeler,\u201d said the proprietor. He only offered a third interest in the stock, fixtures, and good-will, and this in return for a thousand dollars and managerial ability on the part of the one who should come in. There was no property involved, because the owner of the saloon merely rented from an estate. The offer was genuine enough, but it was a question with Hurstwood whether a third interest in that locality could be made to yield one hundred and fifty dollars a month, which he figured he must have in order to meet the ordinary family expenses and be comfortable.", " The floors were of brightly coloured tiles, the walls a composition of rich, dark, polished wood, which reflected the light, and coloured stucco-work, which gave the place a very sumptuous appearance. The long bar was a blaze of lights, polished woodwork, coloured and cut glassware, and many fancy bottles. It was a truly swell saloon, with rich screens, fancy wines, and a line of bar goods unsurpassed in the country. At Rector\u2019s, Drouet had met Mr. G. W. Hurstwood, manager of Fitzgerald and Moy\u2019s. He had been pointed out as a very successful and well-known man about town. Hurstwood looked the part, for, besides being slightly under forty, he had a good, stout constitution, an active manner, and a solid, substantial air, which was composed in part of his fine clothes, his clean linen, his jewels, and, above all, his own sense of his importance. Drouet immediately conceived a notion of him as being some one worth knowing, and was glad not only to meet him, but to visit the Adams Street bar thereafter whenever he wanted a drink or a cigar. Hurstwood was an interesting character after his kind. He was shrewd and clever in many little things, and capable of creating a good impression. His managerial position was fairly important\u2014a kind of stewardship which was imposing, but lacked financial control. He had risen by perseverance and industry, through long years of service, from the position of barkeeper in a commonplace saloon to his present altitude.", " While he was gazing, she turned and, looking at the remarkable company, sent her escort over. He came, holding a bill in his fingers, all elegant and graceful. \u201cHere you are,\u201d he said. \u201cThanks,\u201d said the captain, turning to the two remaining applicants. \u201cNow we have some for to-morrow night,\u201d he added. Therewith he lined up the last two and proceeded to the head, counting as he went. \u201cOne hundred and thirty-seven,\u201d he announced. \u201cNow, boys, line up. Right dress there. We won\u2019t be much longer about this. Steady, now.\u201d He placed himself at the head and called out \u201cForward.\u201d Hurstwood moved with the line. Across Fifth Avenue, through Madison Square by the winding paths, east on Twenty-third Street, and down Third Avenue wound the long, serpentine company. Midnight pedestrians and loiterers stopped and stared as the company passed. Chatting policemen, at various corners, stared indifferently or nodded to the leader, whom they had seen before. On Third Avenue they marched, a seemingly weary way, to Eighth Street, where there was a lodging-house, closed, apparently, for the night. They were expected, however. Outside in the gloom they stood, while the leader parleyed within. Then doors swung open and they were invited in with a \u201cSteady, now.\u201d Some one was at the head showing rooms, so that there was no delay for keys. Toiling up the creaky stairs, Hurstwood looked back and saw the captain, watching; the last one of the line being included in his broad solicitude."], "What does Hurstwood believe about Carrie that causes him to leave her at home while he goes out with friends?": [" At least, she got the idea that her look was something which represented the world\u2019s longing. She took it to heart as a creditable thing, until he added: \u201cThat puts a burden of duty on you. It so happens that you have this thing. It is no credit to you\u2014that is, I mean, you might not have had it. You paid nothing to get it. But now that you have it, you must do something with it.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d asked Carrie. \u201cI should say, turn to the dramatic field. You have so much sympathy and such a melodious voice. Make them valuable to others. It will make your powers endure.\u201d Carrie did not understand this last. All the rest showed her that her comedy success was little or nothing. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy, just this. You have this quality in your eyes and mouth and in your nature. You can lose it, you know. If you turn away from it and live to satisfy yourself alone, it will go fast enough. The look will leave your eyes. Your mouth will change. Your power to act will disappear. You may think they won\u2019t, but they will. Nature takes care of that.\u201d He was so interested in forwarding all good causes that he sometimes became enthusiastic, giving vent to these preachments. Something in Carrie appealed to him. He wanted to stir her up. \u201cI know,\u201d she said, absently, feeling slightly guilty of neglect. \u201cIf I were you,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019d change.\u201d The effect of this was like roiling helpless waters.", " \u201cYou will have to write and ask him to see you.\u201d So she went away. At the Empire Theatre she found a hive of peculiarly listless and indifferent individuals. Everything ornately upholstered, everything carefully finished, everything remarkably reserved. At the Lyceum she entered one of those secluded, under-stairway closets, berugged and bepaneled, which causes one to feel the greatness of all positions of authority. Here was reserve itself done into a box-office clerk, a doorman, and an assistant, glorying in their fine positions. \u201cAh, be very humble now\u2014very humble indeed. Tell us what it is you require. Tell it quickly, nervously, and without a vestige of self-respect. If no trouble to us in any way, we may see what we can do.\u201d This was the atmosphere of the Lyceum\u2014the attitude, for that matter, of every managerial office in the city. These little proprietors of businesses are lords indeed on their own ground. Carrie came away wearily, somewhat more abashed for her pains. Hurstwood heard the details of the weary and unavailing search that evening. \u201cI didn\u2019t get to see any one,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cI just walked, and walked, and waited around.\u201d Hurstwood only looked at her. \u201cI suppose you have to have some friends before you can get in,\u201d she added, disconsolately. Hurstwood saw the difficulty of this thing, and yet it did not seem so terrible. Carrie was tired and dispirited, but now she could rest.", " I\u2019ll get it too, don\u2019t you forget.\u201d \u201cI hope you do,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cAnd then if that little real estate deal I\u2019ve got on goes through, we\u2019ll get married,\u201d he said with a great show of earnestness, the while he took his place before the mirror and began brushing his hair. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you ever intend to marry me, Charlie,\u201d Carrie said ruefully. The recent protestations of Hurstwood had given her courage to say this. \u201cOh, yes I do\u2014course I do\u2014what put that into your head?\u201d He had stopped his trifling before the mirror now and crossed over to her. For the first time Carrie felt as if she must move away from him. \u201cBut you\u2019ve been saying that so long,\u201d she said, looking with her pretty face upturned into his. \u201cWell, and I mean it too, but it takes money to live as I want to. Now, when I get this increase, I can come pretty near fixing things all right, and I\u2019ll do it. Now, don\u2019t you worry, girlie.\u201d He patted her reassuringly upon the shoulder, but Carrie felt how really futile had been her hopes. She could clearly see that this easy-going soul intended no move in her behalf. He was simply letting things drift because he preferred the free round of his present state to any legal trammellings. In contrast, Hurstwood appeared strong and sincere. He had no easy manner of putting her off. He sympathised with her and showed her what her true value was. He needed her, while Drouet did not care.", " They all know me so well. But you\u2019ll _go_ all right. Anyhow, you\u2019ll probably never meet any of them again.\u201d \u201cOh, I don\u2019t care,\u201d said Carrie desperately. She was determined now to have a try at the fascinating game. Drouet breathed a sigh of relief. He had been afraid that he was about to precipitate another conversation upon the marriage question. The part of Laura, as Carrie found out when she began to examine it, was one of suffering and tears. As delineated by Mr. Daly, it was true to the most sacred traditions of melodrama as he found it when he began his career. The sorrowful demeanour, the tremolo music, the long, explanatory, cumulative addresses, all were there. \u201cPoor fellow,\u201d read Carrie, consulting the text and drawing her voice out pathetically. \u201cMartin, be sure and give him a glass of wine before he goes.\u201d She was surprised at the briefness of the entire part, not knowing that she must be on the stage while others were talking, and not only be there, but also keep herself in harmony with the dramatic movement of the scenes. \u201cI think I can do that, though,\u201d she concluded. When Drouet came the next night, she was very much satisfied with her day\u2019s study. \u201cWell, how goes it, Caddie?\u201d he said. \u201cAll right,\u201d she laughed. \u201cI think I have it memorised nearly.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s hear some of it.\u201d \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know whether I can get up and say it off here,\u201d she said bashfully."], "Who introduces Carrie to Mr. Ames?": [" \u201cHe\u2019s going along with us, aren\u2019t you, Bob?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m very glad to meet you,\u201d said Ames, bowing politely to Carrie. The latter caught in a glance the dimensions of a very stalwart figure. She also noticed that he was smooth-shaven, good looking, and young, but nothing more. \u201cMr. Ames is just down in New York for a few days,\u201d put in Vance, \u201cand we\u2019re trying to show him around a little.\u201d \u201cOh, are you?\u201d said Carrie, taking another glance at the newcomer. \u201cYes; I am just on here from Indianapolis for a week or so,\u201d said young Ames, seating himself on the edge of a chair to wait while Mrs. Vance completed the last touches of her toilet. \u201cI guess you find New York quite a thing to see, don\u2019t you?\u201d said Carrie, venturing something to avoid a possible deadly silence. \u201cIt is rather large to get around in a week,\u201d answered Ames, pleasantly. He was an exceedingly genial soul, this young man, and wholly free of affectation. It seemed to Carrie he was as yet only overcoming the last traces of the bashfulness of youth. He did not seem apt at conversation, but he had the merit of being well dressed and wholly courageous. Carrie felt as if it were not going to be hard to talk to him. \u201cWell, I guess we\u2019re ready now. The coach is outside.\u201d \u201cCome on, people,\u201d said Mrs. Vance, coming in smiling. \u201cBob, you\u2019ll have to look after Mrs. Wheeler.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll try to,\u201d said Bob smiling, and edging closer to Carrie.", " \u201cYou won\u2019t need much watching, will you?\u201d he volunteered, in a sort of ingratiating and help-me-out kind of way. \u201cNot very, I hope,\u201d said Carrie. They descended the stairs, Mrs. Vance offering suggestions, and climbed into the open coach. \u201cAll right,\u201d said Vance, slamming the coach door, and the conveyance rolled away. \u201cWhat is it we\u2019re going to see?\u201d asked Ames. \u201cSothern,\u201d said Vance, \u201cin \u2018Lord Chumley.\u2019\u201d \u201cOh, he is so good!\u201d said Mrs. Vance. \u201cHe\u2019s just the funniest man.\u201d \u201cI notice the papers praise it,\u201d said Ames. \u201cI haven\u2019t any doubt,\u201d put in Vance, \u201cbut we\u2019ll all enjoy it very much.\u201d Ames had taken a seat beside Carrie, and accordingly he felt it his bounden duty to pay her some attention. He was interested to find her so young a wife, and so pretty, though it was only a respectful interest. There was nothing of the dashing lady\u2019s man about him. He had respect for the married state, and thought only of some pretty marriageable girls in Indianapolis. \u201cAre you a born New Yorker?\u201d asked Ames of Carrie. \u201cOh, no; I\u2019ve only been here for two years.\u201d \u201cOh, well, you\u2019ve had time to see a great deal of it, anyhow.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t seem to have,\u201d answered Carrie. \u201cIt\u2019s about as strange to me as when I first came here.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not from the West, are you?\u201d \u201cYes. I\u2019m from Wisconsin,\u201d she answered. \u201cWell, it does seem as if most people in this town haven\u2019t been here so very long. I hear of lots of Indiana people in my line who are here.\u201d \u201cWhat is your line?\u201d asked Carrie.", " It was fine to be so, as a man, she thought. The conversation changed to a book that was having its vogue at the time\u2014\u201cMoulding a Maiden,\u201d by Albert Ross. Mrs. Vance had read it. Vance had seen it discussed in some of the papers. \u201cA man can make quite a strike writing a book,\u201d said Vance. \u201cI notice this fellow Ross is very much talked about.\u201d He was looking at Carrie as he spoke. \u201cI hadn\u2019t heard of him,\u201d said Carrie, honestly. \u201cOh, I have,\u201d said Mrs. Vance. \u201cHe\u2019s written lots of things. This last story is pretty good.\u201d \u201cHe doesn\u2019t amount to much,\u201d said Ames. Carrie turned her eyes toward him as to an oracle. \u201cHis stuff is nearly as bad as \u2018Dora Thorne,\u2019\u201d concluded Ames. Carrie felt this as a personal reproof. She read \u201cDora Thorne,\u201d or had a great deal in the past. It seemed only fair to her, but she supposed that people thought it very fine. Now this clear-eyed, fine-headed youth, who looked something like a student to her, made fun of it. It was poor to him, not worth reading. She looked down, and for the first time felt the pain of not understanding. Yet there was nothing sarcastic or supercilious in the way Ames spoke. He had very little of that in him. Carrie felt that it was just kindly thought of a high order\u2014the right thing to think, and wondered what else was right, according to him. He seemed to notice that she listened and rather sympathised with him, and from now on he talked mostly to her.", " This did not appeal to him exactly, but he cared for her in his own way, and so the thing stood. Still, there was something in the details of the transactions which caused Carrie to feel that her requests were not a delight to him. He did not enthuse over the purchases. This led her to believe that neglect was creeping in, and so another small wedge was entered. Nevertheless, one of the results of Mrs. Vance\u2019s suggestions was the fact that on this occasion Carrie was dressed somewhat to her own satisfaction. She had on her best, but there was comfort in the thought that if she must confine herself to a _best_, it was neat and fitting. She looked the well-groomed woman of twenty-one, and Mrs. Vance praised her, which brought colour to her plump cheeks and a noticeable brightness into her large eyes. It was threatening rain, and Mr. Vance, at his wife\u2019s request, had called a coach. \u201cYour husband isn\u2019t coming?\u201d suggested Mr. Vance, as he met Carrie in his little parlour. \u201cNo; he said he wouldn\u2019t be home for dinner.\u201d \u201cBetter leave a little note for him, telling him where we are. He might turn up.\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d said Carrie, who had not thought of it before. \u201cTell him we\u2019ll be at Sherry\u2019s until eight o\u2019clock. He knows, though I guess.\u201d Carrie crossed the hall with rustling skirts, and scrawled the note, gloves on. When she returned a newcomer was in the Vance flat. \u201cMrs. Wheeler, let me introduce Mr. Ames, a cousin of mine,\u201d said Mrs. Vance."], "What emotional state does the wealth of the Vances induce in Carrie?": [" This irritated and worried him. There came a night when he confessed to Carrie that the business was not doing as well this month as it had the month before. This was in lieu of certain suggestions she had made concerning little things she wanted to buy. She had not failed to notice that he did not seem to consult her about buying clothes for himself. For the first time, it struck her as a ruse, or that he said it so that she would not think of asking for things. Her reply was mild enough, but her thoughts were rebellious. He was not looking after her at all. She was depending for her enjoyment upon the Vances. And now the latter announced that they were going away. It was approaching spring, and they were going North. \u201cOh, yes,\u201d said Mrs. Vance to Carrie, \u201cwe think we might as well give up the flat and store our things. We\u2019ll be gone for the summer, and it would be a useless expense. I think we\u2019ll settle a little farther down town when we come back.\u201d Carrie heard this with genuine sorrow. She had enjoyed Mrs. Vance\u2019s companionship so much. There was no one else in the house whom she knew. Again she would be all alone. Hurstwood\u2019s gloom over the slight decrease in profits and the departure of the Vances came together. So Carrie had loneliness and this mood of her husband to enjoy at the same time. It was a grievous thing. She became restless and dissatisfied, not exactly, as she thought, with Hurstwood, but with life.", " Her lips tightened. The feeling of mutual antagonism was increased. On the other hand, his interest in Drouet\u2019s little shop-girl grew in an almost evenly balanced proportion. That young lady, under the stress of her situation and the tutelage of her new friend, changed effectively. She had the aptitude of the struggler who seeks emancipation. The glow of a more showy life was not lost upon her. She did not grow in knowledge so much as she awakened in the matter of desire. Mrs. Hale\u2019s extended harangues upon the subjects of wealth and position taught her to distinguish between degrees of wealth. Mrs. Hale loved to drive in the afternoon in the sun when it was fine, and to satisfy her soul with a sight of those mansions and lawns which she could not afford. On the North Side had been erected a number of elegant mansions along what is now known as the North Shore Drive. The present lake wall of stone and granitoid was not then in place, but the road had been well laid out, the intermediate spaces of lawn were lovely to look upon, and the houses were thoroughly new and imposing. When the winter season had passed and the first fine days of the early spring appeared, Mrs. Hale secured a buggy for an afternoon and invited Carrie. They rode first through Lincoln Park and on far out towards Evanston, turning back at four and arriving at the north end of the Shore Drive at about five o\u2019clock.", " There were no trees here, no west view of the river. The street was solidly built up. There were twelve families here, respectable enough, but nothing like the Vances. Richer people required more space. Being left alone in this little place, Carrie did without a girl. She made it charming enough, but could not make it delight her. Hurstwood was not inwardly pleased to think that they should have to modify their state, but he argued that he could do nothing. He must put the best face on it, and let it go at that. He tried to show Carrie that there was no cause for financial alarm, but only congratulation over the chance he would have at the end of the year by taking her rather more frequently to the theatre and by providing a liberal table. This was for the time only. He was getting in the frame of mind where he wanted principally to be alone and to be allowed to think. The disease of brooding was beginning to claim him as a victim. Only the newspapers and his own thoughts were worth while. The delight of love had again slipped away. It was a case of live, now, making the best you can out of a very commonplace station in life. The road downward has but few landings and level places. The very state of his mind, superinduced by his condition, caused the breach to widen between him and his partner. At last that individual began to wish that Hurstwood was out of it. It so happened, however, that a real estate deal on the part of the owner of the land arranged things even more effectually than ill-will could have schemed.", " What was it? A very dull round indeed. What did she have? Nothing but this narrow, little flat. The Vances could travel, they could do the things worth doing, and here she was. For what was she made, anyhow? More thought followed, and then tears\u2014tears seemed justified, and the only relief in the world. For another period this state continued, the twain leading a rather monotonous life, and then there was a slight change for the worse. One evening, Hurstwood, after thinking about a way to modify Carrie\u2019s desire for clothes and the general strain upon his ability to provide, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to do much with Shaughnessy.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cOh, he\u2019s a slow, greedy \u2018mick\u2019! He won\u2019t agree to anything to improve the place, and it won\u2019t ever pay without it.\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t you make him?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cNo; I\u2019ve tried. The only thing I can see, if I want to improve, is to get hold of a place of my own.\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cWell, all I have is tied up in there just now. If I had a chance to save a while I think I could open a place that would give us plenty of money.\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t we save?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cWe might try it,\u201d he suggested. \u201cI\u2019ve been thinking that if we\u2019d take a smaller flat down town and live economically for a year, I would have enough, with what I have invested, to open a good place. Then we could arrange to live as you want to.\u201d \u201cIt would suit me all right,\u201d said Carrie, who, nevertheless, felt badly to think it had come to this."], "After two years in New York, why does Hurstwood begin looking for a new business to invest in?": [" She had been taught how to dress and where to go without having ample means to do either. Now, these things\u2014ever-present realities as they were\u2014filled her eyes and mind. The more circumscribed became her state, the more entrancing seemed this other. And now poverty threatened to seize her entirely and to remove this other world far upward like a heaven to which any Lazarus might extend, appealingly, his hands. So, too, the ideal brought into her life by Ames remained. He had gone, but here was his word that riches were not everything; that there was a great deal more in the world than she knew; that the stage was good, and the literature she read poor. He was a strong man and clean\u2014how much stronger and better than Hurstwood and Drouet she only half formulated to herself, but the difference was painful. It was something to which she voluntarily closed her eyes. During the last three months of the Warren Street connection, Hurstwood took parts of days off and hunted, tracking the business advertisements. It was a more or less depressing business, wholly because of the thought that he must soon get something or he would begin to live on the few hundred dollars he was saving, and then he would have nothing to invest\u2014he would have to hire out as a clerk. Everything he discovered in his line advertised as an opportunity, was either too expensive or too wretched for him. Besides, winter was coming, the papers were announcing hardships, and there was a general feeling of hard times in the air, or, at least, he thought so.", " They were in Fitzgerald and Moy\u2019s. It was as if he stood in the door of his elegant little office, comfortably dressed, talking to Sagar Morrison about the value of South Chicago real estate in which the latter was about to invest. \u201cHow would you like to come in on that with me?\u201d he heard Morrison say. \u201cNot me,\u201d he answered, just as he had years before. \u201cI have my hands full now.\u201d The movement of his lips aroused him. He wondered whether he had really spoken. The next time he noticed anything of the sort he really did talk. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you jump, you bloody fool?\u201d he was saying. \u201cJump!\u201d It was a funny English story he was telling to a company of actors. Even as his voice recalled him, he was smiling. A crusty old codger, sitting near by, seemed disturbed; at least, he stared in a most pointed way. Hurstwood straightened up. The humour of the memory fled in an instant and he felt ashamed. For relief, he left his chair and strolled out into the streets. One day, looking down the ad. columns of the \u201cEvening World,\u201d he saw where a new play was at the Casino. Instantly, he came to a mental halt. Carrie had gone! He remembered seeing a poster of her only yesterday, but no doubt it was one left uncovered by the new signs. Curiously, this fact shook him up. He had almost to admit that somehow he was depending upon her being in the city. Now she was gone. He wondered how this important fact had skipped him.", " \u201cCarrie,\u201d he said, getting up once and coming over to her, \u201care you going to stay with me from now on?\u201d She looked at him quizzically, but melted with sympathy as the value of the look upon his face forced itself upon her. It was love now, keen and strong\u2014love enhanced by difficulty and worry. She could not help smiling. \u201cLet me be everything to you from now on,\u201d he said. \u201cDon\u2019t make me worry any more. I\u2019ll be true to you. We\u2019ll go to New York and get a nice flat. I\u2019ll go into business again, and we\u2019ll be happy. Won\u2019t you be mine?\u201d Carrie listened quite solemnly. There was no great passion in her, but the drift of things and this man\u2019s proximity created a semblance of affection. She felt rather sorry for him\u2014a sorrow born of what had only recently been a great admiration. True love she had never felt for him. She would have known as much if she could have analysed her feelings, but this thing which she now felt aroused by his great feeling broke down the barriers between them. \u201cYou\u2019ll stay with me, won\u2019t you?\u201d he asked. \u201cYes,\u201d she said, nodding her head. He gathered her to himself, imprinting kisses upon her lips and cheeks. \u201cYou must marry me, though,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll get a license to-day,\u201d he answered. \u201cHow?\u201d she asked. \u201cUnder a new name,\u201d he answered. \u201cI\u2019ll take a new name and live a new life. From now on I\u2019m Murdock.\u201d \u201cOh, don\u2019t take that name,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cWhy not?\u201d he said.", " Dissolution meant the loss of his thousand dollars, and he could not save another thousand in the time. He understood that Shaughnessy was merely tired of the arrangement, and would probably lease the new corner, when completed, alone. He began to worry about the necessity of a new connection and to see impending serious financial straits unless something turned up. This left him in no mood to enjoy his flat or Carrie, and consequently the depression invaded that quarter. Meanwhile, he took such time as he could to look about, but opportunities were not numerous. More, he had not the same impressive personality which he had when he first came to New York. Bad thoughts had put a shade into his eyes which did not impress others favourably. Neither had he thirteen hundred dollars in hand to talk with. About a month later, finding that he had not made any progress, Shaughnessy reported definitely that Slawson would not extend the lease. \u201cI guess this thing\u2019s got to come to an end,\u201d he said, affecting an air of concern. \u201cWell, if it has, it has,\u201d answered Hurstwood, grimly. He would not give the other a key to his opinions, whatever they were. He should not have the satisfaction. A day or two later he saw that he must say something to Carrie. \u201cYou know,\u201d he said, \u201cI think I\u2019m going to get the worst of my deal down there.\u201d \u201cHow is that?\u201d asked Carrie in astonishment. \u201cWell, the man who owns the ground has sold it, and the new owner won\u2019t release it to us."], "What does Hurstwood waste time doing while he is supposed to be looking for businesses to invest in?": [" Minnie, after the good spirits Carrie manifested at first, expected a fair report. Hanson supposed that Carrie would be satisfied. \u201cWell,\u201d he said, as he came in from the hall in his working clothes, and looked at Carrie through the dining-room door, \u201chow did you make out?\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said Carrie, \u201cit\u2019s pretty hard. I don\u2019t like it.\u201d There was an air about her which showed plainer than any words that she was both weary and disappointed. \u201cWhat sort of work is it?\u201d he asked, lingering a moment as he turned upon his heel to go into the bathroom. \u201cRunning a machine,\u201d answered Carrie. It was very evident that it did not concern him much, save from the side of the flat\u2019s success. He was irritated a shade because it could not have come about in the throw of fortune for Carrie to be pleased. Minnie worked with less elation than she had just before Carrie arrived. The sizzle of the meat frying did not sound quite so pleasing now that Carrie had reported her discontent. To Carrie, the one relief of the whole day would have been a jolly home, a sympathetic reception, a bright supper table, and some one to say: \u201cOh, well, stand it a little while. You will get something better,\u201d but now this was ashes. She began to see that they looked upon her complaint as unwarranted, and that she was supposed to work on and say nothing. She knew that she was to pay four dollars for her board and room, and now she felt that it would be an exceedingly gloomy round, living with these people.", " \u201cMaybe you could get something in the stage line?\u201d he blandly suggested. \u201cMaybe I could,\u201d said Carrie, glad that some one approved of the idea. \u201cI\u2019ll lay my hand to whatever I can get,\u201d he said, now that he saw her brighten up. \u201cI can get something.\u201d She cleaned up the things one morning after he had gone, dressed as neatly as her wardrobe permitted, and set out for Broadway. She did not know that thoroughfare very well. To her it was a wonderful conglomeration of everything great and mighty. The theatres were there\u2014these agencies must be somewhere about. She decided to stop in at the Madison Square Theatre and ask how to find the theatrical agents. This seemed the sensible way. Accordingly, when she reached that theatre she applied to the clerk at the box office. \u201cEh?\u201d he said, looking out. \u201cDramatic agents? I don\u2019t know. You\u2019ll find them in the \u2018Clipper,\u2019 though. They all advertise in that.\u201d \u201cIs that a paper?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cYes,\u201d said the clerk, marvelling at such ignorance of a common fact. \u201cYou can get it at the news-stands,\u201d he added politely, seeing how pretty the inquirer was. Carrie proceeded to get the \u201cClipper,\u201d and tried to find the agents by looking over it as she stood beside the stand. This could not be done so easily. Thirteenth Street was a number of blocks off, but she went back, carrying the precious paper and regretting the waste of time. Hurstwood was already there, sitting in his place.", " They were in Fitzgerald and Moy\u2019s. It was as if he stood in the door of his elegant little office, comfortably dressed, talking to Sagar Morrison about the value of South Chicago real estate in which the latter was about to invest. \u201cHow would you like to come in on that with me?\u201d he heard Morrison say. \u201cNot me,\u201d he answered, just as he had years before. \u201cI have my hands full now.\u201d The movement of his lips aroused him.

He had almost to admit that somehow he was depending upon her being in the city. Now she was gone. He wondered how this important fact had skipped him.", " Her state still seemed fairly reasonable, however. All she did observe was that Hurstwood was somewhat different. Some time in the second year of their residence in Seventy-eighth Street the flat across the hall from Carrie became vacant, and into it moved a very handsome young woman and her husband, with both of whom Carrie afterwards became acquainted. This was brought about solely by the arrangement of the flats, which were united in one place, as it were, by the dumb-waiter. This useful elevator, by which fuel, groceries, and the like were sent up from the basement, and garbage and waste sent down, was used by both residents of one floor; that is, a small door opened into it from each flat. If the occupants of both flats answered to the whistle of the janitor at the same time, they would stand face to face when they opened the dumb-waiter doors. One morning, when Carrie went to remove her paper, the newcomer, a handsome brunette of perhaps twenty-three years of age, was there for a like purpose. She was in a night-robe and dressing-gown, with her hair very much tousled, but she looked so pretty and good-natured that Carrie instantly conceived a liking for her. The newcomer did no more than smile shamefacedly, but it was sufficient. Carrie felt that she would like to know her, and a similar feeling stirred in the mind of the other, who admired Carrie\u2019s innocent face. \u201cThat\u2019s a real pretty woman who has moved in next door,\u201d said Carrie to Hurstwood at the breakfast table."], "What causes Mrs. Vance to retreat in shock when she calls to visit on Carrie at her apartment?": [" So she was thoroughly surprised to encounter her in Fourteenth Street, where she had gone shopping. Carrie was there for the same purpose. \u201cWhy, Mrs. Wheeler,\u201d said Mrs. Vance, looking Carrie over in a glance, \u201cwhere have you been? Why haven\u2019t you been to see me? I\u2019ve been wondering all this time what had become of you. Really, I\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cI\u2019m so glad to see you,\u201d said Carrie, pleased and yet nonplussed. Of all times, this was the worst to encounter Mrs. Vance. \u201cWhy, I\u2019m living down town here. I\u2019ve been intending to come and see you. Where are you living now?\u201d \u201cIn Fifty-eighth Street,\u201d said Mrs. Vance, \u201cjust off Seventh Avenue\u2014218. Why don\u2019t you come and see me?\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cReally, I\u2019ve been wanting to come. I know I ought to. It\u2019s a shame. But you know\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s your number?\u201d said Mrs. Vance. \u201cThirteenth Street,\u201d said Carrie, reluctantly. \u201c112 West.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said Mrs. Vance, \u201cthat\u2019s right near here, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cYou must come down and see me some time.\u201d \u201cWell, you\u2019re a fine one,\u201d said Mrs. Vance, laughing, the while noting that Carrie\u2019s appearance had modified somewhat. \u201cThe address, too,\u201d she added to herself. \u201cThey must be hard up.\u201d Still she liked Carrie well enough to take her in tow. \u201cCome with me in here a minute,\u201d she exclaimed, turning into a store. When Carrie returned home, there was Hurstwood, reading as usual. He seemed to take his condition with the utmost nonchalance.", " The old helpful, urging melancholy was restored. The desirous Carrie was whispered to concerning her possibilities. There were no immediate results to this awakening, for Carrie had little power of initiative; but, nevertheless, she seemed ever capable of getting herself into the tide of change where she would be easily borne along. Hurstwood noticed nothing. He had been unconscious of the marked contrasts which Carrie had observed. He did not even detect the shade of melancholy which settled in her eyes. Worst of all, she now began to feel the loneliness of the flat and seek the company of Mrs. Vance, who liked her exceedingly. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the matin\u00e9e this afternoon,\u201d said Mrs. Vance, who had stepped across into Carrie\u2019s flat one morning, still arrayed in a soft pink dressing-gown, which she had donned upon rising. Hurstwood and Vance had gone their separate ways nearly an hour before. \u201cAll right,\u201d said Carrie, noticing the air of the petted and well-groomed woman in Mrs. Vance\u2019s general appearance. She looked as though she was dearly loved and her every wish gratified. \u201cWhat shall we see?\u201d \u201cOh, I do want to see Nat Goodwin,\u201d said Mrs. Vance. \u201cI do think he is the jolliest actor. The papers say this is such a good play.\u201d \u201cWhat time will we have to start?\u201d asked Carrie. \u201cLet\u2019s go at once and walk down Broadway from Thirty-fourth Street,\u201d said Mrs. Vance. \u201cIt\u2019s such an interesting walk.", " You play cards, don\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cA little,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll have a game of cards. If your husband comes home bring him over.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s not coming to dinner to-night,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cWell, when he does come we\u2019ll call him in.\u201d Carrie acquiesced, and that evening met the portly Vance, an individual a few years younger than Hurstwood, and who owed his seemingly comfortable matrimonial state much more to his money than to his good looks. He thought well of Carrie upon the first glance and laid himself out to be genial, teaching her a new game of cards and talking to her about New York and its pleasures. Mrs. Vance played some upon the piano, and at last Hurstwood came. \u201cI am very glad to meet you,\u201d he said to Mrs. Vance when Carrie introduced him, showing much of the old grace which had captivated Carrie. \u201cDid you think your wife had run away?\u201d said Mr. Vance, extending his hand upon introduction. \u201cI didn\u2019t know but what she might have found a better husband,\u201d said Hurstwood. He now turned his attention to Mrs. Vance, and in a flash Carrie saw again what she for some time had subconsciously missed in Hurstwood\u2014the adroitness and flattery of which he was capable. She also saw that she was not well dressed\u2014not nearly as well dressed\u2014as Mrs. Vance. These were not vague ideas any longer. Her situation was cleared up for her. She felt that her life was becoming stale, and therein she felt cause for gloom.", " This did not appeal to him exactly, but he cared for her in his own way, and so the thing stood. Still, there was something in the details of the transactions which caused Carrie to feel that her requests were not a delight to him. He did not enthuse over the purchases. This led her to believe that neglect was creeping in, and so another small wedge was entered. Nevertheless, one of the results of Mrs. Vance\u2019s suggestions was the fact that on this occasion Carrie was dressed somewhat to her own satisfaction. She had on her best, but there was comfort in the thought that if she must confine herself to a _best_, it was neat and fitting. She looked the well-groomed woman of twenty-one, and Mrs. Vance praised her, which brought colour to her plump cheeks and a noticeable brightness into her large eyes. It was threatening rain, and Mr. Vance, at his wife\u2019s request, had called a coach. \u201cYour husband isn\u2019t coming?\u201d suggested Mr. Vance, as he met Carrie in his little parlour. \u201cNo; he said he wouldn\u2019t be home for dinner.\u201d \u201cBetter leave a little note for him, telling him where we are. He might turn up.\u201d \u201cI will,\u201d said Carrie, who had not thought of it before. \u201cTell him we\u2019ll be at Sherry\u2019s until eight o\u2019clock. He knows, though I guess.\u201d Carrie crossed the hall with rustling skirts, and scrawled the note, gloves on. When she returned a newcomer was in the Vance flat. \u201cMrs. Wheeler, let me introduce Mr. Ames, a cousin of mine,\u201d said Mrs. Vance."], "What job does Carrie first get in New York?": [" His beard was at least four days old. \u201cOh,\u201d thought Carrie, \u201cif she were to come here and see him?\u201d She shook her head in absolute misery. It looked as if her situation was becoming unbearable. Driven to desperation, she asked at dinner: \u201cDid you ever hear any more from that wholesale house?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want an inexperienced man.\u201d Carrie dropped the subject, feeling unable to say more. \u201cI met Mrs. Vance this afternoon,\u201d she said, after a time. \u201cDid, eh?\u201d he answered. \u201cThey\u2019re back in New York now,\u201d Carrie went on. \u201cShe did look so nice.\u201d \u201cWell, she can afford it as long as he puts up for it,\u201d returned Hurstwood. \u201cHe\u2019s got a soft job.\u201d Hurstwood was looking into the paper. He could not see the look of infinite weariness and discontent Carrie gave him. \u201cShe said she thought she\u2019d call here some day.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s been long getting round to it, hasn\u2019t she?\u201d said Hurstwood, with a kind of sarcasm. The woman didn\u2019t appeal to him from her spending side. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Carrie, angered by the man\u2019s attitude. \u201cPerhaps I didn\u2019t want her to come.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s too gay,\u201d said Hurstwood, significantly. \u201cNo one can keep up with her pace unless they\u2019ve got a lot of money.\u201d \u201cMr. Vance doesn\u2019t seem to find it very hard.\u201d \u201cHe may not now,\u201d answered Hurstwood, doggedly, well understanding the inference; \u201cbut his life isn\u2019t done yet. You can\u2019t tell what\u2019ll happen. He may get down like anybody else.\u201d There was something quite knavish in the man\u2019s attitude.", " She felt at times as if she could cry out and make such a row that some one would come to her aid; at other times it seemed an almost useless thing\u2014so far was she from any aid, no matter what she did. All the while Hurstwood was endeavouring to formulate his plea in such a way that it would strike home and bring her into sympathy with him. \u201cI was simply put where I didn\u2019t know what else to do.\u201d Carrie deigned no suggestion of hearing this. \u201cWhen I say you wouldn\u2019t come unless I could marry you, I decided to put everything else behind me and get you to come away with me. I\u2019m going off now to another city. I want to go to Montreal for a while, and then anywhere you want to. We\u2019ll go and live in New York, if you say.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll not have anything to do with you,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cI want to get off this train. Where are we going?\u201d \u201cTo Detroit,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cOh!\u201d said Carrie, in a burst of anguish. So distant and definite a point seemed to increase the difficulty. \u201cWon\u2019t you come along with me?\u201d he said, as if there was great danger that she would not. \u201cYou won\u2019t need to do anything but travel with me. I\u2019ll not trouble you in any way. You can see Montreal and New York, and then if you don\u2019t want to stay you can go back. It will be better than trying to go back to-night.\u201d The first gleam of fairness shone in this proposition for Carrie. It seemed a plausible thing to do, much as she feared his opposition if she tried to carry it out.", " No further opportunity for conversation occurred, but the next evening, when they were getting ready for the stage, this girl appeared anew at her side. \u201cThey say this show is going on the road next month.\u201d \u201cIs it?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cYes; do you think you\u2019ll go?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know; I guess so, if they\u2019ll take me.\u201d \u201cOh, they\u2019ll take you. I wouldn\u2019t go. They won\u2019t give you any more, and it will cost you everything you make to live. I never leave New York. There are too many shows going on here.\u201d \u201cCan you always get in another show?\u201d \u201cI always have. There\u2019s one going on up at the Broadway this month. I\u2019m going to try and get in that if this one really goes.\u201d Carrie heard this with aroused intelligence. Evidently it wasn\u2019t so very difficult to get on. Maybe she also could get a place if this show went away. \u201cDo they all pay about the same?\u201d she asked. \u201cYes. Sometimes you get a little more. This show doesn\u2019t pay very much.\u201d \u201cI get twelve,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cDo you?\u201d said the girl. \u201cThey pay me fifteen, and you do more work than I do. I wouldn\u2019t stand it if I were you. They\u2019re just giving you less because they think you don\u2019t know. You ought to be making fifteen.\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019m not,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cWell, you\u2019ll get more at the next place if you want it,\u201d went on the girl, who admired Carrie very much. \u201cYou do fine, and the manager knows it.\u201d To say the truth, Carrie did unconsciously move about with an air pleasing and somewhat distinctive.", " He ordered Carrie\u2019s trunk sent to the depot, where he had it sent by express to New York. No one seemed to be observing him, but he left at night. He was greatly agitated lest at the first station across the border or at the depot in New York there should be waiting for him an officer of the law. Carrie, ignorant of his theft and his fears, enjoyed the entry into the latter city in the morning. The round green hills sentinelling the broad, expansive bosom of the Hudson held her attention by their beauty as the train followed the line of the stream. She had heard of the Hudson River, the great city of New York, and now she looked out, filling her mind with the wonder of it. As the train turned east at Spuyten Duyvil and followed the east bank of the Harlem River, Hurstwood nervously called her attention to the fact that they were on the edge of the city. After her experience with Chicago, she expected long lines of cars\u2014a great highway of tracks\u2014and noted the difference. The sight of a few boats in the Harlem and more in the East River tickled her young heart. It was the first sign of the great sea. Next came a plain street with five-story brick flats, and then the train plunged into the tunnel. \u201cGrand Central Station!\u201d called the trainman, as, after a few minutes of darkness and smoke, daylight reappeared. Hurstwood arose and gathered up his small grip. He was screwed up to the highest tension."], "What does Carrie feel toward Hurstwood after she finds work as a chorus girl?": [" \u201cShe can afford to dress well,\u201d thought Carrie, \u201cand so could I, if I could only keep my money. I haven\u2019t a decent tie of any kind to wear.\u201d She put out her foot and looked at her shoe reflectively. \u201cI\u2019ll get a pair of shoes Saturday, anyhow; I don\u2019t care what happens.\u201d One of the sweetest and most sympathetic little chorus girls in the company made friends with her because in Carrie she found nothing to frighten her away. She was a gay little Manon, unwitting of society\u2019s fierce conception of morality, but, nevertheless, good to her neighbour and charitable. Little license was allowed the chorus in the matter of conversation, but, nevertheless, some was indulged in. \u201cIt\u2019s warm to-night, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said this girl, arrayed in pink fleshings and an imitation golden helmet. She also carried a shining shield. \u201cYes; it is,\u201d said Carrie, pleased that some one should talk to her. \u201cI\u2019m almost roasting,\u201d said the girl. Carrie looked into her pretty face, with its large blue eyes, and saw little beads of moisture. \u201cThere\u2019s more marching in this opera than ever I did before,\u201d added the girl. \u201cHave you been in others?\u201d asked Carrie, surprised at her experience. \u201cLots of them,\u201d said the girl; \u201chaven\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cThis is my first experience.\u201d \u201cOh, is it? I thought I saw you the time they ran \u2018The Queen\u2019s Mate\u2019 here.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Carrie, shaking her head; \u201cnot me.\u201d This conversation was interrupted by the blare of the orchestra and the sputtering of the calcium lights in the wings as the line was called to form for a new entrance.", " \u201cYou,\u201d he said, \u201cshow this girl how to do what you\u2019re doing. When you get through, come to me.\u201d The girl so addressed rose promptly and gave Carrie her place. \u201cIt isn\u2019t hard to do,\u201d she said, bending over. \u201cYou just take this so, fasten it with this clamp, and start the machine.\u201d She suited action to word, fastened the piece of leather, which was eventually to form the right half of the upper of a man\u2019s shoe, by little adjustable clamps, and pushed a small steel rod at the side of the machine. The latter jumped to the task of punching, with sharp, snapping clicks, cutting circular bits of leather out of the side of the upper, leaving the holes which were to hold the laces. After observing a few times, the girl let her work at it alone. Seeing that it was fairly well done, she went away. The pieces of leather came from the girl at the machine to her right, and were passed on to the girl at her left. Carrie saw at once that an average speed was necessary or the work would pile up on her and all those below would be delayed. She had no time to look about, and bent anxiously to her task. The girls at her left and right realised her predicament and feelings, and, in a way, tried to aid her, as much as they dared, by working slower. At this task she laboured incessantly for some time, finding relief from her own nervous fears and imaginings in the humdrum, mechanical movement of the machine.", " Then the other complications of love, desire, and opposition possessed him. His thoughts fled on before him upon eagles\u2019 wings. He could hardly wait until he should meet Carrie face to face. What was the night, after all, without her\u2014what the day? She must and should be his. For her part, Carrie had experienced a world of fancy and feeling since she had left him, the night before. She had listened to Drouet\u2019s enthusiastic maunderings with much regard for that part which concerned herself, with very little for that which affected his own gain. She kept him at such lengths as she could, because her thoughts were with her own triumph. She felt Hurstwood\u2019s passion as a delightful background to her own achievement, and she wondered what he would have to say. She was sorry for him, too, with that peculiar sorrow which finds something complimentary to itself in the misery of another. She was now experiencing the first shades of feeling of that subtle change which removes one out of the ranks of the suppliants into the lines of the dispensers of charity. She was, all in all, exceedingly happy. On the morrow, however, there was nothing in the papers concerning the event, and, in view of the flow of common, everyday things about, it now lost a shade of the glow of the previous evening. Drouet himself was not talking so much _of_ as _for_ her. He felt instinctively that, for some reason or other, he needed reconstruction in her regard.", " Carrie began to feel that there was something exuberant and unnatural in his manner. \u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way most girls begin,\u201d he went on, \u201cwho go on the stage. It\u2019s a good way to get experience.\u201d He was turning on her a glance of the companionable and persuasive manner. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult thing,\u201d he went on, \u201cbut there\u2019s always a chance, you know.\u201d Then, as if he suddenly remembered, he pulled out his watch and consulted it. \u201cI\u2019ve an appointment at two,\u201d he said, \u201cand I\u2019ve got to go to lunch now. Would you care to come and dine with me? We can talk it over there.\u201d \u201cOh, no,\u201d said Carrie, the whole motive of the man flashing on her at once. \u201cI have an engagement myself.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s too bad,\u201d he said, realising that he had been a little beforehand in his offer and that Carrie was about to go away. \u201cCome in later. I may know of something.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d she answered, with some trepidation and went out. \u201cShe was good-looking, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d said the manager\u2019s companion, who had not caught all the details of the game he had played. \u201cYes, in a way,\u201d said the other, sore to think the game had been lost. \u201cShe\u2019d never make an actress, though. Just another chorus girl\u2014that\u2019s all.\u201d This little experience nearly destroyed her ambition to call upon the manager at the Chicago Opera House, but she decided to do so after a time. He was of a more sedate turn of mind."], "What term do crowds of people shout at Hurstwood when he attempts to drive a trolley?": [" Her lips tightened. The feeling of mutual antagonism was increased. On the other hand, his interest in Drouet\u2019s little shop-girl grew in an almost evenly balanced proportion. That young lady, under the stress of her situation and the tutelage of her new friend, changed effectively. She had the aptitude of the struggler who seeks emancipation. The glow of a more showy life was not lost upon her. She did not grow in knowledge so much as she awakened in the matter of desire. Mrs. Hale\u2019s extended harangues upon the subjects of wealth and position taught her to distinguish between degrees of wealth. Mrs. Hale loved to drive in the afternoon in the sun when it was fine, and to satisfy her soul with a sight of those mansions and lawns which she could not afford. On the North Side had been erected a number of elegant mansions along what is now known as the North Shore Drive. The present lake wall of stone and granitoid was not then in place, but the road had been well laid out, the intermediate spaces of lawn were lovely to look upon, and the houses were thoroughly new and imposing. When the winter season had passed and the first fine days of the early spring appeared, Mrs. Hale secured a buggy for an afternoon and invited Carrie. They rode first through Lincoln Park and on far out towards Evanston, turning back at four and arriving at the north end of the Shore Drive at about five o\u2019clock.", " They demanded that the system be abolished, and that ten hours be considered a day\u2019s work, barring unavoidable delays, with $2.25 pay. They demanded immediate acceptance of these terms, which the various trolley companies refused. Hurstwood at first sympathised with the demands of these men\u2014indeed, it is a question whether he did not always sympathise with them to the end, belie him as his actions might. Reading nearly all the news, he was attracted first by the scare-heads with which the trouble was noted in the \u201cWorld.\u201d He read it fully\u2014the names of the seven companies involved, the number of men. \u201cThey\u2019re foolish to strike in this sort of weather,\u201d he thought to himself. \u201cLet \u2019em win if they can, though.\u201d The next day there was even a larger notice of it. \u201cBrooklynites Walk,\u201d said the \u201cWorld.\u201d \u201cKnights of Labour Tie up the Trolley Lines Across the Bridge.\u201d \u201cAbout Seven Thousand Men Out.\u201d Hurstwood read this, formulating to himself his own idea of what would be the outcome. He was a great believer in the strength of corporations. \u201cThey can\u2019t win,\u201d he said, concerning the men. \u201cThey haven\u2019t any money. The police will protect the companies. They\u2019ve got to. The public has to have its cars.\u201d He didn\u2019t sympathise with the corporations, but strength was with them. So was property and public utility. \u201cThose fellows can\u2019t win,\u201d he thought. Among other things, he noticed a circular issued by one of the companies, which read: ATLANTIC AVENUE RAILROAD SPECIAL NOTICE The motormen and conductors and other employees of this company having abruptly left its service, an opportunity is now given to all loyal men who have struck against their will to be reinstated, providing they will make their applications by twelve o\u2019clock noon on Wednesday, January 16th.", " It seemed a most irritating drag upon all his desires and opportunities. For all this, he still retained the semblance of leadership and control, even though his wife was straining to revolt. Her display of temper and open assertion of opposition were based upon nothing more than the feeling that she could do it. She had no special evidence wherewith to justify herself\u2014the knowledge of something which would give her both authority and excuse. The latter was all that was lacking, however, to give a solid foundation to what, in a way, seemed groundless discontent. The clear proof of one overt deed was the cold breath needed to convert the lowering clouds of suspicion into a rain of wrath. An inkling of untoward deeds on the part of Hurstwood had come. Doctor Beale, the handsome resident physician of the neighbourhood, met Mrs. Hurstwood at her own doorstep some days after Hurstwood and Carrie had taken the drive west on Washington Boulevard. Dr. Beale, coming east on the same drive, had recognised Hurstwood, but not before he was quite past him. He was not so sure of Carrie\u2014did not know whether it was Hurstwood\u2019s wife or daughter. \u201cYou don\u2019t speak to your friends when you meet them out driving, do you?\u201d he said, jocosely, to Mrs. Hurstwood. \u201cIf I see them, I do. Where was I?\u201d \u201cOn Washington Boulevard.\u201d he answered, expecting her eye to light with immediate remembrance. She shook her head.", " Her little bravado made her feel as if she ought to make amends. In a little while their old thoughts returned to both. \u201cShe\u2019s making more than she says,\u201d thought Hurstwood. \u201cShe says she\u2019s making twelve, but that wouldn\u2019t buy all those things. I don\u2019t care. Let her keep her money. I\u2019ll get something again one of these days. Then she can go to the deuce.\u201d He only said this in his anger, but it prefigured a possible course of action and attitude well enough. \u201cI don\u2019t care,\u201d thought Carrie. \u201cHe ought to be told to get out and do something. It isn\u2019t right that I should support him.\u201d In these days Carrie was introduced to several youths, friends of Miss Osborne, who were of the kind most aptly described as gay and festive. They called once to get Miss Osborne for an afternoon drive. Carrie was with her at the time. \u201cCome and go along,\u201d said Lola. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cOh, yes, come and go. What have you got to do?\u201d \u201cI have to be home by five,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cWhat for?\u201d \u201cOh, dinner.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ll take us to dinner,\u201d said Lola. \u201cOh, no,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cI won\u2019t go. I can\u2019t.\u201d \u201cOh, do come. They\u2019re awful nice boys. We\u2019ll get you back in time. We\u2019re only going for a drive in Central Park.\u201d Carrie thought a while, and at last yielded. \u201cNow, I must be back by half-past four,\u201d she said. The information went in one ear of Lola and out the other. After Drouet and Hurstwood, there was the least touch of cynicism in her attitude toward young men\u2014especially of the gay and frivolous sort."], "Who does Carrie decide to move in with after getting her first speaking part in New York?": [" He thought upon the subject rather actively the first few days he was in New York, and decided that he must act quickly. As a consequence, he consulted the business opportunities advertised in the morning papers and began investigations on his own account. That was not before he had become settled, however. Carrie and he went looking for a flat, as arranged, and found one in Seventy-eighth Street near Amsterdam Avenue. It was a five-story building, and their flat was on the third floor. Owing to the fact that the street was not yet built up solidly, it was possible to see east to the green tops of the trees in Central Park and west to the broad waters of the Hudson, a glimpse of which was to be had out of the west windows. For the privilege of six rooms and a bath, running in a straight line, they were compelled to pay thirty-five dollars a month\u2014an average, and yet exorbitant, rent for a home at the time. Carrie noticed the difference between the size of the rooms here and in Chicago and mentioned it. \u201cYou\u2019ll not find anything better, dear,\u201d said Hurstwood, \u201cunless you go into one of the old-fashioned houses, and then you won\u2019t have any of these conveniences.\u201d Carrie picked out the new abode because of its newness and bright wood-work. It was one of the very new ones supplied with steam heat, which was a great advantage. The stationary range, hot and cold water, dumb-waiter, speaking tubes, and call-bell for the janitor pleased her very much.", " They went out, and at the corner the commonplace Irish individual was standing, eyeing him. Hurstwood could scarcely refrain from showing that he knew of this chap\u2019s presence. The insolence in the fellow\u2019s eye was galling. Still they passed, and he explained to Carrie concerning the city. Another restaurant was not long in showing itself, and here they entered. \u201cWhat a queer town this is,\u201d said Carrie, who marvelled at it solely because it was not like Chicago. \u201cIt isn\u2019t as lively as Chicago,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Carrie, whose feelings were already localised in the great Western city. \u201cWell, it isn\u2019t as interesting,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cWhat\u2019s here?\u201d asked Carrie, wondering at his choosing to visit this town. \u201cNothing much,\u201d returned Hurstwood. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a resort. There\u2019s some pretty scenery about here.\u201d Carrie listened, but with a feeling of unrest. There was much about her situation which destroyed the possibility of appreciation. \u201cWe won\u2019t stay here long,\u201d said Hurstwood, who was now really glad to note her dissatisfaction. \u201cYou pick out your clothes as soon as breakfast is over and we\u2019ll run down to New York soon. You\u2019ll like that. It\u2019s a lot more like a city than any place outside Chicago.\u201d He was really planning to slip out and away. He would see what these detectives would do\u2014what move his employers at Chicago would make\u2014then he would slip away\u2014down to New York, where it was easy to hide.", " No further opportunity for conversation occurred, but the next evening, when they were getting ready for the stage, this girl appeared anew at her side. \u201cThey say this show is going on the road next month.\u201d \u201cIs it?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cYes; do you think you\u2019ll go?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know; I guess so, if they\u2019ll take me.\u201d \u201cOh, they\u2019ll take you. I wouldn\u2019t go. They won\u2019t give you any more, and it will cost you everything you make to live. I never leave New York. There are too many shows going on here.\u201d \u201cCan you always get in another show?\u201d \u201cI always have. There\u2019s one going on up at the Broadway this month. I\u2019m going to try and get in that if this one really goes.\u201d Carrie heard this with aroused intelligence. Evidently it wasn\u2019t so very difficult to get on. Maybe she also could get a place if this show went away. \u201cDo they all pay about the same?\u201d she asked. \u201cYes. Sometimes you get a little more. This show doesn\u2019t pay very much.\u201d \u201cI get twelve,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cDo you?\u201d said the girl. \u201cThey pay me fifteen, and you do more work than I do. I wouldn\u2019t stand it if I were you. They\u2019re just giving you less because they think you don\u2019t know. You ought to be making fifteen.\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019m not,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cWell, you\u2019ll get more at the next place if you want it,\u201d went on the girl, who admired Carrie very much. \u201cYou do fine, and the manager knows it.\u201d To say the truth, Carrie did unconsciously move about with an air pleasing and somewhat distinctive.", " Experience of the world and of necessity was in her favour. No longer the lightest word of a man made her head dizzy. She had learned that men could change and fail. Flattery in its most palpable form had lost its force with her. It required superiority\u2014kindly superiority\u2014to move her\u2014the superiority of a genius like Ames. \u201cI don\u2019t like the actors in our company,\u201d she told Lola one day. \u201cThey\u2019re all so struck on themselves.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you think Mr. Barclay\u2019s pretty nice?\u201d inquired Lola, who had received a condescending smile or two from that quarter. \u201cOh, he\u2019s nice enough,\u201d answered Carrie; \u201cbut he isn\u2019t sincere. He assumes such an air.\u201d Lola felt for her first hold upon Carrie in the following manner: \u201cAre you paying room-rent where you are?\u201d \u201cCertainly,\u201d answered Carrie. \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cI know where I could get the loveliest room and bath, cheap. It\u2019s too big for me, but it would be just right for two, and the rent is only six dollars a week for both.\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cIn Seventeenth Street.\u201d \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know as I\u2019d care to change,\u201d said Carrie, who was already turning over the three-dollar rate in her mind. She was thinking if she had only herself to support this would leave her seventeen for herself. Nothing came of this until after the Brooklyn adventure of Hurstwood\u2019s and her success with the speaking part. Then she began to feel as if she must be free. She thought of leaving Hurstwood and thus making him act for himself, but he had developed such peculiar traits she feared he might resist any effort to throw him off."], "How does Hurstwood learn about Carrie\u2019s acting success?": [" \u201cIf you do, maybe I can help you. I\u2019ve got a lot of friends in that line.\u201d She made no answer to this. \u201cDon\u2019t go and try to knock around now without any money. Let me help you,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s no easy thing to go on your own hook here.\u201d Carrie only rocked back and forth in her chair. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to go up against a hard game that way.\u201d He bestirred himself about some other details and Carrie rocked on. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me all about this thing,\u201d he said, after a time, \u201cand let\u2019s call it off? You don\u2019t really care for Hurstwood, do you?\u201d \u201cWhy do you want to start on that again?\u201d said Carrie. \u201cYou were to blame.\u201d \u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t,\u201d he answered. \u201cYes, you were, too,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have ever told me such a story as that.\u201d \u201cBut you didn\u2019t have much to do with him, did you?\u201d went on Drouet, anxious for his own peace of mind to get some direct denial from her. \u201cI won\u2019t talk about it,\u201d said Carrie, pained at the quizzical turn the peace arrangement had taken. \u201cWhat\u2019s the use of acting like that now, Cad?\u201d insisted the drummer, stopping in his work and putting up a hand expressively. \u201cYou might let me know where I stand, at least.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t,\u201d said Carrie, feeling no refuge but in anger. \u201cWhatever has happened is your own fault.\u201d \u201cThen you do care for him?\u201d said Drouet, stopping completely and experiencing a rush of feeling. \u201cOh, stop!\u201d said Carrie. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll not be made a fool of,\u201d exclaimed Drouet.", " One of the officers addressed him. \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d \u201cI want to see if I can get a place.\u201d \u201cThe offices are up those steps,\u201d said the bluecoat. His face was a very neutral thing to contemplate. In his heart of hearts, he sympathised with the strikers and hated this \u201cscab.\u201d In his heart of hearts, also, he felt the dignity and use of the police force, which commanded order. Of its true social significance, he never once dreamed. His was not the mind for that. The two feelings blended in him\u2014neutralised one another and him. He would have fought for this man as determinedly as for himself, and yet only so far as commanded. Strip him of his uniform, and he would have soon picked his side. Hurstwood ascended a dusty flight of steps and entered a small, dust-coloured office, in which were a railing, a long desk, and several clerks. \u201cWell, sir?\u201d said a middle-aged man, looking up at him from the long desk. \u201cDo you want to hire any men?\u201d inquired Hurstwood. \u201cWhat are you\u2014a motorman?\u201d \u201cNo; I\u2019m not anything,\u201d said Hurstwood. He was not at all abashed by his position. He knew these people needed men. If one didn\u2019t take him, another would. This man could take him or leave him, just as he chose. \u201cWell, we prefer experienced men, of course,\u201d said the man. He paused, while Hurstwood smiled indifferently. Then he added: \u201cStill, I guess you can learn. What is your name?\u201d \u201cWheeler,\u201d said Hurstwood.", " \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cI think I\u2019ll try some of the managers.\u201d Hurstwood heard this, dead to the horror of it. He rocked a little to and fro, and chewed at his finger. It seemed all very natural in such extreme states. He would do better later on. Chapter XXXVIII. IN ELF LAND DISPORTING: THE GRIM WORLD WITHOUT When Carrie renewed her search, as she did the next day, going to the Casino, she found that in the opera chorus, as in other fields, employment is difficult to secure. Girls who can stand in a line and look pretty are as numerous as labourers who can swing a pick. She found there was no discrimination between one and the other of applicants, save as regards a conventional standard of prettiness and form. Their own opinion or knowledge of their ability went for nothing. \u201cWhere shall I find Mr. Gray?\u201d she asked of a sulky doorman at the stage entrance of the Casino. \u201cYou can\u2019t see him now; he\u2019s busy.\u201d \u201cDo you know when I can see him?\u201d \u201cGot an appointment with him?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cWell, you\u2019ll have to call at his office.\u201d \u201cOh, dear!\u201d exclaimed Carrie. \u201cWhere is his office?\u201d He gave her the number. She knew there was no need of calling there now. He would not be in. Nothing remained but to employ the intermediate hours in search. The dismal story of ventures in other places is quickly told. Mr. Daly saw no one save by appointment. Carrie waited an hour in a dingy office, quite in spite of obstacles, to learn this fact of the placid, indifferent Mr. Dorney.", " She did not seem to feel that he was wretched. She would have done nearly as well with a block of wood. The accessories she needed were within her own imagination. The acting of others could not affect them. \u201cAnd you repent already?\u201d she said, slowly. \u201cI lost you,\u201d he said, seizing her little hand, \u201cand I was at the mercy of any flirt who chose to give me an inviting look. It was your fault\u2014you know it was\u2014why did you leave me?\u201d Carrie turned slowly away, and seemed to be mastering some impulse in silence. Then she turned back. \u201cRay,\u201d she said, \u201cthe greatest happiness I have ever felt has been the thought that all your affection was forever bestowed upon a virtuous woman, your equal in family, fortune, and accomplishments. What a revelation do you make to me now! What is it makes you continually war with your happiness?\u201d The last question was asked so simply that it came to the audience and the lover as a personal thing. At last it came to the part where the lover exclaimed, \u201cBe to me as you used to be.\u201d Carrie answered, with affecting sweetness, \u201cI cannot be that to you, but I can speak in the spirit of the Laura who is dead to you forever.\u201d \u201cBe it as you will,\u201d said Patton. Hurstwood leaned forward. The whole audience was silent and intent. \u201cLet the woman you look upon be wise or vain,\u201d said Carrie, her eyes bent sadly upon the lover, who had sunk into a seat, \u201cbeautiful or homely, rich or poor, she has but one thing she can really give or refuse\u2014her heart.\u201d Drouet felt a scratch in his throat."], "How does Hurstwood begin generating income after spending three weeks in a hospital with pneumonia?": [" \u201cI\u2019ll give you a dollar more if you make good time.\u201d The cabby beat his horse into a sort of imitation gallop which was fairly fast, however. On the way Hurstwood thought what to do. Reaching the number, he hurried up the steps and did not spare the bell in waking the servant. \u201cIs Mrs. Drouet in?\u201d he asked. \u201cYes,\u201d said the astonished girl. \u201cTell her to dress and come to the door at once. Her husband is in the hospital, injured, and wants to see her.\u201d The servant girl hurried upstairs, convinced by the man\u2019s strained and emphatic manner. \u201cWhat!\u201d said Carrie, lighting the gas and searching for her clothes. \u201cMr. Drouet is hurt and in the hospital. He wants to see you. The cab\u2019s downstairs.\u201d Carrie dressed very rapidly, and soon appeared below, forgetting everything save the necessities. \u201cDrouet is hurt,\u201d said Hurstwood quickly. \u201cHe wants to see you. Come quickly.\u201d Carrie was so bewildered that she swallowed the whole story. \u201cGet in,\u201d said Hurstwood, helping her and jumping after. The cabby began to turn the horse around. \u201cMichigan Central depot,\u201d he said, standing up and speaking so low that Carrie could not hear, \u201cas fast as you can go.\u201d Chapter XXVIII. A PILGRIM, AN OUTLAW: THE SPIRIT DETAINED The cab had not travelled a short block before Carrie, settling herself and thoroughly waking in the night atmosphere, asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with him? Is he hurt badly?\u201d \u201cIt isn\u2019t anything very serious,\u201d Hurstwood said solemnly.", " It seemed all he could do to crawl to his room, where he remained for a day. \u201cThat man Wheeler\u2019s sick,\u201d reported one of the lackeys to the night clerk. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with him?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. He\u2019s got a high fever.\u201d The hotel physician looked at him. \u201cBetter send him to Bellevue,\u201d he recommended. \u201cHe\u2019s got pneumonia.\u201d Accordingly, he was carted away. In three weeks the worst was over, but it was nearly the first of May before his strength permitted him to be turned out. Then he was discharged. No more weakly looking object ever strolled out into the spring sunshine than the once hale, lusty manager. All his corpulency had fled. His face was thin and pale, his hands white, his body flabby. Clothes and all, he weighed but one hundred and thirty-five pounds. Some old garments had been given him\u2014a cheap brown coat and misfit pair of trousers. Also some change and advice. He was told to apply to the charities. Again he resorted to the Bowery lodging-house, brooding over where to look. From this it was but a step to beggary. \u201cWhat can a man do?\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t starve.\u201d His first application was in sunny Second Avenue. A well-dressed man came leisurely strolling toward him out of Stuyvesant Park. Hurstwood nerved himself and sidled near. \u201cWould you mind giving me ten cents?\u201d he said, directly. \u201cI\u2019m in a position where I must ask some one.\u201d The man scarcely looked at him, fished in his vest pocket and took out a dime.", " \u201cWhy, I know it. I\u2019ve always known it,\u201d said Drouet. Carrie was feeling about for a right thought. She was making a most miserable showing, and yet feelings were generating within her which were anything but crumbling cowardice. \u201cI thought I told you,\u201d he added. \u201cNo, you didn\u2019t,\u201d she contradicted, suddenly recovering her voice. \u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything of the kind.\u201d Drouet listened to her in astonishment. This was something new. \u201cI thought I did,\u201d he said. Carrie looked around her very solemnly, and then went over to the window. \u201cYou oughtn\u2019t to have had anything to do with him,\u201d said Drouet in an injured tone, \u201cafter all I\u2019ve done for you.\u201d \u201cYou,\u201d said Carrie, \u201cyou! What have you done for me?\u201d Her little brain had been surging with contradictory feelings\u2014shame at exposure, shame at Hurstwood\u2019s perfidy, anger at Drouet\u2019s deception, the mockery he had made at her. Now one clear idea came into her head. He was at fault. There was no doubt about it. Why did he bring Hurstwood out\u2014Hurstwood, a married man, and never say a word to her? Never mind now about Hurstwood\u2019s perfidy\u2014why had he done this? Why hadn\u2019t he warned her? There he stood now, guilty of this miserable breach of confidence and talking about what he had done for her! \u201cWell, I like that,\u201d exclaimed Drouet, little realising the fire his remark had generated. \u201cI think I\u2019ve done a good deal.\u201d \u201cYou have, eh?\u201d she answered. \u201cYou\u2019ve deceived me\u2014that\u2019s what you\u2019ve done.", " Even Hurstwood was doing well enough, and she was anxious that his small real estate adventures should prosper. His property holdings, as yet, were rather small, but his income was pleasing and his position with Fitzgerald and Moy was fixed. Both those gentlemen were on pleasant and rather informal terms with him. The atmosphere which such personalities would create must be apparent to all. It worked out in a thousand little conversations, all of which were of the same calibre. \u201cI\u2019m going up to Fox Lake to-morrow,\u201d announced George, Jr., at the dinner table one Friday evening. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on up there?\u201d queried Mrs. Hurstwood. \u201cEddie Fahrway\u2019s got a new steam launch, and he wants me to come up and see how it works.\u201d \u201cHow much did it cost him?\u201d asked his mother. \u201cOh, over two thousand dollars. He says it\u2019s a dandy.\u201d \u201cOld Fahrway must be making money,\u201d put in Hurstwood. \u201cHe is, I guess. Jack told me they were shipping Vegacura to Australia now\u2014said they sent a whole box to Cape Town last week.\u201d \u201cJust think of that!\u201d said Mrs. Hurstwood, \u201cand only four years ago they had that basement in Madison Street.\u201d \u201cJack told me they were going to put up a six-story building next spring in Robey Street.\u201d \u201cJust think of that!\u201d said Jessica. On this particular occasion Hurstwood wished to leave early. \u201cI guess I\u2019ll be going down town,\u201d he remarked, rising. \u201cAre we going to McVicker\u2019s Monday?\u201d questioned Mrs. Hurstwood, without rising."], "What does the homeless man known as \u201cthe captain\u201d solicit donations for?": [" Once there, Hurstwood breathed easier. He felt as if the world were not quite so bad with such a good man in it. Others seemed to feel like himself about this. \u201cCaptain\u2019s a great feller, ain\u2019t he?\u201d said the man ahead\u2014a little, woebegone, helpless-looking sort of individual, who looked as though he had ever been the sport and care of fortune. \u201cYes,\u201d said Hurstwood, indifferently. \u201cHuh! there\u2019s a lot back there yet,\u201d said a man farther up, leaning out and looking back at the applicants for whom the captain was pleading. \u201cYes. Must be over a hundred to-night,\u201d said another. \u201cLook at the guy in the cab,\u201d observed a third. A cab had stopped. Some gentleman in evening dress reached out a bill to the captain, who took it with simple thanks and turned away to his line. There was a general craning of necks as the jewel in the white shirt front sparkled and the cab moved off. Even the crowd gaped in awe. \u201cThat fixes up nine men for the night,\u201d said the captain, counting out as many of the line near him. \u201cLine up over there. Now, then, there are only seven. I need twelve cents.\u201d Money came slowly. In the course of time the crowd thinned out to a meagre handful. Fifth Avenue, save for an occasional cab or foot passenger, was bare. Broadway was thinly peopled with pedestrians. Only now and then a stranger passing noticed the small group, handed out a coin, and went away, unheeding. The captain remained stolid and determined.", " \u201cSilence!\u201d exclaimed the captain. \u201cNow, then, gentlemen, these men are without beds. They have to have some place to sleep to-night. They can\u2019t lie out in the streets. I need twelve cents to put one of them to bed. Who will give it to me?\u201d No reply. \u201cWell, we\u2019ll have to wait here, boys, until some one does. Twelve cents isn\u2019t so very much for one man.\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s fifteen,\u201d exclaimed a young man, peering forward with strained eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s all I can afford.\u201d \u201cAll right. Now I have fifteen. Step out of the line,\u201d and seizing one by the shoulder, the captain marched him off a little way and stood him up alone. Coming back, he resumed his place and began again. \u201cI have three cents left. These men must be put to bed somehow. There are\u201d\u2014counting\u2014\u201cone, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve men. Nine cents more will put the next man to bed; give him a good, comfortable bed for the night. I go right along and look after that myself. Who will give me nine cents?\u201d One of the watchers, this time a middle-aged man, handed him a five-cent piece. \u201cNow, I have eight cents. Four more will give this man a bed. Come, gentlemen. We are going very slow this evening. You all have good beds. How about these?\u201d \u201cHere you are,\u201d remarked a bystander, putting a coin into his hand. \u201cThat,\u201d said the captain, looking at the coin, \u201cpays for two beds for two men and gives me five on the next one.", " This unique individual was no less than an ex-soldier turned religionist, who, having suffered the whips and privations of our peculiar social system, had concluded that his duty to the God which he conceived lay in aiding his fellow-man. The form of aid which he chose to administer was entirely original with himself. It consisted of securing a bed for all such homeless wayfarers as should apply to him at this particular spot, though he had scarcely the wherewithal to provide a comfortable habitation for himself. Taking his place amid this lightsome atmosphere, he would stand, his stocky figure cloaked in a great cape overcoat, his head protected by a broad slouch hat, awaiting the applicants who had in various ways learned the nature of his charity. For a while he would stand alone, gazing like any idler upon an ever-fascinating scene. On the evening in question, a policeman passing saluted him as \u201ccaptain,\u201d in a friendly way. An urchin who had frequently seen him before, stopped to gaze. All others took him for nothing out of the ordinary, save in the matter of dress, and conceived of him as a stranger whistling and idling for his own amusement. As the first half-hour waned, certain characters appeared. Here and there in the passing crowds one might see, now and then, a loiterer edging interestedly near. A slouchy figure crossed the opposite corner and glanced furtively in his direction.", " What use to contend? He was weary to-night. It was a simple way out of one difficulty, at least. To-morrow, maybe, he would do better. Back of him, where some of those were whose beds were safe, a relaxed air was apparent. The strain of uncertainty being removed, he heard them talking with moderate freedom and some leaning toward sociability. Politics, religion, the state of the government, some newspaper sensations, and the more notorious facts the world over, found mouthpieces and auditors there. Cracked and husky voices pronounced forcibly upon odd matters. Vague and rambling observations were made in reply. There were squints, and leers, and some dull, ox-like stares from those who were too dull or too weary to converse. Standing tells. Hurstwood became more weary waiting. He thought he should drop soon and shifted restlessly from one foot to the other. At last his turn came. The man ahead had been paid for and gone to the blessed line of success. He was now first, and already the captain was talking for him. \u201cTwelve cents, gentlemen\u2014twelve cents puts this man to bed. He wouldn\u2019t stand here in the cold if he had any place to go.\u201d Hurstwood swallowed something that rose to his throat. Hunger and weakness had made a coward of him. \u201cHere you are,\u201d said a stranger, handing money to the captain. Now the latter put a kindly hand on the ex-manager\u2019s shoulder. \u201cLine up over there,\u201d he said."], "Who tells Carrie about the theft Hurstwood perpetrated before the two of them left Chicago?": [" They went out, and at the corner the commonplace Irish individual was standing, eyeing him. Hurstwood could scarcely refrain from showing that he knew of this chap\u2019s presence. The insolence in the fellow\u2019s eye was galling. Still they passed, and he explained to Carrie concerning the city. Another restaurant was not long in showing itself, and here they entered. \u201cWhat a queer town this is,\u201d said Carrie, who marvelled at it solely because it was not like Chicago. \u201cIt isn\u2019t as lively as Chicago,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Carrie, whose feelings were already localised in the great Western city. \u201cWell, it isn\u2019t as interesting,\u201d said Hurstwood. \u201cWhat\u2019s here?\u201d asked Carrie, wondering at his choosing to visit this town. \u201cNothing much,\u201d returned Hurstwood. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a resort. There\u2019s some pretty scenery about here.\u201d Carrie listened, but with a feeling of unrest. There was much about her situation which destroyed the possibility of appreciation. \u201cWe won\u2019t stay here long,\u201d said Hurstwood, who was now really glad to note her dissatisfaction. \u201cYou pick out your clothes as soon as breakfast is over and we\u2019ll run down to New York soon. You\u2019ll like that. It\u2019s a lot more like a city than any place outside Chicago.\u201d He was really planning to slip out and away. He would see what these detectives would do\u2014what move his employers at Chicago would make\u2014then he would slip away\u2014down to New York, where it was easy to hide.", " He ordered Carrie\u2019s trunk sent to the depot, where he had it sent by express to New York. No one seemed to be observing him, but he left at night. He was greatly agitated lest at the first station across the border or at the depot in New York there should be waiting for him an officer of the law. Carrie, ignorant of his theft and his fears, enjoyed the entry into the latter city in the morning. The round green hills sentinelling the broad, expansive bosom of the Hudson held her attention by their beauty as the train followed the line of the stream. She had heard of the Hudson River, the great city of New York, and now she looked out, filling her mind with the wonder of it. As the train turned east at Spuyten Duyvil and followed the east bank of the Harlem River, Hurstwood nervously called her attention to the fact that they were on the edge of the city. After her experience with Chicago, she expected long lines of cars\u2014a great highway of tracks\u2014and noted the difference. The sight of a few boats in the Harlem and more in the East River tickled her young heart. It was the first sign of the great sea. Next came a plain street with five-story brick flats, and then the train plunged into the tunnel. \u201cGrand Central Station!\u201d called the trainman, as, after a few minutes of darkness and smoke, daylight reappeared. Hurstwood arose and gathered up his small grip. He was screwed up to the highest tension.", " \u201cI\u2019m going to have a business of my own pretty soon,\u201d he observed in one place. \u201cI can get backing for two hundred thousand dollars.\u201d Carrie listened most good-naturedly. \u201cSay,\u201d he said, suddenly; \u201cwhere is Hurstwood now?\u201d Carrie flushed a little. \u201cHe\u2019s here in New York, I guess,\u201d she said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him for some time.\u201d Drouet mused for a moment. He had not been sure until now that the ex-manager was not an influential figure in the background. He imagined not; but this assurance relieved him. It must be that Carrie had got rid of him\u2014as well she ought, he thought. \u201cA man always makes a mistake when he does anything like that,\u201d he observed. \u201cLike what?\u201d said Carrie, unwitting of what was coming. \u201cOh, you know,\u201d and Drouet waved her intelligence, as it were, with his hand. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d she answered. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cWhy that affair in Chicago\u2014the time he left.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what you are talking about,\u201d said Carrie. Could it be he would refer so rudely to Hurstwood\u2019s flight with her? \u201cOho!\u201d said Drouet, incredulously. \u201cYou knew he took ten thousand dollars with him when he left, didn\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cWhat!\u201d said Carrie. \u201cYou don\u2019t mean to say he stole money, do you?\u201d \u201cWhy,\u201d said Drouet, puzzled at her tone, \u201cyou knew that, didn\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cWhy, no,\u201d said Carrie. \u201cOf course I didn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWell, that\u2019s funny,\u201d said Drouet. \u201cHe did, you know. It was in all the papers.\u201d \u201cHow much did you say he took?\u201d said Carrie.", " She heard him open the top of the wardrobe and take out his hat. Then the dining-room door closed, and she knew he had gone. After a few moments of silence, she stood up, dry-eyed, and looked out the window. Hurstwood was just strolling up the street, from the flat, toward Sixth Avenue. The latter made progress along Thirteenth and across Fourteenth Street to Union Square. \u201cLook for work!\u201d he said to himself. \u201cLook for work! She tells me to get out and look for work.\u201d He tried to shield himself from his own mental accusation, which told him that she was right. \u201cWhat a cursed thing that Mrs. Vance\u2019s call was, anyhow,\u201d he thought. \u201cStood right there, and looked me over. I know what she was thinking.\u201d He remembered the few times he had seen her in Seventy-eight Street. She was always a swell-looker, and he had tried to put on the air of being worthy of such as she, in front of her. Now, to think she had caught him looking this way. He wrinkled his forehead in his distress. \u201cThe devil!\u201d he said a dozen times in an hour. It was a quarter after four when he left the house. Carrie was in tears. There would be no dinner that night. \u201cWhat the deuce,\u201d he said, swaggering mentally to hide his own shame from himself. \u201cI\u2019m not so bad. I\u2019m not down yet.\u201d He looked around the square, and seeing the several large hotels, decided to go to one for dinner. He would get his papers and make himself comfortable there."], "How does Hurstwood die, unbeknownst to Carrie?": [" Then he gathered his cloak about him and strolled out into the night. \u201cI can\u2019t stand much of this,\u201d said Hurstwood, whose legs ached him painfully, as he sat down upon the miserable bunk in the small, lightless chamber allotted to him. \u201cI\u2019ve got to eat, or I\u2019ll die.\u201d Chapter XLVI. STIRRING TROUBLED WATERS Playing in New York one evening on this her return, Carrie was putting the finishing touches to her toilet before leaving for the night, when a commotion near the stage door caught her ear. It included a familiar voice. \u201cNever mind, now. I want to see Miss Madenda.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll have to send in your card.\u201d \u201cOh, come off! Here.\u201d A half-dollar was passed over, and now a knock came at her dressing-room door. Carrie opened it. \u201cWell, well!\u201d said Drouet. \u201cI do swear! Why, how are you? I knew that was you the moment I saw you.\u201d Carrie fell back a pace, expecting a most embarrassing conversation. \u201cAren\u2019t you going to shake hands with me? Well, you\u2019re a dandy! That\u2019s all right, shake hands.\u201d Carrie put out her hand, smiling, if for nothing more than the man\u2019s exuberant good-nature. Though older, he was but slightly changed. The same fine clothes, the same stocky body, the same rosy countenance. \u201cThat fellow at the door there didn\u2019t want to let me in, until I paid him. I knew it was you, all right. Say, you\u2019ve got a great show. You do your part fine. I knew you would. I just happened to be passing to-night and thought I\u2019d drop in for a few minutes.", " He must even take her to supper, shamming. He finally went about and asked how she was getting along. The actors were all dressing, talking, hurrying about. Drouet was palavering himself with the looseness of excitement and passion. The manager mastered himself only by a great effort. \u201cWe are going to supper, of course,\u201d he said, with a voice that was a mockery of his heart. \u201cOh, yes,\u201d said Carrie, smiling. The little actress was in fine feather. She was realising now what it was to be petted. For once she was the admired, the sought-for. The independence of success now made its first faint showing. With the tables turned, she was looking down, rather than up, to her lover. She did not fully realise that this was so, but there was something in condescension coming from her which was infinitely sweet. When she was ready they climbed into the waiting coach and drove down town; once, only, did she find an opportunity to express her feeling, and that was when the manager preceded Drouet in the coach and sat beside her. Before Drouet was fully in she had squeezed Hurstwood\u2019s hand in a gentle, impulsive manner. The manager was beside himself with affection. He could have sold his soul to be with her alone. \u201cAh,\u201d he thought, \u201cthe agony of it.\u201d Drouet hung on, thinking he was all in all. The dinner was spoiled by his enthusiasm. Hurstwood went home feeling as if he should die if he did not find affectionate relief.", " She answered that she had not. \u201cWell,\u201d said the foreman, scratching his ear meditatively, \u201cwe do need a stitcher. We like experienced help, though. We\u2019ve hardly got time to break people in.\u201d He paused and looked away out of the window. \u201cWe might, though, put you at finishing,\u201d he concluded reflectively. \u201cHow much do you pay a week?\u201d ventured Carrie, emboldened by a certain softness in the man\u2019s manner and his simplicity of address. \u201cThree and a half,\u201d he answered. \u201cOh,\u201d she was about to exclaim, but checked herself and allowed her thoughts to die without expression. \u201cWe\u2019re not exactly in need of anybody,\u201d he went on vaguely, looking her over as one would a package. \u201cYou can come on Monday morning, though,\u201d he added, \u201cand I\u2019ll put you to work.\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d said Carrie weakly. \u201cIf you come, bring an apron,\u201d he added. He walked away and left her standing by the elevator, never so much as inquiring her name. While the appearance of the shop and the announcement of the price paid per week operated very much as a blow to Carrie\u2019s fancy, the fact that work of any kind was offered after so rude a round of experience was gratifying. She could not begin to believe that she would take the place, modest as her aspirations were. She had been used to better than that. Her mere experience and the free out-of-door life of the country caused her nature to revolt at such confinement. Dirt had never been her share.", " It gave him more respect for Carrie. Her appearance came into a new light, under Hurstwood\u2019s appreciation. The situation livened considerably. \u201cNow, let me see,\u201d said Hurstwood, looking over Carrie\u2019s shoulder very deferentially. \u201cWhat have you?\u201d He studied for a moment. \u201cThat\u2019s rather good,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky. Now, I\u2019ll show you how to trounce your husband. You take my advice.\u201d \u201cHere,\u201d said Drouet, \u201cif you two are going to scheme together, I won\u2019t stand a ghost of a show. Hurstwood\u2019s a regular sharp.\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s your wife. She brings me luck. Why shouldn\u2019t she win?\u201d Carrie looked gratefully at Hurstwood, and smiled at Drouet. The former took the air of a mere friend. He was simply there to enjoy himself. Anything that Carrie did was pleasing to him, nothing more. \u201cThere,\u201d he said, holding back one of his own good cards, and giving Carrie a chance to take a trick. \u201cI count that clever playing for a beginner.\u201d The latter laughed gleefully as she saw the hand coming her way. It was as if she were invincible when Hurstwood helped her. He did not look at her often. When he did, it was with a mild light in his eye. Not a shade was there of anything save geniality and kindness. He took back the shifty, clever gleam, and replaced it with one of innocence. Carrie could not guess but that it was pleasure with him in the immediate thing. She felt that he considered she was doing a great deal."]}
