{"At the openingof the novel, what is Michael Henchard\u2019s occupation?": [" He looked about the room at the novel hangings and ingenious furniture with which she had surrounded herself. \u201cUpon my life I didn\u2019t know such furniture as this could be bought in Casterbridge,\u201d he said. \u201cNor can it be,\u201d said she. \u201cNor will it till fifty years more of civilization have passed over the town. It took a waggon and four horses to get it here.\u201d \u201cH\u2019m. It looks as if you were living on capital.\u201d \u201cO no, I am not.\u201d \u201cSo much the better. But the fact is, your setting up like this makes my beaming towards you rather awkward.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d An answer was not really needed, and he did not furnish one. \u201cWell,\u201d he went on, \u201cthere\u2019s nobody in the world I would have wished to see enter into this wealth before you, Lucetta, and nobody, I am sure, who will become it more.\u201d He turned to her with congratulatory admiration so fervid that she shrank somewhat, notwithstanding that she knew him so well.", " But, ah!\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cI am no accomplished person. And a companion to you must be that.\u201d \u201cO, not necessarily.\u201d \u201cNot? But I can\u2019t help using rural words sometimes, when I don\u2019t mean to.\u201d \u201cNever mind, I shall like to know them.\u201d \u201cAnd\u2014O, I know I shan\u2019t do!\u201d\u2014she cried with a distressful laugh. \u201cI accidentally learned to write round hand instead of ladies\u2019-hand. And, of course, you want some one who can write that?\u201d \u201cWell, no.\u201d \u201cWhat, not necessary to write ladies\u2019-hand?\u201d cried the joyous Elizabeth. \u201cNot at all.\u201d \u201cBut where do you live?\u201d \u201cIn Casterbridge, or rather I shall be living here after twelve o\u2019clock to-day.\u201d Elizabeth expressed her astonishment. \u201cI have been staying at Budmouth for a few days while my house was getting ready. The house I am going into is that one they call High-Place Hall\u2014the old stone one looking down the lane to the market. Two or three rooms are fit for occupation, though not all: I sleep there to-night for the first time.", " \u201cBut not being a man o\u2019 letters, I can\u2019t read writing; so I don\u2019t know what it is. I can get it and show ye.\u201d They stood in silence while he ran into the cottage; returning in a moment with a crumpled scrap of paper. On it there was pencilled as follows:\u2014 MICHAEL HENCHARD\u2019S WILL. \u201cThat Elizabeth-Jane Farfrae be not told of my death, or made to grieve on account of me. \u201c& that I be not bury\u2019d in consecrated ground. \u201c& that no sexton be asked to toll the bell. \u201c& that nobody is wished to see my dead body. \u201c& that no murners walk behind me at my funeral. \u201c& that no flours be planted on my grave. \u201c& that no man remember me. \u201cTo this I put my name. \u201cMICHAEL HENCHARD.\u201d \u201cWhat are we to do?\u201d said Donald, when he had handed the paper to her. She could not answer distinctly. \u201cO Donald!\u201d she cried at last through her tears, \u201cwhat bitterness lies there! O I would not have minded so much if it had not been for my unkindness at that last parting!...", " The seal had cracked, and the letter was open. Henchard had no reason to suppose the restriction one of serious weight, and his feeling for his late wife had not been of the nature of deep respect. \u201cSome trifling fancy or other of poor Susan\u2019s, I suppose,\u201d he said; and without curiosity he allowed his eyes to scan the letter:\u2014 MY DEAR MICHAEL,\u2014For the good of all three of us I have kept one thing a secret from you till now. I hope you will understand why; I think you will; though perhaps you may not forgive me. But, dear Michael, I have done it for the best. I shall be in my grave when you read this, and Elizabeth-Jane will have a home. Don\u2019t curse me Mike\u2014think of how I was situated. I can hardly write it, but here it is. Elizabeth-Jane is not your Elizabeth-Jane\u2014the child who was in my arms when you sold me. No; she died three months after that, and this living one is my other husband\u2019s."], "To whom does Henchardsell his wife?": [" The time was just after twelve o\u2019clock. Those notes were a signal that all had gone well; that there had been no slip \u2019twixt cup and lip in this case; that Elizabeth-Jane and Donald Farfrae were man and wife. Henchard did not care to ride any further with his chattering companions after hearing this sound. Indeed, it quite unmanned him; and in pursuance of his plan of not showing himself in Casterbridge street till evening, lest he should mortify Farfrae and his bride, he alighted here, with his bundle and bird-cage, and was soon left as a lonely figure on the broad white highway. It was the hill near which he had waited to meet Farfrae, almost two years earlier, to tell him of the serious illness of his wife Lucetta. The place was unchanged; the same larches sighed the same notes; but Farfrae had another wife\u2014and, as Henchard knew, a better one. He only hoped that Elizabeth-Jane had obtained a better home than had been hers at the former time.", " \u201cIt seems the only right course, after all this. Now I think I must go back to Elizabeth-Jane, and tell her that our kinsman, Mr. Henchard, kindly wishes us to stay in the town.\u201d \u201cVery well\u2014arrange that yourself. I\u2019ll go some way with you.\u201d \u201cNo, no. Don\u2019t run any risk!\u201d said his wife anxiously. \u201cI can find my way back\u2014it is not late. Please let me go alone.\u201d \u201cRight,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cBut just one word. Do you forgive me, Susan?\u201d She murmured something; but seemed to find it difficult to frame her answer. \u201cNever mind\u2014all in good time,\u201d said he. \u201cJudge me by my future works\u2014good-bye!\u201d He retreated, and stood at the upper side of the Amphitheatre while his wife passed out through the lower way, and descended under the trees to the town. Then Henchard himself went homeward, going so fast that by the time he reached his door he was almost upon the heels of the unconscious woman from whom he had just parted.", " So that I don\u2019t see how you two can return openly to my house as the wife and daughter I once treated badly, and banished from me; and there\u2019s the rub o\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll go away at once. I only came to see\u2014\u201d \u201cNo, no, Susan; you are not to go\u2014you mistake me!\u201d he said with kindly severity. \u201cI have thought of this plan: that you and Elizabeth take a cottage in the town as the widow Mrs. Newson and her daughter; that I meet you, court you, and marry you. Elizabeth-Jane coming to my house as my stepdaughter. The thing is so natural and easy that it is half done in thinking o\u2019t. This would leave my shady, headstrong, disgraceful life as a young man absolutely unopened; the secret would be yours and mine only; and I should have the pleasure of seeing my own only child under my roof, as well as my wife.\u201d \u201cI am quite in your hands, Michael,\u201d she said meekly. \u201cI came here for the sake of Elizabeth; for myself, if you tell me to leave again to-morrow morning, and never come near you more, I am content to go.\u201d \u201cNow, now; we don\u2019t want to hear that,\u201d said Henchard gently.", " She had risen late, and had just looked out of the window. \u201cOh, please, ma\u2019am, \u2019tis this larry about Mr. Henchard. A woman has proved that before he became a gentleman he sold his wife for five guineas in a booth at a fair.\u201d In all the accounts which Henchard had given her of the separation from his wife Susan for so many years, of his belief in her death, and so on, he had never clearly explained the actual and immediate cause of that separation. The story she now heard for the first time. A gradual misery overspread Lucetta\u2019s face as she dwelt upon the promise wrung from her the night before. At bottom, then, Henchard was this. How terrible a contingency for a woman who should commit herself to his care. During the day she went out to the Ring and to other places, not coming in till nearly dusk. As soon as she saw Elizabeth-Jane after her return indoors she told her that she had resolved to go away from home to the seaside for a few days\u2014to Port-Bredy; Casterbridge was so gloomy."], "The morning afterselling his wife, what pledge does Henchard make?": [" No wife could I hear of, I say, till this very day. And now\u2014she has come back.\u201d \u201cCome back, has she!\u201d \u201cThis morning\u2014this very morning. And what\u2019s to be done?\u201d \u201cCan ye no\u2019 take her and live with her, and make some amends?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve planned and proposed. But, Farfrae,\u201d said Henchard gloomily, \u201cby doing right with Susan I wrong another innocent woman.\u201d \u201cYe don\u2019t say that?\u201d \u201cIn the nature of things, Farfrae, it is almost impossible that a man of my sort should have the good fortune to tide through twenty years o\u2019 life without making more blunders than one. It has been my custom for many years to run across to Jersey in the the way of business, particularly in the potato and root season. I do a large trade wi\u2019 them in that line. Well, one autumn when stopping there I fell quite ill, and in my illness I sank into one of those gloomy fits I sometimes suffer from, on account o\u2019 the loneliness of my domestic life, when the world seems to have the blackness of hell, and, like Job, I could curse the day that gave me birth.\u201d \u201cAh, now, I never feel like it,\u201d said Farfrae.", " In truth, a great change had come over him with regard to her, and he was developing the dream of a future lit by her filial presence, as though that way alone could happiness lie. He was disturbed by another knock at the door, and rose to open it, rather deprecating a call from anybody just then. A stoutly built man stood on the doorstep, with an alien, unfamiliar air about his figure and bearing\u2014an air which might have been called colonial by people of cosmopolitan experience. It was the man who had asked the way at Peter\u2019s finger. Henchard nodded, and looked inquiry. \u201cGood morning, good morning,\u201d said the stranger with profuse heartiness. \u201cIs it Mr. Henchard I am talking to?\u201d \u201cMy name is Henchard.\u201d \u201cThen I\u2019ve caught \u2019ee at home\u2014that\u2019s right. Morning\u2019s the time for business, says I. Can I have a few words with you?\u201d \u201cBy all means,\u201d Henchard answered, showing the way in. \u201cYou may remember me?\u201d said his visitor, seating himself.", " I can always make a good meal in the morning. I\u2019ve got a splendid cold pigeon-pie going just now. You can have some home-brewed if you want to, you know.\u201d \u201cIt is too airly in the morning for that,\u201d said Farfrae with a smile. \u201cWell, of course, I didn\u2019t know. I don\u2019t drink it because of my oath, but I am obliged to brew for my work-people.\u201d Thus talking they returned, and entered Henchard\u2019s premises by the back way or traffic entrance. Here the matter was settled over the breakfast, at which Henchard heaped the young Scotchman\u2019s plate to a prodigal fulness. He would not rest satisfied till Farfrae had written for his luggage from Bristol, and dispatched the letter to the post-office. When it was done this man of strong impulses declared that his new friend should take up his abode in his house\u2014at least till some suitable lodgings could be found. He then took Farfrae round and showed him the place, and the stores of grain, and other stock; and finally entered the offices where the younger of them has already been discovered by Elizabeth.", " So that I don\u2019t see how you two can return openly to my house as the wife and daughter I once treated badly, and banished from me; and there\u2019s the rub o\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll go away at once.

The clock struck nine. Elizabeth-Jane turned to her companion. \u201cThe evening is drawing on, mother,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do you propose to do?\u201d She was surprised to find how irresolute her mother had become. \u201cWe must get a place to lie down in,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI have seen\u2014Mr. Henchard; and that\u2019s all I wanted to do.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s enough for to-night, at any rate,\u201d Elizabeth-Jane replied soothingly. \u201cWe can think to-morrow what is best to do about him. The question now is\u2014is it not?\u2014how shall we find a lodging?\u201d As her mother did not reply Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s mind reverted to the words of the waiter, that the Three Mariners was an inn of moderate charges. A recommendation good for one person was probably good for another. \u201cLet\u2019s go where the young man has gone to,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is respectable.", " \u201cWell, I must walk about till I find her.... Seize her, why didn\u2019t she know better than bring me into this disgrace!\u201d he roared out. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t queer if I was. \u2019Tis like Susan to show such idiotic simplicity. Meek\u2014that meekness has done me more harm than the bitterest temper!\u201d When he was calmer he turned to his original conviction that he must somehow find her and his little Elizabeth-Jane, and put up with the shame as best he could. It was of his own making, and he ought to bear it. But first he resolved to register an oath, a greater oath than he had ever sworn before: and to do it properly he required a fit place and imagery; for there was something fetichistic in this man\u2019s beliefs. He shouldered his basket and moved on, casting his eyes inquisitively round upon the landscape as he walked, and at the distance of three or four miles perceived the roofs of a village and the tower of a church.", " She had risen late, and had just looked out of the window. \u201cOh, please, ma\u2019am, \u2019tis this larry about Mr. Henchard.

I did a deed on account of it which I shall be ashamed of to my dying day. It made such an impression on me that I swore, there and then, that I\u2019d drink nothing stronger than tea for as many years as I was old that day. I have kept my oath; and though, Farfrae, I am sometimes that dry in the dog days that I could drink a quarter-barrel to the pitching, I think o\u2019 my oath, and touch no strong drink at all.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll no\u2019 press ye, sir\u2014I\u2019ll no\u2019 press ye. I respect your vow.\u201d \u201cWell, I shall get a manager somewhere, no doubt,\u201d said Henchard, with strong feeling in his tones. \u201cBut it will be long before I see one that would suit me so well!\u201d The young man appeared much moved by Henchard\u2019s warm convictions of his value. He was silent till they reached the door. \u201cI wish I could stay\u2014sincerely I would like to,\u201d he replied.", " In Henchard\u2019s somewhat lonely life he evidently found the young man as desirable for comradeship as he was useful for consultations. Donald\u2019s brightness of intellect maintained in the corn-factor the admiration it had won at the first hour of their meeting. The poor opinion, and but ill-concealed, that he entertained of the slim Farfrae\u2019s physical girth, strength, and dash was more than counterbalanced by the immense respect he had for his brains. Her quiet eye discerned that Henchard\u2019s tigerish affection for the younger man, his constant liking to have Farfrae near him, now and then resulted in a tendency to domineer, which, however, was checked in a moment when Donald exhibited marks of real offence. One day, looking down on their figures from on high, she heard the latter remark, as they stood in the doorway between the garden and yard, that their habit of walking and driving about together rather neutralized Farfrae\u2019s value as a second pair of eyes, which should be used in places where the principal was not.", " The immediate subject of their talk being exhausted she felt more embarrassed at sitting thus beside her past lover; but soon the two figures of the others were visible at the entrance to the town. The face of the woman was frequently turned back, but Farfrae did not whip on the horse. When these reached the town walls Henchard and his companion had disappeared down the street; Farfrae set down Elizabeth-Jane on her expressing a particular wish to alight there, and drove round to the stables at the back of his lodgings. On this account he entered the house through his garden, and going up to his apartments found them in a particularly disturbed state, his boxes being hauled out upon the landing, and his bookcase standing in three pieces. These phenomena, however, seemed to cause him not the least surprise. \u201cWhen will everything be sent up?\u201d he said to the mistress of the house, who was superintending.", " Henchard himself was mentally and physically unfit for grubbing subtleties from soiled paper; he had in a modern sense received the education of Achilles, and found penmanship a tantalizing art. \u201cYou shall do no more to-night,\u201d he said at length, spreading his great hand over the paper. \u201cThere\u2019s time enough to-morrow. Come indoors with me and have some supper. Now you shall! I am determined on\u2019t.\u201d He shut the account-books with friendly force. Donald had wished to get to his lodgings; but he already saw that his friend and employer was a man who knew no moderation in his requests and impulses, and he yielded gracefully. He liked Henchard\u2019s warmth, even if it inconvenienced him; the great difference in their characters adding to the liking. They locked up the office, and the young man followed his companion through the private little door which, admitting directly into Henchard\u2019s garden, permitted a passage from the utilitarian to the beautiful at one step."], "Who had Henchardarranged to hire as his business manager before meeting Farfrae?": [" X. While she still sat under the Scotchman\u2019s eyes a man came up to the door, reaching it as Henchard opened the door of the inner office to admit Elizabeth. The newcomer stepped forward like the quicker cripple at Bethesda, and entered in her stead. She could hear his words to Henchard: \u201cJoshua Jopp, sir\u2014by appointment\u2014the new manager.\u201d \u201cThe new manager!\u2014he\u2019s in his office,\u201d said Henchard bluntly. \u201cIn his office!\u201d said the man, with a stultified air. \u201cI mentioned Thursday,\u201d said Henchard; \u201cand as you did not keep your appointment, I have engaged another manager. At first I thought he must be you. Do you think I can wait when business is in question?\u201d \u201cYou said Thursday or Saturday, sir,\u201d said the newcomer, pulling out a letter. \u201cWell, you are too late,\u201d said the corn-factor. \u201cI can say no more.\u201d \u201cYou as good as engaged me,\u201d murmured the man. \u201cSubject to an interview,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cI am sorry for you\u2014very sorry indeed.", " Thus their lives rolled on till a day of public rejoicing was suggested to the country at large in celebration of a national event that had recently taken place. For some time Casterbridge, by nature slow, made no response. Then one day Donald Farfrae broached the subject to Henchard by asking if he would have any objection to lend some rick-cloths to himself and a few others, who contemplated getting up an entertainment of some sort on the day named, and required a shelter for the same, to which they might charge admission at the rate of so much a head. \u201cHave as many cloths as you like,\u201d Henchard replied. When his manager had gone about the business Henchard was fired with emulation. It certainly had been very remiss of him, as Mayor, he thought, to call no meeting ere this, to discuss what should be done on this holiday. But Farfrae had been so cursed quick in his movements as to give old-fashioned people in authority no chance of the initiative.", " Coming to the door she cried regardless of consequences, \u201cCome to that, Mr. Henchard, I can let \u2019ee know she\u2019ve waited on worse!\u201d \u201cThen she must have had more charity than sense,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cO no, she hadn\u2019t. \u2019Twere not for charity but for hire; and at a public-house in this town!\u201d \u201cIt is not true!\u201d cried Henchard indignantly. \u201cJust ask her,\u201d said Nance, folding her naked arms in such a manner that she could comfortably scratch her elbows. Henchard glanced at Elizabeth-Jane, whose complexion, now pink and white from confinement, lost nearly all of the former colour. \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d he said to her. \u201cAnything or nothing?\u201d \u201cIt is true,\u201d said Elizabeth-Jane. \u201cBut it was only\u2014\u201d \u201cDid you do it, or didn\u2019t you? Where was it?\u201d \u201cAt the Three Mariners; one evening for a little while, when we were staying there.\u201d Nance glanced triumphantly at Henchard, and sailed into the barn; for assuming that she was to be discharged on the instant she had resolved to make the most of her victory.", " \u201cWell, I admit that the wheat turned out badly,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I was taken in in buying it as much as the bakers who bought it o\u2019 me.\u201d \u201cAnd the poor folk who had to eat it whether or no,\u201d said the inharmonious man outside the window. Henchard\u2019s face darkened. There was temper under the thin bland surface\u2014the temper which, artificially intensified, had banished a wife nearly a score of years before. \u201cYou must make allowances for the accidents of a large business,\u201d he said. \u201cYou must bear in mind that the weather just at the harvest of that corn was worse than we have known it for years. However, I have mended my arrangements on account o\u2019t. Since I have found my business too large to be well looked after by myself alone, I have advertised for a thorough good man as manager of the corn department. When I\u2019ve got him you will find these mistakes will no longer occur\u2014matters will be better looked into.\u201d \u201cBut what are you going to do to repay us for the past?\u201d inquired the man who had before spoken, and who seemed to be a baker or miller."], "How does Hencharddeal with Abel Whittle\u2019s failure to report to work on time?": [" Henchard called aloud to him as he went out of the gate, \u201cHere\u2014Abel Whittle!\u201d Whittle turned, and ran back a few steps. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d he said, in breathless deprecation, as if he knew what was coming next. \u201cOnce more\u2014be in time to-morrow morning. You see what\u2019s to be done, and you hear what I say, and you know I\u2019m not going to be trifled with any longer.\u201d \u201cYes, sir.\u201d Then Abel Whittle left, and Henchard and Farfrae; and Elizabeth saw no more of them. Now there was good reason for this command on Henchard\u2019s part. Poor Abel, as he was called, had an inveterate habit of over-sleeping himself and coming late to his work. His anxious will was to be among the earliest; but if his comrades omitted to pull the string that he always tied round his great toe and left hanging out the window for that purpose, his will was as wind. He did not arrive in time. As he was often second hand at the hay-weighing, or at the crane which lifted the sacks, or was one of those who had to accompany the waggons into the country to fetch away stacks that had been purchased, this affliction of Abel\u2019s was productive of much inconvenience.", " I\u2019m going up that way.\u201d Henchard went off, entered Abel\u2019s house, a little cottage in Back Street, the door of which was never locked because the inmates had nothing to lose. Reaching Whittle\u2019s bedside the corn-factor shouted a bass note so vigorously that Abel started up instantly, and beholding Henchard standing over him, was galvanized into spasmodic movements which had not much relation to getting on his clothes. \u201cOut of bed, sir, and off to the granary, or you leave my employ to-day! \u2019Tis to teach ye a lesson. March on; never mind your breeches!\u201d The unhappy Whittle threw on his sleeve waistcoat, and managed to get into his boots at the bottom of the stairs, while Henchard thrust his hat over his head. Whittle then trotted on down Back Street, Henchard walking sternly behind. Just at this time Farfrae, who had been to Henchard\u2019s house to look for him, came out of the back gate, and saw something white fluttering in the morning gloom, which he soon perceived to be part of Abel\u2019s shirt that showed below his waistcoat.", " I\u2019ve fretted my gizzard green about it, maister, but what can I do? Now last night, afore I went to bed, I only had a scantling o\u2019 cheese and\u2014\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it!\u201d roared Henchard. \u201cTo-morrow the waggons must start at four, and if you\u2019re not here, stand clear. I\u2019ll mortify thy flesh for thee!\u201d \u201cBut let me clear up my points, your worshipful\u2014\u2014\u201d Henchard turned away. \u201cHe asked me and he questioned me, and then \u2019a wouldn\u2019t hear my points!\u201d said Abel, to the yard in general. \u201cNow, I shall twitch like a moment-hand all night to-night for fear o\u2019 him!\u201d The journey to be taken by the waggons next day was a long one into Blackmoor Vale, and at four o\u2019clock lanterns were moving about the yard. But Abel was missing. Before either of the other men could run to Abel\u2019s and warn him Henchard appeared in the garden doorway. \u201cWhere\u2019s Abel Whittle? Not come after all I\u2019ve said? Now I\u2019ll carry out my word, by my blessed fathers\u2014nothing else will do him any good!", " For two mornings in the present week he had kept the others waiting nearly an hour; hence Henchard\u2019s threat. It now remained to be seen what would happen to-morrow. Six o\u2019clock struck, and there was no Whittle. At half-past six Henchard entered the yard; the waggon was horsed that Abel was to accompany; and the other man had been waiting twenty minutes. Then Henchard swore, and Whittle coming up breathless at that instant, the corn-factor turned on him, and declared with an oath that this was the last time; that if he were behind once more, by God, he would come and drag him out o\u2019 bed. \u201cThere is sommit wrong in my make, your worshipful!\u201d said Abel, \u201cespecially in the inside, whereas my poor dumb brain gets as dead as a clot afore I\u2019ve said my few scrags of prayers. Yes\u2014it came on as a stripling, just afore I\u2019d got man\u2019s wages, whereas I never enjoy my bed at all, for no sooner do I lie down than I be asleep, and afore I be awake I be up."], "How is the \u201cdayof public rejoicing\u201d that Henchard arranges thwarted?": [" Thus their lives rolled on till a day of public rejoicing was suggested to the country at large in celebration of a national event that had recently taken place. For some time Casterbridge, by nature slow, made no response. Then one day Donald Farfrae broached the subject to Henchard by asking if he would have any objection to lend some rick-cloths to himself and a few others, who contemplated getting up an entertainment of some sort on the day named, and required a shelter for the same, to which they might charge admission at the rate of so much a head. \u201cHave as many cloths as you like,\u201d Henchard replied. When his manager had gone about the business Henchard was fired with emulation. It certainly had been very remiss of him, as Mayor, he thought, to call no meeting ere this, to discuss what should be done on this holiday. But Farfrae had been so cursed quick in his movements as to give old-fashioned people in authority no chance of the initiative.", " And thus Henchard found himself again on the precise standing which he had occupied a quarter of a century before. Externally there was nothing to hinder his making another start on the upward slope, and by his new lights achieving higher things than his soul in its half-formed state had been able to accomplish. But the ingenious machinery contrived by the Gods for reducing human possibilities of amelioration to a minimum\u2014which arranges that wisdom to do shall come _pari passu_ with the departure of zest for doing\u2014stood in the way of all that. He had no wish to make an arena a second time of a world that had become a mere painted scene to him. Very often, as his hay-knife crunched down among the sweet-smelling grassy stems, he would survey mankind and say to himself: \u201cHere and everywhere be folk dying before their time like frosted leaves, though wanted by their families, the country, and the world; while I, an outcast, an encumberer of the ground, wanted by nobody, and despised by all, live on against my will!\u201d He often kept an eager ear upon the conversation of those who passed along the road\u2014not from a general curiosity by any means\u2014but in the hope that among these travellers between Casterbridge and London some would, sooner or later, speak of the former place.", " Coming to the door she cried regardless of consequences, \u201cCome to that, Mr. Henchard, I can let \u2019ee know she\u2019ve waited on worse!\u201d \u201cThen she must have had more charity than sense,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cO no, she hadn\u2019t. \u2019Twere not for charity but for hire; and at a public-house in this town!\u201d \u201cIt is not true!\u201d cried Henchard indignantly. \u201cJust ask her,\u201d said Nance, folding her naked arms in such a manner that she could comfortably scratch her elbows. Henchard glanced at Elizabeth-Jane, whose complexion, now pink and white from confinement, lost nearly all of the former colour. \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d he said to her. \u201cAnything or nothing?\u201d \u201cIt is true,\u201d said Elizabeth-Jane. \u201cBut it was only\u2014\u201d \u201cDid you do it, or didn\u2019t you? Where was it?\u201d \u201cAt the Three Mariners; one evening for a little while, when we were staying there.\u201d Nance glanced triumphantly at Henchard, and sailed into the barn; for assuming that she was to be discharged on the instant she had resolved to make the most of her victory.", " Henchard had chosen this spot as being the safest from observation which he could think of for meeting his long-lost wife, and at the same time as one easily to be found by a stranger after nightfall. As Mayor of the town, with a reputation to keep up, he could not invite her to come to his house till some definite course had been decided on. Just before eight he approached the deserted earth-work and entered by the south path which descended over the _d\u00e9bris_ of the former dens. In a few moments he could discern a female figure creeping in by the great north gap, or public gateway. They met in the middle of the arena. Neither spoke just at first\u2014there was no necessity for speech\u2014and the poor woman leant against Henchard, who supported her in his arms. \u201cI don\u2019t drink,\u201d he said in a low, halting, apologetic voice. \u201cYou hear, Susan?\u2014I don\u2019t drink now\u2014I haven\u2019t since that night.\u201d Those were his first words."], "Why does Susaninsist on keeping hidden the fact that Elizabeth-Jane does choresin exchange for a room at the inn?": [" Farfrae, to whom he was still a comparative stranger, stood a few steps below the Corn Exchange door\u2014a usual position with him at this hour\u2014and he appeared lost in thought about something he was looking at a little way off. Henchard\u2019s eyes followed Farfrae\u2019s, and he saw that the object of his gaze was no sample-showing farmer, but his own stepdaughter, who had just come out of a shop over the way. She, on her part, was quite unconscious of his attention, and in this was less fortunate than those young women whose very plumes, like those of Juno\u2019s bird, are set with Argus eyes whenever possible admirers are within ken. Henchard went away, thinking that perhaps there was nothing significant after all in Farfrae\u2019s look at Elizabeth-Jane at that juncture. Yet he could not forget that the Scotchman had once shown a tender interest in her, of a fleeting kind. Thereupon promptly came to the surface that idiosyncrasy of Henchard\u2019s which had ruled his courses from the beginning and had mainly made him what he was.", " Only Henchard did not conform to these flexuous changes; he remained stately and vertical, silently thinking. The clock struck nine. Elizabeth-Jane turned to her companion. \u201cThe evening is drawing on, mother,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do you propose to do?\u201d She was surprised to find how irresolute her mother had become. \u201cWe must get a place to lie down in,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI have seen\u2014Mr. Henchard; and that\u2019s all I wanted to do.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s enough for to-night, at any rate,\u201d Elizabeth-Jane replied soothingly. \u201cWe can think to-morrow what is best to do about him. The question now is\u2014is it not?\u2014how shall we find a lodging?\u201d As her mother did not reply Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s mind reverted to the words of the waiter, that the Three Mariners was an inn of moderate charges. A recommendation good for one person was probably good for another. \u201cLet\u2019s go where the young man has gone to,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is respectable.", " \u201cHave you heard?\u201d she asked. \u201cMrs. Farfrae! She is\u2014dead! Yes, indeed\u2014about an hour ago!\u201d \u201cI know it,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cI have but lately come in from there. It is so very good of \u2019ee, Elizabeth, to come and tell me. You must be so tired out, too, with sitting up. Now do you bide here with me this morning. You can go and rest in the other room; and I will call \u2019ee when breakfast is ready.\u201d To please him, and herself\u2014for his recent kindliness was winning a surprised gratitude from the lonely girl\u2014she did as he bade her, and lay down on a sort of couch which Henchard had rigged up out of a settle in the adjoining room. She could hear him moving about in his preparations; but her mind ran most strongly on Lucetta, whose death in such fulness of life and amid such cheerful hopes of maternity was appallingly unexpected. Presently she fell asleep. Meanwhile her stepfather in the outer room had set the breakfast in readiness; but finding that she dozed he would not call her; he waited on, looking into the fire and keeping the kettle boiling with house-wifely care, as if it were an honour to have her in his house.", " \u201c\u2019Od damn it,\u201d cried Henchard, \u201cwhat\u2019s all the world! I like a fellow to talk to. Now come along and hae some supper, and don\u2019t take too much thought about things, or ye\u2019ll drive me crazy.\u201d When she walked with her mother, on the other hand, she often beheld the Scotchman looking at them with a curious interest. The fact that he had met her at the Three Mariners was insufficient to account for it, since on the occasions on which she had entered his room he had never raised his eyes. Besides, it was at her mother more particularly than at herself that he looked, to Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s half-conscious, simple-minded, perhaps pardonable, disappointment. Thus she could not account for this interest by her own attractiveness, and she decided that it might be apparent only\u2014a way of turning his eyes that Mr. Farfrae had. She did not divine the ample explanation of his manner, without personal vanity, that was afforded by the fact of Donald being the depositary of Henchard\u2019s confidence in respect of his past treatment of the pale, chastened mother who walked by her side."], "In a letter writtenon her deathbed, what does Susan confess to her husband?": [" The seal had cracked, and the letter was open. Henchard had no reason to suppose the restriction one of serious weight, and his feeling for his late wife had not been of the nature of deep respect. \u201cSome trifling fancy or other of poor Susan\u2019s, I suppose,\u201d he said; and without curiosity he allowed his eyes to scan the letter:\u2014 MY DEAR MICHAEL,\u2014For the good of all three of us I have kept one thing a secret from you till now. I hope you will understand why; I think you will; though perhaps you may not forgive me. But, dear Michael, I have done it for the best. I shall be in my grave when you read this, and Elizabeth-Jane will have a home. Don\u2019t curse me Mike\u2014think of how I was situated. I can hardly write it, but here it is. Elizabeth-Jane is not your Elizabeth-Jane\u2014the child who was in my arms when you sold me. No; she died three months after that, and this living one is my other husband\u2019s.", " The letter to the young Jersey woman was carefully framed by him, and the interview ended, Henchard saying, as the Scotchman left, \u201cI feel it a great relief, Farfrae, to tell some friend o\u2019 this! You see now that the Mayor of Casterbridge is not so thriving in his mind as it seems he might be from the state of his pocket.\u201d \u201cI do. And I\u2019m sorry for ye!\u201d said Farfrae. When he was gone Henchard copied the letter, and, enclosing a cheque, took it to the post-office, from which he walked back thoughtfully. \u201cCan it be that it will go off so easily!\u201d he said. \u201cPoor thing\u2014God knows! Now then, to make amends to Susan!\u201d XIII. The cottage which Michael Henchard hired for his wife Susan under her name of Newson\u2014in pursuance of their plan\u2014was in the upper or western part of the town, near the Roman wall, and the avenue which overshadowed it. The evening sun seemed to shine more yellowly there than anywhere else this autumn\u2014stretching its rays, as the hours grew later, under the lowest sycamore boughs, and steeping the ground-floor of the dwelling, with its green shutters, in a substratum of radiance which the foliage screened from the upper parts.", " She was terribly careless of appearances, and I was perhaps more, because o\u2019 my dreary state; and it was through this that the scandal arose. At last I was well, and came away. When I was gone she suffered much on my account, and didn\u2019t forget to tell me so in letters one after another; till latterly, I felt I owed her something, and thought that, as I had not heard of Susan for so long, I would make this other one the only return I could make, and ask her if she would run the risk of Susan being alive (very slight as I believed) and marry me, such as I was. She jumped for joy, and we should no doubt soon have been married\u2014but, behold, Susan appears!\u201d Donald showed his deep concern at a complication so far beyond the degree of his simple experiences. \u201cNow see what injury a man may cause around him! Even after that wrong-doing at the fair when I was young, if I had never been so selfish as to let this giddy girl devote herself to me over at Jersey, to the injury of her name, all might now be well.", " \u201cWill you,\u201d said Lucetta, with as much bitterness as she could put into a small communication, \u201cwill you kindly undertake not to speak to me in the biting undertones you used to-day, if I walk through the yard at any time? I bear you no ill-will, and I am only too glad that you should have employment of my dear husband; but in common fairness treat me as his wife, and do not try to make me wretched by covert sneers. I have committed no crime, and done you no injury.\u201d \u201cPoor fool!\u201d said Henchard with fond savagery, holding out the note. \u201cTo know no better than commit herself in writing like this! Why, if I were to show that to her dear husband\u2014pooh!\u201d He threw the letter into the fire. Lucetta took care not to come again among the hay and corn. She would rather have died than run the risk of encountering Henchard at such close quarters a second time. The gulf between them was growing wider every day."], "Why does Henchardagree to remarry Susan rather than pursue his affair with Lucetta?": [" His well-known haughty indifference to the society of womankind, his silent avoidance of converse with the sex, contributed a piquancy to what would otherwise have been an unromantic matter enough. That such a poor fragile woman should be his choice was inexplicable, except on the ground that the engagement was a family affair in which sentimental passion had no place; for it was known that they were related in some way. Mrs. Henchard was so pale that the boys called her \u201cThe Ghost.\u201d Sometimes Henchard overheard this epithet when they passed together along the Walks\u2014as the avenues on the walls were named\u2014at which his face would darken with an expression of destructiveness towards the speakers ominous to see; but he said nothing. He pressed on the preparations for his union, or rather reunion, with this pale creature in a dogged, unflinching spirit which did credit to his conscientiousness.", " She was terribly careless of appearances, and I was perhaps more, because o\u2019 my dreary state; and it was through this that the scandal arose. At last I was well, and came away. When I was gone she suffered much on my account, and didn\u2019t forget to tell me so in letters one after another; till latterly, I felt I owed her something, and thought that, as I had not heard of Susan for so long, I would make this other one the only return I could make, and ask her if she would run the risk of Susan being alive (very slight as I believed) and marry me, such as I was.

Even after that wrong-doing at the fair when I was young, if I had never been so selfish as to let this giddy girl devote herself to me over at Jersey, to the injury of her name, all might now be well.", " For by the \u201cshe\u201d of Lucetta\u2019s story Elizabeth had not been beguiled. XXV. The next phase of the supersession of Henchard in Lucetta\u2019s heart was an experiment in calling on her performed by Farfrae with some apparent trepidation. Conventionally speaking he conversed with both Miss Templeman and her companion; but in fact it was rather that Elizabeth sat invisible in the room. Donald appeared not to see her at all, and answered her wise little remarks with curtly indifferent monosyllables, his looks and faculties hanging on the woman who could boast of a more Protean variety in her phases, moods, opinions, and also principles, than could Elizabeth. Lucetta had persisted in dragging her into the circle; but she had remained like an awkward third point which that circle would not touch. Susan Henchard\u2019s daughter bore up against the frosty ache of the treatment, as she had borne up under worse things, and contrived as soon as possible to get out of the inharmonious room without being missed.", " \u201cI was in Jersey several years, and knew you there by sight.\u201d \u201cIndeed,\u201d she replied. \u201cBut I knew nothing of you.\u201d \u201cI think, ma\u2019am, that a word or two from you would secure for me what I covet very much,\u201d he persisted. She steadily refused to have anything to do with the affair, and cutting him short, because of her anxiety to get indoors before her husband should miss her, left him on the pavement. He watched her till she had vanished, and then went home. When he got there he sat down in the fireless chimney corner looking at the iron dogs, and the wood laid across them for heating the morning kettle. A movement upstairs disturbed him, and Henchard came down from his bedroom, where he seemed to have been rummaging boxes. \u201cI wish,\u201d said Henchard, \u201cyou would do me a service, Jopp, now\u2014to-night, I mean, if you can. Leave this at Mrs. Farfrae\u2019s for her. I should take it myself, of course, but I don\u2019t wish to be seen there.\u201d He handed a package in brown paper, sealed."], "Why does Henchardretract his demand that Farfrae no longer court Elizabeth-Jane?": [" So that I don\u2019t see how you two can return openly to my house as the wife and daughter I once treated badly, and banished from me; and there\u2019s the rub o\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll go away at once. I only came to see\u2014\u201d \u201cNo, no, Susan; you are not to go\u2014you mistake me!\u201d he said with kindly severity. \u201cI have thought of this plan: that you and Elizabeth take a cottage in the town as the widow Mrs. Newson and her daughter; that I meet you, court you, and marry you. Elizabeth-Jane coming to my house as my stepdaughter. The thing is so natural and easy that it is half done in thinking o\u2019t. This would leave my shady, headstrong, disgraceful life as a young man absolutely unopened; the secret would be yours and mine only; and I should have the pleasure of seeing my own only child under my roof, as well as my wife.\u201d \u201cI am quite in your hands, Michael,\u201d she said meekly. \u201cI came here for the sake of Elizabeth; for myself, if you tell me to leave again to-morrow morning, and never come near you more, I am content to go.\u201d \u201cNow, now; we don\u2019t want to hear that,\u201d said Henchard gently.", " His mind began vibrating between the wish to reveal himself to her and the policy of leaving well alone, till he could no longer sit still. He walked up and down, and then he came and stood behind her chair, looking down upon the top of her head. He could no longer restrain his impulse. \u201cWhat did your mother tell you about me\u2014my history?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat you were related by marriage.\u201d \u201cShe should have told more\u2014before you knew me! Then my task would not have been such a hard one.... Elizabeth, it is I who am your father, and not Richard Newson. Shame alone prevented your wretched parents from owning this to you while both of \u2019em were alive.\u201d The back of Elizabeth\u2019s head remained still, and her shoulders did not denote even the movements of breathing. Henchard went on: \u201cI\u2019d rather have your scorn, your fear, anything than your ignorance; \u2019tis that I hate! Your mother and I were man and wife when we were young.", " Sneering at himself for his weakness he yet every hour\u2014nay, every few minutes\u2014conjectured her actions for the time being\u2014her sitting down and rising up, her goings and comings, till thought of Newson\u2019s and Farfrae\u2019s counter-influence would pass like a cold blast over a pool, and efface her image. And then he would say to himself, \u201cO you fool! All this about a daughter who is no daughter of thine!\u201d At length he obtained employment at his own occupation of hay-trusser, work of that sort being in demand at this autumn time. The scene of his hiring was a pastoral farm near the old western highway, whose course was the channel of all such communications as passed between the busy centres of novelty and the remote Wessex boroughs. He had chosen the neighbourhood of this artery from a sense that, situated here, though at a distance of fifty miles, he was virtually nearer to her whose welfare was so dear than he would be at a roadless spot only half as remote.", " The sight of real money in full amount, in answer to a challenge for the same till then deemed slightly hypothetical had a great effect upon the spectators. Their eyes became riveted upon the faces of the chief actors, and then upon the notes as they lay, weighted by the shillings, on the table. Up to this moment it could not positively have been asserted that the man, in spite of his tantalizing declaration, was really in earnest. The spectators had indeed taken the proceedings throughout as a piece of mirthful irony carried to extremes; and had assumed that, being out of work, he was, as a consequence, out of temper with the world, and society, and his nearest kin. But with the demand and response of real cash the jovial frivolity of the scene departed. A lurid colour seemed to fill the tent, and change the aspect of all therein. The mirth-wrinkles left the listeners\u2019 faces, and they waited with parting lips."], "What is the nameof Lucetta Templeman\u2019s estate?": [" In this frame of mind, though without strong feeling, he had strolled up the alley and into High-Place Hall by the postern at which Elizabeth had so nearly encountered him. He had gone on thence into the court, and inquired of a man whom he saw unpacking china from a crate if Miss Le Sueur was living there. Miss Le Sueur had been the name under which he had known Lucetta\u2014or \u201cLucette,\u201d as she had called herself at that time. The man replied in the negative; that Miss Templeman only had come. Henchard went away, concluding that Lucetta had not as yet settled in. He was in this interested stage of the inquiry when he witnessed Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s departure the next day. On hearing her announce the address there suddenly took possession of him the strange thought that Lucetta and Miss Templeman were one and the same person, for he could recall that in her season of intimacy with him the name of the rich relative whom he had deemed somewhat a mythical personage had been given as Templeman.", " The rencounter with Farfrae and his bearings towards Lucetta had made the reflective Elizabeth more observant of her brilliant and amiable companion. A few days afterwards, when her eyes met Lucetta\u2019s as the latter was going out, she somehow knew that Miss Templeman was nourishing a hope of seeing the attractive Scotchman. The fact was printed large all over Lucetta\u2019s cheeks and eyes to any one who could read her as Elizabeth-Jane was beginning to do. Lucetta passed on and closed the street door. A seer\u2019s spirit took possession of Elizabeth, impelling her to sit down by the fire and divine events so surely from data already her own that they could be held as witnessed. She followed Lucetta thus mentally\u2014saw her encounter Donald somewhere as if by chance\u2014saw him wear his special look when meeting women, with an added intensity because this one was Lucetta. She depicted his impassioned manner; beheld the indecision of both between their lothness to separate and their desire not to be observed; depicted their shaking of hands; how they probably parted with frigidity in their general contour and movements, only in the smaller features showing the spark of passion, thus invisible to all but themselves.", " \u201cHim? Who are you talking about?\u201d she said wildly. \u201cNobody, as far as I am concerned,\u201d said Elizabeth firmly. \u201cOh\u2014well. Then it is my mistake,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cBut the business is between me and Miss Templeman. She agrees to be my wife.\u201d \u201cBut don\u2019t dwell on it just now,\u201d entreated Elizabeth, holding Lucetta\u2019s hand. \u201cI don\u2019t wish to, if she promises,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cI have, I have,\u201d groaned Lucetta, her limbs hanging like fluid, from very misery and faintness. \u201cMichael, please don\u2019t argue it any more!\u201d \u201cI will not,\u201d he said. And taking up his hat he went away. Elizabeth-Jane continued to kneel by Lucetta. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d she said. \u201cYou called my father \u2018Michael\u2019 as if you knew him well? And how is it he has got this power over you, that you promise to marry him against your will? Ah\u2014you have many many secrets from me!\u201d \u201cPerhaps you have some from me,\u201d Lucetta murmured with closed eyes, little thinking, however, so unsuspicious was she, that the secret of Elizabeth\u2019s heart concerned the young man who had caused this damage to her own.", " They examined it curiously; observing the rows of trumpet-shaped tubes one within the other, the little scoops, like revolving salt-spoons, which tossed the seed into the upper ends of the tubes that conducted it to the ground; till somebody said, \u201cGood morning, Elizabeth-Jane.\u201d She looked up, and there was her stepfather. His greeting had been somewhat dry and thunderous, and Elizabeth-Jane, embarrassed out of her equanimity, stammered at random, \u201cThis is the lady I live with, father\u2014Miss Templeman.\u201d Henchard put his hand to his hat, which he brought down with a great wave till it met his body at the knee. Miss Templeman bowed. \u201cI am happy to become acquainted with you, Mr. Henchard,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is a curious machine.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d Henchard replied; and he proceeded to explain it, and still more forcibly to ridicule it. \u201cWho brought it here?\u201d said Lucetta. \u201cOh, don\u2019t ask me, ma\u2019am!\u201d said Henchard."], "What ulteriormotive prompts Lucetta to invite Elizabeth-Jane to live with her?": [" \u201cFather,\u201d she said, as soon as she recalled herself to the outspread meal, \u201cit is so kind of you to get this nice breakfast with your own hands, and I idly asleep the while.\u201d \u201cI do it every day,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou have left me; everybody has left me; how should I live but by my own hands.\u201d \u201cYou are very lonely, are you not?\u201d \u201cAy, child\u2014to a degree that you know nothing of! It is my own fault. You are the only one who has been near me for weeks. And you will come no more.\u201d \u201cWhy do you say that? Indeed I will, if you would like to see me.\u201d Henchard signified dubiousness. Though he had so lately hoped that Elizabeth-Jane might again live in his house as daughter, he would not ask her to do so now. Newson might return at any moment, and what Elizabeth would think of him for his deception it were best to bear apart from her. When they had breakfasted his stepdaughter still lingered, till the moment arrived at which Henchard was accustomed to go to his daily work.", " I was so desperate\u2014so afraid of being forced to anything else\u2014so afraid of revelations that would quench his love for me, that I resolved to do it offhand, come what might, and purchase a week of happiness at any cost!\u201d \u201cYou\u2014have\u2014married Mr. Farfrae!\u201d cried Elizabeth-Jane, in Nathan tones Lucetta bowed. She had recovered herself. \u201cThe bells are ringing on that account,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband is downstairs. He will live here till a more suitable house is ready for us; and I have told him that I want you to stay with me just as before.\u201d \u201cLet me think of it alone,\u201d the girl quickly replied, corking up the turmoil of her feeling with grand control. \u201cYou shall. I am sure we shall be happy together.\u201d Lucetta departed to join Donald below, a vague uneasiness floating over her joy at seeing him quite at home there. Not on account of her friend Elizabeth did she feel it: for of the bearings of Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s emotions she had not the least suspicion; but on Henchard\u2019s alone.", " Henchard had chosen this spot as being the safest from observation which he could think of for meeting his long-lost wife, and at the same time as one easily to be found by a stranger after nightfall. As Mayor of the town, with a reputation to keep up, he could not invite her to come to his house till some definite course had been decided on. Just before eight he approached the deserted earth-work and entered by the south path which descended over the _d\u00e9bris_ of the former dens. In a few moments he could discern a female figure creeping in by the great north gap, or public gateway. They met in the middle of the arena. Neither spoke just at first\u2014there was no necessity for speech\u2014and the poor woman leant against Henchard, who supported her in his arms. \u201cI don\u2019t drink,\u201d he said in a low, halting, apologetic voice. \u201cYou hear, Susan?\u2014I don\u2019t drink now\u2014I haven\u2019t since that night.\u201d Those were his first words.", " Elizabeth-Jane, who had often observed them, said, \u201cI wonder if the same trees come every week?\u201d \u201cWhat trees?\u201d said Lucetta, absorbed in watching for Henchard. Elizabeth replied vaguely, for an incident checked her. Behind one of the trees stood Farfrae, briskly discussing a sample-bag with a farmer. Henchard had come up, accidentally encountering the young man, whose face seemed to inquire, \u201cDo we speak to each other?\u201d She saw her stepfather throw a shine into his eye which answered \u201cNo!\u201d Elizabeth-Jane sighed. \u201cAre you particularly interested in anybody out there?\u201d said Lucetta. \u201cO, no,\u201d said her companion, a quick red shooting over her face. Luckily Farfrae\u2019s figure was immediately covered by the apple-tree. Lucetta looked hard at her. \u201cQuite sure?\u201d she said. \u201cO yes,\u201d said Elizabeth-Jane. Again Lucetta looked out. \u201cThey are all farmers, I suppose?\u201d she said. \u201cNo. There\u2019s Mr. Bulge\u2014he\u2019s a wine merchant; there\u2019s Benjamin Brownlet\u2014a horse dealer; and Kitson, the pig breeder; and Yopper, the auctioneer; besides maltsters, and millers\u2014and so on.\u201d Farfrae stood out quite distinctly now; but she did not mention him."], "Where did Lucettalive before moving to Casterbridge?": [" The distance, however, was too great to lend much probability to his desire; and the highest result of his attention to wayside words was that he did indeed hear the name \u201cCasterbridge\u201d uttered one day by the driver of a road-waggon. Henchard ran to the gate of the field he worked in, and hailed the speaker, who was a stranger. \u201cYes\u2014I\u2019ve come from there, maister,\u201d he said, in answer to Henchard\u2019s inquiry. \u201cI trade up and down, ye know; though, what with this travelling without horses that\u2019s getting so common, my work will soon be done.\u201d \u201cAnything moving in the old place, mid I ask?\u201d \u201cAll the same as usual.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve heard that Mr. Farfrae, the late mayor, is thinking of getting married. Now is that true or not?\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t say for the life o\u2019 me. O no, I should think not.\u201d \u201cBut yes, John\u2014you forget,\u201d said a woman inside the waggon-tilt. \u201cWhat were them packages we carr\u2019d there at the beginning o\u2019 the week?", " During the day he had bought a new tool-basket, cleaned up his old hay-knife and wimble, set himself up in fresh leggings, kneenaps and corduroys, and in other ways gone back to the working clothes of his young manhood, discarding for ever the shabby-genteel suit of cloth and rusty silk hat that since his decline had characterized him in the Casterbridge street as a man who had seen better days. He went secretly and alone, not a soul of the many who had known him being aware of his departure. Elizabeth-Jane accompanied him as far as the second bridge on the highway\u2014for the hour of her appointment with the unguessed visitor at Farfrae\u2019s had not yet arrived\u2014and parted from him with unfeigned wonder and sorrow, keeping him back a minute or two before finally letting him go. She watched his form diminish across the moor, the yellow rush-basket at his back moving up and down with each tread, and the creases behind his knees coming and going alternately till she could no longer see them.", " I\u2019ll do anything, if you will only look upon me as your father!\u201d She tried to stand up and comfort him trustfully; but she could not; she was troubled at his presence, like the brethren at the avowal of Joseph. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to come to me all of a sudden,\u201d said Henchard in jerks, and moving like a great tree in a wind. \u201cNo, Elizabeth, I don\u2019t. I\u2019ll go away and not see you till to-morrow, or when you like, and then I\u2019ll show \u2019ee papers to prove my words. There, I am gone, and won\u2019t disturb you any more.... \u2019Twas I that chose your name, my daughter; your mother wanted it Susan. There, don\u2019t forget \u2019twas I gave you your name!\u201d He went out at the door and shut her softly in, and she heard him go away into the garden. But he had not done. Before she had moved, or in any way recovered from the effect of his disclosure, he reappeared. \u201cOne word more, Elizabeth,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll take my surname now\u2014hey?", " \u201cHave you heard?\u201d she asked. \u201cMrs. Farfrae! She is\u2014dead! Yes, indeed\u2014about an hour ago!\u201d \u201cI know it,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cI have but lately come in from there. It is so very good of \u2019ee, Elizabeth, to come and tell me. You must be so tired out, too, with sitting up. Now do you bide here with me this morning. You can go and rest in the other room; and I will call \u2019ee when breakfast is ready.\u201d To please him, and herself\u2014for his recent kindliness was winning a surprised gratitude from the lonely girl\u2014she did as he bade her, and lay down on a sort of couch which Henchard had rigged up out of a settle in the adjoining room. She could hear him moving about in his preparations; but her mind ran most strongly on Lucetta, whose death in such fulness of life and amid such cheerful hopes of maternity was appallingly unexpected. Presently she fell asleep. Meanwhile her stepfather in the outer room had set the breakfast in readiness; but finding that she dozed he would not call her; he waited on, looking into the fire and keeping the kettle boiling with house-wifely care, as if it were an honour to have her in his house."], "How does Lucettareact when Henchard demands that she end her affair with Farfraein order to marry him?": [" Each had just come out from his early breakfast, and there was not another soul near. Henchard was reading a letter from Lucetta, sent in answer to a note from him, in which she made some excuse for not immediately granting him a second interview that he had desired. Donald had no wish to enter into conversation with his former friend on their present constrained terms; neither would he pass him in scowling silence. He nodded, and Henchard did the same. They receded from each other several paces when a voice cried \u201cFarfrae!\u201d It was Henchard\u2019s, who stood regarding him. \u201cDo you remember,\u201d said Henchard, as if it were the presence of the thought and not of the man which made him speak, \u201cdo you remember my story of that second woman\u2014who suffered for her thoughtless intimacy with me?\u201d \u201cI do,\u201d said Farfrae. \u201cDo you remember my telling \u2019ee how it all began and how it ended? \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWell, I have offered to marry her now that I can; but she won\u2019t marry me.", " Henchard unfolded another letter, and read it through likewise, stopping at the subscription as before. \u201cHer name I don\u2019t give,\u201d he said blandly. \u201cAs I didn\u2019t marry her, and another man did, I can scarcely do that in fairness to her.\u201d \u201cTr-rue, tr-rue,\u201d said Farfrae. \u201cBut why didn\u2019t you marry her when your wife Susan died?\u201d Farfrae asked this and the other questions in the comfortably indifferent tone of one whom the matter very remotely concerned. \u201cAh\u2014well you may ask that!\u201d said Henchard, the new-moon-shaped grin adumbrating itself again upon his mouth. \u201cIn spite of all her protestations, when I came forward to do so, as in generosity bound, she was not the woman for me.\u201d \u201cShe had already married another\u2014maybe?\u201d Henchard seemed to think it would be sailing too near the wind to descend further into particulars, and he answered \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cThe young lady must have had a heart that bore transplanting very readily!\u201d \u201cShe had, she had,\u201d said Henchard emphatically.", " \u201cIt came to nothing; and through you. Then why not leave me the freedom that I gained with such sorrow! Had I found that you proposed to marry me for pure love I might have felt bound now. But I soon learnt that you had planned it out of mere charity\u2014almost as an unpleasant duty\u2014because I had nursed you, and compromised myself, and you thought you must repay me. After that I did not care for you so deeply as before.\u201d \u201cWhy did you come here to find me, then?\u201d \u201cI thought I ought to marry you for conscience\u2019 sake, since you were free, even though I\u2014did not like you so well.\u201d \u201cAnd why then don\u2019t you think so now?\u201d She was silent. It was only too obvious that conscience had ruled well enough till new love had intervened and usurped that rule. In feeling this she herself forgot for the moment her partially justifying argument\u2014that having discovered Henchard\u2019s infirmities of temper, she had some excuse for not risking her happiness in his hands after once escaping them.", " \u201cI was in Jersey several years, and knew you there by sight.\u201d \u201cIndeed,\u201d she replied. \u201cBut I knew nothing of you.\u201d \u201cI think, ma\u2019am, that a word or two from you would secure for me what I covet very much,\u201d he persisted. She steadily refused to have anything to do with the affair, and cutting him short, because of her anxiety to get indoors before her husband should miss her, left him on the pavement. He watched her till she had vanished, and then went home. When he got there he sat down in the fireless chimney corner looking at the iron dogs, and the wood laid across them for heating the morning kettle. A movement upstairs disturbed him, and Henchard came down from his bedroom, where he seemed to have been rummaging boxes. \u201cI wish,\u201d said Henchard, \u201cyou would do me a service, Jopp, now\u2014to-night, I mean, if you can. Leave this at Mrs. Farfrae\u2019s for her. I should take it myself, of course, but I don\u2019t wish to be seen there.\u201d He handed a package in brown paper, sealed."], "To whom doesHenchard entrust Lucetta\u2019s letters?": [" For \u2019tis her love-letters that I\u2019ve got here.\u201d \u201cLove letters? then let\u2019s hear \u2019em, good soul,\u201d said Mother Cuxsom. \u201cLord, do ye mind, Richard, what fools we used to be when we were younger? Getting a schoolboy to write ours for us; and giving him a penny, do ye mind, not to tell other folks what he\u2019d put inside, do ye mind?\u201d By this time Jopp had pushed his finger under the seals, and unfastened the letters, tumbling them over and picking up one here and there at random, which he read aloud. These passages soon began to uncover the secret which Lucetta had so earnestly hoped to keep buried, though the epistles, being allusive only, did not make it altogether plain. \u201cMrs. Farfrae wrote that!\u201d said Nance Mockridge. \u201c\u2019Tis a humbling thing for us, as respectable women, that one of the same sex could do it. And now she\u2019s avowed herself to another man!\u201d \u201cSo much the better for her,\u201d said the aged furmity-woman.", " \u201cThe fact is they are letters mostly.... Yes,\u201d he went on, sitting down and unfolding Lucetta\u2019s passionate bundle, \u201chere they be. That ever I should see \u2019em again! I hope Mrs. Farfrae is well after her exertions of yesterday?\u201d \u201cShe has felt a bit weary; and has gone to bed airly on that account.\u201d Henchard returned to the letters, sorting them over with interest, Farfrae being seated at the other end of the dining-table. \u201cYou don\u2019t forget, of course,\u201d he resumed, \u201cthat curious chapter in the history of my past which I told you of, and that you gave me some assistance in? These letters are, in fact, related to that unhappy business. Though, thank God, it is all over now.\u201d \u201cWhat became of the poor woman?\u201d asked Farfrae. \u201cLuckily she married, and married well,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cSo that these reproaches she poured out on me do not now cause me any twinges, as they might otherwise have done.... Just listen to what an angry woman will say!\u201d Farfrae, willing to humour Henchard, though quite uninterested, and bursting with yawns, gave well-mannered attention.", " Moreover that thoughtless want of foresight which had led to all her trouble remained with poor Lucetta still; she had come to meet him here in this compromising way without perceiving the risk. Such a woman was very small deer to hunt; he felt ashamed, lost all zest and desire to humiliate Lucetta there and then, and no longer envied Farfrae his bargain. He had married money, but nothing more. Henchard was anxious to wash his hands of the game. \u201cWell, what do you want me to do?\u201d he said gently. \u201cI am sure I shall be very willing. My reading of those letters was only a sort of practical joke, and I revealed nothing.\u201d \u201cTo give me back the letters and any papers you may have that breathe of matrimony or worse.\u201d \u201cSo be it. Every scrap shall be yours.... But, between you and me, Lucetta, he is sure to find out something of the matter, sooner or later.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d she said with eager tremulousness; \u201cbut not till I have proved myself a faithful and deserving wife to him, and then he may forgive me everything!\u201d Henchard silently looked at her: he almost envied Farfrae such love as that, even now.", " I shall return through Casterbridge and Budmouth, where I shall take the packet-boat. Can you meet me with the letters and other trifles? I shall be in the coach which changes horses at the Antelope Hotel at half-past five Wednesday evening; I shall be wearing a Paisley shawl with a red centre, and thus may easily be found. I should prefer this plan of receiving them to having them sent.\u2014I remain still, yours; ever, \u201cLUCETTA\u201d Henchard breathed heavily. \u201cPoor thing\u2014better you had not known me! Upon my heart and soul, if ever I should be left in a position to carry out that marriage with thee, I _ought_ to do it\u2014I ought to do it, indeed!\u201d The contingency that he had in his mind was, of course, the death of Mrs. Henchard. As requested, he sealed up Lucetta\u2019s letters, and put the parcel aside till the day she had appointed; this plan of returning them by hand being apparently a little _ruse_ of the young lady for exchanging a word or two with him on past times."], "What does Henchardpersuade the town\u2019s musicians to play at the Three Mariners Inn?": [" \u201cGive this to the Mayor at once,\u201d he said, handing in his hasty note. Elizabeth-Jane had seen his movements and heard the words, which attracted her both by their subject and by their accent\u2014a strange one for those parts. It was quaint and northerly. The waiter took the note, while the young stranger continued\u2014 \u201cAnd can ye tell me of a respectable hotel that\u2019s a little more moderate than this?\u201d The waiter glanced indifferently up and down the street. \u201cThey say the Three Mariners, just below here, is a very good place,\u201d he languidly answered; \u201cbut I have never stayed there myself.\u201d The Scotchman, as he seemed to be, thanked him, and strolled on in the direction of the Three Mariners aforesaid, apparently more concerned about the question of an inn than about the fate of his note, now that the momentary impulse of writing it was over. While he was disappearing slowly down the street the waiter left the door, and Elizabeth-Jane saw with some interest the note brought into the dining-room and handed to the Mayor.", " Yet amid so much that was bad needy respectability also found a home. Under some of the roofs abode pure and virtuous souls whose presence there was due to the iron hand of necessity, and to that alone. Families from decayed villages\u2014families of that once bulky, but now nearly extinct, section of village society called \u201cliviers,\u201d or lifeholders\u2014copyholders and others, whose roof-trees had fallen for some reason or other, compelling them to quit the rural spot that had been their home for generations\u2014came here, unless they chose to lie under a hedge by the wayside. The inn called Peter\u2019s Finger was the church of Mixen Lane. It was centrally situate, as such places should be, and bore about the same social relation to the Three Mariners as the latter bore to the King\u2019s Arms. At first sight the inn was so respectable as to be puzzling. The front door was kept shut, and the step was so clean that evidently but few persons entered over its sanded surface.", " Only Henchard did not conform to these flexuous changes; he remained stately and vertical, silently thinking. The clock struck nine. Elizabeth-Jane turned to her companion. \u201cThe evening is drawing on, mother,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do you propose to do?\u201d She was surprised to find how irresolute her mother had become. \u201cWe must get a place to lie down in,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI have seen\u2014Mr. Henchard; and that\u2019s all I wanted to do.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s enough for to-night, at any rate,\u201d Elizabeth-Jane replied soothingly. \u201cWe can think to-morrow what is best to do about him. The question now is\u2014is it not?\u2014how shall we find a lodging?\u201d As her mother did not reply Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s mind reverted to the words of the waiter, that the Three Mariners was an inn of moderate charges. A recommendation good for one person was probably good for another. \u201cLet\u2019s go where the young man has gone to,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is respectable.", " But of course he didn\u2019t know\u2014he was too refined in his mind to know such things!\u201d Thus she earnestly pleaded. Meanwhile, the \u201che\u201d of her mother was not so far away as even they thought. After leaving the Three Mariners he had sauntered up and down the empty High Street, passing and repassing the inn in his promenade. When the Scotchman sang his voice had reached Henchard\u2019s ears through the heart-shaped holes in the window-shutters, and had led him to pause outside them a long while. \u201cTo be sure, to be sure, how that fellow does draw me!\u201d he had said to himself. \u201cI suppose \u2019tis because I\u2019m so lonely. I\u2019d have given him a third share in the business to have stayed!\u201d IX. When Elizabeth-Jane opened the hinged casement next morning the mellow air brought in the feel of imminent autumn almost as distinctly as if she had been in the remotest hamlet. Casterbridge was the complement of the rural life around, not its urban opposite."], "What is Farfrae\u2019sinitial reaction when asked to be mayor of Casterbridge?": [" When they were gone Henchard regarded the watch they had returned to him. \u201c\u2019Tisn\u2019t mine by rights,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cWhy the devil didn\u2019t they take it?\u2014I don\u2019t want what don\u2019t belong to me!\u201d Moved by a recollection he took the watch to the maker\u2019s just opposite, sold it there and then for what the tradesman offered, and went with the proceeds to one among the smaller of his creditors, a cottager of Durnover in straitened circumstances, to whom he handed the money. When everything was ticketed that Henchard had owned, and the auctions were in progress, there was quite a sympathetic reaction in the town, which till then for some time past had done nothing but condemn him. Now that Henchard\u2019s whole career was pictured distinctly to his neighbours, and they could see how admirably he had used his one talent of energy to create a position of affluence out of absolutely nothing\u2014which was really all he could show when he came to the town as a journeyman hay-trusser, with his wimble and knife in his basket\u2014they wondered and regretted his fall.", " Now he wore the remains of an old blue cloth suit of his gentlemanly times, a rusty silk hat, and a once black satin stock, soiled and shabby. Clad thus he went to and fro, still comparatively an active man\u2014for he was not much over forty\u2014and saw with the other men in the yard Donald Farfrae going in and out the green door that led to the garden, and the big house, and Lucetta. At the beginning of the winter it was rumoured about Casterbridge that Mr. Farfrae, already in the Town Council, was to be proposed for Mayor in a year or two. \u201cYes, she was wise, she was wise in her generation!\u201d said Henchard to himself when he heard of this one day on his way to Farfrae\u2019s hay-barn. He thought it over as he wimbled his bonds, and the piece of news acted as a reviviscent breath to that old view of his\u2014of Donald Farfrae as his triumphant rival who rode rough-shod over him. \u201cA fellow of his age going to be Mayor, indeed!\u201d he murmured with a corner-drawn smile on his mouth.", " Elizabeth, in the meantime, had breathed him a sigh, recovered her equanimity, and turned her face to Casterbridge. Before she had reached the first house she was met in her walk by Donald Farfrae. This was evidently not their first meeting that day; they joined hands without ceremony, and Farfrae anxiously asked, \u201cAnd is he gone\u2014and did you tell him?\u2014I mean of the other matter\u2014not of ours.\u201d \u201cHe is gone; and I told him all I knew of your friend. Donald, who is he?\u201d \u201cWell, well, dearie; you will know soon about that. And Mr. Henchard will hear of it if he does not go far.\u201d \u201cHe will go far\u2014he\u2019s bent upon getting out of sight and sound!\u201d She walked beside her lover, and when they reached the Crossways, or Bow, turned with him into Corn Street instead of going straight on to her own door. At Farfrae\u2019s house they stopped and went in. Farfrae flung open the door of the ground-floor sitting-room, saying, \u201cThere he is waiting for you,\u201d and Elizabeth entered.", " \u201cI wonder,\u201d he asked himself with eerie misgiving; \u201cI wonder if it can be that somebody has been roasting a waxen image of me, or stirring an unholy brew to confound me! I don\u2019t believe in such power; and yet\u2014what if they should ha\u2019 been doing it!\u201d Even he could not admit that the perpetrator, if any, might be Farfrae. These isolated hours of superstition came to Henchard in time of moody depression, when all his practical largeness of view had oozed out of him. Meanwhile Donald Farfrae prospered. He had purchased in so depressed a market that the present moderate stiffness of prices was sufficient to pile for him a large heap of gold where a little one had been. \u201cWhy, he\u2019ll soon be Mayor!\u201d said Henchard. It was indeed hard that the speaker should, of all others, have to follow the triumphal chariot of this man to the Capitol. The rivalry of the masters was taken up by the men. September-night shades had fallen upon Casterbridge; the clocks had struck half-past eight, and the moon had risen."], "What is the nameof the ceremony the townspeople perform to shame Lucetta?": [" My mother\u2019s separation from my father was unfortunate for me. You don\u2019t know what it is to have shadows like that upon your life.\u201d Lucetta seemed to wince. \u201cI do not\u2014of that kind precisely,\u201d she said, \u201cbut you may feel a\u2014sense of disgrace\u2014shame\u2014in other ways.\u201d \u201cHave you ever had any such feeling?\u201d said the younger innocently. \u201cO no,\u201d said Lucetta quickly. \u201cI was thinking of\u2014what happens sometimes when women get themselves in strange positions in the eyes of the world from no fault of their own.\u201d \u201cIt must make them very unhappy afterwards.\u201d \u201cIt makes them anxious; for might not other women despise them?\u201d \u201cNot altogether despise them. Yet not quite like or respect them.\u201d Lucetta winced again. Her past was by no means secure from investigation, even in Casterbridge. For one thing Henchard had never returned to her the cloud of letters she had written and sent him in her first excitement. Possibly they were destroyed; but she could have wished that they had never been written.", " It was not so at all. Donald\u2019s genius would have enabled him to get a footing anywhere, without anybody\u2019s help! He would have been just the same if there had been no Henchard in the world!\u201d It was partly Lucetta\u2019s ignorance of the circumstances of Donald\u2019s arrival which led her to speak thus, partly the sensation that everybody seemed bent on snubbing her at this triumphant time. The incident had occupied but a few moments, but it was necessarily witnessed by the Royal Personage, who, however, with practised tact affected not to have noticed anything unusual. He alighted, the Mayor advanced, the address was read; the Illustrious Personage replied, then said a few words to Farfrae, and shook hands with Lucetta as the Mayor\u2019s wife. The ceremony occupied but a few minutes, and the carriages rattled heavily as Pharaoh\u2019s chariots down Corn Street and out upon the Budmouth Road, in continuation of the journey coastward.", " To intrude as little of his personality as possible upon a gay event with which that personality could show nothing in keeping, he decided not to make his appearance till evening\u2014when stiffness would have worn off, and a gentle wish to let bygones be bygones would exercise its sway in all hearts. He started on foot, two mornings before St. Martin\u2019s-tide, allowing himself about sixteen miles to perform for each of the three days\u2019 journey, reckoning the wedding-day as one. There were only two towns, Melchester and Shottsford, of any importance along his course, and at the latter he stopped on the second night, not only to rest, but to prepare himself for the next evening. Possessing no clothes but the working suit he stood in\u2014now stained and distorted by their two months of hard usage, he entered a shop to make some purchases which should put him, externally at any rate, a little in harmony with the prevailing tone of the morrow.", " Elizabeth, in the meantime, had breathed him a sigh, recovered her equanimity, and turned her face to Casterbridge. Before she had reached the first house she was met in her walk by Donald Farfrae. This was evidently not their first meeting that day; they joined hands without ceremony, and Farfrae anxiously asked, \u201cAnd is he gone\u2014and did you tell him?\u2014I mean of the other matter\u2014not of ours.\u201d \u201cHe is gone; and I told him all I knew of your friend. Donald, who is he?\u201d \u201cWell, well, dearie; you will know soon about that. And Mr. Henchard will hear of it if he does not go far.\u201d \u201cHe will go far\u2014he\u2019s bent upon getting out of sight and sound!\u201d She walked beside her lover, and when they reached the Crossways, or Bow, turned with him into Corn Street instead of going straight on to her own door. At Farfrae\u2019s house they stopped and went in. Farfrae flung open the door of the ground-floor sitting-room, saying, \u201cThere he is waiting for you,\u201d and Elizabeth entered."], "How does Lucettareact to the townspeople\u2019s attempt to shame her?": [" \u201cO dear me\u2014what am I at?\u201d she thought, as she pulled up breathless. Indoors she fell to conjecturing the meaning of Farfrae\u2019s enigmatic words about not daring to ask her what he fain would. Elizabeth, that silent observing woman, had long noted how he was rising in favour among the townspeople; and knowing Henchard\u2019s nature now she had feared that Farfrae\u2019s days as manager were numbered, so that the announcement gave her little surprise. Would Mr. Farfrae stay in Casterbridge despite his words and her father\u2019s dismissal? His occult breathings to her might be solvable by his course in that respect. The next day was windy\u2014so windy that walking in the garden she picked up a portion of the draft of a letter on business in Donald Farfrae\u2019s writing, which had flown over the wall from the office. The useless scrap she took indoors, and began to copy the calligraphy, which she much admired. The letter began \u201cDear Sir,\u201d and presently writing on a loose slip \u201cElizabeth-Jane,\u201d she laid the latter over \u201cSir,\u201d making the phrase \u201cDear Elizabeth-Jane.\u201d When she saw the effect a quick red ran up her face and warmed her through, though nobody was there to see what she had done.", " Tradition reports that at a certain stage of the burning her heart burst and leapt out of her body, to the terror of them all, and that not one of those ten thousand people ever cared particularly for hot roast after that. In addition to these old tragedies, pugilistic encounters almost to the death had come off down to recent dates in that secluded arena, entirely invisible to the outside world save by climbing to the top of the enclosure, which few townspeople in the daily round of their lives ever took the trouble to do. So that, though close to the turnpike-road, crimes might be perpetrated there unseen at mid-day. Some boys had latterly tried to impart gaiety to the ruin by using the central arena as a cricket-ground. But the game usually languished for the aforesaid reason\u2014the dismal privacy which the earthen circle enforced, shutting out every appreciative passer\u2019s vision, every commendatory remark from outsiders\u2014everything, except the sky; and to play at games in such circumstances was like acting to an empty house.", " His mind began vibrating between the wish to reveal himself to her and the policy of leaving well alone, till he could no longer sit still. He walked up and down, and then he came and stood behind her chair, looking down upon the top of her head. He could no longer restrain his impulse. \u201cWhat did your mother tell you about me\u2014my history?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat you were related by marriage.\u201d \u201cShe should have told more\u2014before you knew me! Then my task would not have been such a hard one.... Elizabeth, it is I who am your father, and not Richard Newson. Shame alone prevented your wretched parents from owning this to you while both of \u2019em were alive.\u201d The back of Elizabeth\u2019s head remained still, and her shoulders did not denote even the movements of breathing. Henchard went on: \u201cI\u2019d rather have your scorn, your fear, anything than your ignorance; \u2019tis that I hate! Your mother and I were man and wife when we were young.", " In her poverty she had met with repulse from the society to which she had belonged, and she had no great zest for renewing an attempt upon it now. Her heart longed for some ark into which it could fly and be at rest. Rough or smooth she did not care so long as it was warm. Farfrae was shown out, it having entirely escaped him that he had called to see Elizabeth. Lucetta at the window watched him threading the maze of farmers and farmers\u2019 men. She could see by his gait that he was conscious of her eyes, and her heart went out to him for his modesty\u2014pleaded with her sense of his unfitness that he might be allowed to come again. He entered the market-house, and she could see him no more. Three minutes later, when she had left the window, knocks, not of multitude but of strength, sounded through the house, and the waiting-maid tripped up. \u201cThe Mayor,\u201d she said. Lucetta had reclined herself, and she was looking dreamily through her fingers."], "What is Henchard\u2019sofficial role in greeting the Royal Personage?": [" It was not so at all. Donald\u2019s genius would have enabled him to get a footing anywhere, without anybody\u2019s help! He would have been just the same if there had been no Henchard in the world!\u201d It was partly Lucetta\u2019s ignorance of the circumstances of Donald\u2019s arrival which led her to speak thus, partly the sensation that everybody seemed bent on snubbing her at this triumphant time.

The ceremony occupied but a few minutes, and the carriages rattled heavily as Pharaoh\u2019s chariots down Corn Street and out upon the Budmouth Road, in continuation of the journey coastward.", " The carriages containing the Royal visitor and his suite arrived at the spot in a cloud of dust, a procession was formed, and the whole came on to the Town Hall at a walking pace. This spot was the centre of interest. There were a few clear yards in front of the Royal carriage, sanded; and into this space a man stepped before any one could prevent him. It was Henchard. He had unrolled his private flag, and removing his hat he staggered to the side of the slowing vehicle, waving the Union Jack to and fro with his left hand while he blandly held out his right to the Illustrious Personage. All the ladies said with bated breath, \u201cO, look there!\u201d and Lucetta was ready to faint. Elizabeth-Jane peeped through the shoulders of those in front, saw what it was, and was terrified; and then her interest in the spectacle as a strange phenomenon got the better of her fear. Farfrae, with Mayoral authority, immediately rose to the occasion.", " \u201cYes, to-night,\u201d Jopp had said to the Peter\u2019s party at the corner of Mixen Lane. \u201cAs a wind-up to the Royal visit the hit will be all the more pat by reason of their great elevation to-day.\u201d To him, at least, it was not a joke, but a retaliation. XXXVIII. The proceedings had been brief\u2014too brief\u2014to Lucetta whom an intoxicating _Weltlust_ had fairly mastered; but they had brought her a great triumph nevertheless. The shake of the Royal hand still lingered in her fingers; and the chit-chat she had overheard, that her husband might possibly receive the honour of knighthood, though idle to a degree, seemed not the wildest vision; stranger things had occurred to men so good and captivating as her Scotchman was. After the collision with the Mayor, Henchard had withdrawn behind the ladies\u2019 stand; and there he stood, regarding with a stare of abstraction the spot on the lapel of his coat where Farfrae\u2019s hand had seized it.", " It was one of those excitements which, when they move a country town, leave permanent mark upon its chronicles, as a warm summer permanently marks the ring in the tree-trunk corresponding to its date. A Royal Personage was about to pass through the borough on his course further west, to inaugurate an immense engineering work out that way. He had consented to halt half-an-hour or so in the town, and to receive an address from the corporation of Casterbridge, which, as a representative centre of husbandry, wished thus to express its sense of the great services he had rendered to agricultural science and economics, by his zealous promotion of designs for placing the art of farming on a more scientific footing. Royalty had not been seen in Casterbridge since the days of the third King George, and then only by candlelight for a few minutes, when that monarch, on a night-journey, had stopped to change horses at the King\u2019s Arms."], "What event causesElizabeth-Jane to sever her ties with Henchard?": [" Till then, farewell.\u2014Yours, LUCETTA. _P.S._\u2014I was unable to keep my appointment to meet you for a moment or two in passing through Casterbridge the other day. My plans were altered by a family event, which it will surprise you to hear of. Henchard had already heard that High-Place Hall was being prepared for a tenant. He said with a puzzled air to the first person he encountered, \u201cWho is coming to live at the Hall?\u201d \u201cA lady of the name of Templeman, I believe, sir,\u201d said his informant. Henchard thought it over. \u201cLucetta is related to her, I suppose,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cYes, I must put her in her proper position, undoubtedly.\u201d It was by no means with the oppression that would once have accompanied the thought that he regarded the moral necessity now; it was, indeed, with interest, if not warmth. His bitter disappointment at finding Elizabeth-Jane to be none of his, and himself a childless man, had left an emotional void in Henchard that he unconsciously craved to fill.", " We must have a long talk together\u2014but not just now.\u201d He took her hand at parting, and held it so warmly that she, who had known so little friendship, was much affected, and tears rose to her aerial-grey eyes. The instant that she was gone Henchard\u2019s state showed itself more distinctly; having shut the door he sat in his dining-room stiffly erect, gazing at the opposite wall as if he read his history there. \u201cBegad!\u201d he suddenly exclaimed, jumping up. \u201cI didn\u2019t think of that. Perhaps these are impostors\u2014and Susan and the child dead after all!\u201d However, a something in Elizabeth-Jane soon assured him that, as regarded her, at least, there could be little doubt. And a few hours would settle the question of her mother\u2019s identity; for he had arranged in his note to see her that evening. \u201cIt never rains but it pours!\u201d said Henchard. His keenly excited interest in his new friend the Scotchman was now eclipsed by this event, and Donald Farfrae saw so little of him during the rest of the day that he wondered at the suddenness of his employer\u2019s moods.", " Despite this natural solution of the mystery Henchard no less regarded it as an intervention that the figure should have been floating there. Elizabeth-Jane heard him say, \u201cWho is such a reprobate as I! And yet it seems that even I be in Somebody\u2019s hand!\u201d XLII. But the emotional conviction that he was in Somebody\u2019s hand began to die out of Henchard\u2019s breast as time slowly removed into distance the event which had given that feeling birth. The apparition of Newson haunted him. He would surely return. Yet Newson did not arrive. Lucetta had been borne along the churchyard path; Casterbridge had for the last time turned its regard upon her, before proceeding to its work as if she had never lived. But Elizabeth remained undisturbed in the belief of her relationship to Henchard, and now shared his home. Perhaps, after all, Newson was gone for ever. In due time the bereaved Farfrae had learnt the, at least, proximate cause of Lucetta\u2019s illness and death, and his first impulse was naturally enough to wreak vengeance in the name of the law upon the perpetrators of the mischief.", " \u201cWhy didn\u2019t ye take your holiday like the rest of the men?\u201d He spoke in a tone which had just severity enough in it to show that he remembered the untoward event of the forenoon, and his conviction that Henchard had been drinking. Henchard said nothing; but going back he closed the stair hatchway, and stamped upon it so that it went tight into its frame; he next turned to the wondering young man, who by this time observed that one of Henchard\u2019s arms was bound to his side. \u201cNow,\u201d said Henchard quietly, \u201cwe stand face to face\u2014man and man. Your money and your fine wife no longer lift \u2019ee above me as they did but now, and my poverty does not press me down.\u201d \u201cWhat does it all mean?\u201d asked Farfrae simply. \u201cWait a bit, my lad. You should ha\u2019 thought twice before you affronted to extremes a man who had nothing to lose. I\u2019ve stood your rivalry, which ruined me, and your snubbing, which humbled me; but your hustling, that disgraced me, I won\u2019t stand!\u201d Farfrae warmed a little at this."], "Who cares forHenchard in his dying days?": [" Concurrently with this he underwent a moral change. It resulted in his significantly saying every now and then, in tones of recklessness, \u201cOnly a fortnight more!\u201d\u2014\u201cOnly a dozen days!\u201d and so forth, lessening his figures day by day. \u201cWhy d\u2019ye say only a dozen days?\u201d asked Solomon Longways as he worked beside Henchard in the granary weighing oats. \u201cBecause in twelve days I shall be released from my oath.\u201d \u201cWhat oath?\u201d \u201cThe oath to drink no spirituous liquid. In twelve days it will be twenty-one years since I swore it, and then I mean to enjoy myself, please God!\u201d Elizabeth-Jane sat at her window one Sunday, and while there she heard in the street below a conversation which introduced Henchard\u2019s name. She was wondering what was the matter, when a third person who was passing by asked the question in her mind. \u201cMichael Henchard have busted out drinking after taking nothing for twenty-one years!\u201d Elizabeth-Jane jumped up, put on her things, and went out.", " \u201cWhen I was a young man I went in for that sort of thing too strong\u2014far too strong\u2014and was well-nigh ruined by it! I did a deed on account of it which I shall be ashamed of to my dying day. It made such an impression on me that I swore, there and then, that I\u2019d drink nothing stronger than tea for as many years as I was old that day. I have kept my oath; and though, Farfrae, I am sometimes that dry in the dog days that I could drink a quarter-barrel to the pitching, I think o\u2019 my oath, and touch no strong drink at all.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll no\u2019 press ye, sir\u2014I\u2019ll no\u2019 press ye. I respect your vow.\u201d \u201cWell, I shall get a manager somewhere, no doubt,\u201d said Henchard, with strong feeling in his tones. \u201cBut it will be long before I see one that would suit me so well!\u201d The young man appeared much moved by Henchard\u2019s warm convictions of his value. He was silent till they reached the door. \u201cI wish I could stay\u2014sincerely I would like to,\u201d he replied.", " I christened her by the same name we had given to the first, and she filled up the ache I felt at the other\u2019s loss. Michael, I am dying, and I might have held my tongue; but I could not. Tell her husband of this or not, as you may judge; and forgive, if you can, a woman you once deeply wronged, as she forgives you. SUSAN HENCHARD Her husband regarded the paper as if it were a window-pane through which he saw for miles. His lips twitched, and he seemed to compress his frame, as if to bear better. His usual habit was not to consider whether destiny were hard upon him or not\u2014the shape of his ideals in cases of affliction being simply a moody \u201cI am to suffer, I perceive.\u201d \u201cThis much scourging, then, it is for me.\u201d But now through his passionate head there stormed this thought\u2014that the blasting disclosure was what he had deserved. His wife\u2019s extreme reluctance to have the girl\u2019s name altered from Newson to Henchard was now accounted for fully.", " Among the many hindrances to such a pleading not the least was this, that he did not sufficiently value himself to lessen his sufferings by strenuous appeal or elaborate argument. Waiving, therefore, his privilege of self-defence, he regarded only his discomposure. \u201cDon\u2019t ye distress yourself on my account,\u201d he said, with proud superiority. \u201cI would not wish it\u2014at such a time, too, as this. I have done wrong in coming to \u2019ee\u2014I see my error. But it is only for once, so forgive it. I\u2019ll never trouble \u2019ee again, Elizabeth-Jane\u2014no, not to my dying day! Good-night. Good-bye!\u201d Then, before she could collect her thoughts, Henchard went out from her rooms, and departed from the house by the back way as he had come; and she saw him no more. XLV. It was about a month after the day which closed as in the last chapter. Elizabeth-Jane had grown accustomed to the novelty of her situation, and the only difference between Donald\u2019s movements now and formerly was that he hastened indoors rather more quickly after business hours than he had been in the habit of doing for some time."], "To what biblicalfigure does Henchard compare himself in his suffering?": [" The sense of the supernatural was strong in this unhappy man, and he turned away as one might have done in the actual presence of an appalling miracle. He covered his eyes and bowed his head. Without looking again into the stream he took his coat and hat, and went slowly away. Presently he found himself by the door of his own dwelling. To his surprise Elizabeth-Jane was standing there. She came forward, spoke, called him \u201cfather\u201d just as before. Newson, then, had not even yet returned. \u201cI thought you seemed very sad this morning,\u201d she said, \u201cso I have come again to see you. Not that I am anything but sad myself. But everybody and everything seem against you so, and I know you must be suffering.\u201d How this woman divined things! Yet she had not divined their whole extremity. He said to her, \u201cAre miracles still worked, do ye think, Elizabeth? I am not a read man. I don\u2019t know so much as I could wish.", " \u201cIt shows much long-suffering in you to put up with him, and keep him in your employ.\u201d \u201cBut I cannet discharge a man who was once a good friend to me. How can I forget that when I came here \u2019twas he enabled me to make a footing for mysel\u2019? No, no. As long as I\u2019ve a day\u2019s work to offer he shall do it if he chooses. \u2019Tis not I who will deny him such a little as that. But I\u2019ll drop the idea of establishing him in a shop till I can think more about it.\u201d It grieved Farfrae much to give up this scheme. But a damp having been thrown over it by these and other voices in the air, he went and countermanded his orders. The then occupier of the shop was in it when Farfrae spoke to him and feeling it necessary to give some explanation of his withdrawal from the negotiation Donald mentioned Henchard\u2019s name, and stated that the intentions of the Council had been changed. The occupier was much disappointed, and straight-way informed Henchard, as soon as he saw him, that a scheme of the Council for setting him up in a shop had been knocked on the head by Farfrae.", " Idlers were standing on the pavement in front; and wishing to escape the notice of these Henchard passed quickly on to the door. It was wide open, the hall was lighted extravagantly, and people were going up and down the stairs. His courage failed him; to enter footsore, laden, and poorly dressed into the midst of such resplendency was to bring needless humiliation upon her he loved, if not to court repulse from her husband. Accordingly he went round into the street at the back that he knew so well, entered the garden, and came quietly into the house through the kitchen, temporarily depositing the bird and cage under a bush outside, to lessen the awkwardness of his arrival. Solitude and sadness had so emolliated Henchard that he now feared circumstances he would formerly have scorned, and he began to wish that he had not taken upon himself to arrive at such a juncture. However, his progress was made unexpectedly easy by his discovering alone in the kitchen an elderly woman who seemed to be acting as provisional housekeeper during the convulsions from which Farfrae\u2019s establishment was just then suffering.", " Behind his back he was called \u201cWide-oh,\u201d on account of his reputation; to his face \u201cMr.\u201d Fall. The hedge of his garden formed an arch over the entrance, and a door was inserted as in a wall. Outside the door the tall traveller stopped, bandaged his face with a handkerchief as if he were suffering from toothache, and went up the path. The window shutters were not closed, and he could see the prophet within, preparing his supper. In answer to the knock Fall came to the door, candle in hand. The visitor stepped back a little from the light, and said, \u201cCan I speak to \u2019ee?\u201d in significant tones. The other\u2019s invitation to come in was responded to by the country formula, \u201cThis will do, thank \u2019ee,\u201d after which the householder had no alternative but to come out. He placed the candle on the corner of the dresser, took his hat from a nail, and joined the stranger in the porch, shutting the door behind him."], "What does Michael Henchard sell in an auction?": [" I\u2019d challenge England to beat me in the fodder business; and if I were a free man again I\u2019d be worth a thousand pound before I\u2019d done o\u2019t. But a fellow never knows these little things till all chance of acting upon \u2019em is past.\u201d The auctioneer selling the old horses in the field outside could be heard saying, \u201cNow this is the last lot\u2014now who\u2019ll take the last lot for a song? Shall I say forty shillings? \u2019Tis a very promising broodmare, a trifle over five years old, and nothing the matter with the hoss at all, except that she\u2019s a little holler in the back and had her left eye knocked out by the kick of another, her own sister, coming along the road.\u201d \u201cFor my part I don\u2019t see why men who have got wives and don\u2019t want \u2019em, shouldn\u2019t get rid of \u2019em as these gipsy fellows do their old horses,\u201d said the man in the tent. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t they put \u2019em up and sell \u2019em by auction to men who are in need of such articles?", " \u201cBut not being a man o\u2019 letters, I can\u2019t read writing; so I don\u2019t know what it is. I can get it and show ye.\u201d They stood in silence while he ran into the cottage; returning in a moment with a crumpled scrap of paper. On it there was pencilled as follows:\u2014 MICHAEL HENCHARD\u2019S WILL. \u201cThat Elizabeth-Jane Farfrae be not told of my death, or made to grieve on account of me. \u201c& that I be not bury\u2019d in consecrated ground. \u201c& that no sexton be asked to toll the bell. \u201c& that nobody is wished to see my dead body. \u201c& that no murners walk behind me at my funeral. \u201c& that no flours be planted on my grave. \u201c& that no man remember me. \u201cTo this I put my name. \u201cMICHAEL HENCHARD.\u201d \u201cWhat are we to do?\u201d said Donald, when he had handed the paper to her. She could not answer distinctly. \u201cO Donald!\u201d she cried at last through her tears, \u201cwhat bitterness lies there! O I would not have minded so much if it had not been for my unkindness at that last parting!...", " The seal had cracked, and the letter was open. Henchard had no reason to suppose the restriction one of serious weight, and his feeling for his late wife had not been of the nature of deep respect. \u201cSome trifling fancy or other of poor Susan\u2019s, I suppose,\u201d he said; and without curiosity he allowed his eyes to scan the letter:\u2014 MY DEAR MICHAEL,\u2014For the good of all three of us I have kept one thing a secret from you till now. I hope you will understand why; I think you will; though perhaps you may not forgive me. But, dear Michael, I have done it for the best. I shall be in my grave when you read this, and Elizabeth-Jane will have a home. Don\u2019t curse me Mike\u2014think of how I was situated. I can hardly write it, but here it is. Elizabeth-Jane is not your Elizabeth-Jane\u2014the child who was in my arms when you sold me. No; she died three months after that, and this living one is my other husband\u2019s.", " \u201cHim? Who are you talking about?\u201d she said wildly. \u201cNobody, as far as I am concerned,\u201d said Elizabeth firmly. \u201cOh\u2014well. Then it is my mistake,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cBut the business is between me and Miss Templeman. She agrees to be my wife.\u201d \u201cBut don\u2019t dwell on it just now,\u201d entreated Elizabeth, holding Lucetta\u2019s hand. \u201cI don\u2019t wish to, if she promises,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cI have, I have,\u201d groaned Lucetta, her limbs hanging like fluid, from very misery and faintness. \u201cMichael, please don\u2019t argue it any more!\u201d \u201cI will not,\u201d he said. And taking up his hat he went away. Elizabeth-Jane continued to kneel by Lucetta. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d she said. \u201cYou called my father \u2018Michael\u2019 as if you knew him well? And how is it he has got this power over you, that you promise to marry him against your will? Ah\u2014you have many many secrets from me!\u201d \u201cPerhaps you have some from me,\u201d Lucetta murmured with closed eyes, little thinking, however, so unsuspicious was she, that the secret of Elizabeth\u2019s heart concerned the young man who had caused this damage to her own."], "How many years after the auction does the sailor, Newson, die?": [" \u201cWhere is she buried?\u201d the traveller inquired. \u201cBeside her mother,\u201d said Henchard, in the same stolid tones. \u201cWhen did she die?\u201d \u201cA year ago and more,\u201d replied the other without hesitation. The sailor continued standing. Henchard never looked up from the floor. At last Newson said: \u201cMy journey hither has been for nothing! I may as well go as I came! It has served me right. I\u2019ll trouble you no longer.\u201d Henchard heard the retreating footsteps of Newson upon the sanded floor, the mechanical lifting of the latch, the slow opening and closing of the door that was natural to a baulked or dejected man; but he did not turn his head. Newson\u2019s shadow passed the window. He was gone. Then Henchard, scarcely believing the evidence of his senses, rose from his seat amazed at what he had done. It had been the impulse of a moment. The regard he had lately acquired for Elizabeth, the new-sprung hope of his loneliness that she would be to him a daughter of whom he could feel as proud as of the actual daughter she still believed herself to be, had been stimulated by the unexpected coming of Newson to a greedy exclusiveness in relation to her; so that the sudden prospect of her loss had caused him to speak mad lies like a child, in pure mockery of consequences.", " He had expected questions to close in round him, and unmask his fabrication in five minutes; yet such questioning had not come. But surely they would come; Newson\u2019s departure could be but momentary; he would learn all by inquiries in the town; and return to curse him, and carry his last treasure away! He hastily put on his hat, and went out in the direction that Newson had taken. Newson\u2019s back was soon visible up the road, crossing Bull-stake. Henchard followed, and saw his visitor stop at the King\u2019s Arms, where the morning coach which had brought him waited half-an-hour for another coach which crossed there. The coach Newson had come by was now about to move again. Newson mounted, his luggage was put in, and in a few minutes the vehicle disappeared with him. He had not so much as turned his head. It was an act of simple faith in Henchard\u2019s words\u2014faith so simple as to be almost sublime. The young sailor who had taken Susan Henchard on the spur of the moment and on the faith of a glance at her face, more than twenty years before, was still living and acting under the form of the grizzled traveller who had taken Henchard\u2019s words on trust so absolute as to shame him as he stood.", " Henchard observed him indifferently, and shook his head. \u201cWell\u2014perhaps you may not. My name is Newson.\u201d Henchard\u2019s face and eyes seemed to die. The other did not notice it. \u201cI know the name well,\u201d Henchard said at last, looking on the floor. \u201cI make no doubt of that. Well, the fact is, I\u2019ve been looking for \u2019ee this fortnight past. I landed at Havenpool and went through Casterbridge on my way to Falmouth, and when I got there, they told me you had some years before been living at Casterbridge. Back came I again, and by long and by late I got here by coach, ten minutes ago. \u2018He lives down by the mill,\u2019 says they. So here I am. Now\u2014that transaction between us some twenty years agone\u2014\u2019tis that I\u2019ve called about. \u2019Twas a curious business. I was younger then than I am now, and perhaps the less said about it, in one sense, the better.\u201d \u201cCurious business! \u2019Twas worse than curious. I cannot even allow that I\u2019m the man you met then.", " \u201cSit down\u2014Elizabeth-Jane\u2014sit down,\u201d he said, with a shake in his voice as he uttered her name, and sitting down himself he allowed his hands to hang between his knees while he looked upon the carpet. \u201cYour mother, then, is quite well?\u201d \u201cShe is rather worn out, sir, with travelling.\u201d \u201cA sailor\u2019s widow\u2014when did he die?\u201d \u201cFather was lost last spring.\u201d Henchard winced at the word \u201cfather,\u201d thus applied. \u201cDo you and she come from abroad\u2014America or Australia?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo. We have been in England some years. I was twelve when we came here from Canada.\u201d \u201cAh; exactly.\u201d By such conversation he discovered the circumstances which had enveloped his wife and her child in such total obscurity that he had long ago believed them to be in their graves. These things being clear, he returned to the present. \u201cAnd where is your mother staying?\u201d \u201cAt the Three Mariners.\u201d \u201cAnd you are her daughter Elizabeth-Jane?\u201d repeated Henchard."], "Who does Elizabeth-Jane go to live with after Henchard becomes cold towards her?": [" \u201cFather,\u201d she said, as soon as she recalled herself to the outspread meal, \u201cit is so kind of you to get this nice breakfast with your own hands, and I idly asleep the while.\u201d \u201cI do it every day,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou have left me; everybody has left me; how should I live but by my own hands.\u201d \u201cYou are very lonely, are you not?\u201d \u201cAy, child\u2014to a degree that you know nothing of! It is my own fault. You are the only one who has been near me for weeks. And you will come no more.\u201d \u201cWhy do you say that? Indeed I will, if you would like to see me.\u201d Henchard signified dubiousness. Though he had so lately hoped that Elizabeth-Jane might again live in his house as daughter, he would not ask her to do so now. Newson might return at any moment, and what Elizabeth would think of him for his deception it were best to bear apart from her. When they had breakfasted his stepdaughter still lingered, till the moment arrived at which Henchard was accustomed to go to his daily work.", " Then she arose, and with assurance of coming again soon went up the hill in the morning sunlight. \u201cAt this moment her heart is as warm towards me as mine is towards her, she would live with me here in this humble cottage for the asking! Yet before the evening probably he will have come, and then she will scorn me!\u201d This reflection, constantly repeated by Henchard to himself, accompanied him everywhere through the day. His mood was no longer that of the rebellious, ironical, reckless misadventurer; but the leaden gloom of one who has lost all that can make life interesting, or even tolerable. There would remain nobody for him to be proud of, nobody to fortify him; for Elizabeth-Jane would soon be but as a stranger, and worse. Susan, Farfrae, Lucetta, Elizabeth\u2014all had gone from him, one after one, either by his fault or by his misfortune. In place of them he had no interest, hobby, or desire.", " Henchard pushed to the door, and for some seconds made no other movement. He rose to his feet, and stood like a dark ruin, obscured by \u201cthe shade from his own soul up-thrown.\u201d But he was no longer the man to stand these reverses unmoved. His agitation was great, and he would fain have been gone, but before he could leave the dance had ended, the housekeeper had informed Elizabeth-Jane of the stranger who awaited her, and she entered the room immediately. \u201cOh\u2014it is\u2014Mr. Henchard!\u201d she said, starting back. \u201cWhat, Elizabeth?\u201d he cried, as she seized her hand. \u201cWhat do you say?\u2014_Mr._ Henchard? Don\u2019t, don\u2019t scourge me like that! Call me worthless old Henchard\u2014anything\u2014but don\u2019t \u2019ee be so cold as this! O my maid\u2014I see you have another\u2014a real father in my place. Then you know all; but don\u2019t give all your thought to him! Do ye save a little room for me!\u201d She flushed up, and gently drew her hand away.", " \u201cThat\u2019s the way the wind blows, is it?\u201d he said at last grimly, nodding an affirmative to his own thoughts. A yellow flood of reflected sunlight filled the room for a few instants. It was produced by the passing of a load of newly trussed hay from the country, in a waggon marked with Farfrae\u2019s name. Beside it rode Farfrae himself on horseback. Lucetta\u2019s face became\u2014as a woman\u2019s face becomes when the man she loves rises upon her gaze like an apparition. A turn of the eye by Henchard, a glance from the window, and the secret of her inaccessibility would have been revealed. But Henchard in estimating her tone was looking down so plumb-straight that he did not note the warm consciousness upon Lucetta\u2019s face. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have thought it\u2014I shouldn\u2019t have thought it of women!\u201d he said emphatically by-and-by, rising and shaking himself into activity; while Lucetta was so anxious to divert him from any suspicion of the truth that she asked him to be in no hurry."], "Who does the \u201cskimmity ride\u201d parade make fun of?": [" \u201cAh, I saved her from a real bad marriage, and she\u2019s never been the one to thank me.\u201d \u201cI say, what a good foundation for a skimmity-ride,\u201d said Nance. \u201cTrue,\u201d said Mrs. Cuxsom, reflecting. \u201c\u2019Tis as good a ground for a skimmity-ride as ever I knowed; and it ought not to be wasted. The last one seen in Casterbridge must have been ten years ago, if a day.\u201d At this moment there was a shrill whistle, and the landlady said to the man who had been called Charl, \u201c\u2019Tis Jim coming in. Would ye go and let down the bridge for me?\u201d Without replying Charl and his comrade Joe rose, and receiving a lantern from her went out at the back door and down the garden-path, which ended abruptly at the edge of the stream already mentioned. Beyond the stream was the open moor, from which a clammy breeze smote upon their faces as they advanced. Taking up the board that had lain in readiness one of them lowered it across the water, and the instant its further end touched the ground footsteps entered upon it, and there appeared from the shade a stalwart man with straps round his knees, a double-barrelled gun under his arm and some birds slung up behind him.", " In consciousness of this they stopped. \u201cI never found out who it was that sent us to Durnover granary on a fool\u2019s errand that day,\u201d said Donald, in his undulating tones. \u201cDid ye ever know yourself, Miss Newson?\u201d \u201cNever,\u201d said she. \u201cI wonder why they did it!\u201d \u201cFor fun, perhaps.\u201d \u201cPerhaps it was not for fun. It might have been that they thought they would like us to stay waiting there, talking to one another? Ay, well! I hope you Casterbridge folk will not forget me if I go.\u201d \u201cThat I\u2019m sure we won\u2019t!\u201d she said earnestly. \u201cI\u2014wish you wouldn\u2019t go at all.\u201d They had got into the lamplight. \u201cNow, I\u2019ll think over that,\u201d said Donald Farfrae. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll not come up to your door; but part from you here; lest it make your father more angry still.\u201d They parted, Farfrae returning into the dark Bowling Walk, and Elizabeth-Jane going up the street. Without any consciousness of what she was doing she started running with all her might till she reached her father\u2019s door.", " In his hand he carried a small mahogany case, strapped, and clamped with brass. Apparently surprised at the kind of company which confronted him through the kitchen door, he at once abandoned his idea of putting up at the house; but taking the situation lightly, he called for glasses of the best, paid for them as he stood in the passage, and turned to proceed on his way by the front door. This was barred, and while the landlady was unfastening it the conversation about the skimmington was continued in the sitting-room, and reached his ears. \u201cWhat do they mean by a \u2018skimmity-ride\u2019?\u201d he asked. \u201cO, sir!\u201d said the landlady, swinging her long earrings with deprecating modesty; \u201c\u2019tis a\u2019 old foolish thing they do in these parts when a man\u2019s wife is\u2014well, not too particularly his own. But as a respectable householder I don\u2019t encourage it. \u201cStill, are they going to do it shortly? It is a good sight to see, I suppose?\u201d \u201cWell, sir!\u201d she simpered.", " The mixed assemblage of idlers known to each other presently fell apart into two bands by a process of natural selection, the frequenters of Peter\u2019s Finger going off Mixen Lanewards, where most of them lived, while Coney, Buzzford, Longways, and that connection remained in the street. \u201cYou know what\u2019s brewing down there, I suppose?\u201d said Buzzford mysteriously to the others. Coney looked at him. \u201cNot the skimmity-ride?\u201d Buzzford nodded. \u201cI have my doubts if it will be carried out,\u201d said Longways. \u201cIf they are getting it up they are keeping it mighty close. \u201cI heard they were thinking of it a fortnight ago, at all events.\u201d \u201cIf I were sure o\u2019t I\u2019d lay information,\u201d said Longways emphatically. \u201c\u2019Tis too rough a joke, and apt to wake riots in towns. We know that the Scotchman is a right enough man, and that his lady has been a right enough \u2019oman since she came here, and if there was anything wrong about her afore, that\u2019s their business, not ours.\u201d Coney reflected."], "What is Henchard\u2019s dying wish?": [" Among the many hindrances to such a pleading not the least was this, that he did not sufficiently value himself to lessen his sufferings by strenuous appeal or elaborate argument. Waiving, therefore, his privilege of self-defence, he regarded only his discomposure. \u201cDon\u2019t ye distress yourself on my account,\u201d he said, with proud superiority. \u201cI would not wish it\u2014at such a time, too, as this. I have done wrong in coming to \u2019ee\u2014I see my error. But it is only for once, so forgive it. I\u2019ll never trouble \u2019ee again, Elizabeth-Jane\u2014no, not to my dying day! Good-night. Good-bye!\u201d Then, before she could collect her thoughts, Henchard went out from her rooms, and departed from the house by the back way as he had come; and she saw him no more. XLV. It was about a month after the day which closed as in the last chapter. Elizabeth-Jane had grown accustomed to the novelty of her situation, and the only difference between Donald\u2019s movements now and formerly was that he hastened indoors rather more quickly after business hours than he had been in the habit of doing for some time.", " \u201cWhen I was a young man I went in for that sort of thing too strong\u2014far too strong\u2014and was well-nigh ruined by it! I did a deed on account of it which I shall be ashamed of to my dying day. It made such an impression on me that I swore, there and then, that I\u2019d drink nothing stronger than tea for as many years as I was old that day. I have kept my oath; and though, Farfrae, I am sometimes that dry in the dog days that I could drink a quarter-barrel to the pitching, I think o\u2019 my oath, and touch no strong drink at all.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll no\u2019 press ye, sir\u2014I\u2019ll no\u2019 press ye. I respect your vow.\u201d \u201cWell, I shall get a manager somewhere, no doubt,\u201d said Henchard, with strong feeling in his tones. \u201cBut it will be long before I see one that would suit me so well!\u201d The young man appeared much moved by Henchard\u2019s warm convictions of his value. He was silent till they reached the door. \u201cI wish I could stay\u2014sincerely I would like to,\u201d he replied.", " I wish he was the master instead of Henchard,\u2019 they said.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ll talk any nonsense,\u201d Henchard replied with covered gloom. \u201cWell, you can go now. And _I_ am coming to value the hay, d\u2019ye hear?\u2014I.\u201d The boy departed, and Henchard murmured, \u201cWish he were master here, do they?\u201d He went towards Durnover. On his way he overtook Farfrae. They walked on together, Henchard looking mostly on the ground. \u201cYou\u2019re no yoursel\u2019 the day?\u201d Donald inquired. \u201cYes, I am very well,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cBut ye are a bit down\u2014surely ye are down? Why, there\u2019s nothing to be angry about! \u2019Tis splendid stuff that we\u2019ve got from Blackmoor Vale. By the by, the people in Durnover want their hay valued.\u201d \u201cYes. I am going there.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll go with ye.\u201d As Henchard did not reply Donald practised a piece of music _sotto voce_, till, getting near the bereaved people\u2019s door, he stopped himself with\u2014 \u201cAh, as their father is dead I won\u2019t go on with such as that.", " And thus Henchard found himself again on the precise standing which he had occupied a quarter of a century before. Externally there was nothing to hinder his making another start on the upward slope, and by his new lights achieving higher things than his soul in its half-formed state had been able to accomplish. But the ingenious machinery contrived by the Gods for reducing human possibilities of amelioration to a minimum\u2014which arranges that wisdom to do shall come _pari passu_ with the departure of zest for doing\u2014stood in the way of all that. He had no wish to make an arena a second time of a world that had become a mere painted scene to him. Very often, as his hay-knife crunched down among the sweet-smelling grassy stems, he would survey mankind and say to himself: \u201cHere and everywhere be folk dying before their time like frosted leaves, though wanted by their families, the country, and the world; while I, an outcast, an encumberer of the ground, wanted by nobody, and despised by all, live on against my will!\u201d He often kept an eager ear upon the conversation of those who passed along the road\u2014not from a general curiosity by any means\u2014but in the hope that among these travellers between Casterbridge and London some would, sooner or later, speak of the former place."], "What crop is Michael Henchard a merchant of?": [" The farmer\u2019s income was ruled by the wheat-crop within his own horizon, and the wheat-crop by the weather. Thus in person, he became a sort of flesh-barometer, with feelers always directed to the sky and wind around him. The local atmosphere was everything to him; the atmospheres of other countries a matter of indifference. The people, too, who were not farmers, the rural multitude, saw in the god of the weather a more important personage than they do now. Indeed, the feeling of the peasantry in this matter was so intense as to be almost unrealizable in these equable days. Their impulse was well-nigh to prostrate themselves in lamentation before untimely rains and tempests, which came as the Alastor of those households whose crime it was to be poor. After midsummer they watched the weather-cocks as men waiting in antechambers watch the lackey. Sun elated them; quiet rain sobered them; weeks of watery tempest stupefied them.", " \u201cBut not being a man o\u2019 letters, I can\u2019t read writing; so I don\u2019t know what it is. I can get it and show ye.\u201d They stood in silence while he ran into the cottage; returning in a moment with a crumpled scrap of paper. On it there was pencilled as follows:\u2014 MICHAEL HENCHARD\u2019S WILL. \u201cThat Elizabeth-Jane Farfrae be not told of my death, or made to grieve on account of me. \u201c& that I be not bury\u2019d in consecrated ground. \u201c& that no sexton be asked to toll the bell. \u201c& that nobody is wished to see my dead body. \u201c& that no murners walk behind me at my funeral. \u201c& that no flours be planted on my grave. \u201c& that no man remember me. \u201cTo this I put my name. \u201cMICHAEL HENCHARD.\u201d \u201cWhat are we to do?\u201d said Donald, when he had handed the paper to her. She could not answer distinctly. \u201cO Donald!\u201d she cried at last through her tears, \u201cwhat bitterness lies there! O I would not have minded so much if it had not been for my unkindness at that last parting!...", " The seal had cracked, and the letter was open. Henchard had no reason to suppose the restriction one of serious weight, and his feeling for his late wife had not been of the nature of deep respect. \u201cSome trifling fancy or other of poor Susan\u2019s, I suppose,\u201d he said; and without curiosity he allowed his eyes to scan the letter:\u2014 MY DEAR MICHAEL,\u2014For the good of all three of us I have kept one thing a secret from you till now. I hope you will understand why; I think you will; though perhaps you may not forgive me. But, dear Michael, I have done it for the best. I shall be in my grave when you read this, and Elizabeth-Jane will have a home. Don\u2019t curse me Mike\u2014think of how I was situated. I can hardly write it, but here it is. Elizabeth-Jane is not your Elizabeth-Jane\u2014the child who was in my arms when you sold me. No; she died three months after that, and this living one is my other husband\u2019s.", " \u201cHim? Who are you talking about?\u201d she said wildly. \u201cNobody, as far as I am concerned,\u201d said Elizabeth firmly. \u201cOh\u2014well. Then it is my mistake,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cBut the business is between me and Miss Templeman. She agrees to be my wife.\u201d \u201cBut don\u2019t dwell on it just now,\u201d entreated Elizabeth, holding Lucetta\u2019s hand. \u201cI don\u2019t wish to, if she promises,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cI have, I have,\u201d groaned Lucetta, her limbs hanging like fluid, from very misery and faintness. \u201cMichael, please don\u2019t argue it any more!\u201d \u201cI will not,\u201d he said. And taking up his hat he went away. Elizabeth-Jane continued to kneel by Lucetta. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d she said. \u201cYou called my father \u2018Michael\u2019 as if you knew him well? And how is it he has got this power over you, that you promise to marry him against your will? Ah\u2014you have many many secrets from me!\u201d \u201cPerhaps you have some from me,\u201d Lucetta murmured with closed eyes, little thinking, however, so unsuspicious was she, that the secret of Elizabeth\u2019s heart concerned the young man who had caused this damage to her own."], "Who arrives in Casterbridge at the same time as Elizabeth-Jane and Susan?": [" Nobody would have conceived from his outward demeanour that there was no amatory fire or pulse of romance acting as stimulant to the bustle going on in his gaunt, great house; nothing but three large resolves\u2014one, to make amends to his neglected Susan, another, to provide a comfortable home for Elizabeth-Jane under his paternal eye; and a third, to castigate himself with the thorns which these restitutory acts brought in their train; among them the lowering of his dignity in public opinion by marrying so comparatively humble a woman. Susan Henchard entered a carriage for the first time in her life when she stepped into the plain brougham which drew up at the door on the wedding-day to take her and Elizabeth-Jane to church. It was a windless morning of warm November rain, which floated down like meal, and lay in a powdery form on the nap of hats and coats. Few people had gathered round the church door though they were well packed within.", " She was terribly careless of appearances, and I was perhaps more, because o\u2019 my dreary state; and it was through this that the scandal arose. At last I was well, and came away. When I was gone she suffered much on my account, and didn\u2019t forget to tell me so in letters one after another; till latterly, I felt I owed her something, and thought that, as I had not heard of Susan for so long, I would make this other one the only return I could make, and ask her if she would run the risk of Susan being alive (very slight as I believed) and marry me, such as I was. She jumped for joy, and we should no doubt soon have been married\u2014but, behold, Susan appears!\u201d Donald showed his deep concern at a complication so far beyond the degree of his simple experiences. \u201cNow see what injury a man may cause around him! Even after that wrong-doing at the fair when I was young, if I had never been so selfish as to let this giddy girl devote herself to me over at Jersey, to the injury of her name, all might now be well.", " The seal had cracked, and the letter was open. Henchard had no reason to suppose the restriction one of serious weight, and his feeling for his late wife had not been of the nature of deep respect. \u201cSome trifling fancy or other of poor Susan\u2019s, I suppose,\u201d he said; and without curiosity he allowed his eyes to scan the letter:\u2014 MY DEAR MICHAEL,\u2014For the good of all three of us I have kept one thing a secret from you till now.

But now he\u2019s gone I can tell ye. Why, I came to Casterbridge nine or ten months before that day last week that I found ye out. I had been here twice before then. The first time I passed through the town on my way westward, not knowing Elizabeth lived here.

We go back for a moment to the preceding night, to account for Henchard\u2019s attitude. At the hour when Elizabeth-Jane was contemplating her stealthy reconnoitring excursion to the abode of the lady of her fancy, he had been not a little amazed at receiving a letter by hand in Lucetta\u2019s well-known characters. The self-repression, the resignation of her previous communication had vanished from her mood; she wrote with some of the natural lightness which had marked her in their early acquaintance. HIGH-PLACE HALL MY DEAR MR. HENCHARD,\u2014Don\u2019t be surprised. It is for your good and mine, as I hope, that I have come to live at Casterbridge\u2014for how long I cannot tell. That depends upon another; and he is a man, and a merchant, and a Mayor, and one who has the first right to my affections.", " XXXIII. At this date there prevailed in Casterbridge a convivial custom\u2014scarcely recognized as such, yet none the less established. On the afternoon of every Sunday a large contingent of the Casterbridge journeymen\u2014steady churchgoers and sedate characters\u2014having attended service, filed from the church doors across the way to the Three Mariners Inn. The rear was usually brought up by the choir, with their bass-viols, fiddles, and flutes under their arms. The great point, the point of honour, on these sacred occasions was for each man to strictly limit himself to half-a-pint of liquor. This scrupulosity was so well understood by the landlord that the whole company was served in cups of that measure. They were all exactly alike\u2014straight-sided, with two leafless lime-trees done in eel-brown on the sides\u2014one towards the drinker\u2019s lips, the other confronting his comrade. To wonder how many of these cups the landlord possessed altogether was a favourite exercise of children in the marvellous.", " Jopp too, had had a convenient experience; he was the only one in Casterbridge besides Henchard and the close-lipped Elizabeth who knew that Lucetta came truly from Jersey, and but proximately from Bath. \u201cI know Jersey too, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cWas living there when you used to do business that way. O yes\u2014have often seen ye there.\u201d \u201cIndeed! Very good. Then the thing is settled. The testimonials you showed me when you first tried for\u2019t are sufficient.\u201d That characters deteriorated in time of need possibly did not occur to Henchard. Jopp said, \u201cThank you,\u201d and stood more firmly, in the consciousness that at last he officially belonged to that spot. \u201cNow,\u201d said Henchard, digging his strong eyes into Jopp\u2019s face, \u201cone thing is necessary to me, as the biggest corn-and-hay dealer in these parts.

Before she had reached the first house she was met in her walk by Donald Farfrae. This was evidently not their first meeting that day; they joined hands without ceremony, and Farfrae anxiously asked, \u201cAnd is he gone\u2014and did you tell him?\u2014I mean of the other matter\u2014not of ours.\u201d \u201cHe is gone; and I told him all I knew of your friend.

The walls, built of kneaded clay originally faced with a trowel, had been worn by years of rain-washings to a lumpy crumbling surface, channelled and sunken from its plane, its gray rents held together here and there by a leafy strap of ivy which could scarcely find substance enough for the purpose. The rafters were sunken, and the thatch of the roof in ragged holes. Leaves from the fence had been blown into the corners of the doorway, and lay there undisturbed. The door was ajar; Farfrae knocked; and he who stood before them was Whittle, as they had conjectured. His face showed marks of deep sadness, his eyes lighting on them with an unfocused gaze; and he still held in his hand the few sticks he had been out to gather. As soon as he recognized them he started. \u201cWhat, Abel Whittle; is it that ye are heere?\u201d said Farfrae.", " Mr. Henchard said\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care what Mr. Henchard said, nor anybody else! \u2019Tis simple foolishness to do this. Go and dress yourself instantly Whittle.\u201d \u201cHullo, hullo!\u201d said Henchard, coming up behind. \u201cWho\u2019s sending him back?\u201d All the men looked towards Farfrae. \u201cI am,\u201d said Donald. \u201cI say this joke has been carried far enough.\u201d \u201cAnd I say it hasn\u2019t! Get up in the waggon, Whittle.\u201d \u201cNot if I am manager,\u201d said Farfrae. \u201cHe either goes home, or I march out of this yard for good.\u201d Henchard looked at him with a face stern and red. But he paused for a moment, and their eyes met. Donald went up to him, for he saw in Henchard\u2019s look that he began to regret this. \u201cCome,\u201d said Donald quietly, \u201ca man o\u2019 your position should ken better, sir! It is tyrannical and no worthy of you.\u201d \u201c\u2019Tis not tyrannical!\u201d murmured Henchard, like a sullen boy. \u201cIt is to make him remember!\u201d He presently added, in a tone of one bitterly hurt: \u201cWhy did you speak to me before them like that, Farfrae?", " How could I forget?\u201d \u201cDo you care so very much about hurting folks\u2019 feelings?\u201d observed Henchard with a half sneer. \u201cYou do, I know\u2014especially mine!\u201d \u201cI am sorry if I have hurt yours, sir,\u201d replied Donald, standing still, with a second expression of the same sentiment in the regretfulness of his face. \u201cWhy should you say it\u2014think it?\u201d The cloud lifted from Henchard\u2019s brow, and as Donald finished the corn-merchant turned to him, regarding his breast rather than his face. \u201cI have been hearing things that vexed me,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2019Twas that made me short in my manner\u2014made me overlook what you really are. Now, I don\u2019t want to go in here about this hay\u2014Farfrae, you can do it better than I. They sent for \u2019ee, too. I have to attend a meeting of the Town Council at eleven, and \u2019tis drawing on for\u2019t.\u201d They parted thus in renewed friendship, Donald forbearing to ask Henchard for meanings that were not very plain to him."], "What is Henchard\u2019s occupation when he first moves to Casterbridge?": [" But, ah!\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cI am no accomplished person.

And, of course, you want some one who can write that?\u201d \u201cWell, no.\u201d \u201cWhat, not necessary to write ladies\u2019-hand?\u201d cried the joyous Elizabeth. \u201cNot at all.\u201d \u201cBut where do you live?\u201d \u201cIn Casterbridge, or rather I shall be living here after twelve o\u2019clock to-day.\u201d Elizabeth expressed her astonishment. \u201cI have been staying at Budmouth for a few days while my house was getting ready. The house I am going into is that one they call High-Place Hall\u2014the old stone one looking down the lane to the market. Two or three rooms are fit for occupation, though not all: I sleep there to-night for the first time.", " Sneering at himself for his weakness he yet every hour\u2014nay, every few minutes\u2014conjectured her actions for the time being\u2014her sitting down and rising up, her goings and comings, till thought of Newson\u2019s and Farfrae\u2019s counter-influence would pass like a cold blast over a pool, and efface her image. And then he would say to himself, \u201cO you fool! All this about a daughter who is no daughter of thine!\u201d At length he obtained employment at his own occupation of hay-trusser, work of that sort being in demand at this autumn time. The scene of his hiring was a pastoral farm near the old western highway, whose course was the channel of all such communications as passed between the busy centres of novelty and the remote Wessex boroughs. He had chosen the neighbourhood of this artery from a sense that, situated here, though at a distance of fifty miles, he was virtually nearer to her whose welfare was so dear than he would be at a roadless spot only half as remote.", " Elizabeth, in the meantime, had breathed him a sigh, recovered her equanimity, and turned her face to Casterbridge.

At Farfrae\u2019s house they stopped and went in. Farfrae flung open the door of the ground-floor sitting-room, saying, \u201cThere he is waiting for you,\u201d and Elizabeth entered.", " Part of his wish to wash his hands of life arose from his perception of its contrarious inconsistencies\u2014of Nature\u2019s jaunty readiness to support unorthodox social principles. He intended to go on from this place\u2014visited as an act of penance\u2014into another part of the country altogether. But he could not help thinking of Elizabeth, and the quarter of the horizon in which she lived. Out of this it happened that the centrifugal tendency imparted by weariness of the world was counteracted by the centripetal influence of his love for his stepdaughter. As a consequence, instead of following a straight course yet further away from Casterbridge, Henchard gradually, almost unconsciously, deflected from that right line of his first intention; till, by degrees, his wandering, like that of the Canadian woodsman, became part of a circle of which Casterbridge formed the centre. In ascending any particular hill he ascertained the bearings as nearly as he could by means of the sun, moon, or stars, and settled in his mind the exact direction in which Casterbridge and Elizabeth-Jane lay."], "What emotion fuels many of Henchard\u2019s decisions?": [" \u201cI like staying; but I fear I must go!\u201d he said. \u201cBusiness ought not to be neglected, ought it?\u201d \u201cNot for a single minute.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s true.

I\u2019ll go to him and ask him to release you.\u201d \u201cNo, no,\u201d said Lucetta. \u201cLet it all be.\u201d XXVIII. The next morning Henchard went to the Town Hall below Lucetta\u2019s house, to attend Petty Sessions, being still a magistrate for the year by virtue of his late position as Mayor. In passing he looked up at her windows, but nothing of her was to be seen. Henchard as a Justice of the Peace may at first seem to be an even greater incongruity than Shallow and Silence themselves. But his rough and ready perceptions, his sledge-hammer directness, had often served him better than nice legal knowledge in despatching such simple business as fell to his hands in this Court. To-day Dr. Chalkfield, the Mayor for the year, being absent, the corn-merchant took the big chair, his eyes still abstractedly stretching out of the window to the ashlar front of High-Place Hall.", " It seemed to her that this resolve of his had come on account of her attachment and its probable result. She showed her devotion to Farfrae, however, by mastering her emotion and speaking out. \u201cI am sorry you have decided on this,\u201d she said with difficult firmness. \u201cFor I thought it probable\u2014possible\u2014that I might marry Mr. Farfrae some little time hence, and I did not know that you disapproved of the step!\u201d \u201cI approve of anything you desire to do, Izzy,\u201d said Henchard huskily. \u201cIf I did not approve it would be no matter! I wish to go away. My presence might make things awkward in the future, and, in short, it is best that I go.\u201d Nothing that her affection could urge would induce him to reconsider his determination; for she could not urge what she did not know\u2014that when she should learn he was not related to her other than as a step-parent she would refrain from despising him, and that when she knew what he had done to keep her in ignorance she would refrain from hating him.", " Hence, alas, this occurred: Lucetta\u2019s eyes slid over him to this side and to that without anchoring on his features\u2014as gaily dressed women\u2019s eyes will too often do on such occasions. Her manner signified quite plainly that she meant to know him in public no more. But she was never tired of watching Donald, as he stood in animated converse with his friends a few yards off, wearing round his young neck the official gold chain with great square links, like that round the Royal unicorn. Every trifling emotion that her husband showed as he talked had its reflex on her face and lips, which moved in little duplicates to his. She was living his part rather than her own, and cared for no one\u2019s situation but Farfrae\u2019s that day. At length a man stationed at the furthest turn of the high road, namely, on the second bridge of which mention has been made, gave a signal, and the Corporation in their robes proceeded from the front of the Town Hall to the archway erected at the entrance to the town."], "Which character serves as a foil to Henchard?": [" But the most terrible ordeal was to come.

I hope you will understand why; I think you will; though perhaps you may not forgive me. But, dear Michael, I have done it for the best. I shall be in my grave when you read this, and Elizabeth-Jane will have a home. Don\u2019t curse me Mike\u2014think of how I was situated. I can hardly write it, but here it is. Elizabeth-Jane is not your Elizabeth-Jane\u2014the child who was in my arms when you sold me. No; she died three months after that, and this living one is my other husband\u2019s.", " He put his own hand there, as if he could hardly realize such an outrage from one whom it had once been his wont to treat with ardent generosity. While pausing in this half-stupefied state the conversation of Lucetta with the other ladies reached his ears; and he distinctly heard her deny him\u2014deny that he had assisted Donald, that he was anything more than a common journeyman. He moved on homeward, and met Jopp in the archway to the Bull Stake. \u201cSo you\u2019ve had a snub,\u201d said Jopp. \u201cAnd what if I have?\u201d answered Henchard sternly. \u201cWhy, I\u2019ve had one too, so we are both under the same cold shade.\u201d He briefly related his attempt to win Lucetta\u2019s intercession. Henchard merely heard his story, without taking it deeply in. His own relation to Farfrae and Lucetta overshadowed all kindred ones. He went on saying brokenly to himself, \u201cShe has supplicated to me in her time; and now her tongue won\u2019t own me nor her eyes see me!...", " I was so desperate\u2014so afraid of being forced to anything else\u2014so afraid of revelations that would quench his love for me, that I resolved to do it offhand, come what might, and purchase a week of happiness at any cost!\u201d \u201cYou\u2014have\u2014married Mr. Farfrae!\u201d cried Elizabeth-Jane, in Nathan tones Lucetta bowed. She had recovered herself. \u201cThe bells are ringing on that account,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband is downstairs. He will live here till a more suitable house is ready for us; and I have told him that I want you to stay with me just as before.\u201d \u201cLet me think of it alone,\u201d the girl quickly replied, corking up the turmoil of her feeling with grand control. \u201cYou shall. I am sure we shall be happy together.\u201d Lucetta departed to join Donald below, a vague uneasiness floating over her joy at seeing him quite at home there. Not on account of her friend Elizabeth did she feel it: for of the bearings of Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s emotions she had not the least suspicion; but on Henchard\u2019s alone."], "Which two characters live according to their passions?": [" \u201cYou must have done it a\u2019 purpose!\u201d said Farfrae\u2019s waggoner. \u201cYou can hear my horses\u2019 bells half-a-mile such a night as this!\u201d \u201cIf ye\u2019d been minding your business instead of zwailing along in such a gawk-hammer way, you would have zeed me!\u201d retorted the wroth representative of Henchard. However, according to the strict rule of the road it appeared that Henchard\u2019s man was most in the wrong, he therefore attempted to back into the High Street. In doing this the near hind-wheel rose against the churchyard wall and the whole mountainous load went over, two of the four wheels rising in the air, and the legs of the thill horse. Instead of considering how to gather up the load the two men closed in a fight with their fists. Before the first round was quite over Henchard came upon the spot, somebody having run for him. Henchard sent the two men staggering in contrary directions by collaring one with each hand, turned to the horse that was down, and extricated him after some trouble.", " Jopp too, had had a convenient experience; he was the only one in Casterbridge besides Henchard and the close-lipped Elizabeth who knew that Lucetta came truly from Jersey, and but proximately from Bath. \u201cI know Jersey too, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cWas living there when you used to do business that way. O yes\u2014have often seen ye there.\u201d \u201cIndeed! Very good. Then the thing is settled. The testimonials you showed me when you first tried for\u2019t are sufficient.\u201d That characters deteriorated in time of need possibly did not occur to Henchard. Jopp said, \u201cThank you,\u201d and stood more firmly, in the consciousness that at last he officially belonged to that spot. \u201cNow,\u201d said Henchard, digging his strong eyes into Jopp\u2019s face, \u201cone thing is necessary to me, as the biggest corn-and-hay dealer in these parts. The Scotchman, who\u2019s taking the town trade so bold into his hands, must be cut out. D\u2019ye hear? We two can\u2019t live side by side\u2014that\u2019s clear and certain.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve seen it all,\u201d said Jopp.", " \u201cYou ought to marry Mr. Henchard or nobody\u2014certainly not another man!\u201d she went on with a quivering lip in whose movement two passions shared. \u201cI don\u2019t admit that!\u201d said Lucetta passionately. \u201cAdmit it or not, it is true!\u201d Lucetta covered her eyes with her right hand, as if she could plead no more, holding out her left to Elizabeth-Jane. \u201cWhy, you _have_ married him!\u201d cried the latter, jumping up with pleasure after a glance at Lucetta\u2019s fingers. \u201cWhen did you do it? Why did you not tell me, instead of teasing me like this? How very honourable of you! He did treat my mother badly once, it seems, in a moment of intoxication. And it is true that he is stern sometimes. But you will rule him entirely, I am sure, with your beauty and wealth and accomplishments. You are the woman he will adore, and we shall all three be happy together now!\u201d \u201cO, my Elizabeth-Jane!\u201d cried Lucetta distressfully. \u201c\u2019Tis somebody else that I have married!", " She repeated the words. He neither moved nor spoke, and waving her hand to him in utmost friendliness she signified to the flyman to drive up the street. XXII. We go back for a moment to the preceding night, to account for Henchard\u2019s attitude. At the hour when Elizabeth-Jane was contemplating her stealthy reconnoitring excursion to the abode of the lady of her fancy, he had been not a little amazed at receiving a letter by hand in Lucetta\u2019s well-known characters. The self-repression, the resignation of her previous communication had vanished from her mood; she wrote with some of the natural lightness which had marked her in their early acquaintance. HIGH-PLACE HALL MY DEAR MR. HENCHARD,\u2014Don\u2019t be surprised. It is for your good and mine, as I hope, that I have come to live at Casterbridge\u2014for how long I cannot tell. That depends upon another; and he is a man, and a merchant, and a Mayor, and one who has the first right to my affections."], "What opposing forces do Henchard and Farfrae represent, respectively?": [" He knew it was Farfrae\u2019s gig descending the hill from an indescribable personality in its noise, the vehicle having been his own till bought by the Scotchman at the sale of his effects. Henchard thereupon retraced his steps along Yalbury Plain, the gig coming up with him as its driver slackened speed between two plantations. It was a point in the highway near which the road to Mellstock branched off from the homeward direction. By diverging to that village, as he had intended to do, Farfrae might probably delay his return by a couple of hours. It soon appeared that his intention was to do so still, the light swerving towards Cuckoo Lane, the by-road aforesaid. Farfrae\u2019s off gig-lamp flashed in Henchard\u2019s face. At the same time Farfrae discerned his late antagonist. \u201cFarfrae\u2014Mr. Farfrae!\u201d cried the breathless Henchard, holding up his hand. Farfrae allowed the horse to turn several steps into the branch lane before he pulled up.", " The messenger, who was a child, met in the yard not Farfrae, but Henchard. \u201cVery well,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll come.\u201d \u201cBut please will Mr. Farfrae come?\u201d said the child. \u201cI am going that way.... Why Mr. Farfrae?\u201d said Henchard, with the fixed look of thought. \u201cWhy do people always want Mr. Farfrae?\u201d \u201cI suppose because they like him so\u2014that\u2019s what they say.\u201d \u201cOh\u2014I see\u2014that\u2019s what they say\u2014hey? They like him because he\u2019s cleverer than Mr. Henchard, and because he knows more; and, in short, Mr. Henchard can\u2019t hold a candle to him\u2014hey?\u201d \u201cYes\u2014that\u2019s just it, sir\u2014some of it.\u201d \u201cOh, there\u2019s more? Of course there\u2019s more! What besides? Come, here\u2019s a sixpence for a fairing.\u201d \u201c\u2018And he\u2019s better tempered, and Henchard\u2019s a fool to him,\u2019 they say. And when some of the women were a-walking home they said, \u2018He\u2019s a diment\u2014he\u2019s a chap o\u2019 wax\u2014he\u2019s the best\u2014he\u2019s the horse for my money,\u2019 says they. And they said, \u2018He\u2019s the most understanding man o\u2019 them two by long chalks.", " By an extraordinary effort he succeeded at last, though not until they had got far back again from the fatal door. In doing so Henchard contrived to turn Farfrae a complete somersault. Had Henchard\u2019s other arm been free it would have been all over with Farfrae then. But again he regained his feet, wrenching Henchard\u2019s arm considerably, and causing him sharp pain, as could be seen from the twitching of his face. He instantly delivered the younger man an annihilating turn by the left fore-hip, as it used to be expressed, and following up his advantage thrust him towards the door, never loosening his hold till Farfrae\u2019s fair head was hanging over the window-sill, and his arm dangling down outside the wall. \u201cNow,\u201d said Henchard between his gasps, \u201cthis is the end of what you began this morning. Your life is in my hands.\u201d \u201cThen take it, take it!\u201d said Farfrae. \u201cYe\u2019ve wished to long enough!\u201d Henchard looked down upon him in silence, and their eyes met.", " \u201cBut,\u201d implored Henchard, \u201cthe matter is more serious than your business at Mellstock. It is\u2014your wife! She is ill. I can tell you particulars as we go along.\u201d The very agitation and abruptness of Henchard increased Farfrae\u2019s suspicion that this was a _ruse_ to decoy him on to the next wood, where might be effectually compassed what, from policy or want of nerve, Henchard had failed to do earlier in the day. He started the horse. \u201cI know what you think,\u201d deprecated Henchard running after, almost bowed down with despair as he perceived the image of unscrupulous villainy that he assumed in his former friend\u2019s eyes. \u201cBut I am not what you think!\u201d he cried hoarsely. \u201cBelieve me, Farfrae; I have come entirely on your own and your wife\u2019s account. She is in danger. I know no more; and they want you to come. Your man has gone the other way in a mistake. O Farfrae! don\u2019t mistrust me\u2014I am a wretched man; but my heart is true to you still!\u201d Farfrae, however, did distrust him utterly."], "What bird does Henchard give Elizabeth-Jane on her wedding day?": [" Donald Farfrae had discovered in a screened corner a new bird-cage, shrouded in newspaper, and at the bottom of the cage a little ball of feathers\u2014the dead body of a goldfinch. Nobody could tell her how the bird and cage had come there, though that the poor little songster had been starved to death was evident. The sadness of the incident had made an impression on her. She had not been able to forget it for days, despite Farfrae\u2019s tender banter; and now when the matter had been nearly forgotten it was again revived. \u201cOh, please ma\u2019am, we know how the bird-cage came there. That farmer\u2019s man who called on the evening of the wedding\u2014he was seen wi\u2019 it in his hand as he came up the street; and \u2019tis thoughted that he put it down while he came in with his message, and then went away forgetting where he had left it.\u201d This was enough to set Elizabeth thinking, and in thinking she seized hold of the idea, at one feminine bound, that the caged bird had been brought by Henchard for her as a wedding gift and token of repentance.", " Surely they said a wedding was coming off soon\u2014on Martin\u2019s Day?\u201d The man declared he remembered nothing about it; and the waggon went on jangling over the hill. Henchard was convinced that the woman\u2019s memory served her well. The date was an extremely probable one, there being no reason for delay on either side. He might, for that matter, write and inquire of Elizabeth; but his instinct for sequestration had made the course difficult. Yet before he left her she had said that for him to be absent from her wedding was not as she wished it to be. The remembrance would continually revive in him now that it was not Elizabeth and Farfrae who had driven him away from them, but his own haughty sense that his presence was no longer desired. He had assumed the return of Newson without absolute proof that the Captain meant to return; still less that Elizabeth-Jane would welcome him; and with no proof whatever that if he did return he would stay.", " \u201cAh, I thought I hadn\u2019t. I resolved that I would not, I remember, not to hurt the man\u2019s name. But now he\u2019s gone I can tell ye. Why, I came to Casterbridge nine or ten months before that day last week that I found ye out. I had been here twice before then. The first time I passed through the town on my way westward, not knowing Elizabeth lived here. Then hearing at some place\u2014I forget where\u2014that a man of the name of Henchard had been mayor here, I came back, and called at his house one morning. The old rascal!\u2014he said Elizabeth-Jane had died years ago.\u201d Elizabeth now gave earnest heed to his story. \u201cNow, it never crossed my mind that the man was selling me a packet,\u201d continued Newson. \u201cAnd, if you\u2019ll believe me, I was that upset, that I went back to the coach that had brought me, and took passage onward without lying in the town half-an-hour. Ha-ha!\u2014\u2019twas a good joke, and well carried out, and I give the man credit for\u2019t!\u201d Elizabeth-Jane was amazed at the intelligence.", " The time was just after twelve o\u2019clock. Those notes were a signal that all had gone well; that there had been no slip \u2019twixt cup and lip in this case; that Elizabeth-Jane and Donald Farfrae were man and wife. Henchard did not care to ride any further with his chattering companions after hearing this sound. Indeed, it quite unmanned him; and in pursuance of his plan of not showing himself in Casterbridge street till evening, lest he should mortify Farfrae and his bride, he alighted here, with his bundle and bird-cage, and was soon left as a lonely figure on the broad white highway. It was the hill near which he had waited to meet Farfrae, almost two years earlier, to tell him of the serious illness of his wife Lucetta. The place was unchanged; the same larches sighed the same notes; but Farfrae had another wife\u2014and, as Henchard knew, a better one. He only hoped that Elizabeth-Jane had obtained a better home than had been hers at the former time."], "Whose wagons collide outside of the High Place Hall?": [" Elizabeth-Jane could, however, add a capping touch to information so new to her in the bulk. The lady, she said, had arrived that day. When the lamps were lighted, and it was yet not so dark as to render chimneys, attics, and roofs invisible, Elizabeth, almost with a lover\u2019s feeling, thought she would like to look at the outside of High-Place Hall. She went up the street in that direction. The Hall, with its grey _fa\u00e7ade_ and parapet, was the only residence of its sort so near the centre of the town. It had, in the first place, the characteristics of a country mansion\u2014birds\u2019 nests in its chimneys, damp nooks where fungi grew and irregularities of surface direct from Nature\u2019s trowel. At night the forms of passengers were patterned by the lamps in black shadows upon the pale walls. This evening motes of straw lay around, and other signs of the premises having been in that lawless condition which accompanies the entry of a new tenant.", " Now will you think over my proposal, and meet me here the first fine day next week, and say if you are still in the same mind?\u201d Elizabeth, her eyes shining at this prospect of a change from an unbearable position, joyfully assented; and the two parted at the gate of the churchyard. XXI. As a maxim glibly repeated from childhood remains practically unmarked till some mature experience enforces it, so did this High-Place Hall now for the first time really show itself to Elizabeth-Jane, though her ears had heard its name on a hundred occasions. Her mind dwelt upon nothing else but the stranger, and the house, and her own chance of living there, all the rest of the day. In the afternoon she had occasion to pay a few bills in the town and do a little shopping when she learnt that what was a new discovery to herself had become a common topic about the streets. High-Place Hall was undergoing repair; a lady was coming there to live shortly; all the shop-people knew it, and had already discounted the chance of her being a customer.", " It may be I\u2019ve spoke roughly to you\u2014but I\u2019ve been grieved beyond everything by you\u2014there\u2019s something that caused it.\u201d \u201cBy me?\u201d she said, with deep concern. \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t tell you now. But if you\u2019ll stop, and go on living as my daughter, I\u2019ll tell you all in time.\u201d But the proposal had come ten minutes too late. She was in the fly\u2014was already, in imagination, at the house of the lady whose manner had such charms for her. \u201cFather,\u201d she said, as considerately as she could, \u201cI think it best for us that I go on now. I need not stay long; I shall not be far away, and if you want me badly I can soon come back again.\u201d He nodded ever so slightly, as a receipt of her decision and no more. \u201cYou are not going far, you say. What will be your address, in case I wish to write to you? Or am I not to know?\u201d \u201cOh yes\u2014certainly. It is only in the town\u2014High-Place Hall!\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d said Henchard, his face stilling.", " Till then, farewell.\u2014Yours, LUCETTA. _P.S._\u2014I was unable to keep my appointment to meet you for a moment or two in passing through Casterbridge the other day. My plans were altered by a family event, which it will surprise you to hear of. Henchard had already heard that High-Place Hall was being prepared for a tenant. He said with a puzzled air to the first person he encountered, \u201cWho is coming to live at the Hall?\u201d \u201cA lady of the name of Templeman, I believe, sir,\u201d said his informant. Henchard thought it over. \u201cLucetta is related to her, I suppose,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cYes, I must put her in her proper position, undoubtedly.\u201d It was by no means with the oppression that would once have accompanied the thought that he regarded the moral necessity now; it was, indeed, with interest, if not warmth. His bitter disappointment at finding Elizabeth-Jane to be none of his, and himself a childless man, had left an emotional void in Henchard that he unconsciously craved to fill."], "Which space in Casterbridge best represents the indelibility of the past?": [" She was one of those people whom nothing surprises, and though to her, a total stranger, his request must have seemed odd, she willingly volunteered to go up and inform the master and mistress of the house that \u201ca humble old friend\u201d had come. On second thought she said that he had better not wait in the kitchen, but come up into the little back-parlour, which was empty. He thereupon followed her thither, and she left him. Just as she got across the landing to the door of the best parlour a dance was struck up, and she returned to say that she would wait till that was over before announcing him\u2014Mr. and Mrs. Farfrae having both joined in the figure. The door of the front room had been taken off its hinges to give more space, and that of the room Henchard sat in being ajar, he could see fractional parts of the dancers whenever their gyrations brought them near the doorway, chiefly in the shape of the skirts of dresses and streaming curls of hair; together with about three-fifths of the band in profile, including the restless shadow of a fiddler\u2019s elbow, and the tip of the bass-viol bow.", " XI. The Ring at Casterbridge was merely the local name of one of the finest Roman Amphitheatres, if not the very finest, remaining in Britain. Casterbridge announced old Rome in every street, alley, and precinct. It looked Roman, bespoke the art of Rome, concealed dead men of Rome. It was impossible to dig more than a foot or two deep about the town fields and gardens without coming upon some tall soldier or other of the Empire, who had lain there in his silent unobtrusive rest for a space of fifteen hundred years. He was mostly found lying on his side, in an oval scoop in the chalk, like a chicken in its shell; his knees drawn up to his chest; sometimes with the remains of his spear against his arm, a fibula or brooch of bronze on his breast or forehead, an urn at his knees, a jar at his throat, a bottle at his mouth; and mystified conjecture pouring down upon him from the eyes of Casterbridge street boys and men, who had turned a moment to gaze at the familiar spectacle as they passed by.", " In an open space before the church walked a woman with her gown-sleeves rolled up so high that the edge of her underlinen was visible, and her skirt tucked up through her pocket hole. She carried a load under her arm from which she was pulling pieces of bread, and handing them to some other women who walked with her, which pieces they nibbled critically. The sight reminded Mrs. Henchard-Newson and her daughter that they had an appetite; and they inquired of the woman for the nearest baker\u2019s. \u201cYe may as well look for manna-food as good bread in Casterbridge just now,\u201d she said, after directing them. \u201cThey can blare their trumpets and thump their drums, and have their roaring dinners\u201d\u2014waving her hand towards a point further along the street, where the brass band could be seen standing in front of an illuminated building\u2014\u201cbut we must needs be put-to for want of a wholesome crust. There\u2019s less good bread than good beer in Casterbridge now.\u201d \u201cAnd less good beer than swipes,\u201d said a man with his hands in his pockets.", " No, he thought, Farfrae would be suggesting such improvements in his damned luminous way that in spite of himself he, Henchard, would sink to the position of second fiddle, and only scrape harmonies to his manager\u2019s talents. Everybody applauded the Mayor\u2019s proposed entertainment, especially when it became known that he meant to pay for it all himself. Close to the town was an elevated green spot surrounded by an ancient square earthwork\u2014earthworks square and not square, were as common as blackberries hereabout\u2014a spot whereon the Casterbridge people usually held any kind of merry-making, meeting, or sheep-fair that required more space than the streets would afford. On one side it sloped to the river Froom, and from any point a view was obtained of the country round for many miles. This pleasant upland was to be the scene of Henchard\u2019s exploit. He advertised about the town, in long posters of a pink colour, that games of all sorts would take place here; and set to work a little battalion of men under his own eye."], "What do all of the coincidences in the novel push Henchard closer towards?": [" He looked about the room at the novel hangings and ingenious furniture with which she had surrounded herself. \u201cUpon my life I didn\u2019t know such furniture as this could be bought in Casterbridge,\u201d he said. \u201cNor can it be,\u201d said she. \u201cNor will it till fifty years more of civilization have passed over the town. It took a waggon and four horses to get it here.\u201d \u201cH\u2019m. It looks as if you were living on capital.\u201d \u201cO no, I am not.\u201d \u201cSo much the better. But the fact is, your setting up like this makes my beaming towards you rather awkward.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d An answer was not really needed, and he did not furnish one. \u201cWell,\u201d he went on, \u201cthere\u2019s nobody in the world I would have wished to see enter into this wealth before you, Lucetta, and nobody, I am sure, who will become it more.\u201d He turned to her with congratulatory admiration so fervid that she shrank somewhat, notwithstanding that she knew him so well.", " Not to interrupt them she remained on the steps without raising her head any higher. While waiting thus she saw\u2014or fancied she saw, for she had a terror of feeling certain\u2014her stepfather slowly raise his hand to a level behind Farfrae\u2019s shoulders, a curious expression taking possession of his face. The young man was quite unconscious of the action, which was so indirect that, if Farfrae had observed it, he might almost have regarded it as an idle outstretching of the arm. But it would have been possible, by a comparatively light touch, to push Farfrae off his balance, and send him head over heels into the air. Elizabeth felt quite sick at heart on thinking of what this _might_ have meant. As soon as they turned she mechanically took the tea to Henchard, left it, and went away. Reflecting, she endeavoured to assure herself that the movement was an idle eccentricity, and no more. Yet, on the other hand, his subordinate position in an establishment where he once had been master might be acting on him like an irritant poison; and she finally resolved to caution Donald.", " To her surprise her mother, instead of being reclined on the bed where she had left her was in an erect position, with lips parted. At Elizabeth\u2019s entry she lifted her finger. The meaning of this was soon apparent. The room allotted to the two women had at one time served as a dressing-room to the Scotchman\u2019s chamber, as was evidenced by signs of a door of communication between them\u2014now screwed up and pasted over with the wall paper. But, as is frequently the case with hotels of far higher pretensions than the Three Mariners, every word spoken in either of these rooms was distinctly audible in the other. Such sounds came through now. Thus silently conjured Elizabeth deposited the tray, and her mother whispered as she drew near, \u201c\u2019Tis he.\u201d \u201cWho?\u201d said the girl. \u201cThe Mayor.\u201d The tremors in Susan Henchard\u2019s tone might have led any person but one so perfectly unsuspicious of the truth as the girl was, to surmise some closer connection than the admitted simple kinship as a means of accounting for them.", " Three glasses stood at his right hand; but, to his wife\u2019s surprise, the two for wine were empty, while the third, a tumbler, was half full of water. When last she had seen him he was sitting in a corduroy jacket, fustian waistcoat and breeches, and tanned leather leggings, with a basin of hot furmity before him. Time, the magician, had wrought much here.

But my first meeting with her was purely an accident. Do you see, Michael, partly why I have done it?\u2014why, to give you an excuse for coming here as if to visit _her_, and thus to form my acquaintance naturally. She is a dear, good girl, and she thinks you have treated her with undue severity.", " I christened her by the same name we had given to the first, and she filled up the ache I felt at the other\u2019s loss.

I did it for the man; and then he had more and more; till at last he quarrelled with his wife, and offered to sell her to the highest bidder.

When the _soi-disant_ widow had taken the basin of thin poor slop that stood for the rich concoction of the former time, the hag opened a little basket behind the fire, and looking up slily, whispered, \u201cJust a thought o\u2019 rum in it?\u2014smuggled, you know\u2014say two penn\u2019orth\u2014\u2019twill make it slip down like cordial!\u201d Her customer smiled bitterly at this survival of the old trick, and shook her head with a meaning the old woman was far from translating.

The door was studded, and the keystone of the arch was a mask. Originally the mask had exhibited a comic leer, as could still be discerned; but generations of Casterbridge boys had thrown stones at the mask, aiming at its open mouth; and the blows thereon had chipped off the lips and jaws as if they had been eaten away by disease. The appearance was so ghastly by the weakly lamp-glimmer that she could not bear to look at it\u2014the first unpleasant feature of her visit. The position of the queer old door and the odd presence of the leering mask suggested one thing above all others as appertaining to the mansion\u2019s past history\u2014intrigue. By the alley it had been possible to come unseen from all sorts of quarters in the town\u2014the old play-house, the old bull-stake, the old cock-pit, the pool wherein nameless infants had been used to disappear."], "What town does Henchard head towards after giving up on the search for his family?": [" Rigid in this position, more and more words fell successively upon her ear.

He had possibly drunk himself into his tomb. But he might, on the other hand, have had too much sense to do so; for in her time with him he had been given to bouts only, and was not a habitual drunkard. At any rate, the propriety of returning to him, if he lived, was unquestionable. The awkwardness of searching for him lay in enlightening Elizabeth, a proceeding which her mother could not endure to contemplate. She finally resolved to undertake the search without confiding to the girl her former relations with Henchard, leaving it to him if they found him to take what steps he might choose to that end. This will account for their conversation at the fair and the half-informed state at which Elizabeth was led onward. In this attitude they proceeded on their journey, trusting solely to the dim light afforded of Henchard\u2019s whereabouts by the furmity woman.", " To feel that he would like to see Lucetta was with Henchard to start for her house. He put on his hat and went. It was between eight and nine o\u2019clock when he reached her door. The answer brought him was that Miss Templeman was engaged for that evening; but that she would be happy to see him the next day. \u201cThat\u2019s rather like giving herself airs!\u201d he thought. \u201cAnd considering what we\u2014\u201d But after all, she plainly had not expected him, and he took the refusal quietly. Nevertheless he resolved not to go next day. \u201cThese cursed women\u2014there\u2019s not an inch of straight grain in \u2019em!\u201d he said. Let us follow the train of Mr. Henchard\u2019s thought as if it were a clue line, and view the interior of High-Place Hall on this particular evening. On Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s arrival she had been phlegmatically asked by an elderly woman to go upstairs and take off her things. She replied with great earnestness that she would not think of giving that trouble, and on the instant divested herself of her bonnet and cloak in the passage.", " As money was short with him he decided, after some hesitation, to spend the sailor\u2019s money in the prosecution of this search; but it was equally in vain. The truth was that a certain shyness of revealing his conduct prevented Michael Henchard from following up the investigation with the loud hue-and-cry such a pursuit demanded to render it effectual; and it was probably for this reason that he obtained no clue, though everything was done by him that did not involve an explanation of the circumstances under which he had lost her. Weeks counted up to months, and still he searched on, maintaining himself by small jobs of work in the intervals. By this time he had arrived at a seaport, and there he derived intelligence that persons answering somewhat to his description had emigrated a little time before. Then he said he would search no longer, and that he would go and settle in the district which he had had for some time in his mind."], "How many years pass between the second and third chapters?": [" \u201cI wonder if I wear well, as times go!\u201d she observed after a while. \u201cYes\u2014fairly. \u201cWhere am I worst?\u201d \u201cUnder your eyes\u2014I notice a little brownness there.\u201d \u201cYes. That is my worst place, I know. How many years more do you think I shall last before I get hopelessly plain?\u201d There was something curious in the way in which Elizabeth, though the younger, had come to play the part of experienced sage in these discussions. \u201cIt may be five years,\u201d she said judicially. \u201cOr, with a quiet life, as many as ten. With no love you might calculate on ten.\u201d Lucetta seemed to reflect on this as on an unalterable, impartial verdict. She told Elizabeth-Jane no more of the past attachment she had roughly adumbrated as the experiences of a third person; and Elizabeth, who in spite of her philosophy was very tender-hearted, sighed that night in bed at the thought that her pretty, rich Lucetta did not treat her to the full confidence of names and dates in her confessions.", " Each had just come out from his early breakfast, and there was not another soul near. Henchard was reading a letter from Lucetta, sent in answer to a note from him, in which she made some excuse for not immediately granting him a second interview that he had desired. Donald had no wish to enter into conversation with his former friend on their present constrained terms; neither would he pass him in scowling silence. He nodded, and Henchard did the same. They receded from each other several paces when a voice cried \u201cFarfrae!\u201d It was Henchard\u2019s, who stood regarding him. \u201cDo you remember,\u201d said Henchard, as if it were the presence of the thought and not of the man which made him speak, \u201cdo you remember my story of that second woman\u2014who suffered for her thoughtless intimacy with me?\u201d \u201cI do,\u201d said Farfrae. \u201cDo you remember my telling \u2019ee how it all began and how it ended? \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWell, I have offered to marry her now that I can; but she won\u2019t marry me.", " Farfrae came on with one hand in his pocket, and humming a tune in a way which told that the words were most in his mind. They were those of the song he had sung when he arrived years before at the Three Mariners, a poor young man, adventuring for life and fortune, and scarcely knowing witherward:\u2014 \u201cAnd here\u2019s a hand, my trusty fiere, And gie\u2019s a hand o\u2019 thine.\u201d Nothing moved Henchard like an old melody. He sank back. \u201cNo; I can\u2019t do it!\u201d he gasped. \u201cWhy does the infernal fool begin that now!\u201d At length Farfrae was silent, and Henchard looked out of the loft door. \u201cWill ye come up here?\u201d he said. \u201cAy, man,\u201d said Farfrae. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see ye. What\u2019s wrang?\u201d A minute later Henchard heard his feet on the lowest ladder. He heard him land on the first floor, ascend and land on the second, begin the ascent to the third. And then his head rose through the trap behind. \u201cWhat are you doing up here at this time?\u201d he asked, coming forward.", " Three glasses stood at his right hand; but, to his wife\u2019s surprise, the two for wine were empty, while the third, a tumbler, was half full of water. When last she had seen him he was sitting in a corduroy jacket, fustian waistcoat and breeches, and tanned leather leggings, with a basin of hot furmity before him. Time, the magician, had wrought much here. Watching him, and thus thinking of past days, she became so moved that she shrank back against the jamb of the waggon-office doorway to which the steps gave access, the shadow from it conveniently hiding her features. She forgot her daughter till a touch from Elizabeth-Jane aroused her. \u201cHave you seen him, mother?\u201d whispered the girl. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d answered her companion hastily. \u201cI have seen him, and it is enough for me! Now I only want to go\u2014pass away\u2014die.\u201d \u201cWhy\u2014O what?\u201d She drew closer, and whispered in her mother\u2019s ear, \u201cDoes he seem to you not likely to befriend us?"], "Who does Elizabeth-Jane believe to be her father?": [" \u201cElizabeth, do you think much of old times?\u201d said Henchard. \u201cYes, sir; often,\u201d she said. \u201cWho do you put in your pictures of \u2019em?\u201d \u201cMother and father\u2014nobody else hardly.\u201d Henchard always looked like one bent on resisting pain when Elizabeth-Jane spoke of Richard Newson as \u201cfather.\u201d \u201cAh! I am out of all that, am I not?\u201d he said.... \u201cWas Newson a kind father?\u201d \u201cYes, sir; very.\u201d Henchard\u2019s face settled into an expression of stolid loneliness which gradually modulated into something softer. \u201cSuppose I had been your real father?\u201d he said. \u201cWould you have cared for me as much as you cared for Richard Newson?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t think it,\u201d she said quickly. \u201cI can think of no other as my father, except my father.\u201d Henchard\u2019s wife was dissevered from him by death; his friend and helper Farfrae by estrangement; Elizabeth-Jane by ignorance. It seemed to him that only one of them could possibly be recalled, and that was the girl.", " \u201cA joke?\u2014O no!\u201d she cried. \u201cThen he kept you from me, father, all those months, when you might have been here?\u201d The father admitted that such was the case. \u201cHe ought not to have done it!\u201d said Farfrae. Elizabeth sighed. \u201cI said I would never forget him. But O! I think I ought to forget him now!\u201d Newson, like a good many rovers and sojourners among strange men and strange moralities, failed to perceive the enormity of Henchard\u2019s crime, notwithstanding that he himself had been the chief sufferer therefrom. Indeed, the attack upon the absent culprit waxing serious, he began to take Henchard\u2019s part. \u201cWell, \u2019twas not ten words that he said, after all,\u201d Newson pleaded. \u201cAnd how could he know that I should be such a simpleton as to believe him? \u2019Twas as much my fault as his, poor fellow!\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Elizabeth-Jane firmly, in her revulsion of feeling. \u201cHe knew your disposition\u2014you always were so trusting, father; I\u2019ve heard my mother say so hundreds of times\u2014and he did it to wrong you.", " His daughter he had asserted her to be, and his daughter she should always think herself, no matter what hyprocrisy it involved. But he was ill-prepared for the first step in this new situation. The moment he came into the breakfast-room Elizabeth advanced with open confidence to him and took him by the arm. \u201cI have thought and thought all night of it,\u201d she said frankly. \u201cAnd I see that everything must be as you say. And I am going to look upon you as the father that you are, and not to call you Mr. Henchard any more. It is so plain to me now. Indeed, father, it is. For, of course, you would not have done half the things you have done for me, and let me have my own way so entirely, and bought me presents, if I had only been your stepdaughter! He\u2014Mr. Newson\u2014whom my poor mother married by such a strange mistake\u201d (Henchard was glad that he had disguised matters here), \u201cwas very kind\u2014O so kind!\u201d (she spoke with tears in her eyes); \u201cbut that is not the same thing as being one\u2019s real father after all.", " \u201cSit down\u2014Elizabeth-Jane\u2014sit down,\u201d he said, with a shake in his voice as he uttered her name, and sitting down himself he allowed his hands to hang between his knees while he looked upon the carpet. \u201cYour mother, then, is quite well?\u201d \u201cShe is rather worn out, sir, with travelling.\u201d \u201cA sailor\u2019s widow\u2014when did he die?\u201d \u201cFather was lost last spring.\u201d Henchard winced at the word \u201cfather,\u201d thus applied. \u201cDo you and she come from abroad\u2014America or Australia?\u201d he asked. \u201cNo. We have been in England some years. I was twelve when we came here from Canada.\u201d \u201cAh; exactly.\u201d By such conversation he discovered the circumstances which had enveloped his wife and her child in such total obscurity that he had long ago believed them to be in their graves. These things being clear, he returned to the present. \u201cAnd where is your mother staying?\u201d \u201cAt the Three Mariners.\u201d \u201cAnd you are her daughter Elizabeth-Jane?\u201d repeated Henchard."], "Susan and Elizabeth-Jane follow the sound of ___ into Casterbridge.": [" Shall I go?\u201d Henchard replied heavily, \u201cYes; go.\u201d The question of his remaining in Casterbridge was for ever disposed of by this closing in of Newson on the scene. Henchard was not the man to stand the certainty of condemnation on a matter so near his heart. And being an old hand at bearing anguish in silence, and haughty withal, he resolved to make as light as he could of his intentions, while immediately taking his measures. He surprised the young woman whom he had looked upon as his all in this world by saying to her, as if he did not care about her more: \u201cI am going to leave Casterbridge, Elizabeth-Jane.\u201d \u201cLeave Casterbridge!\u201d she cried, \u201cand leave\u2014me?\u201d \u201cYes, this little shop can be managed by you alone as well as by us both; I don\u2019t care about shops and streets and folk\u2014I would rather get into the country by myself, out of sight, and follow my own ways, and leave you to yours.\u201d She looked down and her tears fell silently.", " She was terribly careless of appearances, and I was perhaps more, because o\u2019 my dreary state; and it was through this that the scandal arose. At last I was well, and came away. When I was gone she suffered much on my account, and didn\u2019t forget to tell me so in letters one after another; till latterly, I felt I owed her something, and thought that, as I had not heard of Susan for so long, I would make this other one the only return I could make, and ask her if she would run the risk of Susan being alive (very slight as I believed) and marry me, such as I was. She jumped for joy, and we should no doubt soon have been married\u2014but, behold, Susan appears!\u201d Donald showed his deep concern at a complication so far beyond the degree of his simple experiences. \u201cNow see what injury a man may cause around him! Even after that wrong-doing at the fair when I was young, if I had never been so selfish as to let this giddy girl devote herself to me over at Jersey, to the injury of her name, all might now be well.", " The seal had cracked, and the letter was open.

Those notes were a signal that all had gone well; that there had been no slip \u2019twixt cup and lip in this case; that Elizabeth-Jane and Donald Farfrae were man and wife. Henchard did not care to ride any further with his chattering companions after hearing this sound. Indeed, it quite unmanned him; and in pursuance of his plan of not showing himself in Casterbridge street till evening, lest he should mortify Farfrae and his bride, he alighted here, with his bundle and bird-cage, and was soon left as a lonely figure on the broad white highway. It was the hill near which he had waited to meet Farfrae, almost two years earlier, to tell him of the serious illness of his wife Lucetta. The place was unchanged; the same larches sighed the same notes; but Farfrae had another wife\u2014and, as Henchard knew, a better one. He only hoped that Elizabeth-Jane had obtained a better home than had been hers at the former time."], "What are the townspeople upset about at the public dinner?": [" Ever since the evening of his wife\u2019s arrival with her daughter there had been something in the air which had changed his luck. That dinner at the King\u2019s Arms with his friends had been Henchard\u2019s Austerlitz: he had had his successes since, but his course had not been upward. He was not to be numbered among the aldermen\u2014that Peerage of burghers\u2014as he had expected to be, and the consciousness of this soured him to-day. \u201cWell, where have you been?\u201d he said to her with offhand laconism. \u201cI\u2019ve been strolling in the Walks and churchyard, father, till I feel quite leery.\u201d She clapped her hand to her mouth, but too late. This was just enough to incense Henchard after the other crosses of the day. \u201cI _won\u2019t_ have you talk like that!\u201d he thundered. \u201c\u2018Leery,\u2019 indeed.

Why, I came to Casterbridge nine or ten months before that day last week that I found ye out. I had been here twice before then. The first time I passed through the town on my way westward, not knowing Elizabeth lived here. Then hearing at some place\u2014I forget where\u2014that a man of the name of Henchard had been mayor here, I came back, and called at his house one morning.

They included bankrupts, hypochondriacs, persons who were what is called \u201cout of a situation\u201d from fault or lucklessness, the inefficient of the professional class\u2014shabby-genteel men, who did not know how to get rid of the weary time between breakfast and dinner, and the yet more weary time between dinner and dark. The eye of this species were mostly directed over the parapet upon the running water below. A man seen there looking thus fixedly into the river was pretty sure to be one whom the world did not treat kindly for some reason or other. While one in straits on the townward bridge did not mind who saw him so, and kept his back to the parapet to survey the passers-by, one in straits on this never faced the road, never turned his head at coming footsteps, but, sensitive to his own condition, watched the current whenever a stranger approached, as if some strange fish interested him, though every finned thing had been poached out of the river years before."], "Where do Susan and Elizabeth-Jane decide to stay in Casterbridge?": [" \u201cIt seems the only right course, after all this. Now I think I must go back to Elizabeth-Jane, and tell her that our kinsman, Mr. Henchard, kindly wishes us to stay in the town.\u201d \u201cVery well\u2014arrange that yourself. I\u2019ll go some way with you.\u201d \u201cNo, no. Don\u2019t run any risk!\u201d said his wife anxiously. \u201cI can find my way back\u2014it is not late.

Susan Henchard entered a carriage for the first time in her life when she stepped into the plain brougham which drew up at the door on the wedding-day to take her and Elizabeth-Jane to church. It was a windless morning of warm November rain, which floated down like meal, and lay in a powdery form on the nap of hats and coats. Few people had gathered round the church door though they were well packed within."], "What is the name of the Scotchman that Susan and Elizabeth-Jane follow to the inn?": [" It passed as Henchard went on: \u201cWell, so much the better.

He started the horse. \u201cI know what you think,\u201d deprecated Henchard running after, almost bowed down with despair as he perceived the image of unscrupulous villainy that he assumed in his former friend\u2019s eyes. \u201cBut I am not what you think!\u201d he cried hoarsely. \u201cBelieve me, Farfrae; I have come entirely on your own and your wife\u2019s account. She is in danger. I know no more; and they want you to come. Your man has gone the other way in a mistake.

Clad thus he went to and fro, still comparatively an active man\u2014for he was not much over forty\u2014and saw with the other men in the yard Donald Farfrae going in and out the green door that led to the garden, and the big house, and Lucetta. At the beginning of the winter it was rumoured about Casterbridge that Mr. Farfrae, already in the Town Council, was to be proposed for Mayor in a year or two. \u201cYes, she was wise, she was wise in her generation!\u201d said Henchard to himself when he heard of this one day on his way to Farfrae\u2019s hay-barn. He thought it over as he wimbled his bonds, and the piece of news acted as a reviviscent breath to that old view of his\u2014of Donald Farfrae as his triumphant rival who rode rough-shod over him. \u201cA fellow of his age going to be Mayor, indeed!\u201d he murmured with a corner-drawn smile on his mouth.", " Elizabeth, in the meantime, had breathed him a sigh, recovered her equanimity, and turned her face to Casterbridge. Before she had reached the first house she was met in her walk by Donald Farfrae. This was evidently not their first meeting that day; they joined hands without ceremony, and Farfrae anxiously asked, \u201cAnd is he gone\u2014and did you tell him?\u2014I mean of the other matter\u2014not of ours.\u201d \u201cHe is gone; and I told him all I knew of your friend. Donald, who is he?\u201d \u201cWell, well, dearie; you will know soon about that. And Mr. Henchard will hear of it if he does not go far.\u201d \u201cHe will go far\u2014he\u2019s bent upon getting out of sight and sound!\u201d She walked beside her lover, and when they reached the Crossways, or Bow, turned with him into Corn Street instead of going straight on to her own door. At Farfrae\u2019s house they stopped and went in. Farfrae flung open the door of the ground-floor sitting-room, saying, \u201cThere he is waiting for you,\u201d and Elizabeth entered.", " He passed the remainder of the afternoon in a curious highstrung condition, unable to do much but think of the approaching meeting with her, and sadly satirize himself for his emotions thereon, as a Samson shorn. Such an innovation on Casterbridge customs as a flitting of bridegroom and bride from the town immediately after the ceremony, was not likely, but if it should have taken place he would wait till their return. To assure himself on this point he asked a market-man when near the borough if the newly-married couple had gone away, and was promptly informed that they had not; they were at that hour, according to all accounts, entertaining a houseful of guests at their home in Corn Street. Henchard dusted his boots, washed his hands at the riverside, and proceeded up the town under the feeble lamps. He need have made no inquiries beforehand, for on drawing near Farfrae\u2019s residence it was plain to the least observant that festivity prevailed within, and that Donald himself shared it, his voice being distinctly audible in the street, giving strong expression to a song of his dear native country that he loved so well as never to have revisited it.", " The old crude _viv\u00e2 voce_ system of Henchard, in which everything depended upon his memory, and bargains were made by the tongue alone, was swept away. Letters and ledgers took the place of \u201cI\u2019ll do\u2019t,\u201d and \u201cyou shall hae\u2019t\u201d; and, as in all such cases of advance, the rugged picturesqueness of the old method disappeared with its inconveniences. The position of Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s room\u2014rather high in the house, so that it commanded a view of the hay-stores and granaries across the garden\u2014afforded her opportunity for accurate observation of what went on there. She saw that Donald and Mr. Henchard were inseparables. When walking together Henchard would lay his arm familiarly on his manager\u2019s shoulder, as if Farfrae were a younger brother, bearing so heavily that his slight frame bent under the weight. Occasionally she would hear a perfect cannonade of laughter from Henchard, arising from something Donald had said, the latter looking quite innocent and not laughing at all."], "When Elizabeth delivers Henchard a note, who does she find in his office?": [" In the meantime Elizabeth had reached the inn. Her mother, instead of taking the note with the curiosity of a poor woman expecting assistance, was much moved at sight of it. She did not read it at once, asking Elizabeth to describe her reception, and the very words Mr. Henchard used. Elizabeth\u2019s back was turned when her mother opened the letter. It ran thus:\u2014 \u201cMeet me at eight o\u2019clock this evening, if you can, at the Ring on the Budmouth road. The place is easy to find. I can say no more now. The news upsets me almost. The girl seems to be in ignorance. Keep her so till I have seen you. M. H.\u201d He said nothing about the enclosure of five guineas. The amount was significant; it may tacitly have said to her that he bought her back again. She waited restlessly for the close of the day, telling Elizabeth-Jane that she was invited to see Mr. Henchard; that she would go alone. But she said nothing to show that the place of meeting was not at his house, nor did she hand the note to Elizabeth.", " \u201cGive this to the Mayor at once,\u201d he said, handing in his hasty note. Elizabeth-Jane had seen his movements and heard the words, which attracted her both by their subject and by their accent\u2014a strange one for those parts. It was quaint and northerly. The waiter took the note, while the young stranger continued\u2014 \u201cAnd can ye tell me of a respectable hotel that\u2019s a little more moderate than this?\u201d The waiter glanced indifferently up and down the street. \u201cThey say the Three Mariners, just below here, is a very good place,\u201d he languidly answered; \u201cbut I have never stayed there myself.\u201d The Scotchman, as he seemed to be, thanked him, and strolled on in the direction of the Three Mariners aforesaid, apparently more concerned about the question of an inn than about the fate of his note, now that the momentary impulse of writing it was over. While he was disappearing slowly down the street the waiter left the door, and Elizabeth-Jane saw with some interest the note brought into the dining-room and handed to the Mayor.", " X. While she still sat under the Scotchman\u2019s eyes a man came up to the door, reaching it as Henchard opened the door of the inner office to admit Elizabeth. The newcomer stepped forward like the quicker cripple at Bethesda, and entered in her stead. She could hear his words to Henchard: \u201cJoshua Jopp, sir\u2014by appointment\u2014the new manager.\u201d \u201cThe new manager!\u2014he\u2019s in his office,\u201d said Henchard bluntly. \u201cIn his office!\u201d said the man, with a stultified air. \u201cI mentioned Thursday,\u201d said Henchard; \u201cand as you did not keep your appointment, I have engaged another manager. At first I thought he must be you. Do you think I can wait when business is in question?\u201d \u201cYou said Thursday or Saturday, sir,\u201d said the newcomer, pulling out a letter. \u201cWell, you are too late,\u201d said the corn-factor. \u201cI can say no more.\u201d \u201cYou as good as engaged me,\u201d murmured the man. \u201cSubject to an interview,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cI am sorry for you\u2014very sorry indeed.", " Only Henchard did not conform to these flexuous changes; he remained stately and vertical, silently thinking. The clock struck nine. Elizabeth-Jane turned to her companion. \u201cThe evening is drawing on, mother,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat do you propose to do?\u201d She was surprised to find how irresolute her mother had become. \u201cWe must get a place to lie down in,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI have seen\u2014Mr. Henchard; and that\u2019s all I wanted to do.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s enough for to-night, at any rate,\u201d Elizabeth-Jane replied soothingly. \u201cWe can think to-morrow what is best to do about him. The question now is\u2014is it not?\u2014how shall we find a lodging?\u201d As her mother did not reply Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s mind reverted to the words of the waiter, that the Three Mariners was an inn of moderate charges. A recommendation good for one person was probably good for another. \u201cLet\u2019s go where the young man has gone to,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is respectable."], "What does Henchard enclose in his return letter to Susan?": [" The letter to the young Jersey woman was carefully framed by him, and the interview ended, Henchard saying, as the Scotchman left, \u201cI feel it a great relief, Farfrae, to tell some friend o\u2019 this! You see now that the Mayor of Casterbridge is not so thriving in his mind as it seems he might be from the state of his pocket.\u201d \u201cI do. And I\u2019m sorry for ye!\u201d said Farfrae. When he was gone Henchard copied the letter, and, enclosing a cheque, took it to the post-office, from which he walked back thoughtfully. \u201cCan it be that it will go off so easily!\u201d he said. \u201cPoor thing\u2014God knows! Now then, to make amends to Susan!\u201d XIII. The cottage which Michael Henchard hired for his wife Susan under her name of Newson\u2014in pursuance of their plan\u2014was in the upper or western part of the town, near the Roman wall, and the avenue which overshadowed it. The evening sun seemed to shine more yellowly there than anywhere else this autumn\u2014stretching its rays, as the hours grew later, under the lowest sycamore boughs, and steeping the ground-floor of the dwelling, with its green shutters, in a substratum of radiance which the foliage screened from the upper parts.", " She was terribly careless of appearances, and I was perhaps more, because o\u2019 my dreary state; and it was through this that the scandal arose. At last I was well, and came away. When I was gone she suffered much on my account, and didn\u2019t forget to tell me so in letters one after another; till latterly, I felt I owed her something, and thought that, as I had not heard of Susan for so long, I would make this other one the only return I could make, and ask her if she would run the risk of Susan being alive (very slight as I believed) and marry me, such as I was. She jumped for joy, and we should no doubt soon have been married\u2014but, behold, Susan appears!\u201d Donald showed his deep concern at a complication so far beyond the degree of his simple experiences. \u201cNow see what injury a man may cause around him! Even after that wrong-doing at the fair when I was young, if I had never been so selfish as to let this giddy girl devote herself to me over at Jersey, to the injury of her name, all might now be well.", " The seal had cracked, and the letter was open. Henchard had no reason to suppose the restriction one of serious weight, and his feeling for his late wife had not been of the nature of deep respect. \u201cSome trifling fancy or other of poor Susan\u2019s, I suppose,\u201d he said; and without curiosity he allowed his eyes to scan the letter:\u2014 MY DEAR MICHAEL,\u2014For the good of all three of us I have kept one thing a secret from you till now. I hope you will understand why; I think you will; though perhaps you may not forgive me. But, dear Michael, I have done it for the best. I shall be in my grave when you read this, and Elizabeth-Jane will have a home. Don\u2019t curse me Mike\u2014think of how I was situated. I can hardly write it, but here it is. Elizabeth-Jane is not your Elizabeth-Jane\u2014the child who was in my arms when you sold me. No; she died three months after that, and this living one is my other husband\u2019s.", " Surely they said a wedding was coming off soon\u2014on Martin\u2019s Day?\u201d The man declared he remembered nothing about it; and the waggon went on jangling over the hill. Henchard was convinced that the woman\u2019s memory served her well. The date was an extremely probable one, there being no reason for delay on either side. He might, for that matter, write and inquire of Elizabeth; but his instinct for sequestration had made the course difficult. Yet before he left her she had said that for him to be absent from her wedding was not as she wished it to be. The remembrance would continually revive in him now that it was not Elizabeth and Farfrae who had driven him away from them, but his own haughty sense that his presence was no longer desired. He had assumed the return of Newson without absolute proof that the Captain meant to return; still less that Elizabeth-Jane would welcome him; and with no proof whatever that if he did return he would stay."], "Who do Henchard and Farfrae quarrel over?": [" What\u2019s the odds after all!\u201d \u201cNow listen to me, if it\u2019s no taking up your time,\u201d said Farfrae, \u201cjust as I listened to you. Don\u2019t go. Stay at home.\u201d \u201cBut I can do nothing else, man!\u201d said Henchard scornfully. \u201cThe little money I have will just keep body and soul together for a few weeks, and no more. I have not felt inclined to go back to journey-work yet; but I can\u2019t stay doing nothing, and my best chance is elsewhere.\u201d \u201cNo; but what I propose is this\u2014if ye will listen. Come and live in your old house. We can spare some rooms very well\u2014I am sure my wife would not mind it at all\u2014until there\u2019s an opening for ye.\u201d Henchard started. Probably the picture drawn by the unsuspecting Donald of himself under the same roof with Lucetta was too striking to be received with equanimity. \u201cNo, no,\u201d he said gruffly; \u201cwe should quarrel.\u201d \u201cYou should hae a part to yourself,\u201d said Farfrae; \u201cand nobody to interfere wi\u2019 you.", " \u201cI am greatly obliged to you for all that,\u201d said she, rather with an air of speaking ritual. The stint of reciprocal feeling was perceived, and Henchard showed chagrin at once\u2014nobody was more quick to show that than he. \u201cYou may be obliged or not for\u2019t. Though the things I say may not have the polish of what you\u2019ve lately learnt to expect for the first time in your life, they are real, my lady Lucetta.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s rather a rude way of speaking to me,\u201d pouted Lucetta, with stormy eyes. \u201cNot at all!\u201d replied Henchard hotly. \u201cBut there, there, I don\u2019t wish to quarrel with \u2019ee. I come with an honest proposal for silencing your Jersey enemies, and you ought to be thankful.\u201d \u201cHow can you speak so!\u201d she answered, firing quickly. \u201cKnowing that my only crime was the indulging in a foolish girl\u2019s passion for you with too little regard for correctness, and that I was what I call innocent all the time they called me guilty, you ought not to be so cutting!", " He knew it was Farfrae\u2019s gig descending the hill from an indescribable personality in its noise, the vehicle having been his own till bought by the Scotchman at the sale of his effects. Henchard thereupon retraced his steps along Yalbury Plain, the gig coming up with him as its driver slackened speed between two plantations. It was a point in the highway near which the road to Mellstock branched off from the homeward direction. By diverging to that village, as he had intended to do, Farfrae might probably delay his return by a couple of hours. It soon appeared that his intention was to do so still, the light swerving towards Cuckoo Lane, the by-road aforesaid. Farfrae\u2019s off gig-lamp flashed in Henchard\u2019s face. At the same time Farfrae discerned his late antagonist. \u201cFarfrae\u2014Mr. Farfrae!\u201d cried the breathless Henchard, holding up his hand. Farfrae allowed the horse to turn several steps into the branch lane before he pulled up.", " The messenger, who was a child, met in the yard not Farfrae, but Henchard. \u201cVery well,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll come.\u201d \u201cBut please will Mr. Farfrae come?\u201d said the child. \u201cI am going that way.... Why Mr. Farfrae?\u201d said Henchard, with the fixed look of thought. \u201cWhy do people always want Mr. Farfrae?\u201d \u201cI suppose because they like him so\u2014that\u2019s what they say.\u201d \u201cOh\u2014I see\u2014that\u2019s what they say\u2014hey? They like him because he\u2019s cleverer than Mr. Henchard, and because he knows more; and, in short, Mr. Henchard can\u2019t hold a candle to him\u2014hey?\u201d \u201cYes\u2014that\u2019s just it, sir\u2014some of it.\u201d \u201cOh, there\u2019s more? Of course there\u2019s more! What besides? Come, here\u2019s a sixpence for a fairing.\u201d \u201c\u2018And he\u2019s better tempered, and Henchard\u2019s a fool to him,\u2019 they say. And when some of the women were a-walking home they said, \u2018He\u2019s a diment\u2014he\u2019s a chap o\u2019 wax\u2014he\u2019s the best\u2014he\u2019s the horse for my money,\u2019 says they. And they said, \u2018He\u2019s the most understanding man o\u2019 them two by long chalks."], "What does Farfrae construct for his festival event?": [" \u201cWhy didn\u2019t ye take your holiday like the rest of the men?\u201d He spoke in a tone which had just severity enough in it to show that he remembered the untoward event of the forenoon, and his conviction that Henchard had been drinking. Henchard said nothing; but going back he closed the stair hatchway, and stamped upon it so that it went tight into its frame; he next turned to the wondering young man, who by this time observed that one of Henchard\u2019s arms was bound to his side. \u201cNow,\u201d said Henchard quietly, \u201cwe stand face to face\u2014man and man. Your money and your fine wife no longer lift \u2019ee above me as they did but now, and my poverty does not press me down.\u201d \u201cWhat does it all mean?\u201d asked Farfrae simply. \u201cWait a bit, my lad. You should ha\u2019 thought twice before you affronted to extremes a man who had nothing to lose. I\u2019ve stood your rivalry, which ruined me, and your snubbing, which humbled me; but your hustling, that disgraced me, I won\u2019t stand!\u201d Farfrae warmed a little at this.", " Thus their lives rolled on till a day of public rejoicing was suggested to the country at large in celebration of a national event that had recently taken place. For some time Casterbridge, by nature slow, made no response. Then one day Donald Farfrae broached the subject to Henchard by asking if he would have any objection to lend some rick-cloths to himself and a few others, who contemplated getting up an entertainment of some sort on the day named, and required a shelter for the same, to which they might charge admission at the rate of so much a head. \u201cHave as many cloths as you like,\u201d Henchard replied. When his manager had gone about the business Henchard was fired with emulation. It certainly had been very remiss of him, as Mayor, he thought, to call no meeting ere this, to discuss what should be done on this holiday. But Farfrae had been so cursed quick in his movements as to give old-fashioned people in authority no chance of the initiative.", " We must have a long talk together\u2014but not just now.\u201d He took her hand at parting, and held it so warmly that she, who had known so little friendship, was much affected, and tears rose to her aerial-grey eyes. The instant that she was gone Henchard\u2019s state showed itself more distinctly; having shut the door he sat in his dining-room stiffly erect, gazing at the opposite wall as if he read his history there. \u201cBegad!\u201d he suddenly exclaimed, jumping up. \u201cI didn\u2019t think of that. Perhaps these are impostors\u2014and Susan and the child dead after all!\u201d However, a something in Elizabeth-Jane soon assured him that, as regarded her, at least, there could be little doubt. And a few hours would settle the question of her mother\u2019s identity; for he had arranged in his note to see her that evening. \u201cIt never rains but it pours!\u201d said Henchard. His keenly excited interest in his new friend the Scotchman was now eclipsed by this event, and Donald Farfrae saw so little of him during the rest of the day that he wondered at the suddenness of his employer\u2019s moods.", " \u201cYou promised me!\u201d \u201cYes, yes! But it was under compulsion, and I did not know all your past\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cAnd now I\u2019ve a mind to punish you as you deserve! One word to this bran-new husband of how you courted me, and your precious happiness is blown to atoms!\u201d \u201cMichael\u2014pity me, and be generous!\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve pity! You did; but you don\u2019t now.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll help you to pay off your debt.\u201d \u201cA pensioner of Farfrae\u2019s wife\u2014not I! Don\u2019t stay with me longer\u2014I shall say something worse. Go home!\u201d She disappeared under the trees of the south walk as the band came round the corner, awaking the echoes of every stock and stone in celebration of her happiness. Lucetta took no heed, but ran up the back street and reached her own home unperceived. XXX. Farfrae\u2019s words to his landlady had referred to the removal of his boxes and other effects from his late lodgings to Lucetta\u2019s house. The work was not heavy, but it had been much hindered on account of the frequent pauses necessitated by exclamations of surprise at the event, of which the good woman had been briefly informed by letter a few hours earlier."], "Who does Elizabeth-Jane dance with at the festival ball?": [" I hoped to have another dance with you.\u201d She said she could not dance\u2014in any proper way. \u201cNay, but you do! It\u2019s the feeling for it rather than the learning of steps that makes pleasant dancers.... I fear I offended your father by getting up this! And now, perhaps, I\u2019ll have to go to another part o\u2019 the warrld altogether!\u201d This seemed such a melancholy prospect that Elizabeth-Jane breathed a sigh\u2014letting it off in fragments that he might not hear her. But darkness makes people truthful, and the Scotchman went on impulsively\u2014perhaps he had heard her after all: \u201cI wish I was richer, Miss Newson; and your stepfather had not been offended, I would ask you something in a short time\u2014yes, I would ask you to-night. But that\u2019s not for me!\u201d What he would have asked her he did not say, and instead of encouraging him she remained incompetently silent. Thus afraid one of another they continued their promenade along the walls till they got near the bottom of the Bowling Walk; twenty steps further and the trees would end, and the street-corner and lamps appear.", " The gaiety jarred upon Henchard\u2019s spirits; and he could not quite understand why Farfrae, a much-sobered man, and a widower, who had had his trials, should have cared for it all, notwithstanding the fact that he was quite a young man still, and quickly kindled to enthusiasm by dance and song. That the quiet Elizabeth, who had long ago appraised life at a moderate value, and who knew in spite of her maidenhood that marriage was as a rule no dancing matter, should have had zest for this revelry surprised him still more. However, young people could not be quite old people, he concluded, and custom was omnipotent. With the progress of the dance the performers spread out somewhat, and then for the first time he caught a glimpse of the once despised daughter who had mastered him, and made his heart ache. She was in a dress of white silk or satin, he was not near enough to say which\u2014snowy white, without a tinge of milk or cream; and the expression of her face was one of nervous pleasure rather than of gaiety.", " Henchard pushed to the door, and for some seconds made no other movement. He rose to his feet, and stood like a dark ruin, obscured by \u201cthe shade from his own soul up-thrown.\u201d But he was no longer the man to stand these reverses unmoved. His agitation was great, and he would fain have been gone, but before he could leave the dance had ended, the housekeeper had informed Elizabeth-Jane of the stranger who awaited her, and she entered the room immediately. \u201cOh\u2014it is\u2014Mr. Henchard!\u201d she said, starting back. \u201cWhat, Elizabeth?\u201d he cried, as she seized her hand. \u201cWhat do you say?\u2014_Mr._ Henchard? Don\u2019t, don\u2019t scourge me like that! Call me worthless old Henchard\u2014anything\u2014but don\u2019t \u2019ee be so cold as this! O my maid\u2014I see you have another\u2014a real father in my place. Then you know all; but don\u2019t give all your thought to him! Do ye save a little room for me!\u201d She flushed up, and gently drew her hand away.", " Donald Farfrae had discovered in a screened corner a new bird-cage, shrouded in newspaper, and at the bottom of the cage a little ball of feathers\u2014the dead body of a goldfinch. Nobody could tell her how the bird and cage had come there, though that the poor little songster had been starved to death was evident. The sadness of the incident had made an impression on her. She had not been able to forget it for days, despite Farfrae\u2019s tender banter; and now when the matter had been nearly forgotten it was again revived. \u201cOh, please ma\u2019am, we know how the bird-cage came there. That farmer\u2019s man who called on the evening of the wedding\u2014he was seen wi\u2019 it in his hand as he came up the street; and \u2019tis thoughted that he put it down while he came in with his message, and then went away forgetting where he had left it.\u201d This was enough to set Elizabeth thinking, and in thinking she seized hold of the idea, at one feminine bound, that the caged bird had been brought by Henchard for her as a wedding gift and token of repentance."], "Who is Henchard having an affair with?": [" \u201cI was in Jersey several years, and knew you there by sight.\u201d \u201cIndeed,\u201d she replied. \u201cBut I knew nothing of you.\u201d \u201cI think, ma\u2019am, that a word or two from you would secure for me what I covet very much,\u201d he persisted. She steadily refused to have anything to do with the affair, and cutting him short, because of her anxiety to get indoors before her husband should miss her, left him on the pavement. He watched her till she had vanished, and then went home. When he got there he sat down in the fireless chimney corner looking at the iron dogs, and the wood laid across them for heating the morning kettle. A movement upstairs disturbed him, and Henchard came down from his bedroom, where he seemed to have been rummaging boxes. \u201cI wish,\u201d said Henchard, \u201cyou would do me a service, Jopp, now\u2014to-night, I mean, if you can. Leave this at Mrs. Farfrae\u2019s for her. I should take it myself, of course, but I don\u2019t wish to be seen there.\u201d He handed a package in brown paper, sealed.", " However, it was not too late; and on second thoughts he determined to take upon his own shoulders the responsibility of organizing some amusements, if the other Councilmen would leave the matter in his hands. To this they quite readily agreed, the majority being fine old crusted characters who had a decided taste for living without worry. So Henchard set about his preparations for a really brilliant thing\u2014such as should be worthy of the venerable town. As for Farfrae\u2019s little affair, Henchard nearly forgot it; except once now and then when, on it coming into his mind, he said to himself, \u201cCharge admission at so much a head\u2014just like a Scotchman!\u2014who is going to pay anything a head?\u201d The diversions which the Mayor intended to provide were to be entirely free. He had grown so dependent upon Donald that he could scarcely resist calling him in to consult. But by sheer self-coercion he refrained.", " His well-known haughty indifference to the society of womankind, his silent avoidance of converse with the sex, contributed a piquancy to what would otherwise have been an unromantic matter enough. That such a poor fragile woman should be his choice was inexplicable, except on the ground that the engagement was a family affair in which sentimental passion had no place; for it was known that they were related in some way. Mrs. Henchard was so pale that the boys called her \u201cThe Ghost.\u201d Sometimes Henchard overheard this epithet when they passed together along the Walks\u2014as the avenues on the walls were named\u2014at which his face would darken with an expression of destructiveness towards the speakers ominous to see; but he said nothing. He pressed on the preparations for his union, or rather reunion, with this pale creature in a dogged, unflinching spirit which did credit to his conscientiousness.", " The landscape over the river disappeared; the wind played on the tent-cords in \u00c6olian improvisations, and at length rose to such a pitch that the whole erection slanted to the ground those who had taken shelter within it having to crawl out on their hands and knees. But towards six the storm abated, and a drier breeze shook the moisture from the grass bents. It seemed possible to carry out the programme after all. The awning was set up again; the band was called out from its shelter, and ordered to begin, and where the tables had stood a place was cleared for dancing. \u201cBut where are the folk?\u201d said Henchard, after the lapse of half-an-hour, during which time only two men and a woman had stood up to dance. \u201cThe shops are all shut. Why don\u2019t they come?\u201d \u201cThey are at Farfrae\u2019s affair in the West Walk,\u201d answered a Councilman who stood in the field with the Mayor. \u201cA few, I suppose.

O I would not have minded so much if it had not been for my unkindness at that last parting!...", " She was terribly careless of appearances, and I was perhaps more, because o\u2019 my dreary state; and it was through this that the scandal arose. At last I was well, and came away. When I was gone she suffered much on my account, and didn\u2019t forget to tell me so in letters one after another; till latterly, I felt I owed her something, and thought that, as I had not heard of Susan for so long, I would make this other one the only return I could make, and ask her if she would run the risk of Susan being alive (very slight as I believed) and marry me, such as I was. She jumped for joy, and we should no doubt soon have been married\u2014but, behold, Susan appears!\u201d Donald showed his deep concern at a complication so far beyond the degree of his simple experiences. \u201cNow see what injury a man may cause around him!

Nance accepted this offering thankfully at first; afterwards as a matter of course. On a day when Henchard was on the premises he saw his stepdaughter enter the hay-barn on this errand; and, as there was no clear spot on which to deposit the provisions, she at once set to work arranging two trusses of hay as a table, Mockridge meanwhile standing with her hands on her hips, easefully looking at the preparations on her behalf. \u201cElizabeth, come here!\u201d said Henchard; and she obeyed. \u201cWhy do you lower yourself so confoundedly?\u201d he said with suppressed passion. \u201cHaven\u2019t I told you o\u2019t fifty times?

But most probably luck had little to do with it. Character is Fate, said Novalis, and Farfrae\u2019s character was just the reverse of Henchard\u2019s, who might not inaptly be described as Faust has been described\u2014as a vehement gloomy being who had quitted the ways of vulgar men without light to guide him on a better way. Farfrae duly received the request to discontinue attentions to Elizabeth-Jane. His acts of that kind had been so slight that the request was almost superfluous. Yet he had felt a considerable interest in her, and after some cogitation he decided that it would be as well to enact no Romeo part just then\u2014for the young girl\u2019s sake no less than his own. Thus the incipient attachment was stifled down. A time came when, avoid collision with his former friend as he might, Farfrae was compelled, in sheer self-defence, to close with Henchard in mortal commercial combat."], "Who is Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s father?": [" \u201cElizabeth, do you think much of old times?\u201d said Henchard. \u201cYes, sir; often,\u201d she said. \u201cWho do you put in your pictures of \u2019em?\u201d \u201cMother and father\u2014nobody else hardly.\u201d Henchard always looked like one bent on resisting pain when Elizabeth-Jane spoke of Richard Newson as \u201cfather.\u201d \u201cAh!

It seemed to him that only one of them could possibly be recalled, and that was the girl.", " \u201cA joke?\u2014O no!\u201d she cried. \u201cThen he kept you from me, father, all those months, when you might have been here?\u201d The father admitted that such was the case. \u201cHe ought not to have done it!\u201d said Farfrae. Elizabeth sighed. \u201cI said I would never forget him. But O! I think I ought to forget him now!\u201d Newson, like a good many rovers and sojourners among strange men and strange moralities, failed to perceive the enormity of Henchard\u2019s crime, notwithstanding that he himself had been the chief sufferer therefrom.

He was getting on towards the dead level of middle age, when material things increasingly possess the mind. But Henchard was not left long in suspense. Lucetta was rather addicted to scribbling, as had been shown by the torrent of letters after the _fiasco_ in their marriage arrangements, and hardly had Elizabeth gone away when another note came to the Mayor\u2019s house from High-Place Hall. \u201cI am in residence,\u201d she said, \u201cand comfortable, though getting here has been a wearisome undertaking. You probably know what I am going to tell you, or do you not? My good Aunt Templeman, the banker\u2019s widow, whose very existence you used to doubt, much more her affluence, has lately died, and bequeathed some of her property to me.", " He watched her up the street, and turned into his house. XII. On entering his own door after watching his wife out of sight, the Mayor walked on through the tunnel-shaped passage into the garden, and thence by the back door towards the stores and granaries. A light shone from the office-window, and there being no blind to screen the interior Henchard could see Donald Farfrae still seated where he had left him, initiating himself into the managerial work of the house by overhauling the books. Henchard entered, merely observing, \u201cDon\u2019t let me interrupt you, if ye will stay so late.\u201d He stood behind Farfrae\u2019s chair, watching his dexterity in clearing up the numerical fogs which had been allowed to grow so thick in Henchard\u2019s books as almost to baffle even the Scotchman\u2019s perspicacity. The corn-factor\u2019s mien was half admiring, and yet it was not without a dash of pity for the tastes of any one who could care to give his mind to such finnikin details.", " \u201cThank you for those new books, Mr. Farfrae,\u201d she added shyly. \u201cI wonder if I ought to accept so many!\u201d \u201cAy! why not? It gives me more pleasure to get them for you, than you to have them!\u201d \u201cIt cannot.\u201d They proceeded along the road together till they reached the town, and their paths diverged. Henchard vowed that he would leave them to their own devices, put nothing in the way of their courses, whatever they might mean. If he were doomed to be bereft of her, so it must be. In the situation which their marriage would create he could see no _locus standi_ for himself at all. Farfrae would never recognize him more than superciliously; his poverty ensured that, no less than his past conduct. And so Elizabeth would grow to be a stranger to him, and the end of his life would be friendless solitude. With such a possibility impending he could not help watchfulness. Indeed, within certain lines, he had the right to keep an eye upon her as his charge.", " Henchard pushed to the door, and for some seconds made no other movement. He rose to his feet, and stood like a dark ruin, obscured by \u201cthe shade from his own soul up-thrown.\u201d But he was no longer the man to stand these reverses unmoved. His agitation was great, and he would fain have been gone, but before he could leave the dance had ended, the housekeeper had informed Elizabeth-Jane of the stranger who awaited her, and she entered the room immediately. \u201cOh\u2014it is\u2014Mr. Henchard!\u201d she said, starting back. \u201cWhat, Elizabeth?\u201d he cried, as she seized her hand. \u201cWhat do you say?\u2014_Mr._ Henchard? Don\u2019t, don\u2019t scourge me like that! Call me worthless old Henchard\u2014anything\u2014but don\u2019t \u2019ee be so cold as this! O my maid\u2014I see you have another\u2014a real father in my place. Then you know all; but don\u2019t give all your thought to him! Do ye save a little room for me!\u201d She flushed up, and gently drew her hand away."], "After leaving Henchard\u2019s house, where does Elizabeth-Jane move to?": [" At the last moment of leaving Port-Bredy, Farfrae, like John Gilpin, had been detained by important customers, whom, even in the exceptional circumstances, he was not the man to neglect. Moreover, there was a convenience in Lucetta arriving first at her house. Nobody there as yet knew what had happened; and she was best in a position to break the news to the inmates, and give directions for her husband\u2019s accommodation. He had, therefore, sent on his two-days\u2019 bride in a hired brougham, whilst he went across the country to a certain group of wheat and barley ricks a few miles off, telling her the hour at which he might be expected the same evening. This accounted for her trotting out to meet him after their separation of four hours. By a strenuous effort, after leaving Henchard she calmed herself in readiness to receive Donald at High-Place Hall when he came on from his lodgings. One supreme fact empowered her to this, the sense that, come what would, she had secured him.", " The details of his failure were of the ordinary kind. One day Elizabeth-Jane was passing the King\u2019s Arms, when she saw people bustling in and out more than usual where there was no market. A bystander informed her, with some surprise at her ignorance, that it was a meeting of the Commissioners under Mr. Henchard\u2019s bankruptcy. She felt quite tearful, and when she heard that he was present in the hotel she wished to go in and see him, but was advised not to intrude that day. The room in which debtor and creditors had assembled was a front one, and Henchard, looking out of the window, had caught sight of Elizabeth-Jane through the wire blind. His examination had closed, and the creditors were leaving. The appearance of Elizabeth threw him into a reverie, till, turning his face from the window, and towering above all the rest, he called their attention for a moment more. His countenance had somewhat changed from its flush of prosperity; the black hair and whiskers were the same as ever, but a film of ash was over the rest.", " Let me try to enliven you by some wonderful tricks I have learnt, to kill time. Sit there and don\u2019t move.\u201d She gathered up the pack of cards, pulled the table in front of her, and began to deal them rapidly, telling Elizabeth to choose some. \u201cWell, have you chosen?\u201d she asked flinging down the last card. \u201cNo,\u201d stammered Elizabeth, arousing herself from a reverie. \u201cI forgot, I was thinking of\u2014you, and me\u2014and how strange it is that I am here.\u201d Miss Templeman looked at Elizabeth-Jane with interest, and laid down the cards. \u201cAh! never mind,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll lie here while you sit by me; and we\u2019ll talk.\u201d Elizabeth drew up silently to the head of the sofa, but with obvious pleasure. It could be seen that though in years she was younger than her entertainer in manner and general vision she seemed more of the sage. Miss Templeman deposited herself on the sofa in her former flexuous position, and throwing her arm above her brow\u2014somewhat in the pose of a well-known conception of Titian\u2019s\u2014talked up at Elizabeth-Jane invertedly across her forehead and arm.", " Henchard\u2019s chiding, by begetting in her a nervous fear of doing anything definable as unladylike, had operated thus curiously in keeping them unknown to each other at a critical moment. Much might have resulted from recognition\u2014at the least a query on either side in one and the selfsame form: What could he or she possibly be doing there? Henchard, whatever his business at the lady\u2019s house, reached his own home only a few minutes later than Elizabeth-Jane. Her plan was to broach the question of leaving his roof this evening; the events of the day had urged her to the course. But its execution depended upon his mood, and she anxiously awaited his manner towards her. She found that it had changed. He showed no further tendency to be angry; he showed something worse. Absolute indifference had taken the place of irritability; and his coldness was such that it encouraged her to departure, even more than hot temper could have done."], "Who takes in Elizabeth-Jane at her new residence?": [" His face flushed. \u201cI never expected this\u2014I did not!\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s Providence! Should any one go against it? No; I\u2019ll not go to America; I\u2019ll stay and be your man!\u201d His hand, which had lain lifeless in Henchard\u2019s, returned the latter\u2019s grasp. \u201cDone,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cDone,\u201d said Donald Farfrae. The face of Mr. Henchard beamed forth a satisfaction that was almost fierce in its strength. \u201cNow you are my friend!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cCome back to my house; let\u2019s clinch it at once by clear terms, so as to be comfortable in our minds.\u201d Farfrae caught up his bag and retraced the North-West Avenue in Henchard\u2019s company as he had come. Henchard was all confidence now. \u201cI am the most distant fellow in the world when I don\u2019t care for a man,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when a man takes my fancy he takes it strong. Now I am sure you can eat another breakfast? You couldn\u2019t have eaten much so early, even if they had anything at that place to gi\u2019e thee, which they hadn\u2019t; so come to my house and we will have a solid, staunch tuck-in, and settle terms in black-and-white if you like; though my word\u2019s my bond.", " Elizabeth-Jane could, however, add a capping touch to information so new to her in the bulk. The lady, she said, had arrived that day. When the lamps were lighted, and it was yet not so dark as to render chimneys, attics, and roofs invisible, Elizabeth, almost with a lover\u2019s feeling, thought she would like to look at the outside of High-Place Hall. She went up the street in that direction. The Hall, with its grey _fa\u00e7ade_ and parapet, was the only residence of its sort so near the centre of the town. It had, in the first place, the characteristics of a country mansion\u2014birds\u2019 nests in its chimneys, damp nooks where fungi grew and irregularities of surface direct from Nature\u2019s trowel. At night the forms of passengers were patterned by the lamps in black shadows upon the pale walls. This evening motes of straw lay around, and other signs of the premises having been in that lawless condition which accompanies the entry of a new tenant.", " \u201cLet him breathe\u2014let him breathe, Mother Cuxsom. He hain\u2019t got his second wind yet,\u201d said the master glazier. \u201cOh yes, but I have!\u201d exclaimed the young man; and he at once rendered \u201cO Nannie\u201d with faultless modulations, and another or two of the like sentiment, winding up at their earnest request with \u201cAuld Lang Syne.\u201d By this time he had completely taken possession of the hearts of the Three Mariners\u2019 inmates, including even old Coney. Notwithstanding an occasional odd gravity which awoke their sense of the ludicrous for the moment, they began to view him through a golden haze which the tone of his mind seemed to raise around him. Casterbridge had sentiment\u2014Casterbridge had romance; but this stranger\u2019s sentiment was of differing quality. Or rather, perhaps, the difference was mainly superficial; he was to them like the poet of a new school who takes his contemporaries by storm; who is not really new, but is the first to articulate what all his listeners have felt, though but dumbly till then.", " \u201cI wouldn\u2019t think so hard about it,\u201d said Elizabeth, marking the intensity with which Lucetta was alternating the question whether this or that would suit best. \u201cBut settling upon new clothes is so trying,\u201d said Lucetta. \u201cYou are that person\u201d (pointing to one of the arrangements), \u201cor you are _that_ totally different person\u201d (pointing to the other), \u201cfor the whole of the coming spring and one of the two, you don\u2019t know which, may turn out to be very objectionable.\u201d It was finally decided by Miss Templeman that she would be the cherry-coloured person at all hazards. The dress was pronounced to be a fit, and Lucetta walked with it into the front room, Elizabeth following her. The morning was exceptionally bright for the time of year. The sun fell so flat on the houses and pavement opposite Lucetta\u2019s residence that they poured their brightness into her rooms. Suddenly, after a rumbling of wheels, there were added to this steady light a fantastic series of circling irradiations upon the ceiling, and the companions turned to the window."], "What arrives in Casterbridge, infuriating Henchard?": [" Shall I go?\u201d Henchard replied heavily, \u201cYes; go.\u201d The question of his remaining in Casterbridge was for ever disposed of by this closing in of Newson on the scene. Henchard was not the man to stand the certainty of condemnation on a matter so near his heart. And being an old hand at bearing anguish in silence, and haughty withal, he resolved to make as light as he could of his intentions, while immediately taking his measures. He surprised the young woman whom he had looked upon as his all in this world by saying to her, as if he did not care about her more: \u201cI am going to leave Casterbridge, Elizabeth-Jane.\u201d \u201cLeave Casterbridge!\u201d she cried, \u201cand leave\u2014me?\u201d \u201cYes, this little shop can be managed by you alone as well as by us both; I don\u2019t care about shops and streets and folk\u2014I would rather get into the country by myself, out of sight, and follow my own ways, and leave you to yours.\u201d She looked down and her tears fell silently.", " Henchard observed him indifferently, and shook his head. \u201cWell\u2014perhaps you may not. My name is Newson.\u201d Henchard\u2019s face and eyes seemed to die. The other did not notice it. \u201cI know the name well,\u201d Henchard said at last, looking on the floor. \u201cI make no doubt of that. Well, the fact is, I\u2019ve been looking for \u2019ee this fortnight past. I landed at Havenpool and went through Casterbridge on my way to Falmouth, and when I got there, they told me you had some years before been living at Casterbridge. Back came I again, and by long and by late I got here by coach, ten minutes ago. \u2018He lives down by the mill,\u2019 says they. So here I am. Now\u2014that transaction between us some twenty years agone\u2014\u2019tis that I\u2019ve called about. \u2019Twas a curious business. I was younger then than I am now, and perhaps the less said about it, in one sense, the better.\u201d \u201cCurious business! \u2019Twas worse than curious. I cannot even allow that I\u2019m the man you met then.", " Part of his wish to wash his hands of life arose from his perception of its contrarious inconsistencies\u2014of Nature\u2019s jaunty readiness to support unorthodox social principles. He intended to go on from this place\u2014visited as an act of penance\u2014into another part of the country altogether. But he could not help thinking of Elizabeth, and the quarter of the horizon in which she lived. Out of this it happened that the centrifugal tendency imparted by weariness of the world was counteracted by the centripetal influence of his love for his stepdaughter. As a consequence, instead of following a straight course yet further away from Casterbridge, Henchard gradually, almost unconsciously, deflected from that right line of his first intention; till, by degrees, his wandering, like that of the Canadian woodsman, became part of a circle of which Casterbridge formed the centre. In ascending any particular hill he ascertained the bearings as nearly as he could by means of the sun, moon, or stars, and settled in his mind the exact direction in which Casterbridge and Elizabeth-Jane lay.", " Farfrae should at all events have no reason for delay upon the road by seeing him there when he took his journey homeward later on. Arriving at Casterbridge Henchard went again to Farfrae\u2019s house to make inquiries. As soon as the door opened anxious faces confronted his from the staircase, hall, and landing; and they all said in grievous disappointment, \u201cO\u2014it is not he!\u201d The manservant, finding his mistake, had long since returned, and all hopes had centred upon Henchard. \u201cBut haven\u2019t you found him?\u201d said the doctor. \u201cYes.... I cannot tell \u2019ee!\u201d Henchard replied as he sank down on a chair within the entrance. \u201cHe can\u2019t be home for two hours.\u201d \u201cH\u2019m,\u201d said the surgeon, returning upstairs. \u201cHow is she?\u201d asked Henchard of Elizabeth, who formed one of the group. \u201cIn great danger, father. Her anxiety to see her husband makes her fearfully restless. Poor woman\u2014I fear they have killed her!\u201d Henchard regarded the sympathetic speaker for a few instants as if she struck him in a new light, then, without further remark, went out of the door and onward to his lonely cottage."], "Who begins to call on Lucetta with increasing frequency?": [" Don\u2019t I pay her a dozen pound a year to do things for \u2019ee?\u201d Elizabeth shrank so visibly at the exclamation that he became sorry a few minutes after, and said that he did not mean to be rough. These domestic exhibitions were the small protruding needlerocks which suggested rather than revealed what was underneath. But his passion had less terror for her than his coldness. The increasing frequency of the latter mood told her the sad news that he disliked her with a growing dislike. The more interesting that her appearance and manners became under the softening influences which she could now command, and in her wisdom did command, the more she seemed to estrange him. Sometimes she caught him looking at her with a louring invidiousness that she could hardly bear. Not knowing his secret it was cruel mockery that she should for the first time excite his animosity when she had taken his surname.", " But her attention was at once riveted to the matter by the voice of a maid-servant next door, who spoke from an upper window across the street to some other maid even more elevated than she. \u201cWhich way be they going now?\u201d inquired the first with interest. \u201cI can\u2019t be sure for a moment,\u201d said the second, \u201cbecause of the malter\u2019s chimbley. O yes\u2014I can see \u2019em. Well, I declare, I declare!\u201d \u201cWhat, what?\u201d from the first, more enthusiastically. \u201cThey are coming up Corn Street after all! They sit back to back!\u201d \u201cWhat\u2014two of \u2019em\u2014are there two figures?\u201d \u201cYes. Two images on a donkey, back to back, their elbows tied to one another\u2019s! She\u2019s facing the head, and he\u2019s facing the tail.\u201d \u201cIs it meant for anybody in particular?\u201d \u201cWell\u2014it mid be. The man has got on a blue coat and kerseymere leggings; he has black whiskers, and a reddish face. \u2019Tis a stuffed figure, with a falseface.\u201d The din was increasing now\u2014then it lessened a little.", " \u201cHave you heard?\u201d she asked. \u201cMrs. Farfrae! She is\u2014dead! Yes, indeed\u2014about an hour ago!\u201d \u201cI know it,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cI have but lately come in from there. It is so very good of \u2019ee, Elizabeth, to come and tell me. You must be so tired out, too, with sitting up. Now do you bide here with me this morning. You can go and rest in the other room; and I will call \u2019ee when breakfast is ready.\u201d To please him, and herself\u2014for his recent kindliness was winning a surprised gratitude from the lonely girl\u2014she did as he bade her, and lay down on a sort of couch which Henchard had rigged up out of a settle in the adjoining room. She could hear him moving about in his preparations; but her mind ran most strongly on Lucetta, whose death in such fulness of life and amid such cheerful hopes of maternity was appallingly unexpected. Presently she fell asleep. Meanwhile her stepfather in the outer room had set the breakfast in readiness; but finding that she dozed he would not call her; he waited on, looking into the fire and keeping the kettle boiling with house-wifely care, as if it were an honour to have her in his house.", " Lucetta\u2019s words went no further, and after this day she was so much upon her guard that there appeared no chance of her identification with the young Jersey woman who had been Henchard\u2019s dear comrade at a critical time. Not the least amusing of her safeguards was her resolute avoidance of a French word if one by accident came to her tongue more readily than its English equivalent. She shirked it with the suddenness of the weak Apostle at the accusation, \u201cThy speech bewrayeth thee!\u201d Expectancy sat visibly upon Lucetta the next morning. She dressed herself for Mr. Henchard, and restlessly awaited his call before mid-day; as he did not come she waited on through the afternoon. But she did not tell Elizabeth that the person expected was the girl\u2019s stepfather. They sat in adjoining windows of the same room in Lucetta\u2019s great stone mansion, netting, and looking out upon the market, which formed an animated scene."], "Who does Henchard hire to get rid of Donald Farfrae?": [" Mr. Henchard said\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care what Mr. Henchard said, nor anybody else! \u2019Tis simple foolishness to do this. Go and dress yourself instantly Whittle.\u201d \u201cHullo, hullo!\u201d said Henchard, coming up behind. \u201cWho\u2019s sending him back?\u201d All the men looked towards Farfrae. \u201cI am,\u201d said Donald. \u201cI say this joke has been carried far enough.\u201d \u201cAnd I say it hasn\u2019t! Get up in the waggon, Whittle.\u201d \u201cNot if I am manager,\u201d said Farfrae. \u201cHe either goes home, or I march out of this yard for good.\u201d Henchard looked at him with a face stern and red. But he paused for a moment, and their eyes met. Donald went up to him, for he saw in Henchard\u2019s look that he began to regret this. \u201cCome,\u201d said Donald quietly, \u201ca man o\u2019 your position should ken better, sir! It is tyrannical and no worthy of you.\u201d \u201c\u2019Tis not tyrannical!\u201d murmured Henchard, like a sullen boy. \u201cIt is to make him remember!\u201d He presently added, in a tone of one bitterly hurt: \u201cWhy did you speak to me before them like that, Farfrae?", " Coming to the door she cried regardless of consequences, \u201cCome to that, Mr. Henchard, I can let \u2019ee know she\u2019ve waited on worse!\u201d \u201cThen she must have had more charity than sense,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cO no, she hadn\u2019t. \u2019Twere not for charity but for hire; and at a public-house in this town!\u201d \u201cIt is not true!\u201d cried Henchard indignantly. \u201cJust ask her,\u201d said Nance, folding her naked arms in such a manner that she could comfortably scratch her elbows. Henchard glanced at Elizabeth-Jane, whose complexion, now pink and white from confinement, lost nearly all of the former colour. \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d he said to her. \u201cAnything or nothing?\u201d \u201cIt is true,\u201d said Elizabeth-Jane. \u201cBut it was only\u2014\u201d \u201cDid you do it, or didn\u2019t you? Where was it?\u201d \u201cAt the Three Mariners; one evening for a little while, when we were staying there.\u201d Nance glanced triumphantly at Henchard, and sailed into the barn; for assuming that she was to be discharged on the instant she had resolved to make the most of her victory.", " It seemed to be a bundle of old clothes. \u201cAre they like mine?\u201d asked Henchard. \u201cWell\u2014they are. Dear me\u2014I wonder if\u2014Father, let us go away!\u201d \u201cGo and look once more; and then we will get home.\u201d She went back, and he could see her stoop till her head was close to the margin of the pool. She started up, and hastened back to his side. \u201cWell,\u201d said Henchard; \u201cwhat do you say now?\u201d \u201cLet us go home.\u201d \u201cBut tell me\u2014do\u2014what is it floating there?\u201d \u201cThe effigy,\u201d she answered hastily. \u201cThey must have thrown it into the river higher up amongst the willows at Blackwater, to get rid of it in their alarm at discovery by the magistrates, and it must have floated down here.\u201d \u201cAh\u2014to be sure\u2014the image o\u2019 me! But where is the other? Why that one only?... That performance of theirs killed her, but kept me alive!\u201d Elizabeth-Jane thought and thought of these words \u201ckept me alive,\u201d as they slowly retraced their way to the town, and at length guessed their meaning.", " One day he answered her inquiry for his health by saying that he could not endure Abel Whittle\u2019s pitying eyes upon him while they worked together in the yard. \u201cHe is such a fool,\u201d said Henchard, \u201cthat he can never get out of his mind the time when I was master there.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll come and wimble for you instead of him, if you will allow me,\u201d said she. Her motive on going to the yard was to get an opportunity of observing the general position of affairs on Farfrae\u2019s premises now that her stepfather was a workman there. Henchard\u2019s threats had alarmed her so much that she wished to see his behaviour when the two were face to face. For two or three days after her arrival Donald did not make any appearance. Then one afternoon the green door opened, and through came, first Farfrae, and at his heels Lucetta. Donald brought his wife forward without hesitation, it being obvious that he had no suspicion whatever of any antecedents in common between her and the now journeyman hay-trusser."], "What does Lucetta claim to suffer from so she doesn\u2019t have to speak to Henchard?": [" Was Elizabeth-Jane to remain his by virtue of this hardy invention of a moment? \u201cPerhaps not for long,\u201d said he. Newson might converse with his fellow-travellers, some of whom might be Casterbridge people; and the trick would be discovered. This probability threw Henchard into a defensive attitude, and instead of considering how best to right the wrong, and acquaint Elizabeth\u2019s father with the truth at once, he bethought himself of ways to keep the position he had accidentally won. Towards the young woman herself his affection grew more jealously strong with each new hazard to which his claim to her was exposed. He watched the distant highway expecting to see Newson return on foot, enlightened and indignant, to claim his child. But no figure appeared. Possibly he had spoken to nobody on the coach, but buried his grief in his own heart. His grief!\u2014what was it, after all, to that which he, Henchard, would feel at the loss of her?", " \u201cI\u2019m not the man to sponge on a woman, even though she may be so nearly my own as you. No, Lucetta; what you can do is this and it would save me. My great creditor is Grower, and it is at his hands I shall suffer if at anybody\u2019s; while a fortnight\u2019s forbearance on his part would be enough to allow me to pull through. This may be got out of him in one way\u2014that you would let it be known to him that you are my intended\u2014that we are to be quietly married in the next fortnight.\u2014Now stop, you haven\u2019t heard all! Let him have this story, without, of course, any prejudice to the fact that the actual engagement between us is to be a long one. Nobody else need know: you could go with me to Mr. Grower and just let me speak to \u2019ee before him as if we were on such terms. We\u2019ll ask him to keep it secret. He will willingly wait then. At the fortnight\u2019s end I shall be able to face him; and I can coolly tell him all is postponed between us for a year or two.", " He led the bull to the door, and the light revealed Henchard. He made the bull fast without, and re-entered to the succour of Lucetta; for he had not perceived Elizabeth, who had climbed on to the clover-heap. Lucetta was hysterical, and Henchard took her in his arms and carried her to the door. \u201cYou\u2014have saved me!\u201d she cried, as soon as she could speak. \u201cI have returned your kindness,\u201d he responded tenderly. \u201cYou once saved me.\u201d \u201cHow\u2014comes it to be you\u2014you?\u201d she asked, not heeding his reply. \u201cI came out here to look for you. I have been wanting to tell you something these two or three days; but you have been away, and I could not. Perhaps you cannot talk now?\u201d \u201cOh\u2014no! Where is Elizabeth?\u201d \u201cHere am I!\u201d cried the missing one cheerfully; and without waiting for the ladder to be placed she slid down the face of the clover-stack to the floor. Henchard supporting Lucetta on one side, and Elizabeth-Jane on the other, they went slowly along the rising road.", " \u201cI am sure she would like to. Besides, poor thing, she has no other home.\u201d Farfrae looked at her and saw that she did not suspect the secret of her more reserved friend. He liked her all the better for the blindness. \u201cArrange as you like with her by all means,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is I who have come to your house, not you to mine.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll run and speak to her,\u201d said Lucetta. When she got upstairs to Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s room the latter had taken off her out-door things, and was resting over a book. Lucetta found in a moment that she had not yet learnt the news. \u201cI did not come down to you, Miss Templeman,\u201d she said simply. \u201cI was coming to ask if you had quite recovered from your fright, but I found you had a visitor. What are the bells ringing for, I wonder? And the band, too, is playing. Somebody must be married; or else they are practising for Christmas.\u201d Lucetta uttered a vague \u201cYes,\u201d and seating herself by the other young woman looked musingly at her."], "What does Elizabeth-Jane refuse to give Lucetta?": [" Now I have called to ask \u2019ee this\u2014quite privately. If I should nominate \u2019ee to succeed him, and there should be no particular opposition, will \u2019ee accept the chair?\u201d \u201cBut there are folk whose turn is before mine; and I\u2019m over young, and may be thought pushing!\u201d said Farfrae after a pause. \u201cNot at all. I don\u2019t speak for myself only, several have named it. You won\u2019t refuse?\u201d \u201cWe thought of going away,\u201d interposed Lucetta, looking at Farfrae anxiously. \u201cIt was only a fancy,\u201d Farfrae murmured. \u201cI wouldna refuse if it is the wish of a respectable majority in the Council.\u201d \u201cVery well, then, look upon yourself as elected. We have had older men long enough.\u201d When he was gone Farfrae said musingly, \u201cSee now how it\u2019s ourselves that are ruled by the Powers above us! We plan this, but we do that. If they want to make me Mayor I will stay, and Henchard must rave as he will.\u201d From this evening onward Lucetta was very uneasy.", " The only thing she could say was, \u201cI was a poor girl then; and now my circumstances have altered, so I am hardly the same person.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s true. And it makes the case awkward for me. But I don\u2019t want to touch your money. I am quite willing that every penny of your property shall remain to your personal use. Besides, that argument has nothing in it. The man you are thinking of is no better than I.\u201d \u201cIf you were as good as he you would leave me!\u201d she cried passionately. This unluckily aroused Henchard. \u201cYou cannot in honour refuse me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd unless you give me your promise this very night to be my wife, before a witness, I\u2019ll reveal our intimacy\u2014in common fairness to other men!\u201d A look of resignation settled upon her. Henchard saw its bitterness; and had Lucetta\u2019s heart been given to any other man in the world than Farfrae he would probably have had pity upon her at that moment. But the supplanter was the upstart (as Henchard called him) who had mounted into prominence upon his shoulders, and he could bring himself to show no mercy.", " There was Sandy Macfarlane, who started to America to try his fortune, and he was drowned; and Archibald Leith, he was murdered! And poor Willie Dunbleeze and Maitland Macfreeze\u2014they fell into bad courses, and went the way of all such!\u201d \u201cWhy\u2014you old goosey\u2014I was only speaking in a general sense, of course! You are always so literal. Now when we have finished tea, sing me that funny song about high-heeled shoon and siller tags, and the one-and-forty wooers.\u201d \u201cNo, no. I couldna sing to-night! It\u2019s Henchard\u2014he hates me; so that I may not be his friend if I would. I would understand why there should be a wee bit of envy; but I cannet see a reason for the whole intensity of what he feels. Now, can you, Lucetta? It is more like old-fashioned rivalry in love than just a bit of rivalry in trade.\u201d Lucetta had grown somewhat wan. \u201cNo,\u201d she replied. \u201cI give him employment\u2014I cannet refuse it. But neither can I blind myself to the fact that with a man of passions such as his, there is no safeguard for conduct!\u201d \u201cWhat have you heard\u2014O Donald, dearest?\u201d said Lucetta in alarm.", " Elizabeth-Jane, who had often observed them, said, \u201cI wonder if the same trees come every week?\u201d \u201cWhat trees?\u201d said Lucetta, absorbed in watching for Henchard. Elizabeth replied vaguely, for an incident checked her. Behind one of the trees stood Farfrae, briskly discussing a sample-bag with a farmer. Henchard had come up, accidentally encountering the young man, whose face seemed to inquire, \u201cDo we speak to each other?\u201d She saw her stepfather throw a shine into his eye which answered \u201cNo!\u201d Elizabeth-Jane sighed. \u201cAre you particularly interested in anybody out there?\u201d said Lucetta. \u201cO, no,\u201d said her companion, a quick red shooting over her face. Luckily Farfrae\u2019s figure was immediately covered by the apple-tree. Lucetta looked hard at her. \u201cQuite sure?\u201d she said. \u201cO yes,\u201d said Elizabeth-Jane. Again Lucetta looked out. \u201cThey are all farmers, I suppose?\u201d she said. \u201cNo. There\u2019s Mr. Bulge\u2014he\u2019s a wine merchant; there\u2019s Benjamin Brownlet\u2014a horse dealer; and Kitson, the pig breeder; and Yopper, the auctioneer; besides maltsters, and millers\u2014and so on.\u201d Farfrae stood out quite distinctly now; but she did not mention him."], "Which character profits as the price of corn rises?": [" \u2019Twas verily Fortune sent him to Henchard. His accounts were like a bramblewood when Mr. Farfrae came. He used to reckon his sacks by chalk strokes all in a row like garden-palings, measure his ricks by stretching with his arms, weigh his trusses by a lift, judge his hay by a chaw, and settle the price with a curse. But now this accomplished young man does it all by ciphering and mensuration. Then the wheat\u2014that sometimes used to taste so strong o\u2019 mice when made into bread that people could fairly tell the breed\u2014Farfrae has a plan for purifying, so that nobody would dream the smallest four-legged beast had walked over it once. O yes, everybody is full of him, and the care Mr. Henchard has to keep him, to be sure!\u201d concluded this gentleman. \u201cBut he won\u2019t do it for long, good-now,\u201d said the other. \u201cNo!\u201d said Henchard to himself behind the tree. \u201cOr if he do, he\u2019ll be honeycombed clean out of all the character and standing that he\u2019s built up in these eighteen year!\u201d He went back to the dancing pavilion.", " \u201cThat\u2019s the way the wind blows, is it?\u201d he said at last grimly, nodding an affirmative to his own thoughts. A yellow flood of reflected sunlight filled the room for a few instants. It was produced by the passing of a load of newly trussed hay from the country, in a waggon marked with Farfrae\u2019s name. Beside it rode Farfrae himself on horseback. Lucetta\u2019s face became\u2014as a woman\u2019s face becomes when the man she loves rises upon her gaze like an apparition. A turn of the eye by Henchard, a glance from the window, and the secret of her inaccessibility would have been revealed. But Henchard in estimating her tone was looking down so plumb-straight that he did not note the warm consciousness upon Lucetta\u2019s face. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have thought it\u2014I shouldn\u2019t have thought it of women!\u201d he said emphatically by-and-by, rising and shaking himself into activity; while Lucetta was so anxious to divert him from any suspicion of the truth that she asked him to be in no hurry.", " \u201cYou shall be sorry for this, sir; sorry as a man can be!\u201d said Jopp, standing pale, and looking after the corn-merchant as he disappeared in the crowd of market-men hard by. XXVII. It was the eve of harvest. Prices being low Farfrae was buying. As was usual, after reckoning too surely on famine weather the local farmers had flown to the other extreme, and (in Farfrae\u2019s opinion) were selling off too recklessly\u2014calculating with just a trifle too much certainty upon an abundant yield. So he went on buying old corn at its comparatively ridiculous price: for the produce of the previous year, though not large, had been of excellent quality. When Henchard had squared his affairs in a disastrous way, and got rid of his burdensome purchases at a monstrous loss, the harvest began. There were three days of excellent weather, and then\u2014\u201cWhat if that curst conjuror should be right after all!\u201d said Henchard.", " And then,\u201d cried Farfrae impetuously, his face alight, \u201cI sold it a few weeks after, when it happened to go up again! And so, by contenting mysel\u2019 with small profits frequently repeated, I soon made five hundred pounds\u2014yes!\u201d\u2014(bringing down his hand upon the table, and quite forgetting where he was)\u2014\u201cwhile the others by keeping theirs in hand made nothing at all!\u201d Lucetta regarded him with a critical interest. He was quite a new type of person to her. At last his eye fell upon the lady\u2019s and their glances met. \u201cAy, now, I\u2019m wearying you!\u201d he exclaimed. She said, \u201cNo, indeed,\u201d colouring a shade. \u201cWhat then?\u201d \u201cQuite otherwise. You are most interesting.\u201d It was now Farfrae who showed the modest pink. \u201cI mean all you Scotchmen,\u201d she added in hasty correction. \u201cSo free from Southern extremes.

You have both temperatures going on in you at the same time.\u201d \u201cBut how do you mean that?"], "What does Henchard blackmail Lucetta into agreeing to?": [" \u201cCan you agree\u2014is it not a slight upon Newson\u2014now he\u2019s dead and gone?\u201d Elizabeth reflected. \u201cI\u2019ll think of it, mother,\u201d she answered. When, later in the day, she saw Henchard, she adverted to the matter at once, in a way which showed that the line of feeling started by her mother had been persevered in. \u201cDo you wish this change so very much, sir?\u201d she asked. \u201cWish it? Why, my blessed fathers, what an ado you women make about a trifle! I proposed it\u2014that\u2019s all. Now, \u2019Lizabeth-Jane, just please yourself. Curse me if I care what you do. Now, you understand, don\u2019t \u2019ee go agreeing to it to please me.\u201d Here the subject dropped, and nothing more was said, and nothing was done, and Elizabeth still passed as Miss Newson, and not by her legal name. Meanwhile the great corn and hay traffic conducted by Henchard throve under the management of Donald Farfrae as it had never thriven before. It had formerly moved in jolts; now it went on oiled casters.", " The rencounter with Farfrae and his bearings towards Lucetta had made the reflective Elizabeth more observant of her brilliant and amiable companion. A few days afterwards, when her eyes met Lucetta\u2019s as the latter was going out, she somehow knew that Miss Templeman was nourishing a hope of seeing the attractive Scotchman. The fact was printed large all over Lucetta\u2019s cheeks and eyes to any one who could read her as Elizabeth-Jane was beginning to do. Lucetta passed on and closed the street door. A seer\u2019s spirit took possession of Elizabeth, impelling her to sit down by the fire and divine events so surely from data already her own that they could be held as witnessed. She followed Lucetta thus mentally\u2014saw her encounter Donald somewhere as if by chance\u2014saw him wear his special look when meeting women, with an added intensity because this one was Lucetta. She depicted his impassioned manner; beheld the indecision of both between their lothness to separate and their desire not to be observed; depicted their shaking of hands; how they probably parted with frigidity in their general contour and movements, only in the smaller features showing the spark of passion, thus invisible to all but themselves.", " \u201cHim? Who are you talking about?\u201d she said wildly. \u201cNobody, as far as I am concerned,\u201d said Elizabeth firmly. \u201cOh\u2014well. Then it is my mistake,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cBut the business is between me and Miss Templeman. She agrees to be my wife.\u201d \u201cBut don\u2019t dwell on it just now,\u201d entreated Elizabeth, holding Lucetta\u2019s hand. \u201cI don\u2019t wish to, if she promises,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cI have, I have,\u201d groaned Lucetta, her limbs hanging like fluid, from very misery and faintness. \u201cMichael, please don\u2019t argue it any more!\u201d \u201cI will not,\u201d he said. And taking up his hat he went away. Elizabeth-Jane continued to kneel by Lucetta. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d she said. \u201cYou called my father \u2018Michael\u2019 as if you knew him well? And how is it he has got this power over you, that you promise to marry him against your will? Ah\u2014you have many many secrets from me!\u201d \u201cPerhaps you have some from me,\u201d Lucetta murmured with closed eyes, little thinking, however, so unsuspicious was she, that the secret of Elizabeth\u2019s heart concerned the young man who had caused this damage to her own.", " \u201cYou ought to marry Mr. Henchard or nobody\u2014certainly not another man!\u201d she went on with a quivering lip in whose movement two passions shared. \u201cI don\u2019t admit that!\u201d said Lucetta passionately. \u201cAdmit it or not, it is true!\u201d Lucetta covered her eyes with her right hand, as if she could plead no more, holding out her left to Elizabeth-Jane. \u201cWhy, you _have_ married him!\u201d cried the latter, jumping up with pleasure after a glance at Lucetta\u2019s fingers. \u201cWhen did you do it? Why did you not tell me, instead of teasing me like this? How very honourable of you! He did treat my mother badly once, it seems, in a moment of intoxication. And it is true that he is stern sometimes. But you will rule him entirely, I am sure, with your beauty and wealth and accomplishments. You are the woman he will adore, and we shall all three be happy together now!\u201d \u201cO, my Elizabeth-Jane!\u201d cried Lucetta distressfully. \u201c\u2019Tis somebody else that I have married!"], "What does Lucetta do after discovering Henchard\u2019s secret?": [" \u201cHim?

I have chosen this road latterly. I have no great reason for it.\u201d _He_.\u2014\u201cBut that may make a reason for others.\u201d _She_ (reddening).\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t know that.

A secret cast a deep shadow over my life. And well you know what it was.\u201d Elizabeth admitted that she did, but she refrained from confessing why the sea attracted her. She could not herself account for it fully, not knowing the secret possibly to be that, in addition to early marine associations, her blood was a sailor\u2019s.", " \u201cI am sure she would like to. Besides, poor thing, she has no other home.\u201d Farfrae looked at her and saw that she did not suspect the secret of her more reserved friend. He liked her all the better for the blindness. \u201cArrange as you like with her by all means,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is I who have come to your house, not you to mine.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll run and speak to her,\u201d said Lucetta. When she got upstairs to Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s room the latter had taken off her out-door things, and was resting over a book. Lucetta found in a moment that she had not yet learnt the news. \u201cI did not come down to you, Miss Templeman,\u201d she said simply. \u201cI was coming to ask if you had quite recovered from your fright, but I found you had a visitor. What are the bells ringing for, I wonder? And the band, too, is playing. Somebody must be married; or else they are practising for Christmas.\u201d Lucetta uttered a vague \u201cYes,\u201d and seating herself by the other young woman looked musingly at her.", " \u201cThat\u2019s the way the wind blows, is it?\u201d he said at last grimly, nodding an affirmative to his own thoughts. A yellow flood of reflected sunlight filled the room for a few instants. It was produced by the passing of a load of newly trussed hay from the country, in a waggon marked with Farfrae\u2019s name. Beside it rode Farfrae himself on horseback. Lucetta\u2019s face became\u2014as a woman\u2019s face becomes when the man she loves rises upon her gaze like an apparition. A turn of the eye by Henchard, a glance from the window, and the secret of her inaccessibility would have been revealed. But Henchard in estimating her tone was looking down so plumb-straight that he did not note the warm consciousness upon Lucetta\u2019s face. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have thought it\u2014I shouldn\u2019t have thought it of women!\u201d he said emphatically by-and-by, rising and shaking himself into activity; while Lucetta was so anxious to divert him from any suspicion of the truth that she asked him to be in no hurry."], "Where do Lucetta and Elizabeth-Jane hide from the bull?": [" He led the bull to the door, and the light revealed Henchard. He made the bull fast without, and re-entered to the succour of Lucetta; for he had not perceived Elizabeth, who had climbed on to the clover-heap. Lucetta was hysterical, and Henchard took her in his arms and carried her to the door. \u201cYou\u2014have saved me!\u201d she cried, as soon as she could speak. \u201cI have returned your kindness,\u201d he responded tenderly. \u201cYou once saved me.\u201d \u201cHow\u2014comes it to be you\u2014you?\u201d she asked, not heeding his reply. \u201cI came out here to look for you. I have been wanting to tell you something these two or three days; but you have been away, and I could not. Perhaps you cannot talk now?\u201d \u201cOh\u2014no! Where is Elizabeth?\u201d \u201cHere am I!\u201d cried the missing one cheerfully; and without waiting for the ladder to be placed she slid down the face of the clover-stack to the floor. Henchard supporting Lucetta on one side, and Elizabeth-Jane on the other, they went slowly along the rising road.", " Elizabeth-Jane looked confounded for a moment, knowing she had been overheard, though there was pleasure in her confusion. \u201cYes, I heard you,\u201d said the lady, in a vivacious voice, answering her look. \u201cWhat can have happened?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014I can\u2019t tell you,\u201d said Elizabeth, putting her hand to her face to hide a quick flush that had come. There was no movement or word for a few seconds; then the girl felt that the young lady was sitting down beside her. \u201cI guess how it is with you,\u201d said the latter. \u201cThat was your mother.\u201d She waved her hand towards the tombstone. Elizabeth looked up at her as if inquiring of herself whether there should be confidence. The lady\u2019s manner was so desirous, so anxious, that the girl decided there should be confidence. \u201cIt was my mother,\u201d she said, \u201cmy only friend.\u201d \u201cBut your father, Mr. Henchard. He is living?\u201d \u201cYes, he is living,\u201d said Elizabeth-Jane. \u201cIs he not kind to you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve no wish to complain of him.\u201d \u201cThere has been a disagreement?\u201d \u201cA little.\u201d \u201cPerhaps you were to blame,\u201d suggested the stranger.", " It was a large specimen of the breed, in colour rich dun, though disfigured at present by splotches of mud about his seamy sides. His horns were thick and tipped with brass; his two nostrils like the Thames Tunnel as seen in the perspective toys of yore. Between them, through the gristle of his nose, was a stout copper ring, welded on, and irremovable as Gurth\u2019s collar of brass. To the ring was attached an ash staff about a yard long, which the bull with the motions of his head flung about like a flail. It was not till they observed this dangling stick that the young women were really alarmed; for it revealed to them that the bull was an old one, too savage to be driven, which had in some way escaped, the staff being the means by which the drover controlled him and kept his horns at arms\u2019 length. They looked round for some shelter or hiding-place, and thought of the barn hard by. As long as they had kept their eyes on the bull he had shown some deference in his manner of approach; but no sooner did they turn their backs to seek the barn than he tossed his head and decided to thoroughly terrify them.", " There was neither hedge nor tree in the prospect now, the road clinging to the stubby expanse of corn-land like a strip to an undulating garment. Near her was a barn\u2014the single building of any kind within her horizon. She strained her eyes up the lessening road, but nothing appeared thereon\u2014not so much as a speck. She sighed one word\u2014\u201cDonald!\u201d and turned her face to the town for retreat. Here the case was different. A single figure was approaching her\u2014Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s. Lucetta, in spite of her loneliness, seemed a little vexed. Elizabeth\u2019s face, as soon as she recognized her friend, shaped itself into affectionate lines while yet beyond speaking distance. \u201cI suddenly thought I would come and meet you,\u201d she said, smiling. Lucetta\u2019s reply was taken from her lips by an unexpected diversion. A by-road on her right hand descended from the fields into the highway at the point where she stood, and down the track a bull was rambling uncertainly towards her and Elizabeth, who, facing the other way, did not observe him."], "Who witnesses Lucetta\u2019s wedding in Port-Bredy?": [" Elizabeth, seeing that she looked wan and disturbed, encouraged her in the idea, thinking a change would afford her relief. She could not help suspecting that the gloom which seemed to have come over Casterbridge in Lucetta\u2019s eyes might be partially owing to the fact that Farfrae was away from home. Elizabeth saw her friend depart for Port-Bredy, and took charge of High-Place Hall till her return. After two or three days of solitude and incessant rain Henchard called at the house. He seemed disappointed to hear of Lucetta\u2019s absence and though he nodded with outward indifference he went away handling his beard with a nettled mien. The next day he called again. \u201cIs she come now?\u201d he asked. \u201cYes. She returned this morning,\u201d replied his stepdaughter. \u201cBut she is not indoors. She has gone for a walk along the turnpike-road to Port-Bredy. She will be home by dusk.\u201d After a few words, which only served to reveal his restless impatience, he left the house again.", " Of what? \u201cIf I must tell you\u2014\u2014. Don\u2019t, don\u2019t upbraid me!\u201d \u201cWell! Let\u2019s hear what you mean?\u201d \u201cWitness of my marriage\u2014Mr. Grower was!\u201d \u201cMarriage?\u201d \u201cYes. With Mr. Farfrae. O Michael! I am already his wife. We were married this week at Port-Bredy. There were reasons against our doing it here. Mr. Grower was a witness because he happened to be at Port-Bredy at the time.\u201d Henchard stood as if idiotized. She was so alarmed at his silence that she murmured something about lending him sufficient money to tide over the perilous fortnight. \u201cMarried him?\u201d said Henchard at length. \u201cMy good\u2014what, married him whilst\u2014bound to marry me?\u201d \u201cIt was like this,\u201d she explained, with tears in her eyes and quavers in her voice; \u201cdon\u2019t\u2014don\u2019t be cruel! I loved him so much, and I thought you might tell him of the past\u2014and that grieved me! And then, when I had promised you, I learnt of the rumour that you had\u2014sold your first wife at a fair like a horse or cow!", " She had risen late, and had just looked out of the window. \u201cOh, please, ma\u2019am, \u2019tis this larry about Mr. Henchard. A woman has proved that before he became a gentleman he sold his wife for five guineas in a booth at a fair.\u201d In all the accounts which Henchard had given her of the separation from his wife Susan for so many years, of his belief in her death, and so on, he had never clearly explained the actual and immediate cause of that separation. The story she now heard for the first time. A gradual misery overspread Lucetta\u2019s face as she dwelt upon the promise wrung from her the night before. At bottom, then, Henchard was this. How terrible a contingency for a woman who should commit herself to his care. During the day she went out to the Ring and to other places, not coming in till nearly dusk. As soon as she saw Elizabeth-Jane after her return indoors she told her that she had resolved to go away from home to the seaside for a few days\u2014to Port-Bredy; Casterbridge was so gloomy.", " XXIX. At this hour Lucetta was bounding along the road to Port-Bredy just as Elizabeth had announced. That she had chosen for her afternoon walk the road along which she had returned to Casterbridge three hours earlier in a carriage was curious\u2014if anything should be called curious in concatenations of phenomena wherein each is known to have its accounting cause. It was the day of the chief market\u2014Saturday\u2014and Farfrae for once had been missed from his corn-stand in the dealers\u2019 room. Nevertheless, it was known that he would be home that night\u2014\u201cfor Sunday,\u201d as Casterbridge expressed it. Lucetta, in continuing her walk, had at length reached the end of the ranked trees which bordered the highway in this and other directions out of the town. This end marked a mile; and here she stopped. The spot was a vale between two gentle acclivities, and the road, still adhering to its Roman foundation, stretched onward straight as a surveyor\u2019s line till lost to sight on the most distant ridge."], "After giving up all of his assets, what is Henchard\u2019s last valuable possession?": [" Rigid in this position, more and more words fell successively upon her ear. But what amazed her most was the tone of her husband. He spoke merely in the accents of a man who made a present of his time. \u201cOne word,\u201d he was saying, as the crackling of paper denoted that Henchard was unfolding yet another sheet. \u201cIs it quite fair to this young woman\u2019s memory to read at such length to a stranger what was intended for your eye alone?\u201d \u201cWell, yes,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cBy not giving her name I make it an example of all womankind, and not a scandal to one.\u201d \u201cIf I were you I would destroy them,\u201d said Farfrae, giving more thought to the letters than he had hitherto done. \u201cAs another man\u2019s wife it would injure the woman if it were known.\u201d \u201cNo, I shall not destroy them,\u201d murmured Henchard, putting the letters away. Then he arose, and Lucetta heard no more. She went back to her bedroom in a semi-paralyzed state.", " To feel that he would like to see Lucetta was with Henchard to start for her house. He put on his hat and went. It was between eight and nine o\u2019clock when he reached her door. The answer brought him was that Miss Templeman was engaged for that evening; but that she would be happy to see him the next day. \u201cThat\u2019s rather like giving herself airs!\u201d he thought. \u201cAnd considering what we\u2014\u201d But after all, she plainly had not expected him, and he took the refusal quietly. Nevertheless he resolved not to go next day. \u201cThese cursed women\u2014there\u2019s not an inch of straight grain in \u2019em!\u201d he said. Let us follow the train of Mr. Henchard\u2019s thought as if it were a clue line, and view the interior of High-Place Hall on this particular evening. On Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s arrival she had been phlegmatically asked by an elderly woman to go upstairs and take off her things. She replied with great earnestness that she would not think of giving that trouble, and on the instant divested herself of her bonnet and cloak in the passage.", " \u201cGentlemen,\u201d he said, \u201cover and above the assets that we\u2019ve been talking about, and that appear on the balance-sheet, there be these. It all belongs to ye, as much as everything else I\u2019ve got, and I don\u2019t wish to keep it from you, not I.\u201d Saying this, he took his gold watch from his pocket and laid it on the table; then his purse\u2014the yellow canvas moneybag, such as was carried by all farmers and dealers\u2014untying it, and shaking the money out upon the table beside the watch. The latter he drew back quickly for an instant, to remove the hair-guard made and given him by Lucetta. \u201cThere, now you have all I\u2019ve got in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I wish for your sakes \u2019twas more.\u201d The creditors, farmers almost to a man, looked at the watch, and at the money, and into the street; when Farmer James Everdene of Weatherbury spoke. \u201cNo, no, Henchard,\u201d he said warmly. \u201cWe don\u2019t want that. \u2019Tis honourable in ye; but keep it.", " She liked them so little, indeed, that there was room for wonder why she had countenanced deception at all, and had not bravely let the girl know her history. But the flesh is weak; and the true explanation came in due course. \u201cO Michael!\u201d she said, \u201cI am afraid all this is taking up your time and giving trouble\u2014when I did not expect any such thing!\u201d And she looked at him and at his dress as a man of affluence, and at the furniture he had provided for the room\u2014ornate and lavish to her eyes. \u201cNot at all,\u201d said Henchard, in rough benignity. \u201cThis is only a cottage\u2014it costs me next to nothing. And as to taking up my time\u201d\u2014here his red and black visage kindled with satisfaction\u2014\u201cI\u2019ve a splendid fellow to superintend my business now\u2014a man whose like I\u2019ve never been able to lay hands on before. I shall soon be able to leave everything to him, and have more time to call my own than I\u2019ve had for these last twenty years.\u201d Henchard\u2019s visits here grew so frequent and so regular that it soon became whispered, and then openly discussed in Casterbridge that the masterful, coercive Mayor of the town was raptured and enervated by the genteel widow Mrs. Newson."], "Who purchases Henchard\u2019s failed business?": [" \u201cBut,\u201d implored Henchard, \u201cthe matter is more serious than your business at Mellstock. It is\u2014your wife! She is ill. I can tell you particulars as we go along.\u201d The very agitation and abruptness of Henchard increased Farfrae\u2019s suspicion that this was a _ruse_ to decoy him on to the next wood, where might be effectually compassed what, from policy or want of nerve, Henchard had failed to do earlier in the day. He started the horse. \u201cI know what you think,\u201d deprecated Henchard running after, almost bowed down with despair as he perceived the image of unscrupulous villainy that he assumed in his former friend\u2019s eyes. \u201cBut I am not what you think!\u201d he cried hoarsely. \u201cBelieve me, Farfrae; I have come entirely on your own and your wife\u2019s account. She is in danger. I know no more; and they want you to come. Your man has gone the other way in a mistake.

Why the unhappy hereabout usually chose the bridges for their meditations in preference to a railing, a gate, or a stile, was not so clear. There was a marked difference of quality between the personages who haunted the near bridge of brick and the personages who haunted the far one of stone. Those of lowest character preferred the former, adjoining the town; they did not mind the glare of the public eye. They had been of comparatively no account during their successes; and though they might feel dispirited, they had no particular sense of shame in their ruin. Their hands were mostly kept in their pockets; they wore a leather strap round their hips or knees, and boots that required a great deal of lacing, but seemed never to get any. Instead of sighing at their adversities they spat, and instead of saying the iron had entered into their souls they said they were down on their luck.", " \u201cYou shall be sorry for this, sir; sorry as a man can be!\u201d said Jopp, standing pale, and looking after the corn-merchant as he disappeared in the crowd of market-men hard by. XXVII. It was the eve of harvest. Prices being low Farfrae was buying. As was usual, after reckoning too surely on famine weather the local farmers had flown to the other extreme, and (in Farfrae\u2019s opinion) were selling off too recklessly\u2014calculating with just a trifle too much certainty upon an abundant yield. So he went on buying old corn at its comparatively ridiculous price: for the produce of the previous year, though not large, had been of excellent quality. When Henchard had squared his affairs in a disastrous way, and got rid of his burdensome purchases at a monstrous loss, the harvest began. There were three days of excellent weather, and then\u2014\u201cWhat if that curst conjuror should be right after all!\u201d said Henchard."], "Who owns the cottage Henchard moves into after declaring bankruptcy?": [" The details of his failure were of the ordinary kind. One day Elizabeth-Jane was passing the King\u2019s Arms, when she saw people bustling in and out more than usual where there was no market. A bystander informed her, with some surprise at her ignorance, that it was a meeting of the Commissioners under Mr. Henchard\u2019s bankruptcy. She felt quite tearful, and when she heard that he was present in the hotel she wished to go in and see him, but was advised not to intrude that day. The room in which debtor and creditors had assembled was a front one, and Henchard, looking out of the window, had caught sight of Elizabeth-Jane through the wire blind. His examination had closed, and the creditors were leaving. The appearance of Elizabeth threw him into a reverie, till, turning his face from the window, and towering above all the rest, he called their attention for a moment more. His countenance had somewhat changed from its flush of prosperity; the black hair and whiskers were the same as ever, but a film of ash was over the rest.", " The cottage itself was built of old stones from the long dismantled Priory, scraps of tracery, moulded window-jambs, and arch-labels, being mixed in with the rubble of the walls. In this cottage he occupied a couple of rooms, Jopp, whom Henchard had employed, abused, cajoled, and dismissed by turns, being the householder. But even here her stepfather could not be seen. \u201cNot by his daughter?\u201d pleaded Elizabeth. \u201cBy nobody\u2014at present: that\u2019s his order,\u201d she was informed. Afterwards she was passing by the corn-stores and hay-barns which had been the headquarters of his business. She knew that he ruled there no longer; but it was with amazement that she regarded the familiar gateway. A smear of decisive lead-coloured paint had been laid on to obliterate Henchard\u2019s name, though its letters dimly loomed through like ships in a fog. Over these, in fresh white, spread the name of Farfrae. Abel Whittle was edging his skeleton in at the wicket, and she said, \u201cMr.", " She pondered the position, and agreed with him. He accordingly drew rein, but before reversing their direction paused a moment and looked vaguely round upon the wide country which the elevated position disclosed. While they looked a solitary human form came from under the clump of trees, and crossed ahead of them. The person was some labourer; his gait was shambling, his regard fixed in front of him as absolutely as if he wore blinkers; and in his hand he carried a few sticks. Having crossed the road he descended into a ravine, where a cottage revealed itself, which he entered. \u201cIf it were not so far away from Casterbridge I should say that must be poor Whittle. \u2019Tis just like him,\u201d observed Elizabeth-Jane. \u201cAnd it may be Whittle, for he\u2019s never been to the yard these three weeks, going away without saying any word at all; and I owing him for two days\u2019 work, without knowing who to pay it to.\u201d The possibility led them to alight, and at least make an inquiry at the cottage.", " Farfrae is master here?\u201d \u201cYaas, Miss Henchet,\u201d he said, \u201cMr. Farfrae have bought the concern and all of we work-folk with it; and \u2019tis better for us than \u2019twas\u2014though I shouldn\u2019t say that to you as a daughter-law. We work harder, but we bain\u2019t made afeard now. It was fear made my few poor hairs so thin! No busting out, no slamming of doors, no meddling with yer eternal soul and all that; and though \u2019tis a shilling a week less I\u2019m the richer man; for what\u2019s all the world if yer mind is always in a larry, Miss Henchet?\u201d The intelligence was in a general sense true; and Henchard\u2019s stores, which had remained in a paralyzed condition during the settlement of his bankruptcy, were stirred into activity again when the new tenant had possession. Thenceforward the full sacks, looped with the shining chain, went scurrying up and down under the cat-head, hairy arms were thrust out from the different door-ways, and the grain was hauled in; trusses of hay were tossed anew in and out of the barns, and the wimbles creaked; while the scales and steel-yards began to be busy where guess-work had formerly been the rule."], "Where does Henchard break his vow of sobriety?": [" Now the Three Mariners was the inn chosen by Henchard as the place for closing his long term of dramless years. He had so timed his entry as to be well established in the large room by the time the forty church-goers entered to their customary cups. The flush upon his face proclaimed at once that the vow of twenty-one years had lapsed, and the era of recklessness begun anew. He was seated on a small table, drawn up to the side of the massive oak board reserved for the churchmen, a few of whom nodded to him as they took their places and said, \u201cHow be ye, Mr. Henchard? Quite a stranger here.\u201d Henchard did not take the trouble to reply for a few moments, and his eyes rested on his stretched-out legs and boots. \u201cYes,\u201d he said at length; \u201cthat\u2019s true. I\u2019ve been down in spirit for weeks; some of ye know the cause. I am better now, but not quite serene. I want you fellows of the choir to strike up a tune; and what with that and this brew of Stannidge\u2019s, I am in hopes of getting altogether out of my minor key.\u201d \u201cWith all my heart,\u201d said the first fiddle.", " \u201cWhen I was a young man I went in for that sort of thing too strong\u2014far too strong\u2014and was well-nigh ruined by it! I did a deed on account of it which I shall be ashamed of to my dying day. It made such an impression on me that I swore, there and then, that I\u2019d drink nothing stronger than tea for as many years as I was old that day. I have kept my oath; and though, Farfrae, I am sometimes that dry in the dog days that I could drink a quarter-barrel to the pitching, I think o\u2019 my oath, and touch no strong drink at all.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll no\u2019 press ye, sir\u2014I\u2019ll no\u2019 press ye. I respect your vow.\u201d \u201cWell, I shall get a manager somewhere, no doubt,\u201d said Henchard, with strong feeling in his tones. \u201cBut it will be long before I see one that would suit me so well!\u201d The young man appeared much moved by Henchard\u2019s warm convictions of his value. He was silent till they reached the door. \u201cI wish I could stay\u2014sincerely I would like to,\u201d he replied.", " For to this pair of bridges gravitated all the failures of the town; those who had failed in business, in love, in sobriety, in crime. Why the unhappy hereabout usually chose the bridges for their meditations in preference to a railing, a gate, or a stile, was not so clear. There was a marked difference of quality between the personages who haunted the near bridge of brick and the personages who haunted the far one of stone. Those of lowest character preferred the former, adjoining the town; they did not mind the glare of the public eye. They had been of comparatively no account during their successes; and though they might feel dispirited, they had no particular sense of shame in their ruin. Their hands were mostly kept in their pockets; they wore a leather strap round their hips or knees, and boots that required a great deal of lacing, but seemed never to get any. Instead of sighing at their adversities they spat, and instead of saying the iron had entered into their souls they said they were down on their luck.", " Bringing him some apples she insisted upon paring one for him. He would not take it. \u201cNo, no; such is not for me,\u201d he said drily, and moved to the door. At going out he turned his eye upon her. \u201cYou came to live in Casterbridge entirely on my account,\u201d he said. \u201cYet now you are here you won\u2019t have anything to say to my offer!\u201d He had hardly gone down the staircase when she dropped upon the sofa and jumped up again in a fit of desperation. \u201cI will love him!\u201d she cried passionately; \u201cas for _him_\u2014he\u2019s hot-tempered and stern, and it would be madness to bind myself to him knowing that. I won\u2019t be a slave to the past\u2014I\u2019ll love where I choose!\u201d Yet having decided to break away from Henchard one might have supposed her capable of aiming higher than Farfrae. But Lucetta reasoned nothing: she feared hard words from the people with whom she had been earlier associated; she had no relatives left; and with native lightness of heart took kindly to what fate offered."], "Who becomes the new Mayor of Casterbridge after Henchard\u2019s replacement dies?": [" \u201cThat\u2019s the way the wind blows, is it?\u201d he said at last grimly, nodding an affirmative to his own thoughts. A yellow flood of reflected sunlight filled the room for a few instants. It was produced by the passing of a load of newly trussed hay from the country, in a waggon marked with Farfrae\u2019s name. Beside it rode Farfrae himself on horseback. Lucetta\u2019s face became\u2014as a woman\u2019s face becomes when the man she loves rises upon her gaze like an apparition. A turn of the eye by Henchard, a glance from the window, and the secret of her inaccessibility would have been revealed. But Henchard in estimating her tone was looking down so plumb-straight that he did not note the warm consciousness upon Lucetta\u2019s face. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have thought it\u2014I shouldn\u2019t have thought it of women!\u201d he said emphatically by-and-by, rising and shaking himself into activity; while Lucetta was so anxious to divert him from any suspicion of the truth that she asked him to be in no hurry.", " People thus waited\u2014the county families in their carriages, the masses on foot\u2014and watched the far-stretching London highway to the ringing of bells and chatter of tongues. From the background Elizabeth-Jane watched the scene. Some seats had been arranged from which ladies could witness the spectacle, and the front seat was occupied by Lucetta, the Mayor\u2019s wife, just at present. In the road under her eyes stood Henchard. She appeared so bright and pretty that, as it seemed, he was experiencing the momentary weakness of wishing for her notice. But he was far from attractive to a woman\u2019s eye, ruled as that is so largely by the superficies of things. He was not only a journeyman, unable to appear as he formerly had appeared, but he disdained to appear as well as he might. Everybody else, from the Mayor to the washerwoman, shone in new vesture according to means; but Henchard had doggedly retained the fretted and weather-beaten garments of bygone years.", " But there could be no doubt that he was in reality still possessed to the full by the new idea, whatever that might be. At length he went back to the door of the dining-room, paused, and found that the songs, toasts, and conversation were proceeding quite satisfactorily without his presence. The Corporation, private residents, and major and minor tradesmen had, in fact, gone in for comforting beverages to such an extent that they had quite forgotten, not only the Mayor, but all those vast, political, religious, and social differences which they felt necessary to maintain in the daytime, and which separated them like iron grills. Seeing this the Mayor took his hat, and when the waiter had helped him on with a thin holland overcoat, went out and stood under the portico. Very few persons were now in the street; and his eyes, by a sort of attraction, turned and dwelt upon a spot about a hundred yards further down.", " Now he wore the remains of an old blue cloth suit of his gentlemanly times, a rusty silk hat, and a once black satin stock, soiled and shabby. Clad thus he went to and fro, still comparatively an active man\u2014for he was not much over forty\u2014and saw with the other men in the yard Donald Farfrae going in and out the green door that led to the garden, and the big house, and Lucetta. At the beginning of the winter it was rumoured about Casterbridge that Mr. Farfrae, already in the Town Council, was to be proposed for Mayor in a year or two. \u201cYes, she was wise, she was wise in her generation!\u201d said Henchard to himself when he heard of this one day on his way to Farfrae\u2019s hay-barn. He thought it over as he wimbled his bonds, and the piece of news acted as a reviviscent breath to that old view of his\u2014of Donald Farfrae as his triumphant rival who rode rough-shod over him. \u201cA fellow of his age going to be Mayor, indeed!\u201d he murmured with a corner-drawn smile on his mouth."], "Where does Lucetta meet Henchard to beg him for her letters?": [" Moreover that thoughtless want of foresight which had led to all her trouble remained with poor Lucetta still; she had come to meet him here in this compromising way without perceiving the risk. Such a woman was very small deer to hunt; he felt ashamed, lost all zest and desire to humiliate Lucetta there and then, and no longer envied Farfrae his bargain. He had married money, but nothing more. Henchard was anxious to wash his hands of the game. \u201cWell, what do you want me to do?\u201d he said gently. \u201cI am sure I shall be very willing. My reading of those letters was only a sort of practical joke, and I revealed nothing.\u201d \u201cTo give me back the letters and any papers you may have that breathe of matrimony or worse.\u201d \u201cSo be it. Every scrap shall be yours.... But, between you and me, Lucetta, he is sure to find out something of the matter, sooner or later.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d she said with eager tremulousness; \u201cbut not till I have proved myself a faithful and deserving wife to him, and then he may forgive me everything!\u201d Henchard silently looked at her: he almost envied Farfrae such love as that, even now.", " I shall return through Casterbridge and Budmouth, where I shall take the packet-boat. Can you meet me with the letters and other trifles? I shall be in the coach which changes horses at the Antelope Hotel at half-past five Wednesday evening; I shall be wearing a Paisley shawl with a red centre, and thus may easily be found. I should prefer this plan of receiving them to having them sent.\u2014I remain still, yours; ever, \u201cLUCETTA\u201d Henchard breathed heavily. \u201cPoor thing\u2014better you had not known me! Upon my heart and soul, if ever I should be left in a position to carry out that marriage with thee, I _ought_ to do it\u2014I ought to do it, indeed!\u201d The contingency that he had in his mind was, of course, the death of Mrs. Henchard. As requested, he sealed up Lucetta\u2019s letters, and put the parcel aside till the day she had appointed; this plan of returning them by hand being apparently a little _ruse_ of the young lady for exchanging a word or two with him on past times.", " \u201cThe fact is they are letters mostly.... Yes,\u201d he went on, sitting down and unfolding Lucetta\u2019s passionate bundle, \u201chere they be. That ever I should see \u2019em again! I hope Mrs. Farfrae is well after her exertions of yesterday?\u201d \u201cShe has felt a bit weary; and has gone to bed airly on that account.\u201d Henchard returned to the letters, sorting them over with interest, Farfrae being seated at the other end of the dining-table. \u201cYou don\u2019t forget, of course,\u201d he resumed, \u201cthat curious chapter in the history of my past which I told you of, and that you gave me some assistance in? These letters are, in fact, related to that unhappy business. Though, thank God, it is all over now.\u201d \u201cWhat became of the poor woman?\u201d asked Farfrae. \u201cLuckily she married, and married well,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cSo that these reproaches she poured out on me do not now cause me any twinges, as they might otherwise have done.... Just listen to what an angry woman will say!\u201d Farfrae, willing to humour Henchard, though quite uninterested, and bursting with yawns, gave well-mannered attention.", " For \u2019tis her love-letters that I\u2019ve got here.\u201d \u201cLove letters? then let\u2019s hear \u2019em, good soul,\u201d said Mother Cuxsom. \u201cLord, do ye mind, Richard, what fools we used to be when we were younger? Getting a schoolboy to write ours for us; and giving him a penny, do ye mind, not to tell other folks what he\u2019d put inside, do ye mind?\u201d By this time Jopp had pushed his finger under the seals, and unfastened the letters, tumbling them over and picking up one here and there at random, which he read aloud. These passages soon began to uncover the secret which Lucetta had so earnestly hoped to keep buried, though the epistles, being allusive only, did not make it altogether plain. \u201cMrs. Farfrae wrote that!\u201d said Nance Mockridge. \u201c\u2019Tis a humbling thing for us, as respectable women, that one of the same sex could do it. And now she\u2019s avowed herself to another man!\u201d \u201cSo much the better for her,\u201d said the aged furmity-woman."], "Who is waiting for Lucetta when she returns from her meeting with Henchard?": [" Newson had stayed in Casterbridge three days after the wedding party (whose gaiety, as might have been surmised, was of his making rather than of the married couple\u2019s), and was stared at and honoured as became the returned Crusoe of the hour. But whether or not because Casterbridge was difficult to excite by dramatic returns and disappearances through having been for centuries an assize town, in which sensational exits from the world, antipodean absences, and such like, were half-yearly occurrences, the inhabitants did not altogether lose their equanimity on his account. On the fourth morning he was discovered disconsolately climbing a hill, in his craving to get a glimpse of the sea from somewhere or other. The contiguity of salt water proved to be such a necessity of his existence that he preferred Budmouth as a place of residence, notwithstanding the society of his daughter in the other town.", " The rencounter with Farfrae and his bearings towards Lucetta had made the reflective Elizabeth more observant of her brilliant and amiable companion. A few days afterwards, when her eyes met Lucetta\u2019s as the latter was going out, she somehow knew that Miss Templeman was nourishing a hope of seeing the attractive Scotchman. The fact was printed large all over Lucetta\u2019s cheeks and eyes to any one who could read her as Elizabeth-Jane was beginning to do. Lucetta passed on and closed the street door. A seer\u2019s spirit took possession of Elizabeth, impelling her to sit down by the fire and divine events so surely from data already her own that they could be held as witnessed. She followed Lucetta thus mentally\u2014saw her encounter Donald somewhere as if by chance\u2014saw him wear his special look when meeting women, with an added intensity because this one was Lucetta. She depicted his impassioned manner; beheld the indecision of both between their lothness to separate and their desire not to be observed; depicted their shaking of hands; how they probably parted with frigidity in their general contour and movements, only in the smaller features showing the spark of passion, thus invisible to all but themselves.", " Applying his telescope to his eye Henchard expected that Farfrae\u2019s features would be disclosed as usual. But the lenses revealed that today the man was not Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s lover. It was one clothed as a merchant captain, and as he turned in the scrutiny of the road he revealed his face. Henchard lived a lifetime the moment he saw it. The face was Newson\u2019s. Henchard dropped the glass, and for some seconds made no other movement. Newson waited, and Henchard waited\u2014if that could be called a waiting which was a transfixture. But Elizabeth-Jane did not come. Something or other had caused her to neglect her customary walk that day. Perhaps Farfrae and she had chosen another road for variety\u2019s sake. But what did that amount to? She might be here to-morrow, and in any case Newson, if bent on a private meeting and a revelation of the truth to her, would soon make his opportunity. Then he would tell her not only of his paternity, but of the ruse by which he had been once sent away.", " Elizabeth, in the meantime, had breathed him a sigh, recovered her equanimity, and turned her face to Casterbridge. Before she had reached the first house she was met in her walk by Donald Farfrae. This was evidently not their first meeting that day; they joined hands without ceremony, and Farfrae anxiously asked, \u201cAnd is he gone\u2014and did you tell him?\u2014I mean of the other matter\u2014not of ours.\u201d \u201cHe is gone; and I told him all I knew of your friend. Donald, who is he?\u201d \u201cWell, well, dearie; you will know soon about that. And Mr. Henchard will hear of it if he does not go far.\u201d \u201cHe will go far\u2014he\u2019s bent upon getting out of sight and sound!\u201d She walked beside her lover, and when they reached the Crossways, or Bow, turned with him into Corn Street instead of going straight on to her own door. At Farfrae\u2019s house they stopped and went in. Farfrae flung open the door of the ground-floor sitting-room, saying, \u201cThere he is waiting for you,\u201d and Elizabeth entered."], "Where are Mother Cuxsom and Nance Mockridge going when they run into Jopp?": [" But the most terrible ordeal was to come. Elizabeth had latterly been accustomed of an afternoon to present a cup of cider or ale and bread-and-cheese to Nance Mockridge, who worked in the yard wimbling hay-bonds. Nance accepted this offering thankfully at first; afterwards as a matter of course. On a day when Henchard was on the premises he saw his stepdaughter enter the hay-barn on this errand; and, as there was no clear spot on which to deposit the provisions, she at once set to work arranging two trusses of hay as a table, Mockridge meanwhile standing with her hands on her hips, easefully looking at the preparations on her behalf. \u201cElizabeth, come here!\u201d said Henchard; and she obeyed. \u201cWhy do you lower yourself so confoundedly?\u201d he said with suppressed passion. \u201cHaven\u2019t I told you o\u2019t fifty times? Hey? Making yourself a drudge for a common workwoman of such a character as hers! Why, ye\u2019ll disgrace me to the dust!\u201d Now these words were uttered loud enough to reach Nance inside the barn door, who fired up immediately at the slur upon her personal character.", " For \u2019tis her love-letters that I\u2019ve got here.\u201d \u201cLove letters? then let\u2019s hear \u2019em, good soul,\u201d said Mother Cuxsom. \u201cLord, do ye mind, Richard, what fools we used to be when we were younger?

And now she\u2019s avowed herself to another man!\u201d \u201cSo much the better for her,\u201d said the aged furmity-woman.", " What could be inside it? So he went on and on till, animated by resentment at Lucetta\u2019s haughtiness, as he thought it, and curiosity to learn if there were any weak sides to this transaction with Henchard, he examined the package. The pen and all its relations being awkward tools in Henchard\u2019s hands he had affixed the seals without an impression, it never occurring to him that the efficacy of such a fastening depended on this. Jopp was far less of a tyro; he lifted one of the seals with his penknife, peeped in at the end thus opened, saw that the bundle consisted of letters; and, having satisfied himself thus far, sealed up the end again by simply softening the wax with the candle, and went off with the parcel as requested. His path was by the river-side at the foot of the town. Coming into the light at the bridge which stood at the end of High Street he beheld lounging thereon Mother Cuxsom and Nance Mockridge.", " So much for man\u2019s rivalry, he thought. Death was to have the oyster, and Farfrae and himself the shells. But about Elizabeth-Jane; in the midst of his gloom she seemed to him as a pin-point of light. He had liked the look on her face as she answered him from the stairs. There had been affection in it, and above all things what he desired now was affection from anything that was good and pure. She was not his own, yet, for the first time, he had a faint dream that he might get to like her as his own,\u2014if she would only continue to love him. Jopp was just going to bed when Henchard got home. As the latter entered the door Jopp said, \u201cThis is rather bad about Mrs. Farfrae\u2019s illness.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Henchard shortly, though little dreaming of Jopp\u2019s complicity in the night\u2019s harlequinade, and raising his eyes just sufficiently to observe that Jopp\u2019s face was lined with anxiety. \u201cSomebody has called for you,\u201d continued Jopp, when Henchard was shutting himself into his own apartment."], "What does a \u201cskimmity ride\u201d publicly reproach?": [" \u201cAh, I saved her from a real bad marriage, and she\u2019s never been the one to thank me.\u201d \u201cI say, what a good foundation for a skimmity-ride,\u201d said Nance. \u201cTrue,\u201d said Mrs. Cuxsom, reflecting. \u201c\u2019Tis as good a ground for a skimmity-ride as ever I knowed; and it ought not to be wasted. The last one seen in Casterbridge must have been ten years ago, if a day.\u201d At this moment there was a shrill whistle, and the landlady said to the man who had been called Charl, \u201c\u2019Tis Jim coming in. Would ye go and let down the bridge for me?\u201d Without replying Charl and his comrade Joe rose, and receiving a lantern from her went out at the back door and down the garden-path, which ended abruptly at the edge of the stream already mentioned. Beyond the stream was the open moor, from which a clammy breeze smote upon their faces as they advanced. Taking up the board that had lain in readiness one of them lowered it across the water, and the instant its further end touched the ground footsteps entered upon it, and there appeared from the shade a stalwart man with straps round his knees, a double-barrelled gun under his arm and some birds slung up behind him.", " In his hand he carried a small mahogany case, strapped, and clamped with brass. Apparently surprised at the kind of company which confronted him through the kitchen door, he at once abandoned his idea of putting up at the house; but taking the situation lightly, he called for glasses of the best, paid for them as he stood in the passage, and turned to proceed on his way by the front door. This was barred, and while the landlady was unfastening it the conversation about the skimmington was continued in the sitting-room, and reached his ears. \u201cWhat do they mean by a \u2018skimmity-ride\u2019?\u201d he asked. \u201cO, sir!\u201d said the landlady, swinging her long earrings with deprecating modesty; \u201c\u2019tis a\u2019 old foolish thing they do in these parts when a man\u2019s wife is\u2014well, not too particularly his own. But as a respectable householder I don\u2019t encourage it. \u201cStill, are they going to do it shortly? It is a good sight to see, I suppose?\u201d \u201cWell, sir!\u201d she simpered.", " The mixed assemblage of idlers known to each other presently fell apart into two bands by a process of natural selection, the frequenters of Peter\u2019s Finger going off Mixen Lanewards, where most of them lived, while Coney, Buzzford, Longways, and that connection remained in the street. \u201cYou know what\u2019s brewing down there, I suppose?\u201d said Buzzford mysteriously to the others. Coney looked at him. \u201cNot the skimmity-ride?\u201d Buzzford nodded. \u201cI have my doubts if it will be carried out,\u201d said Longways. \u201cIf they are getting it up they are keeping it mighty close. \u201cI heard they were thinking of it a fortnight ago, at all events.\u201d \u201cIf I were sure o\u2019t I\u2019d lay information,\u201d said Longways emphatically. \u201c\u2019Tis too rough a joke, and apt to wake riots in towns. We know that the Scotchman is a right enough man, and that his lady has been a right enough \u2019oman since she came here, and if there was anything wrong about her afore, that\u2019s their business, not ours.\u201d Coney reflected.", " Not a soul in the town need know how you\u2019ve helped me. Since you wish to be of use, there\u2019s your way.\u201d It being now what the people called the \u201cpinking in\u201d of the day, that is, the quarter-hour just before dusk, he did not at first observe the result of his own words upon her. \u201cIf it were anything else,\u201d she began, and the dryness of her lips was represented in her voice. \u201cBut it is such a little thing!\u201d he said, with a deep reproach. \u201cLess than you have offered\u2014just the beginning of what you have so lately promised! I could have told him as much myself, but he would not have believed me.\u201d \u201cIt is not because I won\u2019t\u2014it is because I absolutely can\u2019t,\u201d she said, with rising distress. \u201cYou are provoking!\u201d he burst out. \u201cIt is enough to make me force you to carry out at once what you have promised.\u201d \u201cI cannot!\u201d she insisted desperately. \u201cWhy? When I have only within these few minutes released you from your promise to do the thing offhand.\u201d \u201cBecause\u2014he was a witness!\u201d \u201cWitness?"], "Where do Henchard and Farfrae meet to fight?": [" \u201cYou must have done it a\u2019 purpose!\u201d said Farfrae\u2019s waggoner. \u201cYou can hear my horses\u2019 bells half-a-mile such a night as this!\u201d \u201cIf ye\u2019d been minding your business instead of zwailing along in such a gawk-hammer way, you would have zeed me!\u201d retorted the wroth representative of Henchard. However, according to the strict rule of the road it appeared that Henchard\u2019s man was most in the wrong, he therefore attempted to back into the High Street. In doing this the near hind-wheel rose against the churchyard wall and the whole mountainous load went over, two of the four wheels rising in the air, and the legs of the thill horse. Instead of considering how to gather up the load the two men closed in a fight with their fists. Before the first round was quite over Henchard came upon the spot, somebody having run for him. Henchard sent the two men staggering in contrary directions by collaring one with each hand, turned to the horse that was down, and extricated him after some trouble.", " There was nothing secret in Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s movements beyond what habitual reserve induced, and it may at once be owned on her account that she was guilty of occasional conversations with Donald when they chanced to meet. Whatever the origin of her walks on the Budmouth Road, her return from those walks was often coincident with Farfrae\u2019s emergence from Corn Street for a twenty minutes\u2019 blow on that rather windy highway\u2014just to winnow the seeds and chaff out of him before sitting down to tea, as he said. Henchard became aware of this by going to the Ring, and, screened by its enclosure, keeping his eye upon the road till he saw them meet. His face assumed an expression of extreme anguish. \u201cOf her, too, he means to rob me!\u201d he whispered. \u201cBut he has the right. I do not wish to interfere.\u201d The meeting, in truth, was of a very innocent kind, and matters were by no means so far advanced between the young people as Henchard\u2019s jealous grief inferred.", " She decided to employ persuasion\u2014not with Donald but with the enemy himself. It seemed the only practicable weapon left her as a woman. Having laid her plan she rose, and wrote to him who kept her on these tenterhooks:\u2014 \u201cI overheard your interview with my husband last night, and saw the drift of your revenge. The very thought of it crushes me! Have pity on a distressed woman! If you could see me you would relent. You do not know how anxiety has told upon me lately. I will be at the Ring at the time you leave work\u2014just before the sun goes down. Please come that way. I cannot rest till I have seen you face to face, and heard from your mouth that you will carry this horse-play no further.\u201d To herself she said, on closing up her appeal: \u201cIf ever tears and pleadings have served the weak to fight the strong, let them do so now!\u201d With this view she made a toilette which differed from all she had ever attempted before.", " The time was just after twelve o\u2019clock. Those notes were a signal that all had gone well; that there had been no slip \u2019twixt cup and lip in this case; that Elizabeth-Jane and Donald Farfrae were man and wife. Henchard did not care to ride any further with his chattering companions after hearing this sound. Indeed, it quite unmanned him; and in pursuance of his plan of not showing himself in Casterbridge street till evening, lest he should mortify Farfrae and his bride, he alighted here, with his bundle and bird-cage, and was soon left as a lonely figure on the broad white highway. It was the hill near which he had waited to meet Farfrae, almost two years earlier, to tell him of the serious illness of his wife Lucetta. The place was unchanged; the same larches sighed the same notes; but Farfrae had another wife\u2014and, as Henchard knew, a better one. He only hoped that Elizabeth-Jane had obtained a better home than had been hers at the former time."], "What does Lucetta suffer from upon seeing the \u201cskimmity ride\u201d?": [" \u201cAh, I saved her from a real bad marriage, and she\u2019s never been the one to thank me.\u201d \u201cI say, what a good foundation for a skimmity-ride,\u201d said Nance. \u201cTrue,\u201d said Mrs. Cuxsom, reflecting. \u201c\u2019Tis as good a ground for a skimmity-ride as ever I knowed; and it ought not to be wasted. The last one seen in Casterbridge must have been ten years ago, if a day.\u201d At this moment there was a shrill whistle, and the landlady said to the man who had been called Charl, \u201c\u2019Tis Jim coming in. Would ye go and let down the bridge for me?\u201d Without replying Charl and his comrade Joe rose, and receiving a lantern from her went out at the back door and down the garden-path, which ended abruptly at the edge of the stream already mentioned. Beyond the stream was the open moor, from which a clammy breeze smote upon their faces as they advanced. Taking up the board that had lain in readiness one of them lowered it across the water, and the instant its further end touched the ground footsteps entered upon it, and there appeared from the shade a stalwart man with straps round his knees, a double-barrelled gun under his arm and some birds slung up behind him.", " In his hand he carried a small mahogany case, strapped, and clamped with brass. Apparently surprised at the kind of company which confronted him through the kitchen door, he at once abandoned his idea of putting up at the house; but taking the situation lightly, he called for glasses of the best, paid for them as he stood in the passage, and turned to proceed on his way by the front door. This was barred, and while the landlady was unfastening it the conversation about the skimmington was continued in the sitting-room, and reached his ears. \u201cWhat do they mean by a \u2018skimmity-ride\u2019?\u201d he asked. \u201cO, sir!\u201d said the landlady, swinging her long earrings with deprecating modesty; \u201c\u2019tis a\u2019 old foolish thing they do in these parts when a man\u2019s wife is\u2014well, not too particularly his own. But as a respectable householder I don\u2019t encourage it. \u201cStill, are they going to do it shortly? It is a good sight to see, I suppose?\u201d \u201cWell, sir!\u201d she simpered.", " The mixed assemblage of idlers known to each other presently fell apart into two bands by a process of natural selection, the frequenters of Peter\u2019s Finger going off Mixen Lanewards, where most of them lived, while Coney, Buzzford, Longways, and that connection remained in the street. \u201cYou know what\u2019s brewing down there, I suppose?\u201d said Buzzford mysteriously to the others. Coney looked at him. \u201cNot the skimmity-ride?\u201d Buzzford nodded. \u201cI have my doubts if it will be carried out,\u201d said Longways. \u201cIf they are getting it up they are keeping it mighty close. \u201cI heard they were thinking of it a fortnight ago, at all events.\u201d \u201cIf I were sure o\u2019t I\u2019d lay information,\u201d said Longways emphatically. \u201c\u2019Tis too rough a joke, and apt to wake riots in towns.

If she\u2019s up to such vagaries she must suffer for \u2019em. She\u2019d no business to take the maid\u2014\u2019tis my maid; and if it were the doing again she shouldn\u2019t have her!\u201d Perhaps from some little sense of having countenanced an indefensible proceeding, perhaps because it was late, the customers thinned away from the tent shortly after this episode. The man stretched his elbows forward on the table leant his face upon his arms, and soon began to snore. The furmity seller decided to close for the night, and after seeing the rum-bottles, milk, corn, raisins, etc., that remained on hand, loaded into the cart, came to where the man reclined. She shook him, but could not wake him. As the tent was not to be struck that night, the fair continuing for two or three days, she decided to let the sleeper, who was obviously no tramp, stay where he was, and his basket with him. Extinguishing the last candle, and lowering the flap of the tent, she left it, and drove away."], "Who tells Henchard that Lucetta is dead?": [" I got ashore at Newfoundland, and then I asked myself what I should do. \u201c\u2018Since I\u2019m here, here I\u2019ll bide,\u2019 I thought to myself; \u2018\u2019twill be most kindness to her, now she\u2019s taken against me, to let her believe me lost, for,\u2019 I thought, \u2018while she supposes us both alive she\u2019ll be miserable; but if she thinks me dead she\u2019ll go back to him, and the child will have a home.\u2019 I\u2019ve never returned to this country till a month ago, and I found that, as I supposed, she went to you, and my daughter with her. They told me in Falmouth that Susan was dead. But my Elizabeth-Jane\u2014where is she?\u201d \u201cDead likewise,\u201d said Henchard doggedly. \u201cSurely you learnt that too?\u201d The sailor started up, and took an enervated pace or two down the room. \u201cDead!\u201d he said, in a low voice. \u201cThen what\u2019s the use of my money to me?\u201d Henchard, without answering, shook his head as if that were rather a question for Newson himself than for him.", " Henchard did not turn his eyes toward either of the pair, keeping them fixed on the bond he twisted, as if that alone absorbed him. A feeling of delicacy, which ever prompted Farfrae to avoid anything that might seem like triumphing over a fallen rival, led him to keep away from the hay-barn where Henchard and his daughter were working, and to go on to the corn department. Meanwhile Lucetta, never having been informed that Henchard had entered her husband\u2019s service, rambled straight on to the barn, where she came suddenly upon Henchard, and gave vent to a little \u201cOh!\u201d which the happy and busy Donald was too far off to hear. Henchard, with withering humility of demeanour, touched the brim of his hat to her as Whittle and the rest had done, to which she breathed a dead-alive \u201cGood afternoon.\u201d \u201cI beg your pardon, ma\u2019am?\u201d said Henchard, as if he had not heard. \u201cI said good afternoon,\u201d she faltered.", " Some little time later on Farfrae was passing Henchard\u2019s house on a Sunday morning, when he observed that the blinds were all down. He rang the bell so softly that it only sounded a single full note and a small one; and then he was informed that Mrs. Henchard was dead\u2014just dead\u2014that very hour. At the town-pump there were gathered when he passed a few old inhabitants, who came there for water whenever they had, as at present, spare time to fetch it, because it was purer from that original fount than from their own wells. Mrs. Cuxsom, who had been standing there for an indefinite time with her pitcher, was describing the incidents of Mrs. Henchard\u2019s death, as she had learnt them from the nurse. \u201cAnd she was white as marble-stone,\u201d said Mrs. Cuxsom. \u201cAnd likewise such a thoughtful woman, too\u2014ah, poor soul\u2014that a\u2019 minded every little thing that wanted tending. \u2018Yes,\u2019 says she, \u2018when I\u2019m gone, and my last breath\u2019s blowed, look in the top drawer o\u2019 the chest in the back room by the window, and you\u2019ll find all my coffin clothes, a piece of flannel\u2014that\u2019s to put under me, and the little piece is to put under my head; and my new stockings for my feet\u2014they are folded alongside, and all my other things.", " The rencounter with Farfrae and his bearings towards Lucetta had made the reflective Elizabeth more observant of her brilliant and amiable companion. A few days afterwards, when her eyes met Lucetta\u2019s as the latter was going out, she somehow knew that Miss Templeman was nourishing a hope of seeing the attractive Scotchman. The fact was printed large all over Lucetta\u2019s cheeks and eyes to any one who could read her as Elizabeth-Jane was beginning to do. Lucetta passed on and closed the street door. A seer\u2019s spirit took possession of Elizabeth, impelling her to sit down by the fire and divine events so surely from data already her own that they could be held as witnessed. She followed Lucetta thus mentally\u2014saw her encounter Donald somewhere as if by chance\u2014saw him wear his special look when meeting women, with an added intensity because this one was Lucetta. She depicted his impassioned manner; beheld the indecision of both between their lothness to separate and their desire not to be observed; depicted their shaking of hands; how they probably parted with frigidity in their general contour and movements, only in the smaller features showing the spark of passion, thus invisible to all but themselves."], "Who unexpectedly shows up at Henchard\u2019s home?": [" Farfrae he remembered had gone to the stable and put the horse into the gig; while doing so Whittle had brought him a letter; Farfrae had then said that he would not go towards Budmouth as he had intended\u2014that he was unexpectedly summoned to Weatherbury, and meant to call at Mellstock on his way thither, that place lying but one or two miles out of his course. He must have come prepared for a journey when he first arrived in the yard, unsuspecting enmity; and he must have driven off (though in a changed direction) without saying a word to any one on what had occurred between themselves. It would therefore be useless to call at Farfrae\u2019s house till very late. There was no help for it but to wait till his return, though waiting was almost torture to his restless and self-accusing soul. He walked about the streets and outskirts of the town, lingering here and there till he reached the stone bridge of which mention has been made, an accustomed halting-place with him now.", " Idlers were standing on the pavement in front; and wishing to escape the notice of these Henchard passed quickly on to the door. It was wide open, the hall was lighted extravagantly, and people were going up and down the stairs. His courage failed him; to enter footsore, laden, and poorly dressed into the midst of such resplendency was to bring needless humiliation upon her he loved, if not to court repulse from her husband. Accordingly he went round into the street at the back that he knew so well, entered the garden, and came quietly into the house through the kitchen, temporarily depositing the bird and cage under a bush outside, to lessen the awkwardness of his arrival. Solitude and sadness had so emolliated Henchard that he now feared circumstances he would formerly have scorned, and he began to wish that he had not taken upon himself to arrive at such a juncture. However, his progress was made unexpectedly easy by his discovering alone in the kitchen an elderly woman who seemed to be acting as provisional housekeeper during the convulsions from which Farfrae\u2019s establishment was just then suffering.", " \u201cIt shows much long-suffering in you to put up with him, and keep him in your employ.\u201d \u201cBut I cannet discharge a man who was once a good friend to me. How can I forget that when I came here \u2019twas he enabled me to make a footing for mysel\u2019? No, no. As long as I\u2019ve a day\u2019s work to offer he shall do it if he chooses. \u2019Tis not I who will deny him such a little as that. But I\u2019ll drop the idea of establishing him in a shop till I can think more about it.\u201d It grieved Farfrae much to give up this scheme. But a damp having been thrown over it by these and other voices in the air, he went and countermanded his orders. The then occupier of the shop was in it when Farfrae spoke to him and feeling it necessary to give some explanation of his withdrawal from the negotiation Donald mentioned Henchard\u2019s name, and stated that the intentions of the Council had been changed. The occupier was much disappointed, and straight-way informed Henchard, as soon as he saw him, that a scheme of the Council for setting him up in a shop had been knocked on the head by Farfrae.", " \u201cWell,\u201d said the lady, a little of the whiteness of her teeth appearing with the word through the black fleece that protected her face, \u201chave you decided?\u201d \u201cYes, quite,\u201d said the other eagerly. \u201cYour father is willing?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cThen come along.\u201d \u201cWhen?\u201d \u201cNow\u2014as soon as you like. I had a good mind to send to you to come to my house, thinking you might not venture up here in the wind. But as I like getting out of doors, I thought I would come and see first.\u201d \u201cIt was my own thought.\u201d \u201cThat shows we shall agree. Then can you come to-day? My house is so hollow and dismal that I want some living thing there.\u201d \u201cI think I might be able to,\u201d said the girl, reflecting. Voices were borne over to them at that instant on the wind and raindrops from the other side of the wall. There came such words as \u201csacks,\u201d \u201cquarters,\u201d \u201cthreshing,\u201d \u201ctailing,\u201d \u201cnext Saturday\u2019s market,\u201d each sentence being disorganized by the gusts like a face in a cracked mirror."], "Where does Elizabeth-Jane live after Lucetta\u2019s death?": [" Their intercourse had been so low and hurried that not a word had been lost of the conversation without, which had thus proceeded:\u2014 \u201cHer neck is uncovered, and her hair in bands, and her back-comb in place; she\u2019s got on a puce silk, and white stockings, and coloured shoes.\u201d Again Elizabeth-Jane attempted to close the window, but Lucetta held her by main force. \u201c\u2019Tis me!\u201d she said, with a face pale as death. \u201cA procession\u2014a scandal\u2014an effigy of me, and him!\u201d The look of Elizabeth betrayed that the latter knew it already. \u201cLet us shut it out,\u201d coaxed Elizabeth-Jane, noting that the rigid wildness of Lucetta\u2019s features was growing yet more rigid and wild with the meaning of the noise and laughter. \u201cLet us shut it out!\u201d \u201cIt is of no use!\u201d she shrieked. \u201cHe will see it, won\u2019t he? Donald will see it! He is just coming home\u2014and it will break his heart\u2014he will never love me any more\u2014and O, it will kill me\u2014kill me!\u201d Elizabeth-Jane was frantic now.", " \u201cFather,\u201d she said, as soon as she recalled herself to the outspread meal, \u201cit is so kind of you to get this nice breakfast with your own hands, and I idly asleep the while.\u201d \u201cI do it every day,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou have left me; everybody has left me; how should I live but by my own hands.\u201d \u201cYou are very lonely, are you not?\u201d \u201cAy, child\u2014to a degree that you know nothing of! It is my own fault. You are the only one who has been near me for weeks. And you will come no more.\u201d \u201cWhy do you say that? Indeed I will, if you would like to see me.\u201d Henchard signified dubiousness. Though he had so lately hoped that Elizabeth-Jane might again live in his house as daughter, he would not ask her to do so now. Newson might return at any moment, and what Elizabeth would think of him for his deception it were best to bear apart from her. When they had breakfasted his stepdaughter still lingered, till the moment arrived at which Henchard was accustomed to go to his daily work.", " I was so desperate\u2014so afraid of being forced to anything else\u2014so afraid of revelations that would quench his love for me, that I resolved to do it offhand, come what might, and purchase a week of happiness at any cost!\u201d \u201cYou\u2014have\u2014married Mr. Farfrae!\u201d cried Elizabeth-Jane, in Nathan tones Lucetta bowed. She had recovered herself. \u201cThe bells are ringing on that account,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband is downstairs. He will live here till a more suitable house is ready for us; and I have told him that I want you to stay with me just as before.\u201d \u201cLet me think of it alone,\u201d the girl quickly replied, corking up the turmoil of her feeling with grand control. \u201cYou shall. I am sure we shall be happy together.\u201d Lucetta departed to join Donald below, a vague uneasiness floating over her joy at seeing him quite at home there. Not on account of her friend Elizabeth did she feel it: for of the bearings of Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s emotions she had not the least suspicion; but on Henchard\u2019s alone.", " Elizabeth-Jane, who had often observed them, said, \u201cI wonder if the same trees come every week?\u201d \u201cWhat trees?\u201d said Lucetta, absorbed in watching for Henchard. Elizabeth replied vaguely, for an incident checked her. Behind one of the trees stood Farfrae, briskly discussing a sample-bag with a farmer. Henchard had come up, accidentally encountering the young man, whose face seemed to inquire, \u201cDo we speak to each other?\u201d She saw her stepfather throw a shine into his eye which answered \u201cNo!\u201d Elizabeth-Jane sighed. \u201cAre you particularly interested in anybody out there?\u201d said Lucetta. \u201cO, no,\u201d said her companion, a quick red shooting over her face. Luckily Farfrae\u2019s figure was immediately covered by the apple-tree. Lucetta looked hard at her. \u201cQuite sure?\u201d she said. \u201cO yes,\u201d said Elizabeth-Jane. Again Lucetta looked out. \u201cThey are all farmers, I suppose?\u201d she said. \u201cNo. There\u2019s Mr. Bulge\u2014he\u2019s a wine merchant; there\u2019s Benjamin Brownlet\u2014a horse dealer; and Kitson, the pig breeder; and Yopper, the auctioneer; besides maltsters, and millers\u2014and so on.\u201d Farfrae stood out quite distinctly now; but she did not mention him."], "What does Henchard begin to fear?": [" Farfrae came on with one hand in his pocket, and humming a tune in a way which told that the words were most in his mind. They were those of the song he had sung when he arrived years before at the Three Mariners, a poor young man, adventuring for life and fortune, and scarcely knowing witherward:\u2014 \u201cAnd here\u2019s a hand, my trusty fiere, And gie\u2019s a hand o\u2019 thine.\u201d Nothing moved Henchard like an old melody. He sank back. \u201cNo; I can\u2019t do it!\u201d he gasped. \u201cWhy does the infernal fool begin that now!\u201d At length Farfrae was silent, and Henchard looked out of the loft door. \u201cWill ye come up here?\u201d he said. \u201cAy, man,\u201d said Farfrae. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see ye. What\u2019s wrang?\u201d A minute later Henchard heard his feet on the lowest ladder. He heard him land on the first floor, ascend and land on the second, begin the ascent to the third. And then his head rose through the trap behind. \u201cWhat are you doing up here at this time?\u201d he asked, coming forward.", " The landscape over the river disappeared; the wind played on the tent-cords in \u00c6olian improvisations, and at length rose to such a pitch that the whole erection slanted to the ground those who had taken shelter within it having to crawl out on their hands and knees. But towards six the storm abated, and a drier breeze shook the moisture from the grass bents. It seemed possible to carry out the programme after all. The awning was set up again; the band was called out from its shelter, and ordered to begin, and where the tables had stood a place was cleared for dancing. \u201cBut where are the folk?\u201d said Henchard, after the lapse of half-an-hour, during which time only two men and a woman had stood up to dance. \u201cThe shops are all shut. Why don\u2019t they come?\u201d \u201cThey are at Farfrae\u2019s affair in the West Walk,\u201d answered a Councilman who stood in the field with the Mayor. \u201cA few, I suppose. But where are the body o\u2019 \u2019em?\u201d \u201cAll out of doors are there.\u201d \u201cThen the more fools they!\u201d Henchard walked away moodily.", " \u201cI could have loved you always\u2014I would have, gladly,\u201d she said. \u201cBut how can I when I know you have deceived me so\u2014so bitterly deceived me! You persuaded me that my father was not my father\u2014allowed me to live on in ignorance of the truth for years; and then when he, my warm-hearted real father, came to find me, cruelly sent him away with a wicked invention of my death, which nearly broke his heart. O how can I love as I once did a man who has served us like this!\u201d Henchard\u2019s lips half parted to begin an explanation. But he shut them up like a vice, and uttered not a sound. How should he, there and then, set before her with any effect the palliatives of his great faults\u2014that he had himself been deceived in her identity at first, till informed by her mother\u2019s letter that his own child had died; that, in the second accusation, his lie had been the last desperate throw of a gamester who loved her affection better than his own honour?", " \u201cYou are wishing you were back again,\u201d she said. \u201cAh, no, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Farfrae, suddenly recalling himself. The fair without the windows was now raging thick and loud. It was the chief hiring fair of the year, and differed quite from the market of a few days earlier. In substance it was a whitey-brown crowd flecked with white\u2014this being the body of labourers waiting for places. The long bonnets of the women, like waggon-tilts, their cotton gowns and checked shawls, mixed with the carters\u2019 smockfrocks; for they, too, entered into the hiring. Among the rest, at the corner of the pavement, stood an old shepherd, who attracted the eyes of Lucetta and Farfrae by his stillness. He was evidently a chastened man. The battle of life had been a sharp one with him, for, to begin with, he was a man of small frame. He was now so bowed by hard work and years that, approaching from behind, a person could hardly see his head."], "Who does Elizabeth-Jane meet at Farfrae\u2019s house?": [" So that I don\u2019t see how you two can return openly to my house as the wife and daughter I once treated badly, and banished from me; and there\u2019s the rub o\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll go away at once. I only came to see\u2014\u201d \u201cNo, no, Susan; you are not to go\u2014you mistake me!\u201d he said with kindly severity. \u201cI have thought of this plan: that you and Elizabeth take a cottage in the town as the widow Mrs. Newson and her daughter; that I meet you, court you, and marry you. Elizabeth-Jane coming to my house as my stepdaughter. The thing is so natural and easy that it is half done in thinking o\u2019t. This would leave my shady, headstrong, disgraceful life as a young man absolutely unopened; the secret would be yours and mine only; and I should have the pleasure of seeing my own only child under my roof, as well as my wife.\u201d \u201cI am quite in your hands, Michael,\u201d she said meekly. \u201cI came here for the sake of Elizabeth; for myself, if you tell me to leave again to-morrow morning, and never come near you more, I am content to go.\u201d \u201cNow, now; we don\u2019t want to hear that,\u201d said Henchard gently.", " In the meantime Elizabeth had reached the inn. Her mother, instead of taking the note with the curiosity of a poor woman expecting assistance, was much moved at sight of it. She did not read it at once, asking Elizabeth to describe her reception, and the very words Mr. Henchard used. Elizabeth\u2019s back was turned when her mother opened the letter. It ran thus:\u2014 \u201cMeet me at eight o\u2019clock this evening, if you can, at the Ring on the Budmouth road. The place is easy to find. I can say no more now. The news upsets me almost. The girl seems to be in ignorance. Keep her so till I have seen you. M. H.\u201d He said nothing about the enclosure of five guineas. The amount was significant; it may tacitly have said to her that he bought her back again. She waited restlessly for the close of the day, telling Elizabeth-Jane that she was invited to see Mr. Henchard; that she would go alone. But she said nothing to show that the place of meeting was not at his house, nor did she hand the note to Elizabeth.", " The time was just after twelve o\u2019clock. Those notes were a signal that all had gone well; that there had been no slip \u2019twixt cup and lip in this case; that Elizabeth-Jane and Donald Farfrae were man and wife. Henchard did not care to ride any further with his chattering companions after hearing this sound. Indeed, it quite unmanned him; and in pursuance of his plan of not showing himself in Casterbridge street till evening, lest he should mortify Farfrae and his bride, he alighted here, with his bundle and bird-cage, and was soon left as a lonely figure on the broad white highway. It was the hill near which he had waited to meet Farfrae, almost two years earlier, to tell him of the serious illness of his wife Lucetta. The place was unchanged; the same larches sighed the same notes; but Farfrae had another wife\u2014and, as Henchard knew, a better one. He only hoped that Elizabeth-Jane had obtained a better home than had been hers at the former time.", " There was nothing secret in Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s movements beyond what habitual reserve induced, and it may at once be owned on her account that she was guilty of occasional conversations with Donald when they chanced to meet. Whatever the origin of her walks on the Budmouth Road, her return from those walks was often coincident with Farfrae\u2019s emergence from Corn Street for a twenty minutes\u2019 blow on that rather windy highway\u2014just to winnow the seeds and chaff out of him before sitting down to tea, as he said. Henchard became aware of this by going to the Ring, and, screened by its enclosure, keeping his eye upon the road till he saw them meet. His face assumed an expression of extreme anguish. \u201cOf her, too, he means to rob me!\u201d he whispered. \u201cBut he has the right. I do not wish to interfere.\u201d The meeting, in truth, was of a very innocent kind, and matters were by no means so far advanced between the young people as Henchard\u2019s jealous grief inferred."], "What do Newson and Farfrae plan during their evening at Farfrae\u2019s?": [" Newson\u2019s pride in what she had grown up to be was more than he could express. He kissed her again and again. \u201cI\u2019ve saved you the trouble to come and meet me\u2014ha-ha!\u201d said Newson. \u201cThe fact is that Mr. Farfrae here, he said, \u2018Come up and stop with me for a day or two, Captain Newson, and I\u2019ll bring her round.\u2019 \u2018Faith,\u2019 says I, \u2018so I will\u2019; and here I am.\u201d \u201cWell, Henchard is gone,\u201d said Farfrae, shutting the door. \u201cHe has done it all voluntarily, and, as I gather from Elizabeth, he has been very nice with her. I was got rather uneasy; but all is as it should be, and we will have no more deefficulties at all.\u201d \u201cNow, that\u2019s very much as I thought,\u201d said Newson, looking into the face of each by turns. \u201cI said to myself, ay, a hundred times, when I tried to get a peep at her unknown to herself\u2014\u2018Depend upon it, \u2019tis best that I should live on quiet for a few days like this till something turns up for the better.\u2019 I now know you are all right, and what can I wish for more?\u201d \u201cWell, Captain Newson, I will be glad to see ye here every day now, since it can do no harm,\u201d said Farfrae.", " Now I have called to ask \u2019ee this\u2014quite privately. If I should nominate \u2019ee to succeed him, and there should be no particular opposition, will \u2019ee accept the chair?\u201d \u201cBut there are folk whose turn is before mine; and I\u2019m over young, and may be thought pushing!\u201d said Farfrae after a pause. \u201cNot at all. I don\u2019t speak for myself only, several have named it. You won\u2019t refuse?\u201d \u201cWe thought of going away,\u201d interposed Lucetta, looking at Farfrae anxiously. \u201cIt was only a fancy,\u201d Farfrae murmured. \u201cI wouldna refuse if it is the wish of a respectable majority in the Council.\u201d \u201cVery well, then, look upon yourself as elected. We have had older men long enough.\u201d When he was gone Farfrae said musingly, \u201cSee now how it\u2019s ourselves that are ruled by the Powers above us! We plan this, but we do that. If they want to make me Mayor I will stay, and Henchard must rave as he will.\u201d From this evening onward Lucetta was very uneasy.", " The time was just after twelve o\u2019clock. Those notes were a signal that all had gone well; that there had been no slip \u2019twixt cup and lip in this case; that Elizabeth-Jane and Donald Farfrae were man and wife. Henchard did not care to ride any further with his chattering companions after hearing this sound. Indeed, it quite unmanned him; and in pursuance of his plan of not showing himself in Casterbridge street till evening, lest he should mortify Farfrae and his bride, he alighted here, with his bundle and bird-cage, and was soon left as a lonely figure on the broad white highway.

The place was unchanged; the same larches sighed the same notes; but Farfrae had another wife\u2014and, as Henchard knew, a better one. He only hoped that Elizabeth-Jane had obtained a better home than had been hers at the former time.", " The letter to the young Jersey woman was carefully framed by him, and the interview ended, Henchard saying, as the Scotchman left, \u201cI feel it a great relief, Farfrae, to tell some friend o\u2019 this! You see now that the Mayor of Casterbridge is not so thriving in his mind as it seems he might be from the state of his pocket.\u201d \u201cI do. And I\u2019m sorry for ye!\u201d said Farfrae. When he was gone Henchard copied the letter, and, enclosing a cheque, took it to the post-office, from which he walked back thoughtfully. \u201cCan it be that it will go off so easily!\u201d he said. \u201cPoor thing\u2014God knows! Now then, to make amends to Susan!\u201d XIII. The cottage which Michael Henchard hired for his wife Susan under her name of Newson\u2014in pursuance of their plan\u2014was in the upper or western part of the town, near the Roman wall, and the avenue which overshadowed it. The evening sun seemed to shine more yellowly there than anywhere else this autumn\u2014stretching its rays, as the hours grew later, under the lowest sycamore boughs, and steeping the ground-floor of the dwelling, with its green shutters, in a substratum of radiance which the foliage screened from the upper parts."], "After leaving Casterbridge, where does Henchard end up?": [" At the last moment of leaving Port-Bredy, Farfrae, like John Gilpin, had been detained by important customers, whom, even in the exceptional circumstances, he was not the man to neglect. Moreover, there was a convenience in Lucetta arriving first at her house. Nobody there as yet knew what had happened; and she was best in a position to break the news to the inmates, and give directions for her husband\u2019s accommodation. He had, therefore, sent on his two-days\u2019 bride in a hired brougham, whilst he went across the country to a certain group of wheat and barley ricks a few miles off, telling her the hour at which he might be expected the same evening. This accounted for her trotting out to meet him after their separation of four hours. By a strenuous effort, after leaving Henchard she calmed herself in readiness to receive Donald at High-Place Hall when he came on from his lodgings. One supreme fact empowered her to this, the sense that, come what would, she had secured him.", " They came in from the country, and the steaming horses had probably been travelling a great part of the night. To the shaft of each hung a little board, on which was painted in white letters, \u201cHenchard, corn-factor and hay-merchant.\u201d The spectacle renewed his wife\u2019s conviction that, for her daughter\u2019s sake, she should strain a point to rejoin him. The discussion was continued during breakfast, and the end of it was that Mrs. Henchard decided, for good or for ill, to send Elizabeth-Jane with a message to Henchard, to the effect that his relative Susan, a sailor\u2019s widow, was in the town; leaving it to him to say whether or not he would recognize her. What had brought her to this determination were chiefly two things. He had been described as a lonely widower; and he had expressed shame for a past transaction of his life. There was promise in both. \u201cIf he says no,\u201d she enjoined, as Elizabeth-Jane stood, bonnet on, ready to depart; \u201cif he thinks it does not become the good position he has reached to in the town, to own\u2014to let us call on him as\u2014his distant kinfolk, say, \u2018Then, sir, we would rather not intrude; we will leave Casterbridge as quietly as we have come, and go back to our own country.\u2019 ...I almost feel that I would rather he did say so, as I have not seen him for so many years, and we are so\u2014little allied to him!\u201d \u201cAnd if he say yes?\u201d inquired the more sanguine one.", " To pocket her pride and search for the first husband seemed, wisely or not, the best initiatory step. He had possibly drunk himself into his tomb. But he might, on the other hand, have had too much sense to do so; for in her time with him he had been given to bouts only, and was not a habitual drunkard. At any rate, the propriety of returning to him, if he lived, was unquestionable. The awkwardness of searching for him lay in enlightening Elizabeth, a proceeding which her mother could not endure to contemplate. She finally resolved to undertake the search without confiding to the girl her former relations with Henchard, leaving it to him if they found him to take what steps he might choose to that end. This will account for their conversation at the fair and the half-informed state at which Elizabeth was led onward. In this attitude they proceeded on their journey, trusting solely to the dim light afforded of Henchard\u2019s whereabouts by the furmity woman.", " What could be inside it? So he went on and on till, animated by resentment at Lucetta\u2019s haughtiness, as he thought it, and curiosity to learn if there were any weak sides to this transaction with Henchard, he examined the package. The pen and all its relations being awkward tools in Henchard\u2019s hands he had affixed the seals without an impression, it never occurring to him that the efficacy of such a fastening depended on this. Jopp was far less of a tyro; he lifted one of the seals with his penknife, peeped in at the end thus opened, saw that the bundle consisted of letters; and, having satisfied himself thus far, sealed up the end again by simply softening the wax with the candle, and went off with the parcel as requested. His path was by the river-side at the foot of the town. Coming into the light at the bridge which stood at the end of High Street he beheld lounging thereon Mother Cuxsom and Nance Mockridge."], "What does Henchard leave as a wedding gift for Elizabeth-Jane?": [" Donald Farfrae had discovered in a screened corner a new bird-cage, shrouded in newspaper, and at the bottom of the cage a little ball of feathers\u2014the dead body of a goldfinch. Nobody could tell her how the bird and cage had come there, though that the poor little songster had been starved to death was evident. The sadness of the incident had made an impression on her. She had not been able to forget it for days, despite Farfrae\u2019s tender banter; and now when the matter had been nearly forgotten it was again revived. \u201cOh, please ma\u2019am, we know how the bird-cage came there. That farmer\u2019s man who called on the evening of the wedding\u2014he was seen wi\u2019 it in his hand as he came up the street; and \u2019tis thoughted that he put it down while he came in with his message, and then went away forgetting where he had left it.\u201d This was enough to set Elizabeth thinking, and in thinking she seized hold of the idea, at one feminine bound, that the caged bird had been brought by Henchard for her as a wedding gift and token of repentance.", " Shall I go?\u201d Henchard replied heavily, \u201cYes; go.\u201d The question of his remaining in Casterbridge was for ever disposed of by this closing in of Newson on the scene. Henchard was not the man to stand the certainty of condemnation on a matter so near his heart. And being an old hand at bearing anguish in silence, and haughty withal, he resolved to make as light as he could of his intentions, while immediately taking his measures. He surprised the young woman whom he had looked upon as his all in this world by saying to her, as if he did not care about her more: \u201cI am going to leave Casterbridge, Elizabeth-Jane.\u201d \u201cLeave Casterbridge!\u201d she cried, \u201cand leave\u2014me?\u201d \u201cYes, this little shop can be managed by you alone as well as by us both; I don\u2019t care about shops and streets and folk\u2014I would rather get into the country by myself, out of sight, and follow my own ways, and leave you to yours.\u201d She looked down and her tears fell silently.", " Surely they said a wedding was coming off soon\u2014on Martin\u2019s Day?\u201d The man declared he remembered nothing about it; and the waggon went on jangling over the hill. Henchard was convinced that the woman\u2019s memory served her well. The date was an extremely probable one, there being no reason for delay on either side. He might, for that matter, write and inquire of Elizabeth; but his instinct for sequestration had made the course difficult. Yet before he left her she had said that for him to be absent from her wedding was not as she wished it to be. The remembrance would continually revive in him now that it was not Elizabeth and Farfrae who had driven him away from them, but his own haughty sense that his presence was no longer desired. He had assumed the return of Newson without absolute proof that the Captain meant to return; still less that Elizabeth-Jane would welcome him; and with no proof whatever that if he did return he would stay.", " So that I don\u2019t see how you two can return openly to my house as the wife and daughter I once treated badly, and banished from me; and there\u2019s the rub o\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll go away at once. I only came to see\u2014\u201d \u201cNo, no, Susan; you are not to go\u2014you mistake me!\u201d he said with kindly severity. \u201cI have thought of this plan: that you and Elizabeth take a cottage in the town as the widow Mrs. Newson and her daughter; that I meet you, court you, and marry you. Elizabeth-Jane coming to my house as my stepdaughter. The thing is so natural and easy that it is half done in thinking o\u2019t. This would leave my shady, headstrong, disgraceful life as a young man absolutely unopened; the secret would be yours and mine only; and I should have the pleasure of seeing my own only child under my roof, as well as my wife.\u201d \u201cI am quite in your hands, Michael,\u201d she said meekly. \u201cI came here for the sake of Elizabeth; for myself, if you tell me to leave again to-morrow morning, and never come near you more, I am content to go.\u201d \u201cNow, now; we don\u2019t want to hear that,\u201d said Henchard gently."]}
