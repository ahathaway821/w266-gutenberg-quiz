{"At the openingof the novel, what is Michael Henchard\u2019s occupation?": [" The seal had cracked, and the letter was open. Henchard had no reason to suppose the restriction one of serious weight, and his feeling for his late wife had not been of the nature of deep respect. \u201cSome trifling fancy or other of poor Susan\u2019s, I suppose,\u201d he said; and without curiosity he allowed his eyes to scan the letter:\u2014 MY DEAR MICHAEL,\u2014For the good of all three of us I have kept one thing a secret from you till now. I hope you will understand why; I think you will; though perhaps you may not forgive me. But, dear Michael, I have done it for the best. I shall be in my grave when you read this, and Elizabeth-Jane will have a home. Don\u2019t curse me Mike\u2014think of how I was situated. I can hardly write it, but here it is. Elizabeth-Jane is not your Elizabeth-Jane\u2014the child who was in my arms when you sold me. No; she died three months after that, and this living one is my other husband\u2019s. I christened her by the same name we had given to the first, and she filled up the ache I felt at the other\u2019s loss. Michael, I am dying, and I might have held my tongue; but I could not. Tell her husband of this or not, as you may judge; and forgive, if you can, a woman you once deeply wronged, as she forgives you. SUSAN HENCHARD Her husband regarded the paper as if it were a window-pane through which he saw for miles. His lips twitched, and he seemed to compress his frame, as if to bear better.", " Still, I wouldn\u2019t call in a hurry, because\u2014well, you can guess how this money you\u2019ve come into made me feel.\u201d His voice slowly fell; he was conscious that in this room his accents and manner wore a roughness not observable in the street. He looked about the room at the novel hangings and ingenious furniture with which she had surrounded herself. \u201cUpon my life I didn\u2019t know such furniture as this could be bought in Casterbridge,\u201d he said. \u201cNor can it be,\u201d said she. \u201cNor will it till fifty years more of civilization have passed over the town. It took a waggon and four horses to get it here.\u201d \u201cH\u2019m. It looks as if you were living on capital.\u201d \u201cO no, I am not.\u201d \u201cSo much the better. But the fact is, your setting up like this makes my beaming towards you rather awkward.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d An answer was not really needed, and he did not furnish one. \u201cWell,\u201d he went on, \u201cthere\u2019s nobody in the world I would have wished to see enter into this wealth before you, Lucetta, and nobody, I am sure, who will become it more.\u201d He turned to her with congratulatory admiration so fervid that she shrank somewhat, notwithstanding that she knew him so well. \u201cI am greatly obliged to you for all that,\u201d said she, rather with an air of speaking ritual. The stint of reciprocal feeling was perceived, and Henchard showed chagrin at once\u2014nobody was more quick to show that than he. \u201cYou may be obliged or not for\u2019t. Though the things I say may not have the polish of what you\u2019ve lately learnt to expect for the first time in your life, they are real, my lady Lucetta.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s rather a rude way of speaking to me,\u201d pouted Lucetta, with stormy eyes.", " \u201cNot at all.\u201d \u201cBut where do you live?\u201d \u201cIn Casterbridge, or rather I shall be living here after twelve o\u2019clock to-day.\u201d Elizabeth expressed her astonishment. \u201cI have been staying at Budmouth for a few days while my house was getting ready. The house I am going into is that one they call High-Place Hall\u2014the old stone one looking down the lane to the market. Two or three rooms are fit for occupation, though not all: I sleep there to-night for the first time. Now will you think over my proposal, and meet me here the first fine day next week, and say if you are still in the same mind?\u201d Elizabeth, her eyes shining at this prospect of a change from an unbearable position, joyfully assented; and the two parted at the gate of the churchyard. XXI. As a maxim glibly repeated from childhood remains practically unmarked till some mature experience enforces it, so did this High-Place Hall now for the first time really show itself to Elizabeth-Jane, though her ears had heard its name on a hundred occasions. Her mind dwelt upon nothing else but the stranger, and the house, and her own chance of living there, all the rest of the day. In the afternoon she had occasion to pay a few bills in the town and do a little shopping when she learnt that what was a new discovery to herself had become a common topic about the streets. High-Place Hall was undergoing repair; a lady was coming there to live shortly; all the shop-people knew it, and had already discounted the chance of her being a customer.", " As a consequence, instead of following a straight course yet further away from Casterbridge, Henchard gradually, almost unconsciously, deflected from that right line of his first intention; till, by degrees, his wandering, like that of the Canadian woodsman, became part of a circle of which Casterbridge formed the centre. In ascending any particular hill he ascertained the bearings as nearly as he could by means of the sun, moon, or stars, and settled in his mind the exact direction in which Casterbridge and Elizabeth-Jane lay. Sneering at himself for his weakness he yet every hour\u2014nay, every few minutes\u2014conjectured her actions for the time being\u2014her sitting down and rising up, her goings and comings, till thought of Newson\u2019s and Farfrae\u2019s counter-influence would pass like a cold blast over a pool, and efface her image. And then he would say to himself, \u201cO you fool! All this about a daughter who is no daughter of thine!\u201d At length he obtained employment at his own occupation of hay-trusser, work of that sort being in demand at this autumn time. The scene of his hiring was a pastoral farm near the old western highway, whose course was the channel of all such communications as passed between the busy centres of novelty and the remote Wessex boroughs. He had chosen the neighbourhood of this artery from a sense that, situated here, though at a distance of fifty miles, he was virtually nearer to her whose welfare was so dear than he would be at a roadless spot only half as remote."], "To whom does Henchardsell his wife?": [" I and the first man were thrown together in a strange way, and felt that we ought to be united, as the world had talked of us. He was a widower, as he supposed. He had not heard of his first wife for many years. But the wife returned, and we parted. She is now dead, and the husband comes paying me addresses again, saying, \u2018Now we\u2019ll complete our purposes.\u2019 But, Elizabeth-Jane, all this amounts to a new courtship of me by him; I was absolved from all vows by the return of the other woman.\u201d \u201cHave you not lately renewed your promise?\u201d said the younger with quiet surmise. She had divined Man Number One. \u201cThat was wrung from me by a threat.\u201d \u201cYes, it was. But I think when any one gets coupled up with a man in the past so unfortunately as you have done she ought to become his wife if she can, even if she were not the sinning party.\u201d Lucetta\u2019s countenance lost its sparkle. \u201cHe turned out to be a man I should be afraid to marry,\u201d she pleaded. \u201cReally afraid! And it was not till after my renewed promise that I knew it.\u201d \u201cThen there is only one course left to honesty. You must remain a single woman.\u201d \u201cBut think again! Do consider\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cI am certain,\u201d interrupted her companion hardily. \u201cI have guessed very well who the man is. My father; and I say it is him or nobody for you.\u201d Any suspicion of impropriety was to Elizabeth-Jane like a red rag to a bull. Her craving for correctness of procedure was, indeed, almost vicious.", " The tinge of indifference which had at first been visible in the Scotchman now disappeared. Henchard went on to describe his attempts to find his wife; the oath he swore; the solitary life he led during the years which followed. \u201cI have kept my oath for nineteen years,\u201d he went on; \u201cI have risen to what you see me now.\u201d \u201cAy!\u201d \u201cWell\u2014no wife could I hear of in all that time; and being by nature something of a woman-hater, I have found it no hardship to keep mostly at a distance from the sex. No wife could I hear of, I say, till this very day. And now\u2014she has come back.\u201d \u201cCome back, has she!\u201d \u201cThis morning\u2014this very morning. And what\u2019s to be done?\u201d \u201cCan ye no\u2019 take her and live with her, and make some amends?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve planned and proposed. But, Farfrae,\u201d said Henchard gloomily, \u201cby doing right with Susan I wrong another innocent woman.\u201d \u201cYe don\u2019t say that?\u201d \u201cIn the nature of things, Farfrae, it is almost impossible that a man of my sort should have the good fortune to tide through twenty years o\u2019 life without making more blunders than one. It has been my custom for many years to run across to Jersey in the the way of business, particularly in the potato and root season. I do a large trade wi\u2019 them in that line. Well, one autumn when stopping there I fell quite ill, and in my illness I sank into one of those gloomy fits I sometimes suffer from, on account o\u2019 the loneliness of my domestic life, when the world seems to have the blackness of hell, and, like Job, I could curse the day that gave me birth.\u201d \u201cAh, now, I never feel like it,\u201d said Farfrae.", " \u201cI have to go to Mellstock,\u201d said Farfrae coldly, as he loosened his reins to move on. \u201cBut,\u201d implored Henchard, \u201cthe matter is more serious than your business at Mellstock. It is\u2014your wife! She is ill. I can tell you particulars as we go along.\u201d The very agitation and abruptness of Henchard increased Farfrae\u2019s suspicion that this was a _ruse_ to decoy him on to the next wood, where might be effectually compassed what, from policy or want of nerve, Henchard had failed to do earlier in the day. He started the horse. \u201cI know what you think,\u201d deprecated Henchard running after, almost bowed down with despair as he perceived the image of unscrupulous villainy that he assumed in his former friend\u2019s eyes. \u201cBut I am not what you think!\u201d he cried hoarsely. \u201cBelieve me, Farfrae; I have come entirely on your own and your wife\u2019s account. She is in danger. I know no more; and they want you to come. Your man has gone the other way in a mistake. O Farfrae! don\u2019t mistrust me\u2014I am a wretched man; but my heart is true to you still!\u201d Farfrae, however, did distrust him utterly. He knew his wife was with child, but he had left her not long ago in perfect health; and Henchard\u2019s treachery was more credible than his story. He had in his time heard bitter ironies from Henchard\u2019s lips, and there might be ironies now. He quickened the horse\u2019s pace, and had soon risen into the high country lying between there and Mellstock, Henchard\u2019s spasmodic run after him lending yet more substance to his thought of evil purposes.", " His wife had observed the proceeding with much uneasiness; but he persuaded her to have hers laced also, and she agreed to a milder allowance after some misgiving. The man finished his basin, and called for another, the rum being signalled for in yet stronger proportion. The effect of it was soon apparent in his manner, and his wife but too sadly perceived that in strenuously steering off the rocks of the licensed liquor-tent she had only got into maelstrom depths here amongst the smugglers. The child began to prattle impatiently, and the wife more than once said to her husband, \u201cMichael, how about our lodging? You know we may have trouble in getting it if we don\u2019t go soon.\u201d But he turned a deaf ear to those bird-like chirpings. He talked loud to the company. The child\u2019s black eyes, after slow, round, ruminating gazes at the candles when they were lighted, fell together; then they opened, then shut again, and she slept. At the end of the first basin the man had risen to serenity; at the second he was jovial; at the third, argumentative, at the fourth, the qualities signified by the shape of his face, the occasional clench of his mouth, and the fiery spark of his dark eye, began to tell in his conduct; he was overbearing\u2014even brilliantly quarrelsome. The conversation took a high turn, as it often does on such occasions. The ruin of good men by bad wives, and, more particularly, the frustration of many a promising youth\u2019s high aims and hopes and the extinction of his energies by an early imprudent marriage, was the theme."], "The morning afterselling his wife, what pledge does Henchard make?": [" The tinge of indifference which had at first been visible in the Scotchman now disappeared.

He was disturbed by another knock at the door, and rose to open it, rather deprecating a call from anybody just then. A stoutly built man stood on the doorstep, with an alien, unfamiliar air about his figure and bearing\u2014an air which might have been called colonial by people of cosmopolitan experience. It was the man who had asked the way at Peter\u2019s finger. Henchard nodded, and looked inquiry. \u201cGood morning, good morning,\u201d said the stranger with profuse heartiness. \u201cIs it Mr. Henchard I am talking to?\u201d \u201cMy name is Henchard.\u201d \u201cThen I\u2019ve caught \u2019ee at home\u2014that\u2019s right.

Can I have a few words with you?\u201d \u201cBy all means,\u201d Henchard answered, showing the way in. \u201cYou may remember me?\u201d said his visitor, seating himself. Henchard observed him indifferently, and shook his head. \u201cWell\u2014perhaps you may not. My name is Newson.\u201d Henchard\u2019s face and eyes seemed to die. The other did not notice it. \u201cI know the name well,\u201d Henchard said at last, looking on the floor. \u201cI make no doubt of that. Well, the fact is, I\u2019ve been looking for \u2019ee this fortnight past. I landed at Havenpool and went through Casterbridge on my way to Falmouth, and when I got there, they told me you had some years before been living at Casterbridge.", " \u201cI have to go to Mellstock,\u201d said Farfrae coldly, as he loosened his reins to move on. \u201cBut,\u201d implored Henchard, \u201cthe matter is more serious than your business at Mellstock.

It seemed to him that only one of them could possibly be recalled, and that was the girl. His mind began vibrating between the wish to reveal himself to her and the policy of leaving well alone, till he could no longer sit still. He walked up and down, and then he came and stood behind her chair, looking down upon the top of her head. He could no longer restrain his impulse. \u201cWhat did your mother tell you about me\u2014my history?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat you were related by marriage.\u201d \u201cShe should have told more\u2014before you knew me! Then my task would not have been such a hard one.... Elizabeth, it is I who am your father, and not Richard Newson. Shame alone prevented your wretched parents from owning this to you while both of \u2019em were alive.\u201d The back of Elizabeth\u2019s head remained still, and her shoulders did not denote even the movements of breathing. Henchard went on: \u201cI\u2019d rather have your scorn, your fear, anything than your ignorance; \u2019tis that I hate! Your mother and I were man and wife when we were young. What you saw was our second marriage. Your mother was too honest. We had thought each other dead\u2014and\u2014Newson became her husband.\u201d This was the nearest approach Henchard could make to the full truth. As far as he personally was concerned he would have screened nothing; but he showed a respect for the young girl\u2019s sex and years worthy of a better man."], "Upon arrivingin Casterbridge, where does Susan Henchard predict that she andElizabeth-Jane will find Henchard?": [" \u201cOf course you won\u2019t leave again. Think over the plan I have proposed for a few hours; and if you can\u2019t hit upon a better one we\u2019ll adopt it. I have to be away for a day or two on business, unfortunately; but during that time you can get lodgings\u2014the only ones in the town fit for you are those over the china-shop in High Street\u2014and you can also look for a cottage.\u201d \u201cIf the lodgings are in High Street they are dear, I suppose?\u201d \u201cNever mind\u2014you _must_ start genteel if our plan is to be carried out. Look to me for money. Have you enough till I come back?\u201d \u201cQuite,\u201d said she. \u201cAnd are you comfortable at the inn?\u201d \u201cO yes.\u201d \u201cAnd the girl is quite safe from learning the shame of her case and ours?\u2014that\u2019s what makes me most anxious of all.\u201d \u201cYou would be surprised to find how unlikely she is to dream of the truth. How could she ever suppose such a thing?\u201d \u201cTrue!\u201d \u201cI like the idea of repeating our marriage,\u201d said Mrs. Henchard, after a pause. \u201cIt seems the only right course, after all this. Now I think I must go back to Elizabeth-Jane, and tell her that our kinsman, Mr. Henchard, kindly wishes us to stay in the town.\u201d \u201cVery well\u2014arrange that yourself. I\u2019ll go some way with you.\u201d \u201cNo, no. Don\u2019t run any risk!\u201d said his wife anxiously. \u201cI can find my way back\u2014it is not late. Please let me go alone.\u201d \u201cRight,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cBut just one word. Do you forgive me, Susan?\u201d She murmured something; but seemed to find it difficult to frame her answer.", " \u201cYou hear, Susan?\u2014I don\u2019t drink now\u2014I haven\u2019t since that night.\u201d Those were his first words. He felt her bow her head in acknowledgment that she understood. After a minute or two he again began: \u201cIf I had known you were living, Susan! But there was every reason to suppose you and the child were dead and gone. I took every possible step to find you\u2014travelled\u2014advertised. My opinion at last was that you had started for some colony with that man, and had been drowned on your voyage. Why did you keep silent like this?\u201d \u201cO Michael! because of him\u2014what other reason could there be? I thought I owed him faithfulness to the end of one of our lives\u2014foolishly I believed there was something solemn and binding in the bargain; I thought that even in honour I dared not desert him when he had paid so much for me in good faith. I meet you now only as his widow\u2014I consider myself that, and that I have no claim upon you. Had he not died I should never have come\u2014never! Of that you may be sure.\u201d \u201cTut-tut! How could you be so simple?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. Yet it would have been very wicked\u2014if I had not thought like that!\u201d said Susan, almost crying. \u201cYes\u2014yes\u2014so it would. It is only that which makes me feel \u2019ee an innocent woman. But\u2014to lead me into this!\u201d \u201cWhat, Michael?\u201d she asked, alarmed. \u201cWhy, this difficulty about our living together again, and Elizabeth-Jane. She cannot be told all\u2014she would so despise us both that\u2014I could not bear it!\u201d \u201cThat was why she was brought up in ignorance of you.", " She looked startled, jerked his foot warningly, and murmured, \u201cDid I?\u201d As soon as Elizabeth was gone to her own room Henchard resumed. \u201cBegad, I nearly forgot myself just now! What I meant was that the girl\u2019s hair certainly looked as if it would be darker, when she was a baby.\u201d \u201cIt did; but they alter so,\u201d replied Susan. \u201cTheir hair gets darker, I know\u2014but I wasn\u2019t aware it lightened ever?\u201d \u201cO yes.\u201d And the same uneasy expression came out on her face, to which the future held the key. It passed as Henchard went on: \u201cWell, so much the better. Now Susan, I want to have her called Miss Henchard\u2014not Miss Newson. Lots o\u2019 people do it already in carelessness\u2014it is her legal name\u2014so it may as well be made her usual name\u2014I don\u2019t like t\u2019other name at all for my own flesh and blood. I\u2019ll advertise it in the Casterbridge paper\u2014that\u2019s the way they do it. She won\u2019t object.\u201d \u201cNo. O no. But\u2014\u201d \u201cWell, then, I shall do it,\u201d he said, peremptorily. \u201cSurely, if she\u2019s willing, you must wish it as much as I?\u201d \u201cO yes\u2014if she agrees let us do it by all means,\u201d she replied. Then Mrs. Henchard acted somewhat inconsistently; it might have been called falsely, but that her manner was emotional and full of the earnestness of one who wishes to do right at great hazard. She went to Elizabeth-Jane, whom she found sewing in her own sitting-room upstairs, and told her what had been proposed about her surname. \u201cCan you agree\u2014is it not a slight upon Newson\u2014now he\u2019s dead and gone?\u201d Elizabeth reflected.", " I\u2019m so bad at letters.\u201d \u201cAnd I will.\u201d \u201cNow, I haven\u2019t told you quite all yet. My wife Susan has my daughter with her\u2014the baby that was in her arms at the fair; and this girl knows nothing of me beyond that I am some sort of relation by marriage. She has grown up in the belief that the sailor to whom I made over her mother, and who is now dead, was her father, and her mother\u2019s husband. What her mother has always felt, she and I together feel now\u2014that we can\u2019t proclaim our disgrace to the girl by letting her know the truth. Now what would you do?\u2014I want your advice.\u201d \u201cI think I\u2019d run the risk, and tell her the truth. She\u2019ll forgive ye both.\u201d \u201cNever!\u201d said Henchard. \u201cI am not going to let her know the truth. Her mother and I be going to marry again; and it will not only help us to keep our child\u2019s respect, but it will be more proper. Susan looks upon herself as the sailor\u2019s widow, and won\u2019t think o\u2019 living with me as formerly without another religious ceremony\u2014and she\u2019s right.\u201d Farfrae thereupon said no more. The letter to the young Jersey woman was carefully framed by him, and the interview ended, Henchard saying, as the Scotchman left, \u201cI feel it a great relief, Farfrae, to tell some friend o\u2019 this! You see now that the Mayor of Casterbridge is not so thriving in his mind as it seems he might be from the state of his pocket.\u201d \u201cI do. And I\u2019m sorry for ye!\u201d said Farfrae. When he was gone Henchard copied the letter, and, enclosing a cheque, took it to the post-office, from which he walked back thoughtfully."], "Why does Henchardtake such a strong and immediate liking to Donald Farfrae?": [" She saw that Donald and Mr. Henchard were inseparables. When walking together Henchard would lay his arm familiarly on his manager\u2019s shoulder, as if Farfrae were a younger brother, bearing so heavily that his slight frame bent under the weight. Occasionally she would hear a perfect cannonade of laughter from Henchard, arising from something Donald had said, the latter looking quite innocent and not laughing at all. In Henchard\u2019s somewhat lonely life he evidently found the young man as desirable for comradeship as he was useful for consultations. Donald\u2019s brightness of intellect maintained in the corn-factor the admiration it had won at the first hour of their meeting. The poor opinion, and but ill-concealed, that he entertained of the slim Farfrae\u2019s physical girth, strength, and dash was more than counterbalanced by the immense respect he had for his brains. Her quiet eye discerned that Henchard\u2019s tigerish affection for the younger man, his constant liking to have Farfrae near him, now and then resulted in a tendency to domineer, which, however, was checked in a moment when Donald exhibited marks of real offence. One day, looking down on their figures from on high, she heard the latter remark, as they stood in the doorway between the garden and yard, that their habit of walking and driving about together rather neutralized Farfrae\u2019s value as a second pair of eyes, which should be used in places where the principal was not.", " Well, before I go, let me ask this: Though you are not the young man I thought you were, what\u2019s the difference? Can\u2019t ye stay just the same? Have you really made up your mind about this American notion? I won\u2019t mince matters. I feel you would be invaluable to me\u2014that needn\u2019t be said\u2014and if you will bide and be my manager, I will make it worth your while.\u201d \u201cMy plans are fixed,\u201d said the young man, in negative tones. \u201cI have formed a scheme, and so we need na say any more about it. But will you not drink with me, sir? I find this Casterbridge ale warreming to the stomach.\u201d \u201cNo, no; I fain would, but I can\u2019t,\u201d said Henchard gravely, the scraping of his chair informing the listeners that he was rising to leave. \u201cWhen I was a young man I went in for that sort of thing too strong\u2014far too strong\u2014and was well-nigh ruined by it! I did a deed on account of it which I shall be ashamed of to my dying day. It made such an impression on me that I swore, there and then, that I\u2019d drink nothing stronger than tea for as many years as I was old that day. I have kept my oath; and though, Farfrae, I am sometimes that dry in the dog days that I could drink a quarter-barrel to the pitching, I think o\u2019 my oath, and touch no strong drink at all.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll no\u2019 press ye, sir\u2014I\u2019ll no\u2019 press ye. I respect your vow.\u201d \u201cWell, I shall get a manager somewhere, no doubt,\u201d said Henchard, with strong feeling in his tones.", " His presence here seemed to explain Lucetta\u2019s walk that way. Donald saw her, drew up, and was hastily made acquainted with what had occurred. At Elizabeth-Jane mentioning how greatly Lucetta had been jeopardized, he exhibited an agitation different in kind no less than in intensity from any she had seen in him before. He became so absorbed in the circumstance that he scarcely had sufficient knowledge of what he was doing to think of helping her up beside him. \u201cShe has gone on with Mr. Henchard, you say?\u201d he inquired at last. \u201cYes. He is taking her home. They are almost there by this time.\u201d \u201cAnd you are sure she can get home?\u201d Elizabeth-Jane was quite sure. \u201cYour stepfather saved her?\u201d \u201cEntirely.\u201d Farfrae checked his horse\u2019s pace; she guessed why. He was thinking that it would be best not to intrude on the other two just now. Henchard had saved Lucetta, and to provoke a possible exhibition of her deeper affection for himself was as ungenerous as it was unwise. The immediate subject of their talk being exhausted she felt more embarrassed at sitting thus beside her past lover; but soon the two figures of the others were visible at the entrance to the town. The face of the woman was frequently turned back, but Farfrae did not whip on the horse. When these reached the town walls Henchard and his companion had disappeared down the street; Farfrae set down Elizabeth-Jane on her expressing a particular wish to alight there, and drove round to the stables at the back of his lodgings.", " While leaning thus upon the parapet his listless attention was awakened by sounds of an unaccustomed kind from the town quarter. They were a confusion of rhythmical noises, to which the streets added yet more confusion by encumbering them with echoes. His first incurious thought that the clangour arose from the town band, engaged in an attempt to round off a memorable day in a burst of evening harmony, was contradicted by certain peculiarities of reverberation. But inexplicability did not rouse him to more than a cursory heed; his sense of degradation was too strong for the admission of foreign ideas; and he leant against the parapet as before. XXXIX. When Farfrae descended out of the loft breathless from his encounter with Henchard, he paused at the bottom to recover himself. He arrived at the yard with the intention of putting the horse into the gig himself (all the men having a holiday), and driving to a village on the Budmouth Road. Despite the fearful struggle he decided still to persevere in his journey, so as to recover himself before going indoors and meeting the eyes of Lucetta. He wished to consider his course in a case so serious. When he was just on the point of driving off Whittle arrived with a note badly addressed, and bearing the word \u201cimmediate\u201d upon the outside. On opening it he was surprised to see that it was unsigned. It contained a brief request that he would go to Weatherbury that evening about some business which he was conducting there."], "Who had Henchardarranged to hire as his business manager before meeting Farfrae?": [" X. While she still sat under the Scotchman\u2019s eyes a man came up to the door, reaching it as Henchard opened the door of the inner office to admit Elizabeth. The newcomer stepped forward like the quicker cripple at Bethesda, and entered in her stead. She could hear his words to Henchard: \u201cJoshua Jopp, sir\u2014by appointment\u2014the new manager.\u201d \u201cThe new manager!\u2014he\u2019s in his office,\u201d said Henchard bluntly. \u201cIn his office!\u201d said the man, with a stultified air. \u201cI mentioned Thursday,\u201d said Henchard; \u201cand as you did not keep your appointment, I have engaged another manager. At first I thought he must be you. Do you think I can wait when business is in question?\u201d \u201cYou said Thursday or Saturday, sir,\u201d said the newcomer, pulling out a letter. \u201cWell, you are too late,\u201d said the corn-factor. \u201cI can say no more.\u201d \u201cYou as good as engaged me,\u201d murmured the man. \u201cSubject to an interview,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cI am sorry for you\u2014very sorry indeed. But it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d There was no more to be said, and the man came out, encountering Elizabeth-Jane in his passage. She could see that his mouth twitched with anger, and that bitter disappointment was written in his face everywhere. Elizabeth-Jane now entered, and stood before the master of the premises. His dark pupils\u2014which always seemed to have a red spark of light in them, though this could hardly be a physical fact\u2014turned indifferently round under his dark brows until they rested on her figure.", " XVI. On this account Henchard\u2019s manner towards Farfrae insensibly became more reserved. He was courteous\u2014too courteous\u2014and Farfrae was quite surprised at the good breeding which now for the first time showed itself among the qualities of a man he had hitherto thought undisciplined, if warm and sincere. The corn-factor seldom or never again put his arm upon the young man\u2019s shoulder so as to nearly weigh him down with the pressure of mechanized friendship. He left off coming to Donald\u2019s lodgings and shouting into the passage. \u201cHoy, Farfrae, boy, come and have some dinner with us! Don\u2019t sit here in solitary confinement!\u201d But in the daily routine of their business there was little change. Thus their lives rolled on till a day of public rejoicing was suggested to the country at large in celebration of a national event that had recently taken place. For some time Casterbridge, by nature slow, made no response. Then one day Donald Farfrae broached the subject to Henchard by asking if he would have any objection to lend some rick-cloths to himself and a few others, who contemplated getting up an entertainment of some sort on the day named, and required a shelter for the same, to which they might charge admission at the rate of so much a head. \u201cHave as many cloths as you like,\u201d Henchard replied. When his manager had gone about the business Henchard was fired with emulation. It certainly had been very remiss of him, as Mayor, he thought, to call no meeting ere this, to discuss what should be done on this holiday.", " She saw that Donald and Mr. Henchard were inseparables. When walking together Henchard would lay his arm familiarly on his manager\u2019s shoulder, as if Farfrae were a younger brother, bearing so heavily that his slight frame bent under the weight.

Would Mr. Farfrae stay in Casterbridge despite his words and her father\u2019s dismissal? His occult breathings to her might be solvable by his course in that respect. The next day was windy\u2014so windy that walking in the garden she picked up a portion of the draft of a letter on business in Donald Farfrae\u2019s writing, which had flown over the wall from the office. The useless scrap she took indoors, and began to copy the calligraphy, which she much admired. The letter began \u201cDear Sir,\u201d and presently writing on a loose slip \u201cElizabeth-Jane,\u201d she laid the latter over \u201cSir,\u201d making the phrase \u201cDear Elizabeth-Jane.\u201d When she saw the effect a quick red ran up her face and warmed her through, though nobody was there to see what she had done. She quickly tore up the slip, and threw it away. After this she grew cool and laughed at herself, walked about the room, and laughed again; not joyfully, but distressfully rather. It was quickly known in Casterbridge that Farfrae and Henchard had decided to dispense with each other. Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s anxiety to know if Farfrae were going away from the town reached a pitch that disturbed her, for she could no longer conceal from herself the cause."], "How does Hencharddeal with Abel Whittle\u2019s failure to report to work on time?": [" \u201cNow, I shall twitch like a moment-hand all night to-night for fear o\u2019 him!\u201d The journey to be taken by the waggons next day was a long one into Blackmoor Vale, and at four o\u2019clock lanterns were moving about the yard. But Abel was missing. Before either of the other men could run to Abel\u2019s and warn him Henchard appeared in the garden doorway. \u201cWhere\u2019s Abel Whittle? Not come after all I\u2019ve said? Now I\u2019ll carry out my word, by my blessed fathers\u2014nothing else will do him any good! I\u2019m going up that way.\u201d Henchard went off, entered Abel\u2019s house, a little cottage in Back Street, the door of which was never locked because the inmates had nothing to lose. Reaching Whittle\u2019s bedside the corn-factor shouted a bass note so vigorously that Abel started up instantly, and beholding Henchard standing over him, was galvanized into spasmodic movements which had not much relation to getting on his clothes. \u201cOut of bed, sir, and off to the granary, or you leave my employ to-day! \u2019Tis to teach ye a lesson. March on; never mind your breeches!\u201d The unhappy Whittle threw on his sleeve waistcoat, and managed to get into his boots at the bottom of the stairs, while Henchard thrust his hat over his head. Whittle then trotted on down Back Street, Henchard walking sternly behind. Just at this time Farfrae, who had been to Henchard\u2019s house to look for him, came out of the back gate, and saw something white fluttering in the morning gloom, which he soon perceived to be part of Abel\u2019s shirt that showed below his waistcoat.", " And yet the seed that was to lift the foundation of this friendship was at that moment taking root in a chink of its structure. It was about six o\u2019clock; the men were dropping off homeward one by one. The last to leave was a round-shouldered, blinking young man of nineteen or twenty, whose mouth fell ajar on the slightest provocation, seemingly because there was no chin to support it. Henchard called aloud to him as he went out of the gate, \u201cHere\u2014Abel Whittle!\u201d Whittle turned, and ran back a few steps. \u201cYes, sir,\u201d he said, in breathless deprecation, as if he knew what was coming next. \u201cOnce more\u2014be in time to-morrow morning. You see what\u2019s to be done, and you hear what I say, and you know I\u2019m not going to be trifled with any longer.\u201d \u201cYes, sir.\u201d Then Abel Whittle left, and Henchard and Farfrae; and Elizabeth saw no more of them. Now there was good reason for this command on Henchard\u2019s part. Poor Abel, as he was called, had an inveterate habit of over-sleeping himself and coming late to his work. His anxious will was to be among the earliest; but if his comrades omitted to pull the string that he always tied round his great toe and left hanging out the window for that purpose, his will was as wind. He did not arrive in time. As he was often second hand at the hay-weighing, or at the crane which lifted the sacks, or was one of those who had to accompany the waggons into the country to fetch away stacks that had been purchased, this affliction of Abel\u2019s was productive of much inconvenience.", " For two mornings in the present week he had kept the others waiting nearly an hour; hence Henchard\u2019s threat. It now remained to be seen what would happen to-morrow. Six o\u2019clock struck, and there was no Whittle. At half-past six Henchard entered the yard; the waggon was horsed that Abel was to accompany; and the other man had been waiting twenty minutes. Then Henchard swore, and Whittle coming up breathless at that instant, the corn-factor turned on him, and declared with an oath that this was the last time; that if he were behind once more, by God, he would come and drag him out o\u2019 bed. \u201cThere is sommit wrong in my make, your worshipful!\u201d said Abel, \u201cespecially in the inside, whereas my poor dumb brain gets as dead as a clot afore I\u2019ve said my few scrags of prayers. Yes\u2014it came on as a stripling, just afore I\u2019d got man\u2019s wages, whereas I never enjoy my bed at all, for no sooner do I lie down than I be asleep, and afore I be awake I be up. I\u2019ve fretted my gizzard green about it, maister, but what can I do? Now last night, afore I went to bed, I only had a scantling o\u2019 cheese and\u2014\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it!\u201d roared Henchard. \u201cTo-morrow the waggons must start at four, and if you\u2019re not here, stand clear. I\u2019ll mortify thy flesh for thee!\u201d \u201cBut let me clear up my points, your worshipful\u2014\u2014\u201d Henchard turned away. \u201cHe asked me and he questioned me, and then \u2019a wouldn\u2019t hear my points!\u201d said Abel, to the yard in general.", " \u201cFor maircy\u2019s sake, what object\u2019s this?\u201d said Farfrae, following Abel into the yard, Henchard being some way in the rear by this time. \u201cYe see, Mr. Farfrae,\u201d gibbered Abel with a resigned smile of terror, \u201che said he\u2019d mortify my flesh if so be I didn\u2019t get up sooner, and now he\u2019s a-doing on\u2019t! Ye see it can\u2019t be helped, Mr. Farfrae; things do happen queer sometimes! Yes\u2014I\u2019ll go to Blackmoor Vale half naked as I be, since he do command; but I shall kill myself afterwards; I can\u2019t outlive the disgrace, for the women-folk will be looking out of their winders at my mortification all the way along, and laughing me to scorn as a man \u2019ithout breeches! You know how I feel such things, Maister Farfrae, and how forlorn thoughts get hold upon me. Yes\u2014I shall do myself harm\u2014I feel it coming on!\u201d \u201cGet back home, and slip on your breeches, and come to wark like a man! If ye go not, you\u2019ll ha\u2019e your death standing there!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m afeard I mustn\u2019t! Mr. Henchard said\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care what Mr. Henchard said, nor anybody else! \u2019Tis simple foolishness to do this. Go and dress yourself instantly Whittle.\u201d \u201cHullo, hullo!\u201d said Henchard, coming up behind. \u201cWho\u2019s sending him back?\u201d All the men looked towards Farfrae. \u201cI am,\u201d said Donald. \u201cI say this joke has been carried far enough.\u201d \u201cAnd I say it hasn\u2019t! Get up in the waggon, Whittle.\u201d \u201cNot if I am manager,\u201d said Farfrae. \u201cHe either goes home, or I march out of this yard for good.\u201d Henchard looked at him with a face stern and red."], "How is the \u201cdayof public rejoicing\u201d that Henchard arranges thwarted?": [" XVI. On this account Henchard\u2019s manner towards Farfrae insensibly became more reserved. He was courteous\u2014too courteous\u2014and Farfrae was quite surprised at the good breeding which now for the first time showed itself among the qualities of a man he had hitherto thought undisciplined, if warm and sincere.

When his manager had gone about the business Henchard was fired with emulation. It certainly had been very remiss of him, as Mayor, he thought, to call no meeting ere this, to discuss what should be done on this holiday.", " And thus Henchard found himself again on the precise standing which he had occupied a quarter of a century before. Externally there was nothing to hinder his making another start on the upward slope, and by his new lights achieving higher things than his soul in its half-formed state had been able to accomplish. But the ingenious machinery contrived by the Gods for reducing human possibilities of amelioration to a minimum\u2014which arranges that wisdom to do shall come _pari passu_ with the departure of zest for doing\u2014stood in the way of all that. He had no wish to make an arena a second time of a world that had become a mere painted scene to him. Very often, as his hay-knife crunched down among the sweet-smelling grassy stems, he would survey mankind and say to himself: \u201cHere and everywhere be folk dying before their time like frosted leaves, though wanted by their families, the country, and the world; while I, an outcast, an encumberer of the ground, wanted by nobody, and despised by all, live on against my will!\u201d He often kept an eager ear upon the conversation of those who passed along the road\u2014not from a general curiosity by any means\u2014but in the hope that among these travellers between Casterbridge and London some would, sooner or later, speak of the former place. The distance, however, was too great to lend much probability to his desire; and the highest result of his attention to wayside words was that he did indeed hear the name \u201cCasterbridge\u201d uttered one day by the driver of a road-waggon.", " \u201cElizabeth, come here!\u201d said Henchard; and she obeyed. \u201cWhy do you lower yourself so confoundedly?\u201d he said with suppressed passion. \u201cHaven\u2019t I told you o\u2019t fifty times? Hey? Making yourself a drudge for a common workwoman of such a character as hers! Why, ye\u2019ll disgrace me to the dust!\u201d Now these words were uttered loud enough to reach Nance inside the barn door, who fired up immediately at the slur upon her personal character. Coming to the door she cried regardless of consequences, \u201cCome to that, Mr. Henchard, I can let \u2019ee know she\u2019ve waited on worse!\u201d \u201cThen she must have had more charity than sense,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cO no, she hadn\u2019t. \u2019Twere not for charity but for hire; and at a public-house in this town!\u201d \u201cIt is not true!\u201d cried Henchard indignantly. \u201cJust ask her,\u201d said Nance, folding her naked arms in such a manner that she could comfortably scratch her elbows. Henchard glanced at Elizabeth-Jane, whose complexion, now pink and white from confinement, lost nearly all of the former colour. \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d he said to her. \u201cAnything or nothing?\u201d \u201cIt is true,\u201d said Elizabeth-Jane. \u201cBut it was only\u2014\u201d \u201cDid you do it, or didn\u2019t you? Where was it?\u201d \u201cAt the Three Mariners; one evening for a little while, when we were staying there.\u201d Nance glanced triumphantly at Henchard, and sailed into the barn; for assuming that she was to be discharged on the instant she had resolved to make the most of her victory.", " It is not for myself I want it, but for our unlucky fellow-townsman Henchard. It would be a new beginning for him, if a small one; and I have told the Council that I would head a private subscription among them to set him up in it\u2014that I would be fifty pounds, if they would make up the other fifty among them.\u201d \u201cYes, yes; so I\u2019ve heard; and there\u2019s nothing to say against it for that matter,\u201d the town-clerk replied, in his plain, frank way. \u201cBut, Farfrae, others see what you don\u2019t. Henchard hates \u2019ee\u2014ay, hates \u2019ee; and \u2019tis right that you should know it. To my knowledge he was at the Three Mariners last night, saying in public that about you which a man ought not to say about another.\u201d \u201cIs that so\u2014ah, is that so?\u201d said Farfrae, looking down. \u201cWhy should he do it?\u201d added the young man bitterly; \u201cwhat harm have I done him that he should try to wrong me?\u201d \u201cGod only knows,\u201d said Joyce, lifting his eyebrows. \u201cIt shows much long-suffering in you to put up with him, and keep him in your employ.\u201d \u201cBut I cannet discharge a man who was once a good friend to me. How can I forget that when I came here \u2019twas he enabled me to make a footing for mysel\u2019? No, no. As long as I\u2019ve a day\u2019s work to offer he shall do it if he chooses. \u2019Tis not I who will deny him such a little as that. But I\u2019ll drop the idea of establishing him in a shop till I can think more about it.\u201d It grieved Farfrae much to give up this scheme."], "Why does Susaninsist on keeping hidden the fact that Elizabeth-Jane does choresin exchange for a room at the inn?": [" Henchard went home. The morning having now fully broke he lit his fire, and sat abstractedly beside it. He had not sat there long when a gentle footstep approached the house and entered the passage, a finger tapping lightly at the door. Henchard\u2019s face brightened, for he knew the motions to be Elizabeth\u2019s. She came into his room, looking wan and sad. \u201cHave you heard?\u201d she asked. \u201cMrs. Farfrae! She is\u2014dead! Yes, indeed\u2014about an hour ago!\u201d \u201cI know it,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cI have but lately come in from there. It is so very good of \u2019ee, Elizabeth, to come and tell me. You must be so tired out, too, with sitting up. Now do you bide here with me this morning. You can go and rest in the other room; and I will call \u2019ee when breakfast is ready.\u201d To please him, and herself\u2014for his recent kindliness was winning a surprised gratitude from the lonely girl\u2014she did as he bade her, and lay down on a sort of couch which Henchard had rigged up out of a settle in the adjoining room. She could hear him moving about in his preparations; but her mind ran most strongly on Lucetta, whose death in such fulness of life and amid such cheerful hopes of maternity was appallingly unexpected. Presently she fell asleep. Meanwhile her stepfather in the outer room had set the breakfast in readiness; but finding that she dozed he would not call her; he waited on, looking into the fire and keeping the kettle boiling with house-wifely care, as if it were an honour to have her in his house.", " The inn called Peter\u2019s Finger was the church of Mixen Lane. It was centrally situate, as such places should be, and bore about the same social relation to the Three Mariners as the latter bore to the King\u2019s Arms. At first sight the inn was so respectable as to be puzzling. The front door was kept shut, and the step was so clean that evidently but few persons entered over its sanded surface. But at the corner of the public-house was an alley, a mere slit, dividing it from the next building. Half-way up the alley was a narrow door, shiny and paintless from the rub of infinite hands and shoulders. This was the actual entrance to the inn. A pedestrian would be seen abstractedly passing along Mixen Lane; and then, in a moment, he would vanish, causing the gazer to blink like Ashton at the disappearance of Ravenswood. That abstracted pedestrian had edged into the slit by the adroit fillip of his person sideways; from the slit he edged into the tavern by a similar exercise of skill. The company at the Three Mariners were persons of quality in comparison with the company which gathered here; though it must be admitted that the lowest fringe of the Mariner\u2019s party touched the crest of Peter\u2019s at points. Waifs and strays of all sorts loitered about here. The landlady was a virtuous woman who years ago had been unjustly sent to gaol as an accessory to something or other after the fact. She underwent her twelvemonth, and had worn a martyr\u2019s countenance ever since, except at times of meeting the constable who apprehended her, when she winked her eye.", " \u201cWe must get a place to lie down in,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI have seen\u2014Mr. Henchard; and that\u2019s all I wanted to do.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s enough for to-night, at any rate,\u201d Elizabeth-Jane replied soothingly. \u201cWe can think to-morrow what is best to do about him. The question now is\u2014is it not?\u2014how shall we find a lodging?\u201d As her mother did not reply Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s mind reverted to the words of the waiter, that the Three Mariners was an inn of moderate charges. A recommendation good for one person was probably good for another. \u201cLet\u2019s go where the young man has gone to,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is respectable. What do you say?\u201d Her mother assented, and down the street they went. In the meantime the Mayor\u2019s thoughtfulness, engendered by the note as stated, continued to hold him in abstraction; till, whispering to his neighbour to take his place, he found opportunity to leave the chair. This was just after the departure of his wife and Elizabeth. Outside the door of the assembly-room he saw the waiter, and beckoning to him asked who had brought the note which had been handed in a quarter of an hour before. \u201cA young man, sir\u2014a sort of traveller. He was a Scotchman seemingly.\u201d \u201cDid he say how he had got it?\u201d \u201cHe wrote it himself, sir, as he stood outside the window.\u201d \u201cOh\u2014wrote it himself.... Is the young man in the hotel?\u201d \u201cNo, sir. He went to the Three Mariners, I believe.\u201d The mayor walked up and down the vestibule of the hotel with his hands under his coat tails, as if he were merely seeking a cooler atmosphere than that of the room he had quitted.", " The good stabling and the good ale of the Mariners, though somewhat difficult to reach on account of there being but this narrow way to both, were nevertheless perseveringly sought out by the sagacious old heads who knew what was what in Casterbridge. Henchard stood without the inn for a few instants; then lowering the dignity of his presence as much as possible by buttoning the brown holland coat over his shirt-front, and in other ways toning himself down to his ordinary everyday appearance, he entered the inn door. VII. Elizabeth-Jane and her mother had arrived some twenty minutes earlier. Outside the house they had stood and considered whether even this homely place, though recommended as moderate, might not be too serious in its prices for their light pockets. Finally, however, they had found courage to enter, and duly met Stannidge the landlord, a silent man, who drew and carried frothing measures to this room and to that, shoulder to shoulder with his waiting-maids\u2014a stately slowness, however, entering into his ministrations by contrast with theirs, as became one whose service was somewhat optional. It would have been altogether optional but for the orders of the landlady, a person who sat in the bar, corporeally motionless, but with a flitting eye and quick ear, with which she observed and heard through the open door and hatchway the pressing needs of customers whom her husband overlooked though close at hand."], "In a letter writtenon her deathbed, what does Susan confess to her husband?": [" The seal had cracked, and the letter was open. Henchard had no reason to suppose the restriction one of serious weight, and his feeling for his late wife had not been of the nature of deep respect. \u201cSome trifling fancy or other of poor Susan\u2019s, I suppose,\u201d he said; and without curiosity he allowed his eyes to scan the letter:\u2014 MY DEAR MICHAEL,\u2014For the good of all three of us I have kept one thing a secret from you till now. I hope you will understand why; I think you will; though perhaps you may not forgive me. But, dear Michael, I have done it for the best. I shall be in my grave when you read this, and Elizabeth-Jane will have a home. Don\u2019t curse me Mike\u2014think of how I was situated. I can hardly write it, but here it is. Elizabeth-Jane is not your Elizabeth-Jane\u2014the child who was in my arms when you sold me. No; she died three months after that, and this living one is my other husband\u2019s. I christened her by the same name we had given to the first, and she filled up the ache I felt at the other\u2019s loss. Michael, I am dying, and I might have held my tongue; but I could not. Tell her husband of this or not, as you may judge; and forgive, if you can, a woman you once deeply wronged, as she forgives you. SUSAN HENCHARD Her husband regarded the paper as if it were a window-pane through which he saw for miles. His lips twitched, and he seemed to compress his frame, as if to bear better.", " I\u2019m so bad at letters.\u201d \u201cAnd I will.\u201d \u201cNow, I haven\u2019t told you quite all yet. My wife Susan has my daughter with her\u2014the baby that was in her arms at the fair; and this girl knows nothing of me beyond that I am some sort of relation by marriage. She has grown up in the belief that the sailor to whom I made over her mother, and who is now dead, was her father, and her mother\u2019s husband. What her mother has always felt, she and I together feel now\u2014that we can\u2019t proclaim our disgrace to the girl by letting her know the truth. Now what would you do?\u2014I want your advice.\u201d \u201cI think I\u2019d run the risk, and tell her the truth. She\u2019ll forgive ye both.\u201d \u201cNever!\u201d said Henchard. \u201cI am not going to let her know the truth. Her mother and I be going to marry again; and it will not only help us to keep our child\u2019s respect, but it will be more proper. Susan looks upon herself as the sailor\u2019s widow, and won\u2019t think o\u2019 living with me as formerly without another religious ceremony\u2014and she\u2019s right.\u201d Farfrae thereupon said no more. The letter to the young Jersey woman was carefully framed by him, and the interview ended, Henchard saying, as the Scotchman left, \u201cI feel it a great relief, Farfrae, to tell some friend o\u2019 this! You see now that the Mayor of Casterbridge is not so thriving in his mind as it seems he might be from the state of his pocket.\u201d \u201cI do. And I\u2019m sorry for ye!\u201d said Farfrae. When he was gone Henchard copied the letter, and, enclosing a cheque, took it to the post-office, from which he walked back thoughtfully.", " Henchard unfolded another letter, and read it through likewise, stopping at the subscription as before. \u201cHer name I don\u2019t give,\u201d he said blandly. \u201cAs I didn\u2019t marry her, and another man did, I can scarcely do that in fairness to her.\u201d \u201cTr-rue, tr-rue,\u201d said Farfrae. \u201cBut why didn\u2019t you marry her when your wife Susan died?\u201d Farfrae asked this and the other questions in the comfortably indifferent tone of one whom the matter very remotely concerned. \u201cAh\u2014well you may ask that!\u201d said Henchard, the new-moon-shaped grin adumbrating itself again upon his mouth. \u201cIn spite of all her protestations, when I came forward to do so, as in generosity bound, she was not the woman for me.\u201d \u201cShe had already married another\u2014maybe?\u201d Henchard seemed to think it would be sailing too near the wind to descend further into particulars, and he answered \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cThe young lady must have had a heart that bore transplanting very readily!\u201d \u201cShe had, she had,\u201d said Henchard emphatically. He opened a third and fourth letter, and read. This time he approached the conclusion as if the signature were indeed coming with the rest. But again he stopped short. The truth was that, as may be divined, he had quite intended to effect a grand catastrophe at the end of this drama by reading out the name, he had come to the house with no other thought. But sitting here in cold blood he could not do it. Such a wrecking of hearts appalled even him.", " \u201cIf they don\u2019t take her for that, in ten seconds they\u2019ll have to give more,\u201d said the husband. \u201cVery well. Now auctioneer, add another.\u201d \u201cThree guineas\u2014going for three guineas!\u201d said the rheumy man. \u201cNo bid?\u201d said the husband. \u201cGood Lord, why she\u2019s cost me fifty times the money, if a penny. Go on.\u201d \u201cFour guineas!\u201d cried the auctioneer. \u201cI\u2019ll tell ye what\u2014I won\u2019t sell her for less than five,\u201d said the husband, bringing down his fist so that the basins danced. \u201cI\u2019ll sell her for five guineas to any man that will pay me the money, and treat her well; and he shall have her for ever, and never hear aught o\u2019 me. But she shan\u2019t go for less. Now then\u2014five guineas\u2014and she\u2019s yours. Susan, you agree?\u201d She bowed her head with absolute indifference. \u201cFive guineas,\u201d said the auctioneer, \u201cor she\u2019ll be withdrawn. Do anybody give it? The last time. Yes or no?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said a loud voice from the doorway. All eyes were turned. Standing in the triangular opening which formed the door of the tent was a sailor, who, unobserved by the rest, had arrived there within the last two or three minutes. A dead silence followed his affirmation. \u201cYou say you do?\u201d asked the husband, staring at him. \u201cI say so,\u201d replied the sailor. \u201cSaying is one thing, and paying is another. Where\u2019s the money?\u201d The sailor hesitated a moment, looked anew at the woman, came in, unfolded five crisp pieces of paper, and threw them down upon the tablecloth."], "Why does Henchardagree to remarry Susan rather than pursue his affair with Lucetta?": [" His well-known haughty indifference to the society of womankind, his silent avoidance of converse with the sex, contributed a piquancy to what would otherwise have been an unromantic matter enough. That such a poor fragile woman should be his choice was inexplicable, except on the ground that the engagement was a family affair in which sentimental passion had no place; for it was known that they were related in some way. Mrs. Henchard was so pale that the boys called her \u201cThe Ghost.\u201d Sometimes Henchard overheard this epithet when they passed together along the Walks\u2014as the avenues on the walls were named\u2014at which his face would darken with an expression of destructiveness towards the speakers ominous to see; but he said nothing. He pressed on the preparations for his union, or rather reunion, with this pale creature in a dogged, unflinching spirit which did credit to his conscientiousness. Nobody would have conceived from his outward demeanour that there was no amatory fire or pulse of romance acting as stimulant to the bustle going on in his gaunt, great house; nothing but three large resolves\u2014one, to make amends to his neglected Susan, another, to provide a comfortable home for Elizabeth-Jane under his paternal eye; and a third, to castigate himself with the thorns which these restitutory acts brought in their train; among them the lowering of his dignity in public opinion by marrying so comparatively humble a woman.", " Still, I wouldn\u2019t call in a hurry, because\u2014well, you can guess how this money you\u2019ve come into made me feel.\u201d His voice slowly fell; he was conscious that in this room his accents and manner wore a roughness not observable in the street. He looked about the room at the novel hangings and ingenious furniture with which she had surrounded herself. \u201cUpon my life I didn\u2019t know such furniture as this could be bought in Casterbridge,\u201d he said. \u201cNor can it be,\u201d said she. \u201cNor will it till fifty years more of civilization have passed over the town. It took a waggon and four horses to get it here.\u201d \u201cH\u2019m. It looks as if you were living on capital.\u201d \u201cO no, I am not.\u201d \u201cSo much the better. But the fact is, your setting up like this makes my beaming towards you rather awkward.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d An answer was not really needed, and he did not furnish one. \u201cWell,\u201d he went on, \u201cthere\u2019s nobody in the world I would have wished to see enter into this wealth before you, Lucetta, and nobody, I am sure, who will become it more.\u201d He turned to her with congratulatory admiration so fervid that she shrank somewhat, notwithstanding that she knew him so well. \u201cI am greatly obliged to you for all that,\u201d said she, rather with an air of speaking ritual. The stint of reciprocal feeling was perceived, and Henchard showed chagrin at once\u2014nobody was more quick to show that than he. \u201cYou may be obliged or not for\u2019t. Though the things I say may not have the polish of what you\u2019ve lately learnt to expect for the first time in your life, they are real, my lady Lucetta.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s rather a rude way of speaking to me,\u201d pouted Lucetta, with stormy eyes.", " \u201cYou hear, Susan?\u2014I don\u2019t drink now\u2014I haven\u2019t since that night.\u201d Those were his first words. He felt her bow her head in acknowledgment that she understood. After a minute or two he again began: \u201cIf I had known you were living, Susan! But there was every reason to suppose you and the child were dead and gone. I took every possible step to find you\u2014travelled\u2014advertised. My opinion at last was that you had started for some colony with that man, and had been drowned on your voyage. Why did you keep silent like this?\u201d \u201cO Michael! because of him\u2014what other reason could there be? I thought I owed him faithfulness to the end of one of our lives\u2014foolishly I believed there was something solemn and binding in the bargain; I thought that even in honour I dared not desert him when he had paid so much for me in good faith. I meet you now only as his widow\u2014I consider myself that, and that I have no claim upon you. Had he not died I should never have come\u2014never! Of that you may be sure.\u201d \u201cTut-tut! How could you be so simple?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. Yet it would have been very wicked\u2014if I had not thought like that!\u201d said Susan, almost crying. \u201cYes\u2014yes\u2014so it would. It is only that which makes me feel \u2019ee an innocent woman. But\u2014to lead me into this!\u201d \u201cWhat, Michael?\u201d she asked, alarmed. \u201cWhy, this difficulty about our living together again, and Elizabeth-Jane. She cannot be told all\u2014she would so despise us both that\u2014I could not bear it!\u201d \u201cThat was why she was brought up in ignorance of you.", " She steadily refused to have anything to do with the affair, and cutting him short, because of her anxiety to get indoors before her husband should miss her, left him on the pavement. He watched her till she had vanished, and then went home. When he got there he sat down in the fireless chimney corner looking at the iron dogs, and the wood laid across them for heating the morning kettle. A movement upstairs disturbed him, and Henchard came down from his bedroom, where he seemed to have been rummaging boxes. \u201cI wish,\u201d said Henchard, \u201cyou would do me a service, Jopp, now\u2014to-night, I mean, if you can. Leave this at Mrs. Farfrae\u2019s for her. I should take it myself, of course, but I don\u2019t wish to be seen there.\u201d He handed a package in brown paper, sealed. Henchard had been as good as his word. Immediately on coming indoors he had searched over his few belongings, and every scrap of Lucetta\u2019s writing that he possessed was here. Jopp indifferently expressed his willingness. \u201cWell, how have ye got on to-day?\u201d his lodger asked. \u201cAny prospect of an opening?\u201d \u201cI am afraid not,\u201d said Jopp, who had not told the other of his application to Farfrae. \u201cThere never will be in Casterbridge,\u201d declared Henchard decisively. \u201cYou must roam further afield.\u201d He said goodnight to Jopp, and returned to his own part of the house. Jopp sat on till his eyes were attracted by the shadow of the candle-snuff on the wall, and looking at the original he found that it had formed itself into a head like a red-hot cauliflower."], "Why does Henchardretract his demand that Farfrae no longer court Elizabeth-Jane?": [" Elizabeth, that silent observing woman, had long noted how he was rising in favour among the townspeople; and knowing Henchard\u2019s nature now she had feared that Farfrae\u2019s days as manager were numbered, so that the announcement gave her little surprise. Would Mr. Farfrae stay in Casterbridge despite his words and her father\u2019s dismissal? His occult breathings to her might be solvable by his course in that respect. The next day was windy\u2014so windy that walking in the garden she picked up a portion of the draft of a letter on business in Donald Farfrae\u2019s writing, which had flown over the wall from the office. The useless scrap she took indoors, and began to copy the calligraphy, which she much admired. The letter began \u201cDear Sir,\u201d and presently writing on a loose slip \u201cElizabeth-Jane,\u201d she laid the latter over \u201cSir,\u201d making the phrase \u201cDear Elizabeth-Jane.\u201d When she saw the effect a quick red ran up her face and warmed her through, though nobody was there to see what she had done. She quickly tore up the slip, and threw it away. After this she grew cool and laughed at herself, walked about the room, and laughed again; not joyfully, but distressfully rather. It was quickly known in Casterbridge that Farfrae and Henchard had decided to dispense with each other. Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s anxiety to know if Farfrae were going away from the town reached a pitch that disturbed her, for she could no longer conceal from herself the cause.", " They were Bank-of-England notes for five pounds. Upon the face of this he clinked down the shillings severally\u2014one, two, three, four, five. The sight of real money in full amount, in answer to a challenge for the same till then deemed slightly hypothetical had a great effect upon the spectators. Their eyes became riveted upon the faces of the chief actors, and then upon the notes as they lay, weighted by the shillings, on the table. Up to this moment it could not positively have been asserted that the man, in spite of his tantalizing declaration, was really in earnest. The spectators had indeed taken the proceedings throughout as a piece of mirthful irony carried to extremes; and had assumed that, being out of work, he was, as a consequence, out of temper with the world, and society, and his nearest kin. But with the demand and response of real cash the jovial frivolity of the scene departed. A lurid colour seemed to fill the tent, and change the aspect of all therein. The mirth-wrinkles left the listeners\u2019 faces, and they waited with parting lips. \u201cNow,\u201d said the woman, breaking the silence, so that her low dry voice sounded quite loud, \u201cbefore you go further, Michael, listen to me. If you touch that money, I and this girl go with the man. Mind, it is a joke no longer.\u201d \u201cA joke? Of course it is not a joke!\u201d shouted her husband, his resentment rising at her suggestion. \u201cI take the money; the sailor takes you.", " \u201cI can think of no other as my father, except my father.\u201d Henchard\u2019s wife was dissevered from him by death; his friend and helper Farfrae by estrangement; Elizabeth-Jane by ignorance. It seemed to him that only one of them could possibly be recalled, and that was the girl. His mind began vibrating between the wish to reveal himself to her and the policy of leaving well alone, till he could no longer sit still. He walked up and down, and then he came and stood behind her chair, looking down upon the top of her head. He could no longer restrain his impulse. \u201cWhat did your mother tell you about me\u2014my history?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat you were related by marriage.\u201d \u201cShe should have told more\u2014before you knew me! Then my task would not have been such a hard one.... Elizabeth, it is I who am your father, and not Richard Newson. Shame alone prevented your wretched parents from owning this to you while both of \u2019em were alive.\u201d The back of Elizabeth\u2019s head remained still, and her shoulders did not denote even the movements of breathing. Henchard went on: \u201cI\u2019d rather have your scorn, your fear, anything than your ignorance; \u2019tis that I hate! Your mother and I were man and wife when we were young. What you saw was our second marriage. Your mother was too honest. We had thought each other dead\u2014and\u2014Newson became her husband.\u201d This was the nearest approach Henchard could make to the full truth. As far as he personally was concerned he would have screened nothing; but he showed a respect for the young girl\u2019s sex and years worthy of a better man.", " As a consequence, instead of following a straight course yet further away from Casterbridge, Henchard gradually, almost unconsciously, deflected from that right line of his first intention; till, by degrees, his wandering, like that of the Canadian woodsman, became part of a circle of which Casterbridge formed the centre. In ascending any particular hill he ascertained the bearings as nearly as he could by means of the sun, moon, or stars, and settled in his mind the exact direction in which Casterbridge and Elizabeth-Jane lay. Sneering at himself for his weakness he yet every hour\u2014nay, every few minutes\u2014conjectured her actions for the time being\u2014her sitting down and rising up, her goings and comings, till thought of Newson\u2019s and Farfrae\u2019s counter-influence would pass like a cold blast over a pool, and efface her image. And then he would say to himself, \u201cO you fool! All this about a daughter who is no daughter of thine!\u201d At length he obtained employment at his own occupation of hay-trusser, work of that sort being in demand at this autumn time. The scene of his hiring was a pastoral farm near the old western highway, whose course was the channel of all such communications as passed between the busy centres of novelty and the remote Wessex boroughs. He had chosen the neighbourhood of this artery from a sense that, situated here, though at a distance of fifty miles, he was virtually nearer to her whose welfare was so dear than he would be at a roadless spot only half as remote."], "What is the nameof Lucetta Templeman\u2019s estate?": [" In this frame of mind, though without strong feeling, he had strolled up the alley and into High-Place Hall by the postern at which Elizabeth had so nearly encountered him. He had gone on thence into the court, and inquired of a man whom he saw unpacking china from a crate if Miss Le Sueur was living there. Miss Le Sueur had been the name under which he had known Lucetta\u2014or \u201cLucette,\u201d as she had called herself at that time. The man replied in the negative; that Miss Templeman only had come. Henchard went away, concluding that Lucetta had not as yet settled in. He was in this interested stage of the inquiry when he witnessed Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s departure the next day. On hearing her announce the address there suddenly took possession of him the strange thought that Lucetta and Miss Templeman were one and the same person, for he could recall that in her season of intimacy with him the name of the rich relative whom he had deemed somewhat a mythical personage had been given as Templeman. Though he was not a fortune-hunter, the possibility that Lucetta had been sublimed into a lady of means by some munificent testament on the part of this relative lent a charm to her image which it might not otherwise have acquired. He was getting on towards the dead level of middle age, when material things increasingly possess the mind. But Henchard was not left long in suspense. Lucetta was rather addicted to scribbling, as had been shown by the torrent of letters after the _fiasco_ in their marriage arrangements, and hardly had Elizabeth gone away when another note came to the Mayor\u2019s house from High-Place Hall.", " \u201cWell, have you chosen?\u201d she asked flinging down the last card. \u201cNo,\u201d stammered Elizabeth, arousing herself from a reverie. \u201cI forgot, I was thinking of\u2014you, and me\u2014and how strange it is that I am here.\u201d Miss Templeman looked at Elizabeth-Jane with interest, and laid down the cards. \u201cAh! never mind,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll lie here while you sit by me; and we\u2019ll talk.\u201d Elizabeth drew up silently to the head of the sofa, but with obvious pleasure. It could be seen that though in years she was younger than her entertainer in manner and general vision she seemed more of the sage. Miss Templeman deposited herself on the sofa in her former flexuous position, and throwing her arm above her brow\u2014somewhat in the pose of a well-known conception of Titian\u2019s\u2014talked up at Elizabeth-Jane invertedly across her forehead and arm. \u201cI must tell you something,\u201d she said. \u201cI wonder if you have suspected it. I have only been mistress of a large house and fortune a little while.\u201d \u201cOh\u2014only a little while?\u201d murmured Elizabeth-Jane, her countenance slightly falling. \u201cAs a girl I lived about in garrison towns and elsewhere with my father, till I was quite flighty and unsettled. He was an officer in the army. I should not have mentioned this had I not thought it best you should know the truth.\u201d \u201cYes, yes.\u201d She looked thoughtfully round the room\u2014at the little square piano with brass inlayings, at the window-curtains, at the lamp, at the fair and dark kings and queens on the card-table, and finally at the inverted face of Lucetta Templeman, whose large lustrous eyes had such an odd effect upside down.", " The latter appeared, surprised in the midst of her lucubrations. As soon as she saw Henchard she went across to him dutifully. \u201cElizabeth-Jane,\u201d he said, taking her hand, \u201cI want you to hear this.\u201d And turning to Lucetta: \u201cWill you, or will you not, marry me? \u201cIf you\u2014wish it, I must agree!\u201d \u201cYou say yes?\u201d \u201cI do.\u201d No sooner had she given the promise than she fell back in a fainting state. \u201cWhat dreadful thing drives her to say this, father, when it is such a pain to her?\u201d asked Elizabeth, kneeling down by Lucetta. \u201cDon\u2019t compel her to do anything against her will! I have lived with her, and know that she cannot bear much.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be a no\u2019thern simpleton!\u201d said Henchard drily. \u201cThis promise will leave him free for you, if you want him, won\u2019t it?\u201d At this Lucetta seemed to wake from her swoon with a start. \u201cHim? Who are you talking about?\u201d she said wildly. \u201cNobody, as far as I am concerned,\u201d said Elizabeth firmly. \u201cOh\u2014well. Then it is my mistake,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cBut the business is between me and Miss Templeman. She agrees to be my wife.\u201d \u201cBut don\u2019t dwell on it just now,\u201d entreated Elizabeth, holding Lucetta\u2019s hand. \u201cI don\u2019t wish to, if she promises,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cI have, I have,\u201d groaned Lucetta, her limbs hanging like fluid, from very misery and faintness. \u201cMichael, please don\u2019t argue it any more!\u201d \u201cI will not,\u201d he said. And taking up his hat he went away. Elizabeth-Jane continued to kneel by Lucetta.", " Yet not quite like or respect them.\u201d Lucetta winced again. Her past was by no means secure from investigation, even in Casterbridge. For one thing Henchard had never returned to her the cloud of letters she had written and sent him in her first excitement. Possibly they were destroyed; but she could have wished that they had never been written. The rencounter with Farfrae and his bearings towards Lucetta had made the reflective Elizabeth more observant of her brilliant and amiable companion. A few days afterwards, when her eyes met Lucetta\u2019s as the latter was going out, she somehow knew that Miss Templeman was nourishing a hope of seeing the attractive Scotchman. The fact was printed large all over Lucetta\u2019s cheeks and eyes to any one who could read her as Elizabeth-Jane was beginning to do. Lucetta passed on and closed the street door. A seer\u2019s spirit took possession of Elizabeth, impelling her to sit down by the fire and divine events so surely from data already her own that they could be held as witnessed. She followed Lucetta thus mentally\u2014saw her encounter Donald somewhere as if by chance\u2014saw him wear his special look when meeting women, with an added intensity because this one was Lucetta. She depicted his impassioned manner; beheld the indecision of both between their lothness to separate and their desire not to be observed; depicted their shaking of hands; how they probably parted with frigidity in their general contour and movements, only in the smaller features showing the spark of passion, thus invisible to all but themselves."], "What ulteriormotive prompts Lucetta to invite Elizabeth-Jane to live with her?": [" They sat down to breakfast, and Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s thoughts reverted to Lucetta. Their sadness added charm to a countenance whose beauty had ever lain in its meditative soberness. \u201cFather,\u201d she said, as soon as she recalled herself to the outspread meal, \u201cit is so kind of you to get this nice breakfast with your own hands, and I idly asleep the while.\u201d \u201cI do it every day,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou have left me; everybody has left me; how should I live but by my own hands.\u201d \u201cYou are very lonely, are you not?\u201d \u201cAy, child\u2014to a degree that you know nothing of! It is my own fault. You are the only one who has been near me for weeks. And you will come no more.\u201d \u201cWhy do you say that? Indeed I will, if you would like to see me.\u201d Henchard signified dubiousness. Though he had so lately hoped that Elizabeth-Jane might again live in his house as daughter, he would not ask her to do so now. Newson might return at any moment, and what Elizabeth would think of him for his deception it were best to bear apart from her. When they had breakfasted his stepdaughter still lingered, till the moment arrived at which Henchard was accustomed to go to his daily work. Then she arose, and with assurance of coming again soon went up the hill in the morning sunlight. \u201cAt this moment her heart is as warm towards me as mine is towards her, she would live with me here in this humble cottage for the asking! Yet before the evening probably he will have come, and then she will scorn me!\u201d This reflection, constantly repeated by Henchard to himself, accompanied him everywhere through the day.", " The latter appeared, surprised in the midst of her lucubrations. As soon as she saw Henchard she went across to him dutifully. \u201cElizabeth-Jane,\u201d he said, taking her hand, \u201cI want you to hear this.\u201d And turning to Lucetta: \u201cWill you, or will you not, marry me? \u201cIf you\u2014wish it, I must agree!\u201d \u201cYou say yes?\u201d \u201cI do.\u201d No sooner had she given the promise than she fell back in a fainting state. \u201cWhat dreadful thing drives her to say this, father, when it is such a pain to her?\u201d asked Elizabeth, kneeling down by Lucetta. \u201cDon\u2019t compel her to do anything against her will! I have lived with her, and know that she cannot bear much.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be a no\u2019thern simpleton!\u201d said Henchard drily. \u201cThis promise will leave him free for you, if you want him, won\u2019t it?\u201d At this Lucetta seemed to wake from her swoon with a start. \u201cHim? Who are you talking about?\u201d she said wildly. \u201cNobody, as far as I am concerned,\u201d said Elizabeth firmly. \u201cOh\u2014well. Then it is my mistake,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cBut the business is between me and Miss Templeman. She agrees to be my wife.\u201d \u201cBut don\u2019t dwell on it just now,\u201d entreated Elizabeth, holding Lucetta\u2019s hand. \u201cI don\u2019t wish to, if she promises,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cI have, I have,\u201d groaned Lucetta, her limbs hanging like fluid, from very misery and faintness. \u201cMichael, please don\u2019t argue it any more!\u201d \u201cI will not,\u201d he said. And taking up his hat he went away. Elizabeth-Jane continued to kneel by Lucetta.", " When the young woman came in, sweetly unconscious of the turn in the tide, Lucetta went up to her, and said quite sincerely\u2014 \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve come. You\u2019ll live with me a long time, won\u2019t you?\u201d Elizabeth as a watch-dog to keep her father off\u2014what a new idea. Yet it was not unpleasing. Henchard had neglected her all these days, after compromising her indescribably in the past. The least he could have done when he found himself free, and herself affluent, would have been to respond heartily and promptly to her invitation. Her emotions rose, fell, undulated, filled her with wild surmise at their suddenness; and so passed Lucetta\u2019s experiences of that day. XXIV. Poor Elizabeth-Jane, little thinking what her malignant star had done to blast the budding attentions she had won from Donald Farfrae, was glad to hear Lucetta\u2019s words about remaining. For in addition to Lucetta\u2019s house being a home, that raking view of the market-place which it afforded had as much attraction for her as for Lucetta. The _carrefour_ was like the regulation Open Place in spectacular dramas, where the incidents that occur always happen to bear on the lives of the adjoining residents. Farmers, merchants, dairymen, quacks, hawkers, appeared there from week to week, and disappeared as the afternoon wasted away. It was the node of all orbits. From Saturday to Saturday was as from day to day with the two young women now.", " She had recovered herself. \u201cThe bells are ringing on that account,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband is downstairs. He will live here till a more suitable house is ready for us; and I have told him that I want you to stay with me just as before.\u201d \u201cLet me think of it alone,\u201d the girl quickly replied, corking up the turmoil of her feeling with grand control. \u201cYou shall. I am sure we shall be happy together.\u201d Lucetta departed to join Donald below, a vague uneasiness floating over her joy at seeing him quite at home there. Not on account of her friend Elizabeth did she feel it: for of the bearings of Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s emotions she had not the least suspicion; but on Henchard\u2019s alone. Now the instant decision of Susan Henchard\u2019s daughter was to dwell in that house no more. Apart from her estimate of the propriety of Lucetta\u2019s conduct, Farfrae had been so nearly her avowed lover that she felt she could not abide there. It was still early in the evening when she hastily put on her things and went out. In a few minutes, knowing the ground, she had found a suitable lodging, and arranged to enter it that night. Returning and entering noiselessly she took off her pretty dress and arrayed herself in a plain one, packing up the other to keep as her best; for she would have to be very economical now. She wrote a note to leave for Lucetta, who was closely shut up in the drawing-room with Farfrae; and then Elizabeth-Jane called a man with a wheel-barrow; and seeing her boxes put into it she trotted off down the street to her rooms."], "Where did Lucettalive before moving to Casterbridge?": [" \u201cI don\u2019t forbid you to marry him,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cPromise not to quite forget me when\u2014\u2014\u201d He meant when Newson should come. She promised mechanically, in her agitation; and the same evening at dusk Henchard left the town, to whose development he had been one of the chief stimulants for many years. During the day he had bought a new tool-basket, cleaned up his old hay-knife and wimble, set himself up in fresh leggings, kneenaps and corduroys, and in other ways gone back to the working clothes of his young manhood, discarding for ever the shabby-genteel suit of cloth and rusty silk hat that since his decline had characterized him in the Casterbridge street as a man who had seen better days. He went secretly and alone, not a soul of the many who had known him being aware of his departure. Elizabeth-Jane accompanied him as far as the second bridge on the highway\u2014for the hour of her appointment with the unguessed visitor at Farfrae\u2019s had not yet arrived\u2014and parted from him with unfeigned wonder and sorrow, keeping him back a minute or two before finally letting him go. She watched his form diminish across the moor, the yellow rush-basket at his back moving up and down with each tread, and the creases behind his knees coming and going alternately till she could no longer see them. Though she did not know it Henchard formed at this moment much the same picture as he had presented when entering Casterbridge for the first time nearly a quarter of a century before; except, to be sure, that the serious addition to his years had considerably lessened the spring to his stride, that his state of hopelessness had weakened him, and imparted to his shoulders, as weighted by the basket, a perceptible bend.", " Henchard ran to the gate of the field he worked in, and hailed the speaker, who was a stranger. \u201cYes\u2014I\u2019ve come from there, maister,\u201d he said, in answer to Henchard\u2019s inquiry. \u201cI trade up and down, ye know; though, what with this travelling without horses that\u2019s getting so common, my work will soon be done.\u201d \u201cAnything moving in the old place, mid I ask?\u201d \u201cAll the same as usual.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve heard that Mr. Farfrae, the late mayor, is thinking of getting married. Now is that true or not?\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t say for the life o\u2019 me. O no, I should think not.\u201d \u201cBut yes, John\u2014you forget,\u201d said a woman inside the waggon-tilt. \u201cWhat were them packages we carr\u2019d there at the beginning o\u2019 the week? Surely they said a wedding was coming off soon\u2014on Martin\u2019s Day?\u201d The man declared he remembered nothing about it; and the waggon went on jangling over the hill. Henchard was convinced that the woman\u2019s memory served her well. The date was an extremely probable one, there being no reason for delay on either side. He might, for that matter, write and inquire of Elizabeth; but his instinct for sequestration had made the course difficult. Yet before he left her she had said that for him to be absent from her wedding was not as she wished it to be. The remembrance would continually revive in him now that it was not Elizabeth and Farfrae who had driven him away from them, but his own haughty sense that his presence was no longer desired.", " Henchard went home. The morning having now fully broke he lit his fire, and sat abstractedly beside it. He had not sat there long when a gentle footstep approached the house and entered the passage, a finger tapping lightly at the door. Henchard\u2019s face brightened, for he knew the motions to be Elizabeth\u2019s. She came into his room, looking wan and sad. \u201cHave you heard?\u201d she asked. \u201cMrs. Farfrae! She is\u2014dead! Yes, indeed\u2014about an hour ago!\u201d \u201cI know it,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cI have but lately come in from there. It is so very good of \u2019ee, Elizabeth, to come and tell me. You must be so tired out, too, with sitting up. Now do you bide here with me this morning. You can go and rest in the other room; and I will call \u2019ee when breakfast is ready.\u201d To please him, and herself\u2014for his recent kindliness was winning a surprised gratitude from the lonely girl\u2014she did as he bade her, and lay down on a sort of couch which Henchard had rigged up out of a settle in the adjoining room. She could hear him moving about in his preparations; but her mind ran most strongly on Lucetta, whose death in such fulness of life and amid such cheerful hopes of maternity was appallingly unexpected. Presently she fell asleep. Meanwhile her stepfather in the outer room had set the breakfast in readiness; but finding that she dozed he would not call her; he waited on, looking into the fire and keeping the kettle boiling with house-wifely care, as if it were an honour to have her in his house.", " When he had gone on to give details which a whole series of slight and unregarded incidents in her past life strangely corroborated; when, in short, she believed his story to be true, she became greatly agitated, and turning round to the table flung her face upon it weeping. \u201cDon\u2019t cry\u2014don\u2019t cry!\u201d said Henchard, with vehement pathos, \u201cI can\u2019t bear it, I won\u2019t bear it. I am your father; why should you cry? Am I so dreadful, so hateful to \u2019ee? Don\u2019t take against me, Elizabeth-Jane!\u201d he cried, grasping her wet hand. \u201cDon\u2019t take against me\u2014though I was a drinking man once, and used your mother roughly\u2014I\u2019ll be kinder to you than _he_ was! I\u2019ll do anything, if you will only look upon me as your father!\u201d She tried to stand up and comfort him trustfully; but she could not; she was troubled at his presence, like the brethren at the avowal of Joseph. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to come to me all of a sudden,\u201d said Henchard in jerks, and moving like a great tree in a wind. \u201cNo, Elizabeth, I don\u2019t. I\u2019ll go away and not see you till to-morrow, or when you like, and then I\u2019ll show \u2019ee papers to prove my words. There, I am gone, and won\u2019t disturb you any more.... \u2019Twas I that chose your name, my daughter; your mother wanted it Susan. There, don\u2019t forget \u2019twas I gave you your name!\u201d He went out at the door and shut her softly in, and she heard him go away into the garden. But he had not done. Before she had moved, or in any way recovered from the effect of his disclosure, he reappeared."], "How does Lucettareact when Henchard demands that she end her affair with Farfraein order to marry him?": [" Henchard unfolded another letter, and read it through likewise, stopping at the subscription as before. \u201cHer name I don\u2019t give,\u201d he said blandly. \u201cAs I didn\u2019t marry her, and another man did, I can scarcely do that in fairness to her.\u201d \u201cTr-rue, tr-rue,\u201d said Farfrae. \u201cBut why didn\u2019t you marry her when your wife Susan died?\u201d Farfrae asked this and the other questions in the comfortably indifferent tone of one whom the matter very remotely concerned. \u201cAh\u2014well you may ask that!\u201d said Henchard, the new-moon-shaped grin adumbrating itself again upon his mouth. \u201cIn spite of all her protestations, when I came forward to do so, as in generosity bound, she was not the woman for me.\u201d \u201cShe had already married another\u2014maybe?\u201d Henchard seemed to think it would be sailing too near the wind to descend further into particulars, and he answered \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cThe young lady must have had a heart that bore transplanting very readily!\u201d \u201cShe had, she had,\u201d said Henchard emphatically. He opened a third and fourth letter, and read. This time he approached the conclusion as if the signature were indeed coming with the rest. But again he stopped short. The truth was that, as may be divined, he had quite intended to effect a grand catastrophe at the end of this drama by reading out the name, he had come to the house with no other thought. But sitting here in cold blood he could not do it. Such a wrecking of hearts appalled even him.", " You should get out, and gossip about as other women do, and then you wouldn\u2019t be obliged to ask me a question of that kind. Well, now, I have something to tell you.\u201d Elizabeth-Jane said she was so glad, and made herself receptive. \u201cI must go rather a long way back,\u201d said Lucetta, the difficulty of explaining herself satisfactorily to the pondering one beside her growing more apparent at each syllable. \u201cYou remember that trying case of conscience I told you of some time ago\u2014about the first lover and the second lover?\u201d She let out in jerky phrases a leading word or two of the story she had told. \u201cO yes\u2014I remember the story of _your friend_,\u201d said Elizabeth drily, regarding the irises of Lucetta\u2019s eyes as though to catch their exact shade. \u201cThe two lovers\u2014the old one and the new: how she wanted to marry the second, but felt she ought to marry the first; so that the good she would have done she did not, and the evil that she would not, that she did\u2014exactly like the Apostle Paul.\u201d \u201cO no; she didn\u2019t do evil exactly!\u201d said Lucetta hastily. \u201cBut you said that she\u2014or as I may say _you_\u201d\u2014answered Elizabeth, dropping the mask, \u201cwere in honour and conscience bound to marry the first?\u201d Lucetta\u2019s blush at being seen through came and went again before she replied anxiously, \u201cYou will never breathe this, will you, Elizabeth-Jane?\u201d \u201cCertainly not, if you say not. \u201cThen I will tell you that the case is more complicated\u2014worse, in fact\u2014than it seemed in my story.", " \u201cDo you remember,\u201d said Henchard, as if it were the presence of the thought and not of the man which made him speak, \u201cdo you remember my story of that second woman\u2014who suffered for her thoughtless intimacy with me?\u201d \u201cI do,\u201d said Farfrae. \u201cDo you remember my telling \u2019ee how it all began and how it ended? \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWell, I have offered to marry her now that I can; but she won\u2019t marry me. Now what would you think of her\u2014I put it to you?\u201d \u201cWell, ye owe her nothing more now,\u201d said Farfrae heartily. \u201cIt is true,\u201d said Henchard, and went on. That he had looked up from a letter to ask his questions completely shut out from Farfrae\u2019s mind all vision of Lucetta as the culprit. Indeed, her present position was so different from that of the young woman of Henchard\u2019s story as of itself to be sufficient to blind him absolutely to her identity. As for Henchard, he was reassured by Farfrae\u2019s words and manner against a suspicion which had crossed his mind. They were not those of a conscious rival. Yet that there was rivalry by some one he was firmly persuaded. He could feel it in the air around Lucetta, see it in the turn of her pen. There was an antagonistic force in exercise, so that when he had tried to hang near her he seemed standing in a refluent current. That it was not innate caprice he was more and more certain. Her windows gleamed as if they did not want him; her curtains seem to hang slily, as if they screened an ousting presence.", " \u201cIt is past ten o\u2019clock, and you have no right to surprise me here at such a time.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve not the right. At any rate I have the excuse. Is it so necessary that I should stop to think of manners and customs?\u201d \u201cIt is too late for propriety, and might injure me.\u201d \u201cI called an hour ago, and you would not see me, and I thought you were in when I called now. It is you, Lucetta, who are doing wrong. It is not proper in \u2019ee to throw me over like this. I have a little matter to remind you of, which you seem to forget.\u201d She sank into a chair, and turned pale. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear it\u2014I don\u2019t want to hear it!\u201d she said through her hands, as he, standing close to the edge of her gown, began to allude to the Jersey days. \u201cBut you ought to hear it,\u201d said he. \u201cIt came to nothing; and through you. Then why not leave me the freedom that I gained with such sorrow! Had I found that you proposed to marry me for pure love I might have felt bound now. But I soon learnt that you had planned it out of mere charity\u2014almost as an unpleasant duty\u2014because I had nursed you, and compromised myself, and you thought you must repay me. After that I did not care for you so deeply as before.\u201d \u201cWhy did you come here to find me, then?\u201d \u201cI thought I ought to marry you for conscience\u2019 sake, since you were free, even though I\u2014did not like you so well.\u201d \u201cAnd why then don\u2019t you think so now?\u201d She was silent."], "To whom doesHenchard entrust Lucetta\u2019s letters?": [" Yet not quite like or respect them.\u201d Lucetta winced again. Her past was by no means secure from investigation, even in Casterbridge. For one thing Henchard had never returned to her the cloud of letters she had written and sent him in her first excitement. Possibly they were destroyed; but she could have wished that they had never been written. The rencounter with Farfrae and his bearings towards Lucetta had made the reflective Elizabeth more observant of her brilliant and amiable companion.

The fact was printed large all over Lucetta\u2019s cheeks and eyes to any one who could read her as Elizabeth-Jane was beginning to do. Lucetta passed on and closed the street door.

She shook her head. \u201cHow can you be sorry,\u201d she asked, \u201cwhen you deliberately cause it?\u201d \u201cWhat!\u201d said Henchard uneasily. \u201cIs it anything I have done that has pulled you down like that?\u201d \u201cIt is all your doing,\u201d she said. \u201cI have no other grief. My happiness would be secure enough but for your threats. O Michael! don\u2019t wreck me like this! You might think that you have done enough! When I came here I was a young woman; now I am rapidly becoming an old one. Neither my husband nor any other man will regard me with interest long.\u201d Henchard was disarmed. His old feeling of supercilious pity for womankind in general was intensified by this suppliant appearing here as the double of the first. Moreover that thoughtless want of foresight which had led to all her trouble remained with poor Lucetta still; she had come to meet him here in this compromising way without perceiving the risk. Such a woman was very small deer to hunt; he felt ashamed, lost all zest and desire to humiliate Lucetta there and then, and no longer envied Farfrae his bargain. He had married money, but nothing more. Henchard was anxious to wash his hands of the game. \u201cWell, what do you want me to do?\u201d he said gently. \u201cI am sure I shall be very willing. My reading of those letters was only a sort of practical joke, and I revealed nothing.\u201d \u201cTo give me back the letters and any papers you may have that breathe of matrimony or worse.\u201d \u201cSo be it.", " \u2018Where beest now, dear Joe, under or top?\u2019 she\u2019d scream again. By George, \u2019twas through her I was took!

It did hurt my feelings to be so wronged!... Ah well\u2014\u2019tis over now.\u201d \u201cI might have had \u2019ee days afore that,\u201d said the keeper. \u201cI was within a few yards of \u2019ee dozens of times, with a sight more of birds than that poor one.\u201d \u201cYes\u2014\u2019tis not our greatest doings that the world gets wind of,\u201d said the furmity-woman, who, lately settled in this purlieu, sat among the rest. Having travelled a great deal in her time she spoke with cosmopolitan largeness of idea. It was she who presently asked Jopp what was the parcel he kept so snugly under his arm. \u201cAh, therein lies a grand secret,\u201d said Jopp. \u201cIt is the passion of love. To think that a woman should love one man so well, and hate another so unmercifully.\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s the object of your meditation, sir?\u201d \u201cOne that stands high in this town. I\u2019d like to shame her! Upon my life, \u2019twould be as good as a play to read her love-letters, the proud piece of silk and wax-work! For \u2019tis her love-letters that I\u2019ve got here.\u201d \u201cLove letters? then let\u2019s hear \u2019em, good soul,\u201d said Mother Cuxsom. \u201cLord, do ye mind, Richard, what fools we used to be when we were younger?", " Rigid in this position, more and more words fell successively upon her ear. But what amazed her most was the tone of her husband. He spoke merely in the accents of a man who made a present of his time. \u201cOne word,\u201d he was saying, as the crackling of paper denoted that Henchard was unfolding yet another sheet. \u201cIs it quite fair to this young woman\u2019s memory to read at such length to a stranger what was intended for your eye alone?\u201d \u201cWell, yes,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cBy not giving her name I make it an example of all womankind, and not a scandal to one.\u201d \u201cIf I were you I would destroy them,\u201d said Farfrae, giving more thought to the letters than he had hitherto done. \u201cAs another man\u2019s wife it would injure the woman if it were known.\u201d \u201cNo, I shall not destroy them,\u201d murmured Henchard, putting the letters away. Then he arose, and Lucetta heard no more. She went back to her bedroom in a semi-paralyzed state. For very fear she could not undress, but sat on the edge of the bed, waiting. Would Henchard let out the secret in his parting words? Her suspense was terrible. Had she confessed all to Donald in their early acquaintance he might possibly have got over it, and married her just the same\u2014unlikely as it had once seemed; but for her or any one else to tell him now would be fatal. The door slammed; she could hear her husband bolting it. After looking round in his customary way he came leisurely up the stairs."], "What does Henchardpersuade the town\u2019s musicians to play at the Three Mariners Inn?": [" The inn called Peter\u2019s Finger was the church of Mixen Lane. It was centrally situate, as such places should be, and bore about the same social relation to the Three Mariners as the latter bore to the King\u2019s Arms. At first sight the inn was so respectable as to be puzzling. The front door was kept shut, and the step was so clean that evidently but few persons entered over its sanded surface. But at the corner of the public-house was an alley, a mere slit, dividing it from the next building. Half-way up the alley was a narrow door, shiny and paintless from the rub of infinite hands and shoulders. This was the actual entrance to the inn. A pedestrian would be seen abstractedly passing along Mixen Lane; and then, in a moment, he would vanish, causing the gazer to blink like Ashton at the disappearance of Ravenswood. That abstracted pedestrian had edged into the slit by the adroit fillip of his person sideways; from the slit he edged into the tavern by a similar exercise of skill. The company at the Three Mariners were persons of quality in comparison with the company which gathered here; though it must be admitted that the lowest fringe of the Mariner\u2019s party touched the crest of Peter\u2019s at points. Waifs and strays of all sorts loitered about here. The landlady was a virtuous woman who years ago had been unjustly sent to gaol as an accessory to something or other after the fact. She underwent her twelvemonth, and had worn a martyr\u2019s countenance ever since, except at times of meeting the constable who apprehended her, when she winked her eye.", " \u201cOn no account ought ye to have helped serve here to-night. Not because of ourselves, but for the sake of _him_. If he should befriend us, and take us up, and then find out what you did when staying here, \u2019twould grieve and wound his natural pride as Mayor of the town.\u201d Elizabeth, who would perhaps have been more alarmed at this than her mother had she known the real relationship, was not much disturbed about it as things stood. Her \u201che\u201d was another man than her poor mother\u2019s. \u201cFor myself,\u201d she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t at all mind waiting a little upon him. He\u2019s so respectable, and educated\u2014far above the rest of \u2019em in the inn. They thought him very simple not to know their grim broad way of talking about themselves here. But of course he didn\u2019t know\u2014he was too refined in his mind to know such things!\u201d Thus she earnestly pleaded. Meanwhile, the \u201che\u201d of her mother was not so far away as even they thought. After leaving the Three Mariners he had sauntered up and down the empty High Street, passing and repassing the inn in his promenade. When the Scotchman sang his voice had reached Henchard\u2019s ears through the heart-shaped holes in the window-shutters, and had led him to pause outside them a long while. \u201cTo be sure, to be sure, how that fellow does draw me!\u201d he had said to himself. \u201cI suppose \u2019tis because I\u2019m so lonely. I\u2019d have given him a third share in the business to have stayed!\u201d IX. When Elizabeth-Jane opened the hinged casement next morning the mellow air brought in the feel of imminent autumn almost as distinctly as if she had been in the remotest hamlet.", " These things being clear, he returned to the present. \u201cAnd where is your mother staying?\u201d \u201cAt the Three Mariners.\u201d \u201cAnd you are her daughter Elizabeth-Jane?\u201d repeated Henchard. He arose, came close to her, and glanced in her face. \u201cI think,\u201d he said, suddenly turning away with a wet eye, \u201cyou shall take a note from me to your mother. I should like to see her.... She is not left very well off by her late husband?\u201d His eye fell on Elizabeth\u2019s clothes, which, though a respectable suit of black, and her very best, were decidedly old-fashioned even to Casterbridge eyes. \u201cNot very well,\u201d she said, glad that he had divined this without her being obliged to express it. He sat down at the table and wrote a few lines, next taking from his pocket-book a five-pound note, which he put in the envelope with the letter, adding to it, as by an afterthought, five shillings. Sealing the whole up carefully, he directed it to \u201cMrs. Newson, Three Mariners Inn,\u201d and handed the packet to Elizabeth. \u201cDeliver it to her personally, please,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cWell, I am glad to see you here, Elizabeth-Jane\u2014very glad. We must have a long talk together\u2014but not just now.\u201d He took her hand at parting, and held it so warmly that she, who had known so little friendship, was much affected, and tears rose to her aerial-grey eyes. The instant that she was gone Henchard\u2019s state showed itself more distinctly; having shut the door he sat in his dining-room stiffly erect, gazing at the opposite wall as if he read his history there.", " \u201cWe must get a place to lie down in,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI have seen\u2014Mr. Henchard; and that\u2019s all I wanted to do.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s enough for to-night, at any rate,\u201d Elizabeth-Jane replied soothingly. \u201cWe can think to-morrow what is best to do about him. The question now is\u2014is it not?\u2014how shall we find a lodging?\u201d As her mother did not reply Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s mind reverted to the words of the waiter, that the Three Mariners was an inn of moderate charges. A recommendation good for one person was probably good for another. \u201cLet\u2019s go where the young man has gone to,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is respectable. What do you say?\u201d Her mother assented, and down the street they went. In the meantime the Mayor\u2019s thoughtfulness, engendered by the note as stated, continued to hold him in abstraction; till, whispering to his neighbour to take his place, he found opportunity to leave the chair. This was just after the departure of his wife and Elizabeth. Outside the door of the assembly-room he saw the waiter, and beckoning to him asked who had brought the note which had been handed in a quarter of an hour before. \u201cA young man, sir\u2014a sort of traveller. He was a Scotchman seemingly.\u201d \u201cDid he say how he had got it?\u201d \u201cHe wrote it himself, sir, as he stood outside the window.\u201d \u201cOh\u2014wrote it himself.... Is the young man in the hotel?\u201d \u201cNo, sir. He went to the Three Mariners, I believe.\u201d The mayor walked up and down the vestibule of the hotel with his hands under his coat tails, as if he were merely seeking a cooler atmosphere than that of the room he had quitted."], "What is Farfrae\u2019sinitial reaction when asked to be mayor of Casterbridge?": [" \u201c\u2019Tisn\u2019t mine by rights,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cWhy the devil didn\u2019t they take it?\u2014I don\u2019t want what don\u2019t belong to me!\u201d Moved by a recollection he took the watch to the maker\u2019s just opposite, sold it there and then for what the tradesman offered, and went with the proceeds to one among the smaller of his creditors, a cottager of Durnover in straitened circumstances, to whom he handed the money. When everything was ticketed that Henchard had owned, and the auctions were in progress, there was quite a sympathetic reaction in the town, which till then for some time past had done nothing but condemn him. Now that Henchard\u2019s whole career was pictured distinctly to his neighbours, and they could see how admirably he had used his one talent of energy to create a position of affluence out of absolutely nothing\u2014which was really all he could show when he came to the town as a journeyman hay-trusser, with his wimble and knife in his basket\u2014they wondered and regretted his fall. Try as she might, Elizabeth could never meet with him. She believed in him still, though nobody else did; and she wanted to be allowed to forgive him for his roughness to her, and to help him in his trouble. She wrote to him; he did not reply. She then went to his house\u2014the great house she had lived in so happily for a time\u2014with its front of dun brick, vitrified here and there and its heavy sash-bars\u2014but Henchard was to be found there no more.", " \u201cWhat\u2019s going on to-night?\u201d asked the girl, after singling out an old man and standing by him long enough to acquire a neighbourly right of converse. \u201cWell, ye must be a stranger sure,\u201d said the old man, without taking his eyes from the window. \u201cWhy, \u2019tis a great public dinner of the gentle-people and such like leading volk\u2014wi\u2019 the Mayor in the chair. As we plainer fellows bain\u2019t invited, they leave the winder-shutters open that we may get jist a sense o\u2019t out here. If you mount the steps you can see em. That\u2019s Mr. Henchard, the Mayor, at the end of the table, a facing ye; and that\u2019s the Council men right and left.... Ah, lots of them when they begun life were no more than I be now!\u201d \u201cHenchard!\u201d said Elizabeth-Jane, surprised, but by no means suspecting the whole force of the revelation. She ascended to the top of the steps. Her mother, though her head was bowed, had already caught from the inn-window tones that strangely riveted her attention, before the old man\u2019s words, \u201cMr. Henchard, the Mayor,\u201d reached her ears. She arose, and stepped up to her daughter\u2019s side as soon as she could do so without showing exceptional eagerness. The interior of the hotel dining-room was spread out before her, with its tables, and glass, and plate, and inmates. Facing the window, in the chair of dignity, sat a man about forty years of age; of heavy frame, large features, and commanding voice; his general build being rather coarse than compact.", " If they want to make me Mayor I will stay, and Henchard must rave as he will.\u201d From this evening onward Lucetta was very uneasy. If she had not been imprudence incarnate she would not have acted as she did when she met Henchard by accident a day or two later. It was in the bustle of the market, when no one could readily notice their discourse. \u201cMichael,\u201d said she, \u201cI must again ask you what I asked you months ago\u2014to return me any letters or papers of mine that you may have\u2014unless you have destroyed them? You must see how desirable it is that the time at Jersey should be blotted out, for the good of all parties.\u201d \u201cWhy, bless the woman!\u2014I packed up every scrap of your handwriting to give you in the coach\u2014but you never appeared.\u201d She explained how the death of her aunt had prevented her taking the journey on that day. \u201cAnd what became of the parcel then?\u201d she asked. He could not say\u2014he would consider. When she was gone he recollected that he had left a heap of useless papers in his former dining-room safe\u2014built up in the wall of his old house\u2014now occupied by Farfrae. The letters might have been amongst them. A grotesque grin shaped itself on Henchard\u2019s face. Had that safe been opened? On the very evening which followed this there was a great ringing of bells in Casterbridge, and the combined brass, wood, catgut, and leather bands played round the town with more prodigality of percussion-notes than ever.", " When this was all done, and Henchard had become in a measure broken in, he came to work daily on the home premises like the rest. And thus the once flourishing merchant and Mayor and what not stood as a day-labourer in the barns and granaries he formerly had owned. \u201cI have worked as a journeyman before now, ha\u2019n\u2019t I?\u201d he would say in his defiant way; \u201cand why shouldn\u2019t I do it again?\u201d But he looked a far different journeyman from the one he had been in his earlier days. Then he had worn clean, suitable clothes, light and cheerful in hue; leggings yellow as marigolds, corduroys immaculate as new flax, and a neckerchief like a flower-garden. Now he wore the remains of an old blue cloth suit of his gentlemanly times, a rusty silk hat, and a once black satin stock, soiled and shabby. Clad thus he went to and fro, still comparatively an active man\u2014for he was not much over forty\u2014and saw with the other men in the yard Donald Farfrae going in and out the green door that led to the garden, and the big house, and Lucetta. At the beginning of the winter it was rumoured about Casterbridge that Mr. Farfrae, already in the Town Council, was to be proposed for Mayor in a year or two. \u201cYes, she was wise, she was wise in her generation!\u201d said Henchard to himself when he heard of this one day on his way to Farfrae\u2019s hay-barn. He thought it over as he wimbled his bonds, and the piece of news acted as a reviviscent breath to that old view of his\u2014of Donald Farfrae as his triumphant rival who rode rough-shod over him."], "What is the nameof the ceremony the townspeople perform to shame Lucetta?": [" Field labourers and their wives and children trooped in from the villages for their weekly shopping, and instead of a rattle of wheels and a tramp of horses ruling the sound as earlier, there was nothing but the shuffle of many feet. All the implements were gone; all the farmers; all the moneyed class. The character of the town\u2019s trading had changed from bulk to multiplicity and pence were handled now as pounds had been handled earlier in the day. Lucetta and Elizabeth looked out upon this, for though it was night and the street lamps were lighted, they had kept their shutters unclosed. In the faint blink of the fire they spoke more freely. \u201cYour father was distant with you,\u201d said Lucetta. \u201cYes.\u201d And having forgotten the momentary mystery of Henchard\u2019s seeming speech to Lucetta she continued, \u201cIt is because he does not think I am respectable. I have tried to be so more than you can imagine, but in vain! My mother\u2019s separation from my father was unfortunate for me. You don\u2019t know what it is to have shadows like that upon your life.\u201d Lucetta seemed to wince. \u201cI do not\u2014of that kind precisely,\u201d she said, \u201cbut you may feel a\u2014sense of disgrace\u2014shame\u2014in other ways.\u201d \u201cHave you ever had any such feeling?\u201d said the younger innocently. \u201cO no,\u201d said Lucetta quickly. \u201cI was thinking of\u2014what happens sometimes when women get themselves in strange positions in the eyes of the world from no fault of their own.\u201d \u201cIt must make them very unhappy afterwards.\u201d \u201cIt makes them anxious; for might not other women despise them?\u201d \u201cNot altogether despise them.", " \u201cHe works for my husband,\u201d said Lucetta. \u201cOh\u2014is that all? They have been saying to me that it was through him your husband first got a footing in Casterbridge. What stories people will tell!\u201d \u201cThey will indeed. It was not so at all. Donald\u2019s genius would have enabled him to get a footing anywhere, without anybody\u2019s help! He would have been just the same if there had been no Henchard in the world!\u201d It was partly Lucetta\u2019s ignorance of the circumstances of Donald\u2019s arrival which led her to speak thus, partly the sensation that everybody seemed bent on snubbing her at this triumphant time. The incident had occupied but a few moments, but it was necessarily witnessed by the Royal Personage, who, however, with practised tact affected not to have noticed anything unusual. He alighted, the Mayor advanced, the address was read; the Illustrious Personage replied, then said a few words to Farfrae, and shook hands with Lucetta as the Mayor\u2019s wife. The ceremony occupied but a few minutes, and the carriages rattled heavily as Pharaoh\u2019s chariots down Corn Street and out upon the Budmouth Road, in continuation of the journey coastward. In the crowd stood Coney, Buzzford, and Longways. \u201cSome difference between him now and when he zung at the Dree Mariners,\u201d said the first. \u201c\u2019Tis wonderful how he could get a lady of her quality to go snacks wi\u2019 en in such quick time.\u201d \u201cTrue. Yet how folk do worship fine clothes!", " He started on foot, two mornings before St. Martin\u2019s-tide, allowing himself about sixteen miles to perform for each of the three days\u2019 journey, reckoning the wedding-day as one. There were only two towns, Melchester and Shottsford, of any importance along his course, and at the latter he stopped on the second night, not only to rest, but to prepare himself for the next evening. Possessing no clothes but the working suit he stood in\u2014now stained and distorted by their two months of hard usage, he entered a shop to make some purchases which should put him, externally at any rate, a little in harmony with the prevailing tone of the morrow. A rough yet respectable coat and hat, a new shirt and neck-cloth, were the chief of these; and having satisfied himself that in appearance at least he would not now offend her, he proceeded to the more interesting particular of buying her some present. What should that present be? He walked up and down the street, regarding dubiously the display in the shop windows, from a gloomy sense that what he might most like to give her would be beyond his miserable pocket. At length a caged goldfinch met his eye. The cage was a plain and small one, the shop humble, and on inquiry he concluded he could afford the modest sum asked. A sheet of newspaper was tied round the little creature\u2019s wire prison, and with the wrapped up cage in his hand Henchard sought a lodging for the night.", " Elizabeth, that silent observing woman, had long noted how he was rising in favour among the townspeople; and knowing Henchard\u2019s nature now she had feared that Farfrae\u2019s days as manager were numbered, so that the announcement gave her little surprise. Would Mr. Farfrae stay in Casterbridge despite his words and her father\u2019s dismissal? His occult breathings to her might be solvable by his course in that respect. The next day was windy\u2014so windy that walking in the garden she picked up a portion of the draft of a letter on business in Donald Farfrae\u2019s writing, which had flown over the wall from the office. The useless scrap she took indoors, and began to copy the calligraphy, which she much admired. The letter began \u201cDear Sir,\u201d and presently writing on a loose slip \u201cElizabeth-Jane,\u201d she laid the latter over \u201cSir,\u201d making the phrase \u201cDear Elizabeth-Jane.\u201d When she saw the effect a quick red ran up her face and warmed her through, though nobody was there to see what she had done. She quickly tore up the slip, and threw it away. After this she grew cool and laughed at herself, walked about the room, and laughed again; not joyfully, but distressfully rather. It was quickly known in Casterbridge that Farfrae and Henchard had decided to dispense with each other. Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s anxiety to know if Farfrae were going away from the town reached a pitch that disturbed her, for she could no longer conceal from herself the cause."], "How does Lucettareact to the townspeople\u2019s attempt to shame her?": [" Elizabeth, that silent observing woman, had long noted how he was rising in favour among the townspeople; and knowing Henchard\u2019s nature now she had feared that Farfrae\u2019s days as manager were numbered, so that the announcement gave her little surprise.

In addition to these old tragedies, pugilistic encounters almost to the death had come off down to recent dates in that secluded arena, entirely invisible to the outside world save by climbing to the top of the enclosure, which few townspeople in the daily round of their lives ever took the trouble to do. So that, though close to the turnpike-road, crimes might be perpetrated there unseen at mid-day. Some boys had latterly tried to impart gaiety to the ruin by using the central arena as a cricket-ground. But the game usually languished for the aforesaid reason\u2014the dismal privacy which the earthen circle enforced, shutting out every appreciative passer\u2019s vision, every commendatory remark from outsiders\u2014everything, except the sky; and to play at games in such circumstances was like acting to an empty house. Possibly, too, the boys were timid, for some old people said that at certain moments in the summer time, in broad daylight, persons sitting with a book or dozing in the arena had, on lifting their eyes, beheld the slopes lined with a gazing legion of Hadrian\u2019s soldiery as if watching the gladiatorial combat; and had heard the roar of their excited voices, that the scene would remain but a moment, like a lightning flash, and then disappear.", " Henchard was less popular now than he had been when nearly two years before, they had voted him to the chief magistracy on account of his amazing energy. While they had collectively profited by this quality of the corn-factor\u2019s they had been made to wince individually on more than one occasion. So he went out of the hall and down the street alone. Reaching home he seemed to recollect something with a sour satisfaction. He called Elizabeth-Jane. Seeing how he looked when she entered she appeared alarmed. \u201cNothing to find fault with,\u201d he said, observing her concern. \u201cOnly I want to caution you, my dear. That man, Farfrae\u2014it is about him. I\u2019ve seen him talking to you two or three times\u2014he danced with \u2019ee at the rejoicings, and came home with \u2019ee. Now, now, no blame to you. But just harken: Have you made him any foolish promise? Gone the least bit beyond sniff and snaff at all?\u201d \u201cNo. I have promised him nothing.\u201d \u201cGood. All\u2019s well that ends well. I particularly wish you not to see him again.\u201d \u201cVery well, sir.\u201d \u201cYou promise?\u201d She hesitated for a moment, and then said\u2014 \u201cYes, if you much wish it.\u201d \u201cI do. He\u2019s an enemy to our house!\u201d When she had gone he sat down, and wrote in a heavy hand to Farfrae thus:\u2014 Sir,\u2014I make request that henceforth you and my stepdaughter be as strangers to each other. She on her part has promised to welcome no more addresses from you; and I trust, therefore, you will not attempt to force them upon her.", " In her poverty she had met with repulse from the society to which she had belonged, and she had no great zest for renewing an attempt upon it now. Her heart longed for some ark into which it could fly and be at rest. Rough or smooth she did not care so long as it was warm. Farfrae was shown out, it having entirely escaped him that he had called to see Elizabeth. Lucetta at the window watched him threading the maze of farmers and farmers\u2019 men. She could see by his gait that he was conscious of her eyes, and her heart went out to him for his modesty\u2014pleaded with her sense of his unfitness that he might be allowed to come again. He entered the market-house, and she could see him no more. Three minutes later, when she had left the window, knocks, not of multitude but of strength, sounded through the house, and the waiting-maid tripped up. \u201cThe Mayor,\u201d she said. Lucetta had reclined herself, and she was looking dreamily through her fingers. She did not answer at once, and the maid repeated the information with the addition, \u201cAnd he\u2019s afraid he hasn\u2019t much time to spare, he says.\u201d \u201cOh! Then tell him that as I have a headache I won\u2019t detain him to-day.\u201d The message was taken down, and she heard the door close. Lucetta had come to Casterbridge to quicken Henchard\u2019s feelings with regard to her. She had quickened them, and now she was indifferent to the achievement. Her morning view of Elizabeth-Jane as a disturbing element changed, and she no longer felt strongly the necessity of getting rid of the girl for her stepfather\u2019s sake."], "What is Henchard\u2019sofficial role in greeting the Royal Personage?": [" \u201cHe works for my husband,\u201d said Lucetta. \u201cOh\u2014is that all?

Yet how folk do worship fine clothes!", " This spot was the centre of interest. There were a few clear yards in front of the Royal carriage, sanded; and into this space a man stepped before any one could prevent him. It was Henchard. He had unrolled his private flag, and removing his hat he staggered to the side of the slowing vehicle, waving the Union Jack to and fro with his left hand while he blandly held out his right to the Illustrious Personage. All the ladies said with bated breath, \u201cO, look there!\u201d and Lucetta was ready to faint. Elizabeth-Jane peeped through the shoulders of those in front, saw what it was, and was terrified; and then her interest in the spectacle as a strange phenomenon got the better of her fear. Farfrae, with Mayoral authority, immediately rose to the occasion. He seized Henchard by the shoulder, dragged him back, and told him roughly to be off. Henchard\u2019s eyes met his, and Farfrae observed the fierce light in them despite his excitement and irritation. For a moment Henchard stood his ground rigidly; then by an unaccountable impulse gave way and retired. Farfrae glanced to the ladies\u2019 gallery, and saw that his Calphurnia\u2019s cheek was pale. \u201cWhy\u2014it is your husband\u2019s old patron!\u201d said Mrs. Blowbody, a lady of the neighbourhood who sat beside Lucetta. \u201cPatron!\u201d said Donald\u2019s wife with quick indignation. \u201cDo you say the man is an acquaintance of Mr. Farfrae\u2019s?\u201d observed Mrs. Bath, the physician\u2019s wife, a new-comer to the town through her recent marriage with the doctor.", " He was not only a journeyman, unable to appear as he formerly had appeared, but he disdained to appear as well as he might. Everybody else, from the Mayor to the washerwoman, shone in new vesture according to means; but Henchard had doggedly retained the fretted and weather-beaten garments of bygone years. Hence, alas, this occurred: Lucetta\u2019s eyes slid over him to this side and to that without anchoring on his features\u2014as gaily dressed women\u2019s eyes will too often do on such occasions. Her manner signified quite plainly that she meant to know him in public no more. But she was never tired of watching Donald, as he stood in animated converse with his friends a few yards off, wearing round his young neck the official gold chain with great square links, like that round the Royal unicorn. Every trifling emotion that her husband showed as he talked had its reflex on her face and lips, which moved in little duplicates to his. She was living his part rather than her own, and cared for no one\u2019s situation but Farfrae\u2019s that day. At length a man stationed at the furthest turn of the high road, namely, on the second bridge of which mention has been made, gave a signal, and the Corporation in their robes proceeded from the front of the Town Hall to the archway erected at the entrance to the town. The carriages containing the Royal visitor and his suite arrived at the spot in a cloud of dust, a procession was formed, and the whole came on to the Town Hall at a walking pace.", " \u201cA good laugh warms my heart more than a cordial, and that\u2019s the truth on\u2019t.\u201d Jopp gathered up the letters, and it being now somewhat late he did not attempt to call at Farfrae\u2019s with them that night. He reached home, sealed them up as before, and delivered the parcel at its address next morning. Within an hour its contents were reduced to ashes by Lucetta, who, poor soul! was inclined to fall down on her knees in thankfulness that at last no evidence remained of the unlucky episode with Henchard in her past. For though hers had been rather the laxity of inadvertence than of intention, that episode, if known, was not the less likely to operate fatally between herself and her husband. XXXVII. Such was the state of things when the current affairs of Casterbridge were interrupted by an event of such magnitude that its influence reached to the lowest social stratum there, stirring the depths of its society simultaneously with the preparations for the skimmington. It was one of those excitements which, when they move a country town, leave permanent mark upon its chronicles, as a warm summer permanently marks the ring in the tree-trunk corresponding to its date. A Royal Personage was about to pass through the borough on his course further west, to inaugurate an immense engineering work out that way. He had consented to halt half-an-hour or so in the town, and to receive an address from the corporation of Casterbridge, which, as a representative centre of husbandry, wished thus to express its sense of the great services he had rendered to agricultural science and economics, by his zealous promotion of designs for placing the art of farming on a more scientific footing."], "What event causesElizabeth-Jane to sever her ties with Henchard?": [" \u201cBegad!\u201d he suddenly exclaimed, jumping up. \u201cI didn\u2019t think of that. Perhaps these are impostors\u2014and Susan and the child dead after all!\u201d However, a something in Elizabeth-Jane soon assured him that, as regarded her, at least, there could be little doubt. And a few hours would settle the question of her mother\u2019s identity; for he had arranged in his note to see her that evening. \u201cIt never rains but it pours!\u201d said Henchard. His keenly excited interest in his new friend the Scotchman was now eclipsed by this event, and Donald Farfrae saw so little of him during the rest of the day that he wondered at the suddenness of his employer\u2019s moods. In the meantime Elizabeth had reached the inn. Her mother, instead of taking the note with the curiosity of a poor woman expecting assistance, was much moved at sight of it. She did not read it at once, asking Elizabeth to describe her reception, and the very words Mr. Henchard used. Elizabeth\u2019s back was turned when her mother opened the letter. It ran thus:\u2014 \u201cMeet me at eight o\u2019clock this evening, if you can, at the Ring on the Budmouth road. The place is easy to find. I can say no more now. The news upsets me almost. The girl seems to be in ignorance. Keep her so till I have seen you. M. H.\u201d He said nothing about the enclosure of five guineas. The amount was significant; it may tacitly have said to her that he bought her back again. She waited restlessly for the close of the day, telling Elizabeth-Jane that she was invited to see Mr. Henchard; that she would go alone.", " Henchard watched him with his mouth firmly set, the squareness of his jaw and the verticality of his profile being unduly marked. Farfrae came on with one hand in his pocket, and humming a tune in a way which told that the words were most in his mind. They were those of the song he had sung when he arrived years before at the Three Mariners, a poor young man, adventuring for life and fortune, and scarcely knowing witherward:\u2014 \u201cAnd here\u2019s a hand, my trusty fiere, And gie\u2019s a hand o\u2019 thine.\u201d Nothing moved Henchard like an old melody. He sank back. \u201cNo; I can\u2019t do it!\u201d he gasped. \u201cWhy does the infernal fool begin that now!\u201d At length Farfrae was silent, and Henchard looked out of the loft door. \u201cWill ye come up here?\u201d he said. \u201cAy, man,\u201d said Farfrae. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see ye. What\u2019s wrang?\u201d A minute later Henchard heard his feet on the lowest ladder. He heard him land on the first floor, ascend and land on the second, begin the ascent to the third. And then his head rose through the trap behind. \u201cWhat are you doing up here at this time?\u201d he asked, coming forward. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t ye take your holiday like the rest of the men?\u201d He spoke in a tone which had just severity enough in it to show that he remembered the untoward event of the forenoon, and his conviction that Henchard had been drinking. Henchard said nothing; but going back he closed the stair hatchway, and stamped upon it so that it went tight into its frame; he next turned to the wondering young man, who by this time observed that one of Henchard\u2019s arms was bound to his side.", " I am glad you acted fairly by her. As soon as I knew she was no more, it was brought home to me very forcibly by my conscience that I ought to endeavour to disperse the shade which my _\u00e9tourderie_ flung over my name, by asking you to carry out your promise to me. I hope you are of the same mind, and that you will take steps to this end. As, however, I did not know how you were situated, or what had happened since our separation, I decided to come and establish myself here before communicating with you. You probably feel as I do about this. I shall be able to see you in a day or two. Till then, farewell.\u2014Yours, LUCETTA. _P.S._\u2014I was unable to keep my appointment to meet you for a moment or two in passing through Casterbridge the other day. My plans were altered by a family event, which it will surprise you to hear of. Henchard had already heard that High-Place Hall was being prepared for a tenant. He said with a puzzled air to the first person he encountered, \u201cWho is coming to live at the Hall?\u201d \u201cA lady of the name of Templeman, I believe, sir,\u201d said his informant. Henchard thought it over. \u201cLucetta is related to her, I suppose,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cYes, I must put her in her proper position, undoubtedly.\u201d It was by no means with the oppression that would once have accompanied the thought that he regarded the moral necessity now; it was, indeed, with interest, if not warmth. His bitter disappointment at finding Elizabeth-Jane to be none of his, and himself a childless man, had left an emotional void in Henchard that he unconsciously craved to fill.", " Despite this natural solution of the mystery Henchard no less regarded it as an intervention that the figure should have been floating there. Elizabeth-Jane heard him say, \u201cWho is such a reprobate as I! And yet it seems that even I be in Somebody\u2019s hand!\u201d XLII. But the emotional conviction that he was in Somebody\u2019s hand began to die out of Henchard\u2019s breast as time slowly removed into distance the event which had given that feeling birth. The apparition of Newson haunted him. He would surely return. Yet Newson did not arrive. Lucetta had been borne along the churchyard path; Casterbridge had for the last time turned its regard upon her, before proceeding to its work as if she had never lived. But Elizabeth remained undisturbed in the belief of her relationship to Henchard, and now shared his home. Perhaps, after all, Newson was gone for ever. In due time the bereaved Farfrae had learnt the, at least, proximate cause of Lucetta\u2019s illness and death, and his first impulse was naturally enough to wreak vengeance in the name of the law upon the perpetrators of the mischief. He resolved to wait till the funeral was over ere he moved in the matter. The time having come he reflected. Disastrous as the result had been, it was obviously in no way foreseen or intended by the thoughtless crew who arranged the motley procession. The tempting prospect of putting to the blush people who stand at the head of affairs\u2014that supreme and piquant enjoyment of those who writhe under the heel of the same\u2014had alone animated them, so far as he could see; for he knew nothing of Jopp\u2019s incitements."], "Who cares forHenchard in his dying days?": [" Well, before I go, let me ask this: Though you are not the young man I thought you were, what\u2019s the difference? Can\u2019t ye stay just the same? Have you really made up your mind about this American notion? I won\u2019t mince matters. I feel you would be invaluable to me\u2014that needn\u2019t be said\u2014and if you will bide and be my manager, I will make it worth your while.\u201d \u201cMy plans are fixed,\u201d said the young man, in negative tones. \u201cI have formed a scheme, and so we need na say any more about it. But will you not drink with me, sir? I find this Casterbridge ale warreming to the stomach.\u201d \u201cNo, no; I fain would, but I can\u2019t,\u201d said Henchard gravely, the scraping of his chair informing the listeners that he was rising to leave. \u201cWhen I was a young man I went in for that sort of thing too strong\u2014far too strong\u2014and was well-nigh ruined by it! I did a deed on account of it which I shall be ashamed of to my dying day. It made such an impression on me that I swore, there and then, that I\u2019d drink nothing stronger than tea for as many years as I was old that day. I have kept my oath; and though, Farfrae, I am sometimes that dry in the dog days that I could drink a quarter-barrel to the pitching, I think o\u2019 my oath, and touch no strong drink at all.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll no\u2019 press ye, sir\u2014I\u2019ll no\u2019 press ye. I respect your vow.\u201d \u201cWell, I shall get a manager somewhere, no doubt,\u201d said Henchard, with strong feeling in his tones.", " But he shut them up like a vice, and uttered not a sound. How should he, there and then, set before her with any effect the palliatives of his great faults\u2014that he had himself been deceived in her identity at first, till informed by her mother\u2019s letter that his own child had died; that, in the second accusation, his lie had been the last desperate throw of a gamester who loved her affection better than his own honour? Among the many hindrances to such a pleading not the least was this, that he did not sufficiently value himself to lessen his sufferings by strenuous appeal or elaborate argument. Waiving, therefore, his privilege of self-defence, he regarded only his discomposure. \u201cDon\u2019t ye distress yourself on my account,\u201d he said, with proud superiority. \u201cI would not wish it\u2014at such a time, too, as this. I have done wrong in coming to \u2019ee\u2014I see my error. But it is only for once, so forgive it. I\u2019ll never trouble \u2019ee again, Elizabeth-Jane\u2014no, not to my dying day! Good-night. Good-bye!\u201d Then, before she could collect her thoughts, Henchard went out from her rooms, and departed from the house by the back way as he had come; and she saw him no more. XLV. It was about a month after the day which closed as in the last chapter. Elizabeth-Jane had grown accustomed to the novelty of her situation, and the only difference between Donald\u2019s movements now and formerly was that he hastened indoors rather more quickly after business hours than he had been in the habit of doing for some time.", " The seal had cracked, and the letter was open. Henchard had no reason to suppose the restriction one of serious weight, and his feeling for his late wife had not been of the nature of deep respect. \u201cSome trifling fancy or other of poor Susan\u2019s, I suppose,\u201d he said; and without curiosity he allowed his eyes to scan the letter:\u2014 MY DEAR MICHAEL,\u2014For the good of all three of us I have kept one thing a secret from you till now. I hope you will understand why; I think you will; though perhaps you may not forgive me. But, dear Michael, I have done it for the best. I shall be in my grave when you read this, and Elizabeth-Jane will have a home. Don\u2019t curse me Mike\u2014think of how I was situated. I can hardly write it, but here it is. Elizabeth-Jane is not your Elizabeth-Jane\u2014the child who was in my arms when you sold me. No; she died three months after that, and this living one is my other husband\u2019s. I christened her by the same name we had given to the first, and she filled up the ache I felt at the other\u2019s loss. Michael, I am dying, and I might have held my tongue; but I could not. Tell her husband of this or not, as you may judge; and forgive, if you can, a woman you once deeply wronged, as she forgives you. SUSAN HENCHARD Her husband regarded the paper as if it were a window-pane through which he saw for miles. His lips twitched, and he seemed to compress his frame, as if to bear better.", " \u201cA fellow of his age going to be Mayor, indeed!\u201d he murmured with a corner-drawn smile on his mouth. \u201cBut \u2019tis her money that floats en upward. Ha-ha\u2014how cust odd it is! Here be I, his former master, working for him as man, and he the man standing as master, with my house and my furniture and my what-you-may-call wife all his own.\u201d He repeated these things a hundred times a day. During the whole period of his acquaintance with Lucetta he had never wished to claim her as his own so desperately as he now regretted her loss. It was no mercenary hankering after her fortune that moved him, though that fortune had been the means of making her so much the more desired by giving her the air of independence and sauciness which attracts men of his composition. It had given her servants, house, and fine clothing\u2014a setting that invested Lucetta with a startling novelty in the eyes of him who had known her in her narrow days. He accordingly lapsed into moodiness, and at every allusion to the possibility of Farfrae\u2019s near election to the municipal chair his former hatred of the Scotchman returned. Concurrently with this he underwent a moral change. It resulted in his significantly saying every now and then, in tones of recklessness, \u201cOnly a fortnight more!\u201d\u2014\u201cOnly a dozen days!\u201d and so forth, lessening his figures day by day. \u201cWhy d\u2019ye say only a dozen days?\u201d asked Solomon Longways as he worked beside Henchard in the granary weighing oats."], "To what biblicalfigure does Henchard compare himself in his suffering?": [" It is not for myself I want it, but for our unlucky fellow-townsman Henchard. It would be a new beginning for him, if a small one; and I have told the Council that I would head a private subscription among them to set him up in it\u2014that I would be fifty pounds, if they would make up the other fifty among them.\u201d \u201cYes, yes; so I\u2019ve heard; and there\u2019s nothing to say against it for that matter,\u201d the town-clerk replied, in his plain, frank way. \u201cBut, Farfrae, others see what you don\u2019t. Henchard hates \u2019ee\u2014ay, hates \u2019ee; and \u2019tis right that you should know it. To my knowledge he was at the Three Mariners last night, saying in public that about you which a man ought not to say about another.\u201d \u201cIs that so\u2014ah, is that so?\u201d said Farfrae, looking down. \u201cWhy should he do it?\u201d added the young man bitterly; \u201cwhat harm have I done him that he should try to wrong me?\u201d \u201cGod only knows,\u201d said Joyce, lifting his eyebrows. \u201cIt shows much long-suffering in you to put up with him, and keep him in your employ.\u201d \u201cBut I cannet discharge a man who was once a good friend to me. How can I forget that when I came here \u2019twas he enabled me to make a footing for mysel\u2019? No, no. As long as I\u2019ve a day\u2019s work to offer he shall do it if he chooses. \u2019Tis not I who will deny him such a little as that. But I\u2019ll drop the idea of establishing him in a shop till I can think more about it.\u201d It grieved Farfrae much to give up this scheme.", " He need have made no inquiries beforehand, for on drawing near Farfrae\u2019s residence it was plain to the least observant that festivity prevailed within, and that Donald himself shared it, his voice being distinctly audible in the street, giving strong expression to a song of his dear native country that he loved so well as never to have revisited it. Idlers were standing on the pavement in front; and wishing to escape the notice of these Henchard passed quickly on to the door. It was wide open, the hall was lighted extravagantly, and people were going up and down the stairs. His courage failed him; to enter footsore, laden, and poorly dressed into the midst of such resplendency was to bring needless humiliation upon her he loved, if not to court repulse from her husband. Accordingly he went round into the street at the back that he knew so well, entered the garden, and came quietly into the house through the kitchen, temporarily depositing the bird and cage under a bush outside, to lessen the awkwardness of his arrival. Solitude and sadness had so emolliated Henchard that he now feared circumstances he would formerly have scorned, and he began to wish that he had not taken upon himself to arrive at such a juncture. However, his progress was made unexpectedly easy by his discovering alone in the kitchen an elderly woman who seemed to be acting as provisional housekeeper during the convulsions from which Farfrae\u2019s establishment was just then suffering.", " At first it was indistinct by reason of the shadow from the bank; but it emerged thence and took shape, which was that of a human body, lying stiff and stark upon the surface of the stream. In the circular current imparted by the central flow the form was brought forward, till it passed under his eyes; and then he perceived with a sense of horror that it was _himself_. Not a man somewhat resembling him, but one in all respects his counterpart, his actual double, was floating as if dead in Ten Hatches Hole. The sense of the supernatural was strong in this unhappy man, and he turned away as one might have done in the actual presence of an appalling miracle. He covered his eyes and bowed his head. Without looking again into the stream he took his coat and hat, and went slowly away. Presently he found himself by the door of his own dwelling. To his surprise Elizabeth-Jane was standing there. She came forward, spoke, called him \u201cfather\u201d just as before. Newson, then, had not even yet returned. \u201cI thought you seemed very sad this morning,\u201d she said, \u201cso I have come again to see you. Not that I am anything but sad myself. But everybody and everything seem against you so, and I know you must be suffering.\u201d How this woman divined things! Yet she had not divined their whole extremity. He said to her, \u201cAre miracles still worked, do ye think, Elizabeth? I am not a read man. I don\u2019t know so much as I could wish.", " The hedge of his garden formed an arch over the entrance, and a door was inserted as in a wall. Outside the door the tall traveller stopped, bandaged his face with a handkerchief as if he were suffering from toothache, and went up the path. The window shutters were not closed, and he could see the prophet within, preparing his supper. In answer to the knock Fall came to the door, candle in hand. The visitor stepped back a little from the light, and said, \u201cCan I speak to \u2019ee?\u201d in significant tones. The other\u2019s invitation to come in was responded to by the country formula, \u201cThis will do, thank \u2019ee,\u201d after which the householder had no alternative but to come out. He placed the candle on the corner of the dresser, took his hat from a nail, and joined the stranger in the porch, shutting the door behind him. \u201cI\u2019ve long heard that you can\u2014do things of a sort?\u201d began the other, repressing his individuality as much as he could. \u201cMaybe so, Mr. Henchard,\u201d said the weather-caster. \u201cAh\u2014why do you call me that?\u201d asked the visitor with a start. \u201cBecause it\u2019s your name. Feeling you\u2019d come I\u2019ve waited for \u2019ee; and thinking you might be leery from your walk I laid two supper plates\u2014look ye here.\u201d He threw open the door and disclosed the supper-table, at which appeared a second chair, knife and fork, plate and mug, as he had declared. Henchard felt like Saul at his reception by Samuel; he remained in silence for a few moments, then throwing off the disguise of frigidity which he had hitherto preserved he said, \u201cThen I have not come in vain.... Now, for instance, can ye charm away warts?\u201d \u201cWithout trouble.\u201d \u201cCure the evil?\u201d \u201cThat I\u2019ve done\u2014with consideration\u2014if they will wear the toad-bag by night as well as by day.\u201d \u201cForecast the weather?\u201d \u201cWith labour and time.\u201d \u201cThen take this,\u201d said Henchard."], "What does Michael Henchard sell in an auction?": [" \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t they put \u2019em up and sell \u2019em by auction to men who are in need of such articles? Hey? Why, begad, I\u2019d sell mine this minute if anybody would buy her!\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s them that would do that,\u201d some of the guests replied, looking at the woman, who was by no means ill-favoured. \u201cTrue,\u201d said a smoking gentleman, whose coat had the fine polish about the collar, elbows, seams, and shoulder-blades that long-continued friction with grimy surfaces will produce, and which is usually more desired on furniture than on clothes. From his appearance he had possibly been in former time groom or coachman to some neighbouring county family. \u201cI\u2019ve had my breedings in as good circles, I may say, as any man,\u201d he added, \u201cand I know true cultivation, or nobody do; and I can declare she\u2019s got it\u2014in the bone, mind ye, I say\u2014as much as any female in the fair\u2014though it may want a little bringing out.\u201d Then, crossing his legs, he resumed his pipe with a nicely-adjusted gaze at a point in the air. The fuddled young husband stared for a few seconds at this unexpected praise of his wife, half in doubt of the wisdom of his own attitude towards the possessor of such qualities. But he speedily lapsed into his former conviction, and said harshly\u2014 \u201cWell, then, now is your chance; I am open to an offer for this gem o\u2019 creation.\u201d She turned to her husband and murmured, \u201cMichael, you have talked this nonsense in public places before.", " The seal had cracked, and the letter was open.

His lips twitched, and he seemed to compress his frame, as if to bear better.", " \u201cIf they don\u2019t take her for that, in ten seconds they\u2019ll have to give more,\u201d said the husband. \u201cVery well. Now auctioneer, add another.\u201d \u201cThree guineas\u2014going for three guineas!\u201d said the rheumy man. \u201cNo bid?\u201d said the husband. \u201cGood Lord, why she\u2019s cost me fifty times the money, if a penny.

But she shan\u2019t go for less. Now then\u2014five guineas\u2014and she\u2019s yours. Susan, you agree?\u201d She bowed her head with absolute indifference. \u201cFive guineas,\u201d said the auctioneer, \u201cor she\u2019ll be withdrawn. Do anybody give it? The last time. Yes or no?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said a loud voice from the doorway. All eyes were turned. Standing in the triangular opening which formed the door of the tent was a sailor, who, unobserved by the rest, had arrived there within the last two or three minutes. A dead silence followed his affirmation. \u201cYou say you do?\u201d asked the husband, staring at him. \u201cI say so,\u201d replied the sailor. \u201cSaying is one thing, and paying is another. Where\u2019s the money?\u201d The sailor hesitated a moment, looked anew at the woman, came in, unfolded five crisp pieces of paper, and threw them down upon the tablecloth.", " \u201cUpon the head of his bed he pinned a piece of paper, with some writing upon it,\u201d continued Abel Whittle. \u201cBut not being a man o\u2019 letters, I can\u2019t read writing; so I don\u2019t know what it is. I can get it and show ye.\u201d They stood in silence while he ran into the cottage; returning in a moment with a crumpled scrap of paper. On it there was pencilled as follows:\u2014 MICHAEL HENCHARD\u2019S WILL. \u201cThat Elizabeth-Jane Farfrae be not told of my death, or made to grieve on account of me. \u201c& that I be not bury\u2019d in consecrated ground. \u201c& that no sexton be asked to toll the bell. \u201c& that nobody is wished to see my dead body. \u201c& that no murners walk behind me at my funeral. \u201c& that no flours be planted on my grave. \u201c& that no man remember me. \u201cTo this I put my name. \u201cMICHAEL HENCHARD.\u201d \u201cWhat are we to do?\u201d said Donald, when he had handed the paper to her. She could not answer distinctly. \u201cO Donald!\u201d she cried at last through her tears, \u201cwhat bitterness lies there! O I would not have minded so much if it had not been for my unkindness at that last parting!... But there\u2019s no altering\u2014so it must be.\u201d What Henchard had written in the anguish of his dying was respected as far as practicable by Elizabeth-Jane, though less from a sense of the sacredness of last words, as such, than from her independent knowledge that the man who wrote them meant what he said. She knew the directions to be a piece of the same stuff that his whole life was made of, and hence were not to be tampered with to give herself a mournful pleasure, or her husband credit for large-heartedness."], "How many years after the auction does the sailor, Newson, die?": [" \u201cSurely you learnt that too?\u201d The sailor started up, and took an enervated pace or two down the room. \u201cDead!\u201d he said, in a low voice. \u201cThen what\u2019s the use of my money to me?\u201d Henchard, without answering, shook his head as if that were rather a question for Newson himself than for him. \u201cWhere is she buried?\u201d the traveller inquired. \u201cBeside her mother,\u201d said Henchard, in the same stolid tones. \u201cWhen did she die?\u201d \u201cA year ago and more,\u201d replied the other without hesitation. The sailor continued standing. Henchard never looked up from the floor. At last Newson said: \u201cMy journey hither has been for nothing! I may as well go as I came! It has served me right. I\u2019ll trouble you no longer.\u201d Henchard heard the retreating footsteps of Newson upon the sanded floor, the mechanical lifting of the latch, the slow opening and closing of the door that was natural to a baulked or dejected man; but he did not turn his head. Newson\u2019s shadow passed the window. He was gone. Then Henchard, scarcely believing the evidence of his senses, rose from his seat amazed at what he had done. It had been the impulse of a moment. The regard he had lately acquired for Elizabeth, the new-sprung hope of his loneliness that she would be to him a daughter of whom he could feel as proud as of the actual daughter she still believed herself to be, had been stimulated by the unexpected coming of Newson to a greedy exclusiveness in relation to her; so that the sudden prospect of her loss had caused him to speak mad lies like a child, in pure mockery of consequences.", " That\u2019s plain enough. It has been done elsewhere\u2014and why not here?\u201d \u201c\u2019Tis quite on the understanding that the young woman is willing,\u201d said the sailor blandly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t hurt her feelings for the world.\u201d \u201cFaith, nor I,\u201d said her husband. \u201cBut she is willing, provided she can have the child. She said so only the other day when I talked o\u2019t!\u201d \u201cThat you swear?\u201d said the sailor to her. \u201cI do,\u201d said she, after glancing at her husband\u2019s face and seeing no repentance there. \u201cVery well, she shall have the child, and the bargain\u2019s complete,\u201d said the trusser. He took the sailor\u2019s notes and deliberately folded them, and put them with the shillings in a high remote pocket, with an air of finality. The sailor looked at the woman and smiled. \u201cCome along!\u201d he said kindly. \u201cThe little one too\u2014the more the merrier!\u201d She paused for an instant, with a close glance at him. Then dropping her eyes again, and saying nothing, she took up the child and followed him as he made towards the door. On reaching it, she turned, and pulling off her wedding-ring, flung it across the booth in the hay-trusser\u2019s face. \u201cMike,\u201d she said, \u201cI\u2019ve lived with thee a couple of years, and had nothing but temper! Now I\u2019m no more to \u2019ee; I\u2019ll try my luck elsewhere. \u2019Twill be better for me and Elizabeth-Jane, both. So good-bye!\u201d Seizing the sailor\u2019s arm with her right hand, and mounting the little girl on her left, she went out of the tent sobbing bitterly.", " He had expected questions to close in round him, and unmask his fabrication in five minutes; yet such questioning had not come. But surely they would come; Newson\u2019s departure could be but momentary; he would learn all by inquiries in the town; and return to curse him, and carry his last treasure away! He hastily put on his hat, and went out in the direction that Newson had taken. Newson\u2019s back was soon visible up the road, crossing Bull-stake. Henchard followed, and saw his visitor stop at the King\u2019s Arms, where the morning coach which had brought him waited half-an-hour for another coach which crossed there. The coach Newson had come by was now about to move again. Newson mounted, his luggage was put in, and in a few minutes the vehicle disappeared with him. He had not so much as turned his head. It was an act of simple faith in Henchard\u2019s words\u2014faith so simple as to be almost sublime. The young sailor who had taken Susan Henchard on the spur of the moment and on the faith of a glance at her face, more than twenty years before, was still living and acting under the form of the grizzled traveller who had taken Henchard\u2019s words on trust so absolute as to shame him as he stood. Was Elizabeth-Jane to remain his by virtue of this hardy invention of a moment? \u201cPerhaps not for long,\u201d said he. Newson might converse with his fellow-travellers, some of whom might be Casterbridge people; and the trick would be discovered.", " Farfrae flung open the door of the ground-floor sitting-room, saying, \u201cThere he is waiting for you,\u201d and Elizabeth entered. In the arm-chair sat the broad-faced genial man who had called on Henchard on a memorable morning between one and two years before this time, and whom the latter had seen mount the coach and depart within half-an-hour of his arrival. It was Richard Newson. The meeting with the light-hearted father from whom she had been separated half-a-dozen years, as if by death, need hardly be detailed. It was an affecting one, apart from the question of paternity. Henchard\u2019s departure was in a moment explained. When the true facts came to be handled the difficulty of restoring her to her old belief in Newson was not so great as might have seemed likely, for Henchard\u2019s conduct itself was a proof that those facts were true. Moreover, she had grown up under Newson\u2019s paternal care; and even had Henchard been her father in nature, this father in early domiciliation might almost have carried the point against him, when the incidents of her parting with Henchard had a little worn off. Newson\u2019s pride in what she had grown up to be was more than he could express. He kissed her again and again. \u201cI\u2019ve saved you the trouble to come and meet me\u2014ha-ha!\u201d said Newson. \u201cThe fact is that Mr. Farfrae here, he said, \u2018Come up and stop with me for a day or two, Captain Newson, and I\u2019ll bring her round.\u2019 \u2018Faith,\u2019 says I, \u2018so I will\u2019; and here I am.\u201d \u201cWell, Henchard is gone,\u201d said Farfrae, shutting the door."], "Who does Elizabeth-Jane go to live with after Henchard becomes cold towards her?": [" They sat down to breakfast, and Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s thoughts reverted to Lucetta. Their sadness added charm to a countenance whose beauty had ever lain in its meditative soberness. \u201cFather,\u201d she said, as soon as she recalled herself to the outspread meal, \u201cit is so kind of you to get this nice breakfast with your own hands, and I idly asleep the while.\u201d \u201cI do it every day,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou have left me; everybody has left me; how should I live but by my own hands.\u201d \u201cYou are very lonely, are you not?\u201d \u201cAy, child\u2014to a degree that you know nothing of! It is my own fault. You are the only one who has been near me for weeks. And you will come no more.\u201d \u201cWhy do you say that? Indeed I will, if you would like to see me.\u201d Henchard signified dubiousness. Though he had so lately hoped that Elizabeth-Jane might again live in his house as daughter, he would not ask her to do so now. Newson might return at any moment, and what Elizabeth would think of him for his deception it were best to bear apart from her. When they had breakfasted his stepdaughter still lingered, till the moment arrived at which Henchard was accustomed to go to his daily work. Then she arose, and with assurance of coming again soon went up the hill in the morning sunlight. \u201cAt this moment her heart is as warm towards me as mine is towards her, she would live with me here in this humble cottage for the asking! Yet before the evening probably he will have come, and then she will scorn me!\u201d This reflection, constantly repeated by Henchard to himself, accompanied him everywhere through the day.", " A yellow flood of reflected sunlight filled the room for a few instants. It was produced by the passing of a load of newly trussed hay from the country, in a waggon marked with Farfrae\u2019s name. Beside it rode Farfrae himself on horseback. Lucetta\u2019s face became\u2014as a woman\u2019s face becomes when the man she loves rises upon her gaze like an apparition. A turn of the eye by Henchard, a glance from the window, and the secret of her inaccessibility would have been revealed. But Henchard in estimating her tone was looking down so plumb-straight that he did not note the warm consciousness upon Lucetta\u2019s face. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have thought it\u2014I shouldn\u2019t have thought it of women!\u201d he said emphatically by-and-by, rising and shaking himself into activity; while Lucetta was so anxious to divert him from any suspicion of the truth that she asked him to be in no hurry. Bringing him some apples she insisted upon paring one for him. He would not take it. \u201cNo, no; such is not for me,\u201d he said drily, and moved to the door. At going out he turned his eye upon her. \u201cYou came to live in Casterbridge entirely on my account,\u201d he said. \u201cYet now you are here you won\u2019t have anything to say to my offer!\u201d He had hardly gone down the staircase when she dropped upon the sofa and jumped up again in a fit of desperation. \u201cI will love him!\u201d she cried passionately; \u201cas for _him_\u2014he\u2019s hot-tempered and stern, and it would be madness to bind myself to him knowing that.", " Henchard pushed to the door, and for some seconds made no other movement. He rose to his feet, and stood like a dark ruin, obscured by \u201cthe shade from his own soul up-thrown.\u201d But he was no longer the man to stand these reverses unmoved. His agitation was great, and he would fain have been gone, but before he could leave the dance had ended, the housekeeper had informed Elizabeth-Jane of the stranger who awaited her, and she entered the room immediately. \u201cOh\u2014it is\u2014Mr. Henchard!\u201d she said, starting back. \u201cWhat, Elizabeth?\u201d he cried, as she seized her hand. \u201cWhat do you say?\u2014_Mr._ Henchard? Don\u2019t, don\u2019t scourge me like that! Call me worthless old Henchard\u2014anything\u2014but don\u2019t \u2019ee be so cold as this! O my maid\u2014I see you have another\u2014a real father in my place. Then you know all; but don\u2019t give all your thought to him! Do ye save a little room for me!\u201d She flushed up, and gently drew her hand away. \u201cI could have loved you always\u2014I would have, gladly,\u201d she said. \u201cBut how can I when I know you have deceived me so\u2014so bitterly deceived me! You persuaded me that my father was not my father\u2014allowed me to live on in ignorance of the truth for years; and then when he, my warm-hearted real father, came to find me, cruelly sent him away with a wicked invention of my death, which nearly broke his heart. O how can I love as I once did a man who has served us like this!\u201d Henchard\u2019s lips half parted to begin an explanation.", " \u201cI\u2014sometimes think I\u2019ve wronged \u2019ee!\u201d he said, in tones which showed the disquietude that the night shades hid in his face. He shook Farfrae abruptly by the hand, and hastened away as if unwilling to betray himself further. Farfrae saw him turn through the thoroughfare into Bull Stake and vanish down towards the Priory Mill. Meanwhile Elizabeth-Jane, in an upper room no larger than the Prophet\u2019s chamber, and with the silk attire of her palmy days packed away in a box, was netting with great industry between the hours which she devoted to studying such books as she could get hold of. Her lodgings being nearly opposite her stepfather\u2019s former residence, now Farfrae\u2019s, she could see Donald and Lucetta speeding in and out of their door with all the bounding enthusiasm of their situation. She avoided looking that way as much as possible, but it was hardly in human nature to keep the eyes averted when the door slammed. While living on thus quietly she heard the news that Henchard had caught cold and was confined to his room\u2014possibly a result of standing about the meads in damp weather. She went off to his house at once. This time she was determined not to be denied admittance, and made her way upstairs. He was sitting up in the bed with a greatcoat round him, and at first resented her intrusion. \u201cGo away\u2014go away,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t like to see \u2019ee!\u201d \u201cBut, father\u2014\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t like to see \u2019ee,\u201d he repeated."], "Who does the \u201cskimmity ride\u201d parade make fun of?": [" Getting a schoolboy to write ours for us; and giving him a penny, do ye mind, not to tell other folks what he\u2019d put inside, do ye mind?\u201d By this time Jopp had pushed his finger under the seals, and unfastened the letters, tumbling them over and picking up one here and there at random, which he read aloud. These passages soon began to uncover the secret which Lucetta had so earnestly hoped to keep buried, though the epistles, being allusive only, did not make it altogether plain. \u201cMrs. Farfrae wrote that!\u201d said Nance Mockridge. \u201c\u2019Tis a humbling thing for us, as respectable women, that one of the same sex could do it. And now she\u2019s avowed herself to another man!\u201d \u201cSo much the better for her,\u201d said the aged furmity-woman. \u201cAh, I saved her from a real bad marriage, and she\u2019s never been the one to thank me.\u201d \u201cI say, what a good foundation for a skimmity-ride,\u201d said Nance. \u201cTrue,\u201d said Mrs. Cuxsom, reflecting. \u201c\u2019Tis as good a ground for a skimmity-ride as ever I knowed; and it ought not to be wasted. The last one seen in Casterbridge must have been ten years ago, if a day.\u201d At this moment there was a shrill whistle, and the landlady said to the man who had been called Charl, \u201c\u2019Tis Jim coming in. Would ye go and let down the bridge for me?\u201d Without replying Charl and his comrade Joe rose, and receiving a lantern from her went out at the back door and down the garden-path, which ended abruptly at the edge of the stream already mentioned.", " But that\u2019s not for me!\u201d What he would have asked her he did not say, and instead of encouraging him she remained incompetently silent. Thus afraid one of another they continued their promenade along the walls till they got near the bottom of the Bowling Walk; twenty steps further and the trees would end, and the street-corner and lamps appear. In consciousness of this they stopped. \u201cI never found out who it was that sent us to Durnover granary on a fool\u2019s errand that day,\u201d said Donald, in his undulating tones. \u201cDid ye ever know yourself, Miss Newson?\u201d \u201cNever,\u201d said she. \u201cI wonder why they did it!\u201d \u201cFor fun, perhaps.\u201d \u201cPerhaps it was not for fun. It might have been that they thought they would like us to stay waiting there, talking to one another? Ay, well! I hope you Casterbridge folk will not forget me if I go.\u201d \u201cThat I\u2019m sure we won\u2019t!\u201d she said earnestly. \u201cI\u2014wish you wouldn\u2019t go at all.\u201d They had got into the lamplight. \u201cNow, I\u2019ll think over that,\u201d said Donald Farfrae. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll not come up to your door; but part from you here; lest it make your father more angry still.\u201d They parted, Farfrae returning into the dark Bowling Walk, and Elizabeth-Jane going up the street. Without any consciousness of what she was doing she started running with all her might till she reached her father\u2019s door. \u201cO dear me\u2014what am I at?\u201d she thought, as she pulled up breathless. Indoors she fell to conjecturing the meaning of Farfrae\u2019s enigmatic words about not daring to ask her what he fain would.", " He was a middle-aged man, with hair and whiskers prematurely grey, and a broad and genial face. He had crossed on the plank without hesitation, and seemed to see nothing odd in the transit. He thanked them, and walked between them up the garden. \u201cWhat place is this?\u201d he asked, when they reached the door. \u201cA public-house.\u201d \u201cAh, perhaps it will suit me to put up at. Now then, come in and wet your whistle at my expense for the lift over you have given me.\u201d They followed him into the inn, where the increased light exhibited him as one who would stand higher in an estimate by the eye than in one by the ear. He was dressed with a certain clumsy richness\u2014his coat being furred, and his head covered by a cap of seal-skin, which, though the nights were chilly, must have been warm for the daytime, spring being somewhat advanced. In his hand he carried a small mahogany case, strapped, and clamped with brass. Apparently surprised at the kind of company which confronted him through the kitchen door, he at once abandoned his idea of putting up at the house; but taking the situation lightly, he called for glasses of the best, paid for them as he stood in the passage, and turned to proceed on his way by the front door. This was barred, and while the landlady was unfastening it the conversation about the skimmington was continued in the sitting-room, and reached his ears. \u201cWhat do they mean by a \u2018skimmity-ride\u2019?\u201d he asked.", " Now there\u2019s a better-looking woman than she that nobody notices at all, because she\u2019s akin to that hontish fellow Henchard.\u201d \u201cI could worship ye, Buzz, for saying that,\u201d remarked Nance Mockridge. \u201cI do like to see the trimming pulled off such Christmas candles. I am quite unequal to the part of villain myself, or I\u2019d gi\u2019e all my small silver to see that lady toppered.... And perhaps I shall soon,\u201d she added significantly. \u201cThat\u2019s not a noble passiont for a \u2019oman to keep up,\u201d said Longways. Nance did not reply, but every one knew what she meant. The ideas diffused by the reading of Lucetta\u2019s letters at Peter\u2019s Finger had condensed into a scandal, which was spreading like a miasmatic fog through Mixen Lane, and thence up the back streets of Casterbridge. The mixed assemblage of idlers known to each other presently fell apart into two bands by a process of natural selection, the frequenters of Peter\u2019s Finger going off Mixen Lanewards, where most of them lived, while Coney, Buzzford, Longways, and that connection remained in the street. \u201cYou know what\u2019s brewing down there, I suppose?\u201d said Buzzford mysteriously to the others. Coney looked at him. \u201cNot the skimmity-ride?\u201d Buzzford nodded. \u201cI have my doubts if it will be carried out,\u201d said Longways. \u201cIf they are getting it up they are keeping it mighty close. \u201cI heard they were thinking of it a fortnight ago, at all events.\u201d \u201cIf I were sure o\u2019t I\u2019d lay information,\u201d said Longways emphatically."], "What is Henchard\u2019s dying wish?": [" But he shut them up like a vice, and uttered not a sound. How should he, there and then, set before her with any effect the palliatives of his great faults\u2014that he had himself been deceived in her identity at first, till informed by her mother\u2019s letter that his own child had died; that, in the second accusation, his lie had been the last desperate throw of a gamester who loved her affection better than his own honour? Among the many hindrances to such a pleading not the least was this, that he did not sufficiently value himself to lessen his sufferings by strenuous appeal or elaborate argument. Waiving, therefore, his privilege of self-defence, he regarded only his discomposure. \u201cDon\u2019t ye distress yourself on my account,\u201d he said, with proud superiority. \u201cI would not wish it\u2014at such a time, too, as this. I have done wrong in coming to \u2019ee\u2014I see my error. But it is only for once, so forgive it. I\u2019ll never trouble \u2019ee again, Elizabeth-Jane\u2014no, not to my dying day! Good-night. Good-bye!\u201d Then, before she could collect her thoughts, Henchard went out from her rooms, and departed from the house by the back way as he had come; and she saw him no more. XLV. It was about a month after the day which closed as in the last chapter. Elizabeth-Jane had grown accustomed to the novelty of her situation, and the only difference between Donald\u2019s movements now and formerly was that he hastened indoors rather more quickly after business hours than he had been in the habit of doing for some time.", " \u201cVery well,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll come.\u201d \u201cBut please will Mr. Farfrae come?\u201d said the child. \u201cI am going that way.... Why Mr. Farfrae?\u201d said Henchard, with the fixed look of thought. \u201cWhy do people always want Mr. Farfrae?\u201d \u201cI suppose because they like him so\u2014that\u2019s what they say.\u201d \u201cOh\u2014I see\u2014that\u2019s what they say\u2014hey? They like him because he\u2019s cleverer than Mr. Henchard, and because he knows more; and, in short, Mr. Henchard can\u2019t hold a candle to him\u2014hey?\u201d \u201cYes\u2014that\u2019s just it, sir\u2014some of it.\u201d \u201cOh, there\u2019s more? Of course there\u2019s more! What besides? Come, here\u2019s a sixpence for a fairing.\u201d \u201c\u2018And he\u2019s better tempered, and Henchard\u2019s a fool to him,\u2019 they say. And when some of the women were a-walking home they said, \u2018He\u2019s a diment\u2014he\u2019s a chap o\u2019 wax\u2014he\u2019s the best\u2014he\u2019s the horse for my money,\u2019 says they. And they said, \u2018He\u2019s the most understanding man o\u2019 them two by long chalks. I wish he was the master instead of Henchard,\u2019 they said.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ll talk any nonsense,\u201d Henchard replied with covered gloom. \u201cWell, you can go now. And _I_ am coming to value the hay, d\u2019ye hear?\u2014I.\u201d The boy departed, and Henchard murmured, \u201cWish he were master here, do they?\u201d He went towards Durnover. On his way he overtook Farfrae. They walked on together, Henchard looking mostly on the ground. \u201cYou\u2019re no yoursel\u2019 the day?\u201d Donald inquired. \u201cYes, I am very well,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cBut ye are a bit down\u2014surely ye are down?", " And thus Henchard found himself again on the precise standing which he had occupied a quarter of a century before. Externally there was nothing to hinder his making another start on the upward slope, and by his new lights achieving higher things than his soul in its half-formed state had been able to accomplish. But the ingenious machinery contrived by the Gods for reducing human possibilities of amelioration to a minimum\u2014which arranges that wisdom to do shall come _pari passu_ with the departure of zest for doing\u2014stood in the way of all that. He had no wish to make an arena a second time of a world that had become a mere painted scene to him. Very often, as his hay-knife crunched down among the sweet-smelling grassy stems, he would survey mankind and say to himself: \u201cHere and everywhere be folk dying before their time like frosted leaves, though wanted by their families, the country, and the world; while I, an outcast, an encumberer of the ground, wanted by nobody, and despised by all, live on against my will!\u201d He often kept an eager ear upon the conversation of those who passed along the road\u2014not from a general curiosity by any means\u2014but in the hope that among these travellers between Casterbridge and London some would, sooner or later, speak of the former place. The distance, however, was too great to lend much probability to his desire; and the highest result of his attention to wayside words was that he did indeed hear the name \u201cCasterbridge\u201d uttered one day by the driver of a road-waggon.", " There and thus they would muse; if their grief were the grief of oppression they would wish themselves kings; if their grief were poverty, wish themselves millionaires; if sin, they would wish they were saints or angels; if despised love, that they were some much-courted Adonis of county fame. Some had been known to stand and think so long with this fixed gaze downward that eventually they had allowed their poor carcases to follow that gaze; and they were discovered the next morning out of reach of their troubles, either here or in the deep pool called Blackwater, a little higher up the river. To this bridge came Henchard, as other unfortunates had come before him, his way thither being by the riverside path on the chilly edge of the town. Here he was standing one windy afternoon when Durnover church clock struck five. While the gusts were bringing the notes to his ears across the damp intervening flat a man passed behind him and greeted Henchard by name. Henchard turned slightly and saw that the corner was Jopp, his old foreman, now employed elsewhere, to whom, though he hated him, he had gone for lodgings because Jopp was the one man in Casterbridge whose observation and opinion the fallen corn-merchant despised to the point of indifference. Henchard returned him a scarcely perceptible nod, and Jopp stopped. \u201cHe and she are gone into their new house to-day,\u201d said Jopp. \u201cOh,\u201d said Henchard absently."], "What crop is Michael Henchard a merchant of?": [" The time was in the years immediately before foreign competition had revolutionized the trade in grain; when still, as from the earliest ages, the wheat quotations from month to month depended entirely upon the home harvest. A bad harvest, or the prospect of one, would double the price of corn in a few weeks; and the promise of a good yield would lower it as rapidly. Prices were like the roads of the period, steep in gradient, reflecting in their phases the local conditions, without engineering, levellings, or averages. The farmer\u2019s income was ruled by the wheat-crop within his own horizon, and the wheat-crop by the weather. Thus in person, he became a sort of flesh-barometer, with feelers always directed to the sky and wind around him. The local atmosphere was everything to him; the atmospheres of other countries a matter of indifference. The people, too, who were not farmers, the rural multitude, saw in the god of the weather a more important personage than they do now. Indeed, the feeling of the peasantry in this matter was so intense as to be almost unrealizable in these equable days. Their impulse was well-nigh to prostrate themselves in lamentation before untimely rains and tempests, which came as the Alastor of those households whose crime it was to be poor. After midsummer they watched the weather-cocks as men waiting in antechambers watch the lackey. Sun elated them; quiet rain sobered them; weeks of watery tempest stupefied them.", " The seal had cracked, and the letter was open. Henchard had no reason to suppose the restriction one of serious weight, and his feeling for his late wife had not been of the nature of deep respect. \u201cSome trifling fancy or other of poor Susan\u2019s, I suppose,\u201d he said; and without curiosity he allowed his eyes to scan the letter:\u2014 MY DEAR MICHAEL,\u2014For the good of all three of us I have kept one thing a secret from you till now. I hope you will understand why; I think you will; though perhaps you may not forgive me. But, dear Michael, I have done it for the best. I shall be in my grave when you read this, and Elizabeth-Jane will have a home. Don\u2019t curse me Mike\u2014think of how I was situated. I can hardly write it, but here it is. Elizabeth-Jane is not your Elizabeth-Jane\u2014the child who was in my arms when you sold me. No; she died three months after that, and this living one is my other husband\u2019s. I christened her by the same name we had given to the first, and she filled up the ache I felt at the other\u2019s loss. Michael, I am dying, and I might have held my tongue; but I could not. Tell her husband of this or not, as you may judge; and forgive, if you can, a woman you once deeply wronged, as she forgives you. SUSAN HENCHARD Her husband regarded the paper as if it were a window-pane through which he saw for miles. His lips twitched, and he seemed to compress his frame, as if to bear better.", " Had she lost her heart to any other man in the world than the one he had rivalled, cursed, wrestled with for life in days before his spirit was broken, Henchard would have said, \u201cI am content.\u201d But content with the prospect as now depicted was hard to acquire. There is an outer chamber of the brain in which thoughts unowned, unsolicited, and of noxious kind, are sometimes allowed to wander for a moment prior to being sent off whence they came. One of these thoughts sailed into Henchard\u2019s ken now. Suppose he were to communicate to Farfrae the fact that his betrothed was not the child of Michael Henchard at all\u2014legally, nobody\u2019s child; how would that correct and leading townsman receive the information? He might possibly forsake Elizabeth-Jane, and then she would be her step-sire\u2019s own again. Henchard shuddered, and exclaimed, \u201cGod forbid such a thing! Why should I still be subject to these visitations of the devil, when I try so hard to keep him away?\u201d XLIII. What Henchard saw thus early was, naturally enough, seen at a little later date by other people. That Mr. Farfrae \u201cwalked with that bankrupt Henchard\u2019s stepdaughter, of all women,\u201d became a common topic in the town, the simple perambulating term being used hereabout to signify a wooing; and the nineteen superior young ladies of Casterbridge, who had each looked upon herself as the only woman capable of making the merchant Councilman happy, indignantly left off going to the church Farfrae attended, left off conscious mannerisms, left off putting him in their prayers at night amongst their blood relations; in short, reverted to their normal courses.", " \u201cUpon the head of his bed he pinned a piece of paper, with some writing upon it,\u201d continued Abel Whittle. \u201cBut not being a man o\u2019 letters, I can\u2019t read writing; so I don\u2019t know what it is. I can get it and show ye.\u201d They stood in silence while he ran into the cottage; returning in a moment with a crumpled scrap of paper. On it there was pencilled as follows:\u2014 MICHAEL HENCHARD\u2019S WILL. \u201cThat Elizabeth-Jane Farfrae be not told of my death, or made to grieve on account of me. \u201c& that I be not bury\u2019d in consecrated ground. \u201c& that no sexton be asked to toll the bell. \u201c& that nobody is wished to see my dead body. \u201c& that no murners walk behind me at my funeral. \u201c& that no flours be planted on my grave. \u201c& that no man remember me. \u201cTo this I put my name. \u201cMICHAEL HENCHARD.\u201d \u201cWhat are we to do?\u201d said Donald, when he had handed the paper to her. She could not answer distinctly. \u201cO Donald!\u201d she cried at last through her tears, \u201cwhat bitterness lies there! O I would not have minded so much if it had not been for my unkindness at that last parting!... But there\u2019s no altering\u2014so it must be.\u201d What Henchard had written in the anguish of his dying was respected as far as practicable by Elizabeth-Jane, though less from a sense of the sacredness of last words, as such, than from her independent knowledge that the man who wrote them meant what he said. She knew the directions to be a piece of the same stuff that his whole life was made of, and hence were not to be tampered with to give herself a mournful pleasure, or her husband credit for large-heartedness."], "Who arrives in Casterbridge at the same time as Elizabeth-Jane and Susan?": [" The seal had cracked, and the letter was open. Henchard had no reason to suppose the restriction one of serious weight, and his feeling for his late wife had not been of the nature of deep respect. \u201cSome trifling fancy or other of poor Susan\u2019s, I suppose,\u201d he said; and without curiosity he allowed his eyes to scan the letter:\u2014 MY DEAR MICHAEL,\u2014For the good of all three of us I have kept one thing a secret from you till now.

He felt her bow her head in acknowledgment that she understood. After a minute or two he again began: \u201cIf I had known you were living, Susan! But there was every reason to suppose you and the child were dead and gone. I took every possible step to find you\u2014travelled\u2014advertised. My opinion at last was that you had started for some colony with that man, and had been drowned on your voyage. Why did you keep silent like this?\u201d \u201cO Michael! because of him\u2014what other reason could there be? I thought I owed him faithfulness to the end of one of our lives\u2014foolishly I believed there was something solemn and binding in the bargain; I thought that even in honour I dared not desert him when he had paid so much for me in good faith. I meet you now only as his widow\u2014I consider myself that, and that I have no claim upon you. Had he not died I should never have come\u2014never! Of that you may be sure.\u201d \u201cTut-tut! How could you be so simple?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. Yet it would have been very wicked\u2014if I had not thought like that!\u201d said Susan, almost crying. \u201cYes\u2014yes\u2014so it would. It is only that which makes me feel \u2019ee an innocent woman. But\u2014to lead me into this!\u201d \u201cWhat, Michael?\u201d she asked, alarmed. \u201cWhy, this difficulty about our living together again, and Elizabeth-Jane. She cannot be told all\u2014she would so despise us both that\u2014I could not bear it!\u201d \u201cThat was why she was brought up in ignorance of you.", " She looked startled, jerked his foot warningly, and murmured, \u201cDid I?\u201d As soon as Elizabeth was gone to her own room Henchard resumed. \u201cBegad, I nearly forgot myself just now! What I meant was that the girl\u2019s hair certainly looked as if it would be darker, when she was a baby.\u201d \u201cIt did; but they alter so,\u201d replied Susan. \u201cTheir hair gets darker, I know\u2014but I wasn\u2019t aware it lightened ever?\u201d \u201cO yes.\u201d And the same uneasy expression came out on her face, to which the future held the key. It passed as Henchard went on: \u201cWell, so much the better. Now Susan, I want to have her called Miss Henchard\u2014not Miss Newson. Lots o\u2019 people do it already in carelessness\u2014it is her legal name\u2014so it may as well be made her usual name\u2014I don\u2019t like t\u2019other name at all for my own flesh and blood. I\u2019ll advertise it in the Casterbridge paper\u2014that\u2019s the way they do it. She won\u2019t object.\u201d \u201cNo. O no. But\u2014\u201d \u201cWell, then, I shall do it,\u201d he said, peremptorily. \u201cSurely, if she\u2019s willing, you must wish it as much as I?\u201d \u201cO yes\u2014if she agrees let us do it by all means,\u201d she replied. Then Mrs. Henchard acted somewhat inconsistently; it might have been called falsely, but that her manner was emotional and full of the earnestness of one who wishes to do right at great hazard. She went to Elizabeth-Jane, whom she found sewing in her own sitting-room upstairs, and told her what had been proposed about her surname. \u201cCan you agree\u2014is it not a slight upon Newson\u2014now he\u2019s dead and gone?\u201d Elizabeth reflected.", " \u201cNow then, what is it, my young woman?\u201d he said blandly. \u201cCan I speak to you\u2014not on business, sir?\u201d said she. \u201cYes\u2014I suppose.\u201d He looked at her more thoughtfully. \u201cI am sent to tell you, sir,\u201d she innocently went on, \u201cthat a distant relative of yours by marriage, Susan Newson, a sailor\u2019s widow, is in the town, and to ask whether you would wish to see her.\u201d The rich _rouge-et-noir_ of his countenance underwent a slight change. \u201cOh\u2014Susan is\u2014still alive?\u201d he asked with difficulty. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d \u201cAre you her daughter?\u201d \u201cYes, sir\u2014her only daughter.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2014do you call yourself\u2014your Christian name?\u201d \u201cElizabeth-Jane, sir.\u201d \u201cNewson?\u201d \u201cElizabeth-Jane Newson.\u201d This at once suggested to Henchard that the transaction of his early married life at Weydon Fair was unrecorded in the family history. It was more than he could have expected. His wife had behaved kindly to him in return for his unkindness, and had never proclaimed her wrong to her child or to the world. \u201cI am\u2014a good deal interested in your news,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as this is not a matter of business, but pleasure, suppose we go indoors.\u201d It was with a gentle delicacy of manner, surprising to Elizabeth, that he showed her out of the office and through the outer room, where Donald Farfrae was overhauling bins and samples with the inquiring inspection of a beginner in charge. Henchard preceded her through the door in the wall to the suddenly changed scene of the garden and flowers, and onward into the house."], "Which character represents the inauspiciousness of peasant life?": [" \u201cElizabeth, come here!\u201d said Henchard; and she obeyed. \u201cWhy do you lower yourself so confoundedly?\u201d he said with suppressed passion. \u201cHaven\u2019t I told you o\u2019t fifty times? Hey? Making yourself a drudge for a common workwoman of such a character as hers! Why, ye\u2019ll disgrace me to the dust!\u201d Now these words were uttered loud enough to reach Nance inside the barn door, who fired up immediately at the slur upon her personal character. Coming to the door she cried regardless of consequences, \u201cCome to that, Mr. Henchard, I can let \u2019ee know she\u2019ve waited on worse!\u201d \u201cThen she must have had more charity than sense,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cO no, she hadn\u2019t. \u2019Twere not for charity but for hire; and at a public-house in this town!\u201d \u201cIt is not true!\u201d cried Henchard indignantly. \u201cJust ask her,\u201d said Nance, folding her naked arms in such a manner that she could comfortably scratch her elbows. Henchard glanced at Elizabeth-Jane, whose complexion, now pink and white from confinement, lost nearly all of the former colour. \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d he said to her. \u201cAnything or nothing?\u201d \u201cIt is true,\u201d said Elizabeth-Jane. \u201cBut it was only\u2014\u201d \u201cDid you do it, or didn\u2019t you? Where was it?\u201d \u201cAt the Three Mariners; one evening for a little while, when we were staying there.\u201d Nance glanced triumphantly at Henchard, and sailed into the barn; for assuming that she was to be discharged on the instant she had resolved to make the most of her victory.", " Her simplicity\u2014the original ground of Henchard\u2019s contempt for her\u2014had allowed her to live on in the conviction that Newson had acquired a morally real and justifiable right to her by his purchase\u2014though the exact bearings and legal limits of that right were vague. It may seem strange to sophisticated minds that a sane young matron could believe in the seriousness of such a transfer; and were there not numerous other instances of the same belief the thing might scarcely be credited. But she was by no means the first or last peasant woman who had religiously adhered to her purchaser, as too many rural records show. The history of Susan Henchard\u2019s adventures in the interim can be told in two or three sentences. Absolutely helpless she had been taken off to Canada where they had lived several years without any great worldly success, though she worked as hard as any woman could to keep their cottage cheerful and well-provided. When Elizabeth-Jane was about twelve years old the three returned to England, and settled at Falmouth, where Newson made a living for a few years as boatman and general handy shoreman. He then engaged in the Newfoundland trade, and it was during this period that Susan had an awakening. A friend to whom she confided her history ridiculed her grave acceptance of her position; and all was over with her peace of mind. When Newson came home at the end of one winter he saw that the delusion he had so carefully sustained had vanished for ever.", " Whether it were that his northern energy was an overmastering force among the easy-going Wessex worthies, or whether it was sheer luck, the fact remained that whatever he touched he prospered in. Like Jacob in Padan-Aram, he would no sooner humbly limit himself to the ringstraked-and-spotted exceptions of trade than the ringstraked-and-spotted would multiply and prevail. But most probably luck had little to do with it. Character is Fate, said Novalis, and Farfrae\u2019s character was just the reverse of Henchard\u2019s, who might not inaptly be described as Faust has been described\u2014as a vehement gloomy being who had quitted the ways of vulgar men without light to guide him on a better way. Farfrae duly received the request to discontinue attentions to Elizabeth-Jane. His acts of that kind had been so slight that the request was almost superfluous. Yet he had felt a considerable interest in her, and after some cogitation he decided that it would be as well to enact no Romeo part just then\u2014for the young girl\u2019s sake no less than his own. Thus the incipient attachment was stifled down. A time came when, avoid collision with his former friend as he might, Farfrae was compelled, in sheer self-defence, to close with Henchard in mortal commercial combat. He could no longer parry the fierce attacks of the latter by simple avoidance. As soon as their war of prices began everybody was interested, and some few guessed the end.", " Field labourers and their wives and children trooped in from the villages for their weekly shopping, and instead of a rattle of wheels and a tramp of horses ruling the sound as earlier, there was nothing but the shuffle of many feet. All the implements were gone; all the farmers; all the moneyed class. The character of the town\u2019s trading had changed from bulk to multiplicity and pence were handled now as pounds had been handled earlier in the day. Lucetta and Elizabeth looked out upon this, for though it was night and the street lamps were lighted, they had kept their shutters unclosed. In the faint blink of the fire they spoke more freely. \u201cYour father was distant with you,\u201d said Lucetta. \u201cYes.\u201d And having forgotten the momentary mystery of Henchard\u2019s seeming speech to Lucetta she continued, \u201cIt is because he does not think I am respectable. I have tried to be so more than you can imagine, but in vain! My mother\u2019s separation from my father was unfortunate for me. You don\u2019t know what it is to have shadows like that upon your life.\u201d Lucetta seemed to wince. \u201cI do not\u2014of that kind precisely,\u201d she said, \u201cbut you may feel a\u2014sense of disgrace\u2014shame\u2014in other ways.\u201d \u201cHave you ever had any such feeling?\u201d said the younger innocently. \u201cO no,\u201d said Lucetta quickly. \u201cI was thinking of\u2014what happens sometimes when women get themselves in strange positions in the eyes of the world from no fault of their own.\u201d \u201cIt must make them very unhappy afterwards.\u201d \u201cIt makes them anxious; for might not other women despise them?\u201d \u201cNot altogether despise them."], "Which of these characters is not a peasant in Casterbridge?": [" Her simplicity\u2014the original ground of Henchard\u2019s contempt for her\u2014had allowed her to live on in the conviction that Newson had acquired a morally real and justifiable right to her by his purchase\u2014though the exact bearings and legal limits of that right were vague.

In twelve days it will be twenty-one years since I swore it, and then I mean to enjoy myself, please God!\u201d Elizabeth-Jane sat at her window one Sunday, and while there she heard in the street below a conversation which introduced Henchard\u2019s name. She was wondering what was the matter, when a third person who was passing by asked the question in her mind. \u201cMichael Henchard have busted out drinking after taking nothing for twenty-one years!\u201d Elizabeth-Jane jumped up, put on her things, and went out. XXXIII. At this date there prevailed in Casterbridge a convivial custom\u2014scarcely recognized as such, yet none the less established. On the afternoon of every Sunday a large contingent of the Casterbridge journeymen\u2014steady churchgoers and sedate characters\u2014having attended service, filed from the church doors across the way to the Three Mariners Inn. The rear was usually brought up by the choir, with their bass-viols, fiddles, and flutes under their arms. The great point, the point of honour, on these sacred occasions was for each man to strictly limit himself to half-a-pint of liquor. This scrupulosity was so well understood by the landlord that the whole company was served in cups of that measure. They were all exactly alike\u2014straight-sided, with two leafless lime-trees done in eel-brown on the sides\u2014one towards the drinker\u2019s lips, the other confronting his comrade.", " \u201cYou are not going far, you say. What will be your address, in case I wish to write to you? Or am I not to know?\u201d \u201cOh yes\u2014certainly. It is only in the town\u2014High-Place Hall!\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d said Henchard, his face stilling. She repeated the words. He neither moved nor spoke, and waving her hand to him in utmost friendliness she signified to the flyman to drive up the street. XXII. We go back for a moment to the preceding night, to account for Henchard\u2019s attitude. At the hour when Elizabeth-Jane was contemplating her stealthy reconnoitring excursion to the abode of the lady of her fancy, he had been not a little amazed at receiving a letter by hand in Lucetta\u2019s well-known characters. The self-repression, the resignation of her previous communication had vanished from her mood; she wrote with some of the natural lightness which had marked her in their early acquaintance. HIGH-PLACE HALL MY DEAR MR. HENCHARD,\u2014Don\u2019t be surprised. It is for your good and mine, as I hope, that I have come to live at Casterbridge\u2014for how long I cannot tell. That depends upon another; and he is a man, and a merchant, and a Mayor, and one who has the first right to my affections. Seriously, _mon ami_, I am not so light-hearted as I may seem to be from this. I have come here in consequence of hearing of the death of your wife\u2014whom you used to think of as dead so many years before! Poor woman, she seems to have been a sufferer, though uncomplaining, and though weak in intellect not an imbecile.", " \u201cI am again out of a foreman,\u201d said the corn-factor. \u201cAre you in a place?\u201d \u201cNot so much as a beggar\u2019s, sir.\u201d \u201cHow much do you ask?\u201d Jopp named his price, which was very moderate. \u201cWhen can you come?\u201d \u201cAt this hour and moment, sir,\u201d said Jopp, who, standing hands-pocketed at the street corner till the sun had faded the shoulders of his coat to scarecrow green, had regularly watched Henchard in the market-place, measured him, and learnt him, by virtue of the power which the still man has in his stillness of knowing the busy one better than he knows himself. Jopp too, had had a convenient experience; he was the only one in Casterbridge besides Henchard and the close-lipped Elizabeth who knew that Lucetta came truly from Jersey, and but proximately from Bath. \u201cI know Jersey too, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cWas living there when you used to do business that way. O yes\u2014have often seen ye there.\u201d \u201cIndeed! Very good. Then the thing is settled. The testimonials you showed me when you first tried for\u2019t are sufficient.\u201d That characters deteriorated in time of need possibly did not occur to Henchard. Jopp said, \u201cThank you,\u201d and stood more firmly, in the consciousness that at last he officially belonged to that spot. \u201cNow,\u201d said Henchard, digging his strong eyes into Jopp\u2019s face, \u201cone thing is necessary to me, as the biggest corn-and-hay dealer in these parts. The Scotchman, who\u2019s taking the town trade so bold into his hands, must be cut out."], "Where is Donald Farfrae originally from?": [" Henchard left the house with a ton of conjecture, though without a grain of proof, that the counterattraction was Farfrae; and therefore he would not make up his mind. Yet to Elizabeth-Jane it was plain as the town-pump that Donald and Lucetta were incipient lovers. More than once, in spite of her care, Lucetta had been unable to restrain her glance from flitting across into Farfrae\u2019s eyes like a bird to its nest. But Henchard was constructed upon too large a scale to discern such minuti\u00e6 as these by an evening light, which to him were as the notes of an insect that lie above the compass of the human ear. But he was disturbed. And the sense of occult rivalry in suitorship was so much superadded to the palpable rivalry of their business lives. To the coarse materiality of that rivalry it added an inflaming soul. The thus vitalized antagonism took the form of action by Henchard sending for Jopp, the manager originally displaced by Farfrae\u2019s arrival. Henchard had frequently met this man about the streets, observed that his clothing spoke of neediness, heard that he lived in Mixen Lane\u2014a back slum of the town, the _pis aller_ of Casterbridge domiciliation\u2014itself almost a proof that a man had reached a stage when he would not stick at trifles. Jopp came after dark, by the gates of the storeyard, and felt his way through the hay and straw to the office where Henchard sat in solitude awaiting him.", " She saw that Donald and Mr. Henchard were inseparables. When walking together Henchard would lay his arm familiarly on his manager\u2019s shoulder, as if Farfrae were a younger brother, bearing so heavily that his slight frame bent under the weight. Occasionally she would hear a perfect cannonade of laughter from Henchard, arising from something Donald had said, the latter looking quite innocent and not laughing at all. In Henchard\u2019s somewhat lonely life he evidently found the young man as desirable for comradeship as he was useful for consultations. Donald\u2019s brightness of intellect maintained in the corn-factor the admiration it had won at the first hour of their meeting. The poor opinion, and but ill-concealed, that he entertained of the slim Farfrae\u2019s physical girth, strength, and dash was more than counterbalanced by the immense respect he had for his brains. Her quiet eye discerned that Henchard\u2019s tigerish affection for the younger man, his constant liking to have Farfrae near him, now and then resulted in a tendency to domineer, which, however, was checked in a moment when Donald exhibited marks of real offence. One day, looking down on their figures from on high, she heard the latter remark, as they stood in the doorway between the garden and yard, that their habit of walking and driving about together rather neutralized Farfrae\u2019s value as a second pair of eyes, which should be used in places where the principal was not.", " Why, there\u2019s nothing to be angry about! \u2019Tis splendid stuff that we\u2019ve got from Blackmoor Vale. By the by, the people in Durnover want their hay valued.\u201d \u201cYes. I am going there.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll go with ye.\u201d As Henchard did not reply Donald practised a piece of music _sotto voce_, till, getting near the bereaved people\u2019s door, he stopped himself with\u2014 \u201cAh, as their father is dead I won\u2019t go on with such as that. How could I forget?\u201d \u201cDo you care so very much about hurting folks\u2019 feelings?\u201d observed Henchard with a half sneer. \u201cYou do, I know\u2014especially mine!\u201d \u201cI am sorry if I have hurt yours, sir,\u201d replied Donald, standing still, with a second expression of the same sentiment in the regretfulness of his face. \u201cWhy should you say it\u2014think it?\u201d The cloud lifted from Henchard\u2019s brow, and as Donald finished the corn-merchant turned to him, regarding his breast rather than his face. \u201cI have been hearing things that vexed me,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2019Twas that made me short in my manner\u2014made me overlook what you really are. Now, I don\u2019t want to go in here about this hay\u2014Farfrae, you can do it better than I. They sent for \u2019ee, too. I have to attend a meeting of the Town Council at eleven, and \u2019tis drawing on for\u2019t.\u201d They parted thus in renewed friendship, Donald forbearing to ask Henchard for meanings that were not very plain to him. On Henchard\u2019s part there was now again repose; and yet, whenever he thought of Farfrae, it was with a dim dread; and he often regretted that he had told the young man his whole heart, and confided to him the secrets of his life.", " But he paused for a moment, and their eyes met. Donald went up to him, for he saw in Henchard\u2019s look that he began to regret this. \u201cCome,\u201d said Donald quietly, \u201ca man o\u2019 your position should ken better, sir! It is tyrannical and no worthy of you.\u201d \u201c\u2019Tis not tyrannical!\u201d murmured Henchard, like a sullen boy. \u201cIt is to make him remember!\u201d He presently added, in a tone of one bitterly hurt: \u201cWhy did you speak to me before them like that, Farfrae? You might have stopped till we were alone. Ah\u2014I know why! I\u2019ve told ye the secret o\u2019 my life\u2014fool that I was to do\u2019t\u2014and you take advantage of me!\u201d \u201cI had forgot it,\u201d said Farfrae simply. Henchard looked on the ground, said nothing more, and turned away. During the day Farfrae learnt from the men that Henchard had kept Abel\u2019s old mother in coals and snuff all the previous winter, which made him less antagonistic to the corn-factor. But Henchard continued moody and silent, and when one of the men inquired of him if some oats should be hoisted to an upper floor or not, he said shortly, \u201cAsk Mr. Farfrae. He\u2019s master here!\u201d Morally he was; there could be no doubt of it. Henchard, who had hitherto been the most admired man in his circle, was the most admired no longer. One day the daughters of a deceased farmer in Durnover wanted an opinion of the value of their haystack, and sent a messenger to ask Mr. Farfrae to oblige them with one. The messenger, who was a child, met in the yard not Farfrae, but Henchard."], "What is Henchard\u2019s occupation when he first moves to Casterbridge?": [" \u201cNot at all.\u201d \u201cBut where do you live?\u201d \u201cIn Casterbridge, or rather I shall be living here after twelve o\u2019clock to-day.\u201d Elizabeth expressed her astonishment. \u201cI have been staying at Budmouth for a few days while my house was getting ready. The house I am going into is that one they call High-Place Hall\u2014the old stone one looking down the lane to the market. Two or three rooms are fit for occupation, though not all: I sleep there to-night for the first time. Now will you think over my proposal, and meet me here the first fine day next week, and say if you are still in the same mind?\u201d Elizabeth, her eyes shining at this prospect of a change from an unbearable position, joyfully assented; and the two parted at the gate of the churchyard. XXI. As a maxim glibly repeated from childhood remains practically unmarked till some mature experience enforces it, so did this High-Place Hall now for the first time really show itself to Elizabeth-Jane, though her ears had heard its name on a hundred occasions. Her mind dwelt upon nothing else but the stranger, and the house, and her own chance of living there, all the rest of the day. In the afternoon she had occasion to pay a few bills in the town and do a little shopping when she learnt that what was a new discovery to herself had become a common topic about the streets. High-Place Hall was undergoing repair; a lady was coming there to live shortly; all the shop-people knew it, and had already discounted the chance of her being a customer.", " As a consequence, instead of following a straight course yet further away from Casterbridge, Henchard gradually, almost unconsciously, deflected from that right line of his first intention; till, by degrees, his wandering, like that of the Canadian woodsman, became part of a circle of which Casterbridge formed the centre. In ascending any particular hill he ascertained the bearings as nearly as he could by means of the sun, moon, or stars, and settled in his mind the exact direction in which Casterbridge and Elizabeth-Jane lay. Sneering at himself for his weakness he yet every hour\u2014nay, every few minutes\u2014conjectured her actions for the time being\u2014her sitting down and rising up, her goings and comings, till thought of Newson\u2019s and Farfrae\u2019s counter-influence would pass like a cold blast over a pool, and efface her image. And then he would say to himself, \u201cO you fool! All this about a daughter who is no daughter of thine!\u201d At length he obtained employment at his own occupation of hay-trusser, work of that sort being in demand at this autumn time. The scene of his hiring was a pastoral farm near the old western highway, whose course was the channel of all such communications as passed between the busy centres of novelty and the remote Wessex boroughs. He had chosen the neighbourhood of this artery from a sense that, situated here, though at a distance of fifty miles, he was virtually nearer to her whose welfare was so dear than he would be at a roadless spot only half as remote.", " He went on till he came to the first milestone, which stood in the bank, half way up a steep hill. He rested his basket on the top of the stone, placed his elbows on it, and gave way to a convulsive twitch, which was worse than a sob, because it was so hard and so dry. \u201cIf I had only got her with me\u2014if I only had!\u201d he said. \u201cHard work would be nothing to me then! But that was not to be. I\u2014Cain\u2014go alone as I deserve\u2014an outcast and a vagabond. But my punishment is _not_ greater than I can bear!\u201d He sternly subdued his anguish, shouldered his basket, and went on. Elizabeth, in the meantime, had breathed him a sigh, recovered her equanimity, and turned her face to Casterbridge. Before she had reached the first house she was met in her walk by Donald Farfrae. This was evidently not their first meeting that day; they joined hands without ceremony, and Farfrae anxiously asked, \u201cAnd is he gone\u2014and did you tell him?\u2014I mean of the other matter\u2014not of ours.\u201d \u201cHe is gone; and I told him all I knew of your friend. Donald, who is he?\u201d \u201cWell, well, dearie; you will know soon about that. And Mr. Henchard will hear of it if he does not go far.\u201d \u201cHe will go far\u2014he\u2019s bent upon getting out of sight and sound!\u201d She walked beside her lover, and when they reached the Crossways, or Bow, turned with him into Corn Street instead of going straight on to her own door. At Farfrae\u2019s house they stopped and went in.", " In truth, a great change had come over him with regard to her, and he was developing the dream of a future lit by her filial presence, as though that way alone could happiness lie. He was disturbed by another knock at the door, and rose to open it, rather deprecating a call from anybody just then. A stoutly built man stood on the doorstep, with an alien, unfamiliar air about his figure and bearing\u2014an air which might have been called colonial by people of cosmopolitan experience. It was the man who had asked the way at Peter\u2019s finger. Henchard nodded, and looked inquiry. \u201cGood morning, good morning,\u201d said the stranger with profuse heartiness. \u201cIs it Mr. Henchard I am talking to?\u201d \u201cMy name is Henchard.\u201d \u201cThen I\u2019ve caught \u2019ee at home\u2014that\u2019s right. Morning\u2019s the time for business, says I. Can I have a few words with you?\u201d \u201cBy all means,\u201d Henchard answered, showing the way in. \u201cYou may remember me?\u201d said his visitor, seating himself. Henchard observed him indifferently, and shook his head. \u201cWell\u2014perhaps you may not. My name is Newson.\u201d Henchard\u2019s face and eyes seemed to die. The other did not notice it. \u201cI know the name well,\u201d Henchard said at last, looking on the floor. \u201cI make no doubt of that. Well, the fact is, I\u2019ve been looking for \u2019ee this fortnight past. I landed at Havenpool and went through Casterbridge on my way to Falmouth, and when I got there, they told me you had some years before been living at Casterbridge."], "What emotion fuels many of Henchard\u2019s decisions?": [" \u201cWhat is this?\u201d she said. \u201cYou called my father \u2018Michael\u2019 as if you knew him well? And how is it he has got this power over you, that you promise to marry him against your will? Ah\u2014you have many many secrets from me!\u201d \u201cPerhaps you have some from me,\u201d Lucetta murmured with closed eyes, little thinking, however, so unsuspicious was she, that the secret of Elizabeth\u2019s heart concerned the young man who had caused this damage to her own. \u201cI would not\u2014do anything against you at all!\u201d stammered Elizabeth, keeping in all signs of emotion till she was ready to burst. \u201cI cannot understand how my father can command you so; I don\u2019t sympathize with him in it at all. I\u2019ll go to him and ask him to release you.\u201d \u201cNo, no,\u201d said Lucetta. \u201cLet it all be.\u201d XXVIII. The next morning Henchard went to the Town Hall below Lucetta\u2019s house, to attend Petty Sessions, being still a magistrate for the year by virtue of his late position as Mayor. In passing he looked up at her windows, but nothing of her was to be seen. Henchard as a Justice of the Peace may at first seem to be an even greater incongruity than Shallow and Silence themselves. But his rough and ready perceptions, his sledge-hammer directness, had often served him better than nice legal knowledge in despatching such simple business as fell to his hands in this Court. To-day Dr. Chalkfield, the Mayor for the year, being absent, the corn-merchant took the big chair, his eyes still abstractedly stretching out of the window to the ashlar front of High-Place Hall.", " Market\u2014business! I wish there were no business in the warrld.\u201d Lucetta almost laughed\u2014she would quite have laughed\u2014but that there was a little emotion going in her at the time. \u201cHow you change!\u201d she said. \u201cYou should not change like this. \u201cI have never wished such things before,\u201d said the Scotchman, with a simple, shamed, apologetic look for his weakness. \u201cIt is only since coming here and seeing you!\u201d \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, you had better not look at me any longer. Dear me, I feel I have quite demoralized you!\u201d \u201cBut look or look not, I will see you in my thoughts. Well, I\u2019ll go\u2014thank you for the pleasure of this visit.\u201d \u201cThank you for staying.\u201d \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll get into my market-mind when I\u2019ve been out a few minutes,\u201d he murmured. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know\u2014I don\u2019t know!\u201d As he went she said eagerly, \u201cYou may hear them speak of me in Casterbridge as time goes on. If they tell you I\u2019m a coquette, which some may, because of the incidents of my life, don\u2019t believe it, for I am not.\u201d \u201cI swear I will not!\u201d he said fervidly. Thus the two. She had enkindled the young man\u2019s enthusiasm till he was quite brimming with sentiment; while he from merely affording her a new form of idleness, had gone on to wake her serious solicitude. Why was this? They could not have told. Lucetta as a young girl would hardly have looked at a tradesman. But her ups and downs, capped by her indiscretions with Henchard had made her uncritical as to station.", " He was not only a journeyman, unable to appear as he formerly had appeared, but he disdained to appear as well as he might. Everybody else, from the Mayor to the washerwoman, shone in new vesture according to means; but Henchard had doggedly retained the fretted and weather-beaten garments of bygone years. Hence, alas, this occurred: Lucetta\u2019s eyes slid over him to this side and to that without anchoring on his features\u2014as gaily dressed women\u2019s eyes will too often do on such occasions. Her manner signified quite plainly that she meant to know him in public no more. But she was never tired of watching Donald, as he stood in animated converse with his friends a few yards off, wearing round his young neck the official gold chain with great square links, like that round the Royal unicorn. Every trifling emotion that her husband showed as he talked had its reflex on her face and lips, which moved in little duplicates to his. She was living his part rather than her own, and cared for no one\u2019s situation but Farfrae\u2019s that day. At length a man stationed at the furthest turn of the high road, namely, on the second bridge of which mention has been made, gave a signal, and the Corporation in their robes proceeded from the front of the Town Hall to the archway erected at the entrance to the town. The carriages containing the Royal visitor and his suite arrived at the spot in a cloud of dust, a procession was formed, and the whole came on to the Town Hall at a walking pace.", " This had brought them hither. \u201cWhy are there so many idlers round the Town Hall to-day?\u201d said Lucetta to her servant when the case was over. She had risen late, and had just looked out of the window. \u201cOh, please, ma\u2019am, \u2019tis this larry about Mr. Henchard. A woman has proved that before he became a gentleman he sold his wife for five guineas in a booth at a fair.\u201d In all the accounts which Henchard had given her of the separation from his wife Susan for so many years, of his belief in her death, and so on, he had never clearly explained the actual and immediate cause of that separation. The story she now heard for the first time. A gradual misery overspread Lucetta\u2019s face as she dwelt upon the promise wrung from her the night before. At bottom, then, Henchard was this. How terrible a contingency for a woman who should commit herself to his care. During the day she went out to the Ring and to other places, not coming in till nearly dusk. As soon as she saw Elizabeth-Jane after her return indoors she told her that she had resolved to go away from home to the seaside for a few days\u2014to Port-Bredy; Casterbridge was so gloomy. Elizabeth, seeing that she looked wan and disturbed, encouraged her in the idea, thinking a change would afford her relief. She could not help suspecting that the gloom which seemed to have come over Casterbridge in Lucetta\u2019s eyes might be partially owing to the fact that Farfrae was away from home."], "Which character serves as a foil to Henchard?": [" \u201cElizabeth, come here!\u201d said Henchard; and she obeyed. \u201cWhy do you lower yourself so confoundedly?\u201d he said with suppressed passion. \u201cHaven\u2019t I told you o\u2019t fifty times? Hey? Making yourself a drudge for a common workwoman of such a character as hers! Why, ye\u2019ll disgrace me to the dust!\u201d Now these words were uttered loud enough to reach Nance inside the barn door, who fired up immediately at the slur upon her personal character. Coming to the door she cried regardless of consequences, \u201cCome to that, Mr. Henchard, I can let \u2019ee know she\u2019ve waited on worse!\u201d \u201cThen she must have had more charity than sense,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cO no, she hadn\u2019t. \u2019Twere not for charity but for hire; and at a public-house in this town!\u201d \u201cIt is not true!\u201d cried Henchard indignantly. \u201cJust ask her,\u201d said Nance, folding her naked arms in such a manner that she could comfortably scratch her elbows. Henchard glanced at Elizabeth-Jane, whose complexion, now pink and white from confinement, lost nearly all of the former colour. \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d he said to her. \u201cAnything or nothing?\u201d \u201cIt is true,\u201d said Elizabeth-Jane. \u201cBut it was only\u2014\u201d \u201cDid you do it, or didn\u2019t you? Where was it?\u201d \u201cAt the Three Mariners; one evening for a little while, when we were staying there.\u201d Nance glanced triumphantly at Henchard, and sailed into the barn; for assuming that she was to be discharged on the instant she had resolved to make the most of her victory.", " \u201cGod knows that,\u201d replied the man who had seen high life. \u201cHe\u2019s without doubt a stranger here.\u201d \u201cHe came in about five minutes ago,\u201d said the furmity woman, joining the rest with her hands on her hips. \u201cAnd then \u2019a stepped back, and then \u2019a looked in again. I\u2019m not a penny the better for him.\u201d \u201cServes the husband well be-right,\u201d said the staylace vendor. \u201cA comely respectable body like her\u2014what can a man want more? I glory in the woman\u2019s sperrit. I\u2019d ha\u2019 done it myself\u2014od send if I wouldn\u2019t, if a husband had behaved so to me! I\u2019d go, and \u2019a might call, and call, till his keacorn was raw; but I\u2019d never come back\u2014no, not till the great trumpet, would I!\u201d \u201cWell, the woman will be better off,\u201d said another of a more deliberative turn. \u201cFor seafaring natures be very good shelter for shorn lambs, and the man do seem to have plenty of money, which is what she\u2019s not been used to lately, by all showings.\u201d \u201cMark me\u2014I\u2019ll not go after her!\u201d said the trusser, returning doggedly to his seat. \u201cLet her go! If she\u2019s up to such vagaries she must suffer for \u2019em. She\u2019d no business to take the maid\u2014\u2019tis my maid; and if it were the doing again she shouldn\u2019t have her!\u201d Perhaps from some little sense of having countenanced an indefensible proceeding, perhaps because it was late, the customers thinned away from the tent shortly after this episode. The man stretched his elbows forward on the table leant his face upon his arms, and soon began to snore.", " Whether it were that his northern energy was an overmastering force among the easy-going Wessex worthies, or whether it was sheer luck, the fact remained that whatever he touched he prospered in. Like Jacob in Padan-Aram, he would no sooner humbly limit himself to the ringstraked-and-spotted exceptions of trade than the ringstraked-and-spotted would multiply and prevail. But most probably luck had little to do with it. Character is Fate, said Novalis, and Farfrae\u2019s character was just the reverse of Henchard\u2019s, who might not inaptly be described as Faust has been described\u2014as a vehement gloomy being who had quitted the ways of vulgar men without light to guide him on a better way. Farfrae duly received the request to discontinue attentions to Elizabeth-Jane. His acts of that kind had been so slight that the request was almost superfluous. Yet he had felt a considerable interest in her, and after some cogitation he decided that it would be as well to enact no Romeo part just then\u2014for the young girl\u2019s sake no less than his own. Thus the incipient attachment was stifled down. A time came when, avoid collision with his former friend as he might, Farfrae was compelled, in sheer self-defence, to close with Henchard in mortal commercial combat. He could no longer parry the fierce attacks of the latter by simple avoidance. As soon as their war of prices began everybody was interested, and some few guessed the end.", " Henchard\u2019s rejoicings couldn\u2019t say good morning to this,\u201d said one. \u201cA man must be a headstrong stunpoll to think folk would go up to that bleak place to-day.\u201d The other answered that people said it was not only in such things as those that the Mayor was wanting. \u201cWhere would his business be if it were not for this young fellow? \u2019Twas verily Fortune sent him to Henchard. His accounts were like a bramblewood when Mr. Farfrae came. He used to reckon his sacks by chalk strokes all in a row like garden-palings, measure his ricks by stretching with his arms, weigh his trusses by a lift, judge his hay by a chaw, and settle the price with a curse. But now this accomplished young man does it all by ciphering and mensuration. Then the wheat\u2014that sometimes used to taste so strong o\u2019 mice when made into bread that people could fairly tell the breed\u2014Farfrae has a plan for purifying, so that nobody would dream the smallest four-legged beast had walked over it once. O yes, everybody is full of him, and the care Mr. Henchard has to keep him, to be sure!\u201d concluded this gentleman. \u201cBut he won\u2019t do it for long, good-now,\u201d said the other. \u201cNo!\u201d said Henchard to himself behind the tree. \u201cOr if he do, he\u2019ll be honeycombed clean out of all the character and standing that he\u2019s built up in these eighteen year!\u201d He went back to the dancing pavilion. Farfrae was footing a quaint little dance with Elizabeth-Jane\u2014an old country thing, the only one she knew, and though he considerately toned down his movements to suit her demurer gait, the pattern of the shining little nails in the soles of his boots became familiar to the eyes of every bystander."], "Which feeling does Elizabeth-Jane realize dominates most of her life?": [" \u201cOne word more, Elizabeth,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ll take my surname now\u2014hey? Your mother was against it, but it will be much more pleasant to me. \u2019Tis legally yours, you know. But nobody need know that. You shall take it as if by choice. I\u2019ll talk to my lawyer\u2014I don\u2019t know the law of it exactly; but will you do this\u2014let me put a few lines into the newspaper that such is to be your name?\u201d \u201cIf it is my name I must have it, mustn\u2019t I?\u201d she asked. \u201cWell, well; usage is everything in these matters.\u201d \u201cI wonder why mother didn\u2019t wish it?\u201d \u201cOh, some whim of the poor soul\u2019s. Now get a bit of paper and draw up a paragraph as I shall tell you. But let\u2019s have a light.\u201d \u201cI can see by the firelight,\u201d she answered. \u201cYes\u2014I\u2019d rather.\u201d \u201cVery well.\u201d She got a piece of paper, and bending over the fender wrote at his dictation words which he had evidently got by heart from some advertisement or other\u2014words to the effect that she, the writer, hitherto known as Elizabeth-Jane Newson, was going to call herself Elizabeth-Jane Henchard forthwith. It was done, and fastened up, and directed to the office of the _Casterbridge Chronicle_. \u201cNow,\u201d said Henchard, with the blaze of satisfaction that he always emitted when he had carried his point\u2014though tenderness softened it this time\u2014\u201cI\u2019ll go upstairs and hunt for some documents that will prove it all to you. But I won\u2019t trouble you with them till to-morrow. Good-night, my Elizabeth-Jane!\u201d He was gone before the bewildered girl could realize what it all meant, or adjust her filial sense to the new center of gravity.", " Then hearing at some place\u2014I forget where\u2014that a man of the name of Henchard had been mayor here, I came back, and called at his house one morning. The old rascal!\u2014he said Elizabeth-Jane had died years ago.\u201d Elizabeth now gave earnest heed to his story. \u201cNow, it never crossed my mind that the man was selling me a packet,\u201d continued Newson. \u201cAnd, if you\u2019ll believe me, I was that upset, that I went back to the coach that had brought me, and took passage onward without lying in the town half-an-hour. Ha-ha!\u2014\u2019twas a good joke, and well carried out, and I give the man credit for\u2019t!\u201d Elizabeth-Jane was amazed at the intelligence. \u201cA joke?\u2014O no!\u201d she cried. \u201cThen he kept you from me, father, all those months, when you might have been here?\u201d The father admitted that such was the case. \u201cHe ought not to have done it!\u201d said Farfrae. Elizabeth sighed. \u201cI said I would never forget him. But O! I think I ought to forget him now!\u201d Newson, like a good many rovers and sojourners among strange men and strange moralities, failed to perceive the enormity of Henchard\u2019s crime, notwithstanding that he himself had been the chief sufferer therefrom. Indeed, the attack upon the absent culprit waxing serious, he began to take Henchard\u2019s part. \u201cWell, \u2019twas not ten words that he said, after all,\u201d Newson pleaded. \u201cAnd how could he know that I should be such a simpleton as to believe him? \u2019Twas as much my fault as his, poor fellow!\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Elizabeth-Jane firmly, in her revulsion of feeling.", " XXXVIII. The proceedings had been brief\u2014too brief\u2014to Lucetta whom an intoxicating _Weltlust_ had fairly mastered; but they had brought her a great triumph nevertheless. The shake of the Royal hand still lingered in her fingers; and the chit-chat she had overheard, that her husband might possibly receive the honour of knighthood, though idle to a degree, seemed not the wildest vision; stranger things had occurred to men so good and captivating as her Scotchman was. After the collision with the Mayor, Henchard had withdrawn behind the ladies\u2019 stand; and there he stood, regarding with a stare of abstraction the spot on the lapel of his coat where Farfrae\u2019s hand had seized it. He put his own hand there, as if he could hardly realize such an outrage from one whom it had once been his wont to treat with ardent generosity. While pausing in this half-stupefied state the conversation of Lucetta with the other ladies reached his ears; and he distinctly heard her deny him\u2014deny that he had assisted Donald, that he was anything more than a common journeyman. He moved on homeward, and met Jopp in the archway to the Bull Stake. \u201cSo you\u2019ve had a snub,\u201d said Jopp. \u201cAnd what if I have?\u201d answered Henchard sternly. \u201cWhy, I\u2019ve had one too, so we are both under the same cold shade.\u201d He briefly related his attempt to win Lucetta\u2019s intercession. Henchard merely heard his story, without taking it deeply in.", " The seal had cracked, and the letter was open. Henchard had no reason to suppose the restriction one of serious weight, and his feeling for his late wife had not been of the nature of deep respect. \u201cSome trifling fancy or other of poor Susan\u2019s, I suppose,\u201d he said; and without curiosity he allowed his eyes to scan the letter:\u2014 MY DEAR MICHAEL,\u2014For the good of all three of us I have kept one thing a secret from you till now. I hope you will understand why; I think you will; though perhaps you may not forgive me. But, dear Michael, I have done it for the best. I shall be in my grave when you read this, and Elizabeth-Jane will have a home. Don\u2019t curse me Mike\u2014think of how I was situated. I can hardly write it, but here it is. Elizabeth-Jane is not your Elizabeth-Jane\u2014the child who was in my arms when you sold me. No; she died three months after that, and this living one is my other husband\u2019s. I christened her by the same name we had given to the first, and she filled up the ache I felt at the other\u2019s loss. Michael, I am dying, and I might have held my tongue; but I could not. Tell her husband of this or not, as you may judge; and forgive, if you can, a woman you once deeply wronged, as she forgives you. SUSAN HENCHARD Her husband regarded the paper as if it were a window-pane through which he saw for miles. His lips twitched, and he seemed to compress his frame, as if to bear better."], "Which two characters live according to their passions?": [" \u201cYou must have done it a\u2019 purpose!\u201d said Farfrae\u2019s waggoner. \u201cYou can hear my horses\u2019 bells half-a-mile such a night as this!\u201d \u201cIf ye\u2019d been minding your business instead of zwailing along in such a gawk-hammer way, you would have zeed me!\u201d retorted the wroth representative of Henchard. However, according to the strict rule of the road it appeared that Henchard\u2019s man was most in the wrong, he therefore attempted to back into the High Street. In doing this the near hind-wheel rose against the churchyard wall and the whole mountainous load went over, two of the four wheels rising in the air, and the legs of the thill horse. Instead of considering how to gather up the load the two men closed in a fight with their fists. Before the first round was quite over Henchard came upon the spot, somebody having run for him. Henchard sent the two men staggering in contrary directions by collaring one with each hand, turned to the horse that was down, and extricated him after some trouble. He then inquired into the circumstances; and seeing the state of his waggon and its load began hotly rating Farfrae\u2019s man. Lucetta and Elizabeth-Jane had by this time run down to the street corner, whence they watched the bright heap of new hay lying in the moon\u2019s rays, and passed and repassed by the forms of Henchard and the waggoners. The women had witnessed what nobody else had seen\u2014the origin of the mishap; and Lucetta spoke.", " They sat down to breakfast, and Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s thoughts reverted to Lucetta. Their sadness added charm to a countenance whose beauty had ever lain in its meditative soberness. \u201cFather,\u201d she said, as soon as she recalled herself to the outspread meal, \u201cit is so kind of you to get this nice breakfast with your own hands, and I idly asleep the while.\u201d \u201cI do it every day,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou have left me; everybody has left me; how should I live but by my own hands.\u201d \u201cYou are very lonely, are you not?\u201d \u201cAy, child\u2014to a degree that you know nothing of! It is my own fault. You are the only one who has been near me for weeks. And you will come no more.\u201d \u201cWhy do you say that? Indeed I will, if you would like to see me.\u201d Henchard signified dubiousness. Though he had so lately hoped that Elizabeth-Jane might again live in his house as daughter, he would not ask her to do so now. Newson might return at any moment, and what Elizabeth would think of him for his deception it were best to bear apart from her. When they had breakfasted his stepdaughter still lingered, till the moment arrived at which Henchard was accustomed to go to his daily work. Then she arose, and with assurance of coming again soon went up the hill in the morning sunlight. \u201cAt this moment her heart is as warm towards me as mine is towards her, she would live with me here in this humble cottage for the asking! Yet before the evening probably he will have come, and then she will scorn me!\u201d This reflection, constantly repeated by Henchard to himself, accompanied him everywhere through the day.", " \u201cYou are not going far, you say. What will be your address, in case I wish to write to you? Or am I not to know?\u201d \u201cOh yes\u2014certainly. It is only in the town\u2014High-Place Hall!\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d said Henchard, his face stilling. She repeated the words. He neither moved nor spoke, and waving her hand to him in utmost friendliness she signified to the flyman to drive up the street. XXII. We go back for a moment to the preceding night, to account for Henchard\u2019s attitude. At the hour when Elizabeth-Jane was contemplating her stealthy reconnoitring excursion to the abode of the lady of her fancy, he had been not a little amazed at receiving a letter by hand in Lucetta\u2019s well-known characters. The self-repression, the resignation of her previous communication had vanished from her mood; she wrote with some of the natural lightness which had marked her in their early acquaintance. HIGH-PLACE HALL MY DEAR MR. HENCHARD,\u2014Don\u2019t be surprised. It is for your good and mine, as I hope, that I have come to live at Casterbridge\u2014for how long I cannot tell. That depends upon another; and he is a man, and a merchant, and a Mayor, and one who has the first right to my affections. Seriously, _mon ami_, I am not so light-hearted as I may seem to be from this. I have come here in consequence of hearing of the death of your wife\u2014whom you used to think of as dead so many years before! Poor woman, she seems to have been a sufferer, though uncomplaining, and though weak in intellect not an imbecile.", " Owing to her early troubles with regard to her mother a semblance of irregularity had terrors for her which those whose names are safeguarded from suspicion know nothing of. \u201cYou ought to marry Mr. Henchard or nobody\u2014certainly not another man!\u201d she went on with a quivering lip in whose movement two passions shared. \u201cI don\u2019t admit that!\u201d said Lucetta passionately. \u201cAdmit it or not, it is true!\u201d Lucetta covered her eyes with her right hand, as if she could plead no more, holding out her left to Elizabeth-Jane. \u201cWhy, you _have_ married him!\u201d cried the latter, jumping up with pleasure after a glance at Lucetta\u2019s fingers. \u201cWhen did you do it? Why did you not tell me, instead of teasing me like this? How very honourable of you! He did treat my mother badly once, it seems, in a moment of intoxication. And it is true that he is stern sometimes. But you will rule him entirely, I am sure, with your beauty and wealth and accomplishments. You are the woman he will adore, and we shall all three be happy together now!\u201d \u201cO, my Elizabeth-Jane!\u201d cried Lucetta distressfully. \u201c\u2019Tis somebody else that I have married! I was so desperate\u2014so afraid of being forced to anything else\u2014so afraid of revelations that would quench his love for me, that I resolved to do it offhand, come what might, and purchase a week of happiness at any cost!\u201d \u201cYou\u2014have\u2014married Mr. Farfrae!\u201d cried Elizabeth-Jane, in Nathan tones Lucetta bowed."], "What opposing forces do Henchard and Farfrae represent, respectively?": [" It was a point in the highway near which the road to Mellstock branched off from the homeward direction. By diverging to that village, as he had intended to do, Farfrae might probably delay his return by a couple of hours. It soon appeared that his intention was to do so still, the light swerving towards Cuckoo Lane, the by-road aforesaid. Farfrae\u2019s off gig-lamp flashed in Henchard\u2019s face. At the same time Farfrae discerned his late antagonist. \u201cFarfrae\u2014Mr. Farfrae!\u201d cried the breathless Henchard, holding up his hand. Farfrae allowed the horse to turn several steps into the branch lane before he pulled up. He then drew rein, and said \u201cYes?\u201d over his shoulder, as one would towards a pronounced enemy. \u201cCome back to Casterbridge at once!\u201d Henchard said. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong at your house\u2014requiring your return. I\u2019ve run all the way here on purpose to tell ye.\u201d Farfrae was silent, and at his silence Henchard\u2019s soul sank within him. Why had he not, before this, thought of what was only too obvious? He who, four hours earlier, had enticed Farfrae into a deadly wrestle stood now in the darkness of late night-time on a lonely road, inviting him to come a particular way, where an assailant might have confederates, instead of going his purposed way, where there might be a better opportunity of guarding himself from attack. Henchard could almost feel this view of things in course of passage through Farfrae\u2019s mind.", " But he paused for a moment, and their eyes met. Donald went up to him, for he saw in Henchard\u2019s look that he began to regret this. \u201cCome,\u201d said Donald quietly, \u201ca man o\u2019 your position should ken better, sir! It is tyrannical and no worthy of you.\u201d \u201c\u2019Tis not tyrannical!\u201d murmured Henchard, like a sullen boy. \u201cIt is to make him remember!\u201d He presently added, in a tone of one bitterly hurt: \u201cWhy did you speak to me before them like that, Farfrae? You might have stopped till we were alone. Ah\u2014I know why! I\u2019ve told ye the secret o\u2019 my life\u2014fool that I was to do\u2019t\u2014and you take advantage of me!\u201d \u201cI had forgot it,\u201d said Farfrae simply. Henchard looked on the ground, said nothing more, and turned away. During the day Farfrae learnt from the men that Henchard had kept Abel\u2019s old mother in coals and snuff all the previous winter, which made him less antagonistic to the corn-factor. But Henchard continued moody and silent, and when one of the men inquired of him if some oats should be hoisted to an upper floor or not, he said shortly, \u201cAsk Mr. Farfrae. He\u2019s master here!\u201d Morally he was; there could be no doubt of it. Henchard, who had hitherto been the most admired man in his circle, was the most admired no longer. One day the daughters of a deceased farmer in Durnover wanted an opinion of the value of their haystack, and sent a messenger to ask Mr. Farfrae to oblige them with one. The messenger, who was a child, met in the yard not Farfrae, but Henchard.", " \u201cVery well,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll come.\u201d \u201cBut please will Mr. Farfrae come?\u201d said the child. \u201cI am going that way.... Why Mr. Farfrae?\u201d said Henchard, with the fixed look of thought. \u201cWhy do people always want Mr. Farfrae?\u201d \u201cI suppose because they like him so\u2014that\u2019s what they say.\u201d \u201cOh\u2014I see\u2014that\u2019s what they say\u2014hey? They like him because he\u2019s cleverer than Mr. Henchard, and because he knows more; and, in short, Mr. Henchard can\u2019t hold a candle to him\u2014hey?\u201d \u201cYes\u2014that\u2019s just it, sir\u2014some of it.\u201d \u201cOh, there\u2019s more? Of course there\u2019s more! What besides? Come, here\u2019s a sixpence for a fairing.\u201d \u201c\u2018And he\u2019s better tempered, and Henchard\u2019s a fool to him,\u2019 they say. And when some of the women were a-walking home they said, \u2018He\u2019s a diment\u2014he\u2019s a chap o\u2019 wax\u2014he\u2019s the best\u2014he\u2019s the horse for my money,\u2019 says they. And they said, \u2018He\u2019s the most understanding man o\u2019 them two by long chalks. I wish he was the master instead of Henchard,\u2019 they said.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ll talk any nonsense,\u201d Henchard replied with covered gloom. \u201cWell, you can go now. And _I_ am coming to value the hay, d\u2019ye hear?\u2014I.\u201d The boy departed, and Henchard murmured, \u201cWish he were master here, do they?\u201d He went towards Durnover. On his way he overtook Farfrae. They walked on together, Henchard looking mostly on the ground. \u201cYou\u2019re no yoursel\u2019 the day?\u201d Donald inquired. \u201cYes, I am very well,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cBut ye are a bit down\u2014surely ye are down?", " Hampered as he was, however, he could not keep him there, and Farfrae finding his feet again the struggle proceeded as before. By a whirl Henchard brought Donald dangerously near the precipice; seeing his position the Scotchman for the first time locked himself to his adversary, and all the efforts of that infuriated Prince of Darkness\u2014as he might have been called from his appearance just now\u2014were inadequate to lift or loosen Farfrae for a time. By an extraordinary effort he succeeded at last, though not until they had got far back again from the fatal door. In doing so Henchard contrived to turn Farfrae a complete somersault. Had Henchard\u2019s other arm been free it would have been all over with Farfrae then. But again he regained his feet, wrenching Henchard\u2019s arm considerably, and causing him sharp pain, as could be seen from the twitching of his face. He instantly delivered the younger man an annihilating turn by the left fore-hip, as it used to be expressed, and following up his advantage thrust him towards the door, never loosening his hold till Farfrae\u2019s fair head was hanging over the window-sill, and his arm dangling down outside the wall. \u201cNow,\u201d said Henchard between his gasps, \u201cthis is the end of what you began this morning. Your life is in my hands.\u201d \u201cThen take it, take it!\u201d said Farfrae. \u201cYe\u2019ve wished to long enough!\u201d Henchard looked down upon him in silence, and their eyes met."], "What bird does Henchard give Elizabeth-Jane on her wedding day?": [" Donald Farfrae had discovered in a screened corner a new bird-cage, shrouded in newspaper, and at the bottom of the cage a little ball of feathers\u2014the dead body of a goldfinch. Nobody could tell her how the bird and cage had come there, though that the poor little songster had been starved to death was evident. The sadness of the incident had made an impression on her. She had not been able to forget it for days, despite Farfrae\u2019s tender banter; and now when the matter had been nearly forgotten it was again revived. \u201cOh, please ma\u2019am, we know how the bird-cage came there. That farmer\u2019s man who called on the evening of the wedding\u2014he was seen wi\u2019 it in his hand as he came up the street; and \u2019tis thoughted that he put it down while he came in with his message, and then went away forgetting where he had left it.\u201d This was enough to set Elizabeth thinking, and in thinking she seized hold of the idea, at one feminine bound, that the caged bird had been brought by Henchard for her as a wedding gift and token of repentance. He had not expressed to her any regrets or excuses for what he had done in the past; but it was a part of his nature to extenuate nothing, and live on as one of his own worst accusers. She went out, looked at the cage, buried the starved little singer, and from that hour her heart softened towards the self-alienated man. When her husband came in she told him her solution of the bird-cage mystery; and begged Donald to help her in finding out, as soon as possible, whither Henchard had banished himself, that she might make her peace with him; try to do something to render his life less that of an outcast, and more tolerable to him.", " Henchard ran to the gate of the field he worked in, and hailed the speaker, who was a stranger. \u201cYes\u2014I\u2019ve come from there, maister,\u201d he said, in answer to Henchard\u2019s inquiry. \u201cI trade up and down, ye know; though, what with this travelling without horses that\u2019s getting so common, my work will soon be done.\u201d \u201cAnything moving in the old place, mid I ask?\u201d \u201cAll the same as usual.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve heard that Mr. Farfrae, the late mayor, is thinking of getting married. Now is that true or not?\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t say for the life o\u2019 me. O no, I should think not.\u201d \u201cBut yes, John\u2014you forget,\u201d said a woman inside the waggon-tilt. \u201cWhat were them packages we carr\u2019d there at the beginning o\u2019 the week? Surely they said a wedding was coming off soon\u2014on Martin\u2019s Day?\u201d The man declared he remembered nothing about it; and the waggon went on jangling over the hill. Henchard was convinced that the woman\u2019s memory served her well. The date was an extremely probable one, there being no reason for delay on either side. He might, for that matter, write and inquire of Elizabeth; but his instinct for sequestration had made the course difficult. Yet before he left her she had said that for him to be absent from her wedding was not as she wished it to be. The remembrance would continually revive in him now that it was not Elizabeth and Farfrae who had driven him away from them, but his own haughty sense that his presence was no longer desired.", " Then hearing at some place\u2014I forget where\u2014that a man of the name of Henchard had been mayor here, I came back, and called at his house one morning. The old rascal!\u2014he said Elizabeth-Jane had died years ago.\u201d Elizabeth now gave earnest heed to his story. \u201cNow, it never crossed my mind that the man was selling me a packet,\u201d continued Newson. \u201cAnd, if you\u2019ll believe me, I was that upset, that I went back to the coach that had brought me, and took passage onward without lying in the town half-an-hour. Ha-ha!\u2014\u2019twas a good joke, and well carried out, and I give the man credit for\u2019t!\u201d Elizabeth-Jane was amazed at the intelligence. \u201cA joke?\u2014O no!\u201d she cried. \u201cThen he kept you from me, father, all those months, when you might have been here?\u201d The father admitted that such was the case. \u201cHe ought not to have done it!\u201d said Farfrae. Elizabeth sighed. \u201cI said I would never forget him. But O! I think I ought to forget him now!\u201d Newson, like a good many rovers and sojourners among strange men and strange moralities, failed to perceive the enormity of Henchard\u2019s crime, notwithstanding that he himself had been the chief sufferer therefrom. Indeed, the attack upon the absent culprit waxing serious, he began to take Henchard\u2019s part. \u201cWell, \u2019twas not ten words that he said, after all,\u201d Newson pleaded. \u201cAnd how could he know that I should be such a simpleton as to believe him? \u2019Twas as much my fault as his, poor fellow!\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Elizabeth-Jane firmly, in her revulsion of feeling.", " Newson had stayed in Casterbridge three days after the wedding party (whose gaiety, as might have been surmised, was of his making rather than of the married couple\u2019s), and was stared at and honoured as became the returned Crusoe of the hour. But whether or not because Casterbridge was difficult to excite by dramatic returns and disappearances through having been for centuries an assize town, in which sensational exits from the world, antipodean absences, and such like, were half-yearly occurrences, the inhabitants did not altogether lose their equanimity on his account. On the fourth morning he was discovered disconsolately climbing a hill, in his craving to get a glimpse of the sea from somewhere or other. The contiguity of salt water proved to be such a necessity of his existence that he preferred Budmouth as a place of residence, notwithstanding the society of his daughter in the other town. Thither he went, and settled in lodgings in a green-shuttered cottage which had a bow-window, jutting out sufficiently to afford glimpses of a vertical strip of blue sea to any one opening the sash, and leaning forward far enough to look through a narrow lane of tall intervening houses. Elizabeth-Jane was standing in the middle of her upstairs parlour, critically surveying some re-arrangement of articles with her head to one side, when the housemaid came in with the announcement, \u201cOh, please ma\u2019am, we know now how that bird-cage came there.\u201d In exploring her new domain during the first week of residence, gazing with critical satisfaction on this cheerful room and that, penetrating cautiously into dark cellars, sallying forth with gingerly tread to the garden, now leaf-strewn by autumn winds, and thus, like a wise field-marshal, estimating the capabilities of the site whereon she was about to open her housekeeping campaign\u2014Mrs."], "Whose wagons collide outside of the High Place Hall?": [" \u201cNot at all.\u201d \u201cBut where do you live?\u201d \u201cIn Casterbridge, or rather I shall be living here after twelve o\u2019clock to-day.\u201d Elizabeth expressed her astonishment. \u201cI have been staying at Budmouth for a few days while my house was getting ready. The house I am going into is that one they call High-Place Hall\u2014the old stone one looking down the lane to the market. Two or three rooms are fit for occupation, though not all: I sleep there to-night for the first time. Now will you think over my proposal, and meet me here the first fine day next week, and say if you are still in the same mind?\u201d Elizabeth, her eyes shining at this prospect of a change from an unbearable position, joyfully assented; and the two parted at the gate of the churchyard. XXI. As a maxim glibly repeated from childhood remains practically unmarked till some mature experience enforces it, so did this High-Place Hall now for the first time really show itself to Elizabeth-Jane, though her ears had heard its name on a hundred occasions. Her mind dwelt upon nothing else but the stranger, and the house, and her own chance of living there, all the rest of the day. In the afternoon she had occasion to pay a few bills in the town and do a little shopping when she learnt that what was a new discovery to herself had become a common topic about the streets. High-Place Hall was undergoing repair; a lady was coming there to live shortly; all the shop-people knew it, and had already discounted the chance of her being a customer.", " \u201cYou are not going far, you say. What will be your address, in case I wish to write to you? Or am I not to know?\u201d \u201cOh yes\u2014certainly. It is only in the town\u2014High-Place Hall!\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d said Henchard, his face stilling. She repeated the words. He neither moved nor spoke, and waving her hand to him in utmost friendliness she signified to the flyman to drive up the street. XXII. We go back for a moment to the preceding night, to account for Henchard\u2019s attitude. At the hour when Elizabeth-Jane was contemplating her stealthy reconnoitring excursion to the abode of the lady of her fancy, he had been not a little amazed at receiving a letter by hand in Lucetta\u2019s well-known characters. The self-repression, the resignation of her previous communication had vanished from her mood; she wrote with some of the natural lightness which had marked her in their early acquaintance. HIGH-PLACE HALL MY DEAR MR. HENCHARD,\u2014Don\u2019t be surprised. It is for your good and mine, as I hope, that I have come to live at Casterbridge\u2014for how long I cannot tell. That depends upon another; and he is a man, and a merchant, and a Mayor, and one who has the first right to my affections. Seriously, _mon ami_, I am not so light-hearted as I may seem to be from this. I have come here in consequence of hearing of the death of your wife\u2014whom you used to think of as dead so many years before! Poor woman, she seems to have been a sufferer, though uncomplaining, and though weak in intellect not an imbecile.", " Elizabeth-Jane could, however, add a capping touch to information so new to her in the bulk. The lady, she said, had arrived that day. When the lamps were lighted, and it was yet not so dark as to render chimneys, attics, and roofs invisible, Elizabeth, almost with a lover\u2019s feeling, thought she would like to look at the outside of High-Place Hall. She went up the street in that direction. The Hall, with its grey _fa\u00e7ade_ and parapet, was the only residence of its sort so near the centre of the town. It had, in the first place, the characteristics of a country mansion\u2014birds\u2019 nests in its chimneys, damp nooks where fungi grew and irregularities of surface direct from Nature\u2019s trowel. At night the forms of passengers were patterned by the lamps in black shadows upon the pale walls. This evening motes of straw lay around, and other signs of the premises having been in that lawless condition which accompanies the entry of a new tenant. The house was entirely of stone, and formed an example of dignity without great size. It was not altogether aristocratic, still less consequential, yet the old-fashioned stranger instinctively said \u201cBlood built it, and Wealth enjoys it\u201d however vague his opinions of those accessories might be. Yet as regards the enjoying it the stranger would have been wrong, for until this very evening, when the new lady had arrived, the house had been empty for a year or two while before that interval its occupancy had been irregular.", " In this frame of mind, though without strong feeling, he had strolled up the alley and into High-Place Hall by the postern at which Elizabeth had so nearly encountered him. He had gone on thence into the court, and inquired of a man whom he saw unpacking china from a crate if Miss Le Sueur was living there. Miss Le Sueur had been the name under which he had known Lucetta\u2014or \u201cLucette,\u201d as she had called herself at that time. The man replied in the negative; that Miss Templeman only had come. Henchard went away, concluding that Lucetta had not as yet settled in. He was in this interested stage of the inquiry when he witnessed Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s departure the next day. On hearing her announce the address there suddenly took possession of him the strange thought that Lucetta and Miss Templeman were one and the same person, for he could recall that in her season of intimacy with him the name of the rich relative whom he had deemed somewhat a mythical personage had been given as Templeman. Though he was not a fortune-hunter, the possibility that Lucetta had been sublimed into a lady of means by some munificent testament on the part of this relative lent a charm to her image which it might not otherwise have acquired. He was getting on towards the dead level of middle age, when material things increasingly possess the mind. But Henchard was not left long in suspense. Lucetta was rather addicted to scribbling, as had been shown by the torrent of letters after the _fiasco_ in their marriage arrangements, and hardly had Elizabeth gone away when another note came to the Mayor\u2019s house from High-Place Hall."], "Which space in Casterbridge best represents the indelibility of the past?": [" But she said nothing to show that the place of meeting was not at his house, nor did she hand the note to Elizabeth. XI. The Ring at Casterbridge was merely the local name of one of the finest Roman Amphitheatres, if not the very finest, remaining in Britain. Casterbridge announced old Rome in every street, alley, and precinct. It looked Roman, bespoke the art of Rome, concealed dead men of Rome. It was impossible to dig more than a foot or two deep about the town fields and gardens without coming upon some tall soldier or other of the Empire, who had lain there in his silent unobtrusive rest for a space of fifteen hundred years. He was mostly found lying on his side, in an oval scoop in the chalk, like a chicken in its shell; his knees drawn up to his chest; sometimes with the remains of his spear against his arm, a fibula or brooch of bronze on his breast or forehead, an urn at his knees, a jar at his throat, a bottle at his mouth; and mystified conjecture pouring down upon him from the eyes of Casterbridge street boys and men, who had turned a moment to gaze at the familiar spectacle as they passed by. Imaginative inhabitants, who would have felt an unpleasantness at the discovery of a comparatively modern skeleton in their gardens, were quite unmoved by these hoary shapes. They had lived so long ago, their time was so unlike the present, their hopes and motives were so widely removed from ours, that between them and the living there seemed to stretch a gulf too wide for even a spirit to pass.", " She was one of those people whom nothing surprises, and though to her, a total stranger, his request must have seemed odd, she willingly volunteered to go up and inform the master and mistress of the house that \u201ca humble old friend\u201d had come. On second thought she said that he had better not wait in the kitchen, but come up into the little back-parlour, which was empty. He thereupon followed her thither, and she left him. Just as she got across the landing to the door of the best parlour a dance was struck up, and she returned to say that she would wait till that was over before announcing him\u2014Mr. and Mrs. Farfrae having both joined in the figure. The door of the front room had been taken off its hinges to give more space, and that of the room Henchard sat in being ajar, he could see fractional parts of the dancers whenever their gyrations brought them near the doorway, chiefly in the shape of the skirts of dresses and streaming curls of hair; together with about three-fifths of the band in profile, including the restless shadow of a fiddler\u2019s elbow, and the tip of the bass-viol bow. The gaiety jarred upon Henchard\u2019s spirits; and he could not quite understand why Farfrae, a much-sobered man, and a widower, who had had his trials, should have cared for it all, notwithstanding the fact that he was quite a young man still, and quickly kindled to enthusiasm by dance and song. That the quiet Elizabeth, who had long ago appraised life at a moderate value, and who knew in spite of her maidenhood that marriage was as a rule no dancing matter, should have had zest for this revelry surprised him still more.", " In an open space before the church walked a woman with her gown-sleeves rolled up so high that the edge of her underlinen was visible, and her skirt tucked up through her pocket hole. She carried a load under her arm from which she was pulling pieces of bread, and handing them to some other women who walked with her, which pieces they nibbled critically. The sight reminded Mrs. Henchard-Newson and her daughter that they had an appetite; and they inquired of the woman for the nearest baker\u2019s. \u201cYe may as well look for manna-food as good bread in Casterbridge just now,\u201d she said, after directing them. \u201cThey can blare their trumpets and thump their drums, and have their roaring dinners\u201d\u2014waving her hand towards a point further along the street, where the brass band could be seen standing in front of an illuminated building\u2014\u201cbut we must needs be put-to for want of a wholesome crust. There\u2019s less good bread than good beer in Casterbridge now.\u201d \u201cAnd less good beer than swipes,\u201d said a man with his hands in his pockets. \u201cHow does it happen there\u2019s no good bread?\u201d asked Mrs. Henchard. \u201cOh, \u2019tis the corn-factor\u2014he\u2019s the man that our millers and bakers all deal wi\u2019, and he has sold \u2019em growed wheat, which they didn\u2019t know was growed, so they say, till the dough ran all over the ovens like quicksilver; so that the loaves be as flat as toads, and like suet pudden inside. I\u2019ve been a wife, and I\u2019ve been a mother, and I never see such unprincipled bread in Casterbridge as this before.\u2014But you must be a real stranger here not to know what\u2019s made all the poor volks\u2019 insides plim like blowed bladders this week?\u201d \u201cI am,\u201d said Elizabeth\u2019s mother shyly.", " But Farfrae had been so cursed quick in his movements as to give old-fashioned people in authority no chance of the initiative. However, it was not too late; and on second thoughts he determined to take upon his own shoulders the responsibility of organizing some amusements, if the other Councilmen would leave the matter in his hands. To this they quite readily agreed, the majority being fine old crusted characters who had a decided taste for living without worry. So Henchard set about his preparations for a really brilliant thing\u2014such as should be worthy of the venerable town. As for Farfrae\u2019s little affair, Henchard nearly forgot it; except once now and then when, on it coming into his mind, he said to himself, \u201cCharge admission at so much a head\u2014just like a Scotchman!\u2014who is going to pay anything a head?\u201d The diversions which the Mayor intended to provide were to be entirely free. He had grown so dependent upon Donald that he could scarcely resist calling him in to consult. But by sheer self-coercion he refrained. No, he thought, Farfrae would be suggesting such improvements in his damned luminous way that in spite of himself he, Henchard, would sink to the position of second fiddle, and only scrape harmonies to his manager\u2019s talents. Everybody applauded the Mayor\u2019s proposed entertainment, especially when it became known that he meant to pay for it all himself. Close to the town was an elevated green spot surrounded by an ancient square earthwork\u2014earthworks square and not square, were as common as blackberries hereabout\u2014a spot whereon the Casterbridge people usually held any kind of merry-making, meeting, or sheep-fair that required more space than the streets would afford."], "What do all of the coincidences in the novel push Henchard closer towards?": [" Still, I wouldn\u2019t call in a hurry, because\u2014well, you can guess how this money you\u2019ve come into made me feel.\u201d His voice slowly fell; he was conscious that in this room his accents and manner wore a roughness not observable in the street. He looked about the room at the novel hangings and ingenious furniture with which she had surrounded herself. \u201cUpon my life I didn\u2019t know such furniture as this could be bought in Casterbridge,\u201d he said. \u201cNor can it be,\u201d said she. \u201cNor will it till fifty years more of civilization have passed over the town. It took a waggon and four horses to get it here.\u201d \u201cH\u2019m. It looks as if you were living on capital.\u201d \u201cO no, I am not.\u201d \u201cSo much the better. But the fact is, your setting up like this makes my beaming towards you rather awkward.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d An answer was not really needed, and he did not furnish one. \u201cWell,\u201d he went on, \u201cthere\u2019s nobody in the world I would have wished to see enter into this wealth before you, Lucetta, and nobody, I am sure, who will become it more.\u201d He turned to her with congratulatory admiration so fervid that she shrank somewhat, notwithstanding that she knew him so well. \u201cI am greatly obliged to you for all that,\u201d said she, rather with an air of speaking ritual. The stint of reciprocal feeling was perceived, and Henchard showed chagrin at once\u2014nobody was more quick to show that than he. \u201cYou may be obliged or not for\u2019t. Though the things I say may not have the polish of what you\u2019ve lately learnt to expect for the first time in your life, they are real, my lady Lucetta.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s rather a rude way of speaking to me,\u201d pouted Lucetta, with stormy eyes.", " When Elizabeth\u2019s head rose through the trap she perceived that the upper door was open, and that her stepfather and Farfrae stood just within it in conversation, Farfrae being nearest the dizzy edge, and Henchard a little way behind. Not to interrupt them she remained on the steps without raising her head any higher. While waiting thus she saw\u2014or fancied she saw, for she had a terror of feeling certain\u2014her stepfather slowly raise his hand to a level behind Farfrae\u2019s shoulders, a curious expression taking possession of his face. The young man was quite unconscious of the action, which was so indirect that, if Farfrae had observed it, he might almost have regarded it as an idle outstretching of the arm. But it would have been possible, by a comparatively light touch, to push Farfrae off his balance, and send him head over heels into the air. Elizabeth felt quite sick at heart on thinking of what this _might_ have meant. As soon as they turned she mechanically took the tea to Henchard, left it, and went away. Reflecting, she endeavoured to assure herself that the movement was an idle eccentricity, and no more. Yet, on the other hand, his subordinate position in an establishment where he once had been master might be acting on him like an irritant poison; and she finally resolved to caution Donald. XXXIV. Next morning, accordingly, she rose at five o\u2019clock and went into the street.", " When last she had seen him he was sitting in a corduroy jacket, fustian waistcoat and breeches, and tanned leather leggings, with a basin of hot furmity before him. Time, the magician, had wrought much here. Watching him, and thus thinking of past days, she became so moved that she shrank back against the jamb of the waggon-office doorway to which the steps gave access, the shadow from it conveniently hiding her features. She forgot her daughter till a touch from Elizabeth-Jane aroused her. \u201cHave you seen him, mother?\u201d whispered the girl. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d answered her companion hastily. \u201cI have seen him, and it is enough for me! Now I only want to go\u2014pass away\u2014die.\u201d \u201cWhy\u2014O what?\u201d She drew closer, and whispered in her mother\u2019s ear, \u201cDoes he seem to you not likely to befriend us? I thought he looked a generous man. What a gentleman he is, isn\u2019t he? and how his diamond studs shine! How strange that you should have said he might be in the stocks, or in the workhouse, or dead! Did ever anything go more by contraries! Why do you feel so afraid of him? I am not at all; I\u2019ll call upon him\u2014he can but say he don\u2019t own such remote kin.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know at all\u2014I can\u2019t tell what to set about. I feel so down.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be that, mother, now we have got here and all! Rest there where you be a little while\u2014I will look on and find out more about him.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think I can ever meet Mr. Henchard. He is not how I thought he would be\u2014he overpowers me!", " Elizabeth fetched their simple provisions, as she had fetched the Scotchman\u2019s, and went up to the little chamber where she had left her mother, noiselessly pushing open the door with the edge of the tray. To her surprise her mother, instead of being reclined on the bed where she had left her was in an erect position, with lips parted. At Elizabeth\u2019s entry she lifted her finger. The meaning of this was soon apparent. The room allotted to the two women had at one time served as a dressing-room to the Scotchman\u2019s chamber, as was evidenced by signs of a door of communication between them\u2014now screwed up and pasted over with the wall paper. But, as is frequently the case with hotels of far higher pretensions than the Three Mariners, every word spoken in either of these rooms was distinctly audible in the other. Such sounds came through now. Thus silently conjured Elizabeth deposited the tray, and her mother whispered as she drew near, \u201c\u2019Tis he.\u201d \u201cWho?\u201d said the girl. \u201cThe Mayor.\u201d The tremors in Susan Henchard\u2019s tone might have led any person but one so perfectly unsuspicious of the truth as the girl was, to surmise some closer connection than the admitted simple kinship as a means of accounting for them. Two men were indeed talking in the adjoining chamber, the young Scotchman and Henchard, who, having entered the inn while Elizabeth-Jane was in the kitchen waiting for the supper, had been deferentially conducted upstairs by host Stannidge himself."], "What is the name of Michael Henchard\u2019s daughter?": [" The seal had cracked, and the letter was open. Henchard had no reason to suppose the restriction one of serious weight, and his feeling for his late wife had not been of the nature of deep respect. \u201cSome trifling fancy or other of poor Susan\u2019s, I suppose,\u201d he said; and without curiosity he allowed his eyes to scan the letter:\u2014 MY DEAR MICHAEL,\u2014For the good of all three of us I have kept one thing a secret from you till now. I hope you will understand why; I think you will; though perhaps you may not forgive me. But, dear Michael, I have done it for the best. I shall be in my grave when you read this, and Elizabeth-Jane will have a home. Don\u2019t curse me Mike\u2014think of how I was situated. I can hardly write it, but here it is. Elizabeth-Jane is not your Elizabeth-Jane\u2014the child who was in my arms when you sold me. No; she died three months after that, and this living one is my other husband\u2019s. I christened her by the same name we had given to the first, and she filled up the ache I felt at the other\u2019s loss. Michael, I am dying, and I might have held my tongue; but I could not. Tell her husband of this or not, as you may judge; and forgive, if you can, a woman you once deeply wronged, as she forgives you. SUSAN HENCHARD Her husband regarded the paper as if it were a window-pane through which he saw for miles. His lips twitched, and he seemed to compress his frame, as if to bear better.", " I could not bear it either.\u201d \u201cWell\u2014we must talk of a plan for keeping her in her present belief, and getting matters straight in spite of it. You have heard I am in a large way of business here\u2014that I am Mayor of the town, and churchwarden, and I don\u2019t know what all?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d she murmured. \u201cThese things, as well as the dread of the girl discovering our disgrace, makes it necessary to act with extreme caution. So that I don\u2019t see how you two can return openly to my house as the wife and daughter I once treated badly, and banished from me; and there\u2019s the rub o\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll go away at once. I only came to see\u2014\u201d \u201cNo, no, Susan; you are not to go\u2014you mistake me!\u201d he said with kindly severity. \u201cI have thought of this plan: that you and Elizabeth take a cottage in the town as the widow Mrs. Newson and her daughter; that I meet you, court you, and marry you. Elizabeth-Jane coming to my house as my stepdaughter. The thing is so natural and easy that it is half done in thinking o\u2019t. This would leave my shady, headstrong, disgraceful life as a young man absolutely unopened; the secret would be yours and mine only; and I should have the pleasure of seeing my own only child under my roof, as well as my wife.\u201d \u201cI am quite in your hands, Michael,\u201d she said meekly. \u201cI came here for the sake of Elizabeth; for myself, if you tell me to leave again to-morrow morning, and never come near you more, I am content to go.\u201d \u201cNow, now; we don\u2019t want to hear that,\u201d said Henchard gently.", " \u201cUpon the head of his bed he pinned a piece of paper, with some writing upon it,\u201d continued Abel Whittle. \u201cBut not being a man o\u2019 letters, I can\u2019t read writing; so I don\u2019t know what it is. I can get it and show ye.\u201d They stood in silence while he ran into the cottage; returning in a moment with a crumpled scrap of paper. On it there was pencilled as follows:\u2014 MICHAEL HENCHARD\u2019S WILL. \u201cThat Elizabeth-Jane Farfrae be not told of my death, or made to grieve on account of me. \u201c& that I be not bury\u2019d in consecrated ground. \u201c& that no sexton be asked to toll the bell. \u201c& that nobody is wished to see my dead body. \u201c& that no murners walk behind me at my funeral. \u201c& that no flours be planted on my grave. \u201c& that no man remember me. \u201cTo this I put my name. \u201cMICHAEL HENCHARD.\u201d \u201cWhat are we to do?\u201d said Donald, when he had handed the paper to her. She could not answer distinctly. \u201cO Donald!\u201d she cried at last through her tears, \u201cwhat bitterness lies there! O I would not have minded so much if it had not been for my unkindness at that last parting!... But there\u2019s no altering\u2014so it must be.\u201d What Henchard had written in the anguish of his dying was respected as far as practicable by Elizabeth-Jane, though less from a sense of the sacredness of last words, as such, than from her independent knowledge that the man who wrote them meant what he said. She knew the directions to be a piece of the same stuff that his whole life was made of, and hence were not to be tampered with to give herself a mournful pleasure, or her husband credit for large-heartedness.", " Grower was!\u201d \u201cMarriage?\u201d \u201cYes. With Mr. Farfrae. O Michael! I am already his wife. We were married this week at Port-Bredy. There were reasons against our doing it here. Mr. Grower was a witness because he happened to be at Port-Bredy at the time.\u201d Henchard stood as if idiotized. She was so alarmed at his silence that she murmured something about lending him sufficient money to tide over the perilous fortnight. \u201cMarried him?\u201d said Henchard at length. \u201cMy good\u2014what, married him whilst\u2014bound to marry me?\u201d \u201cIt was like this,\u201d she explained, with tears in her eyes and quavers in her voice; \u201cdon\u2019t\u2014don\u2019t be cruel! I loved him so much, and I thought you might tell him of the past\u2014and that grieved me! And then, when I had promised you, I learnt of the rumour that you had\u2014sold your first wife at a fair like a horse or cow! How could I keep my promise after hearing that? I could not risk myself in your hands; it would have been letting myself down to take your name after such a scandal. But I knew I should lose Donald if I did not secure him at once\u2014for you would carry out your threat of telling him of our former acquaintance, as long as there was a chance of keeping me for yourself by doing so. But you will not do so now, will you, Michael? for it is too late to separate us.\u201d The notes of St. Peter\u2019s bells in full peal had been wafted to them while he spoke, and now the genial thumping of the town band, renowned for its unstinted use of the drum-stick, throbbed down the street."], "What type of alcohol does the woman spike Henchard\u2019s porridge with?": [" And then,\u201d cried Farfrae impetuously, his face alight, \u201cI sold it a few weeks after, when it happened to go up again! And so, by contenting mysel\u2019 with small profits frequently repeated, I soon made five hundred pounds\u2014yes!\u201d\u2014(bringing down his hand upon the table, and quite forgetting where he was)\u2014\u201cwhile the others by keeping theirs in hand made nothing at all!\u201d Lucetta regarded him with a critical interest. He was quite a new type of person to her. At last his eye fell upon the lady\u2019s and their glances met. \u201cAy, now, I\u2019m wearying you!\u201d he exclaimed. She said, \u201cNo, indeed,\u201d colouring a shade. \u201cWhat then?\u201d \u201cQuite otherwise. You are most interesting.\u201d It was now Farfrae who showed the modest pink. \u201cI mean all you Scotchmen,\u201d she added in hasty correction. \u201cSo free from Southern extremes. We common people are all one way or the other\u2014warm or cold, passionate or frigid. You have both temperatures going on in you at the same time.\u201d \u201cBut how do you mean that? Ye were best to explain clearly, ma\u2019am.\u201d \u201cYou are animated\u2014then you are thinking of getting on. You are sad the next moment\u2014then you are thinking of Scotland and friends.\u201d \u201cYes. I think of home sometimes!\u201d he said simply. \u201cSo do I\u2014as far as I can. But it was an old house where I was born, and they pulled it down for improvements, so I seem hardly to have any home to think of now.\u201d Lucetta did not add, as she might have done, that the house was in St. Helier, and not in Bath.", " \u201cI object to that conversation!\u201d interposed the old woman. \u201cI was not capable enough to hear what I said, and what is said out of my hearing is not evidence.\u201d There was another stoppage for consultation, a book was referred to, and finally Stubberd was allowed to go on again. The truth was that the old woman had appeared in court so many more times than the magistrates themselves, that they were obliged to keep a sharp look-out upon their procedure. However, when Stubberd had rambled on a little further Henchard broke out impatiently, \u201cCome\u2014we don\u2019t want to hear any more of them cust dees and bees! Say the words out like a man, and don\u2019t be so modest, Stubberd; or else leave it alone!\u201d Turning to the woman, \u201cNow then, have you any questions to ask him, or anything to say?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d she replied with a twinkle in her eye; and the clerk dipped his pen. \u201cTwenty years ago or thereabout I was selling of furmity in a tent at Weydon Fair\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201c\u2018Twenty years ago\u2019\u2014well, that\u2019s beginning at the beginning; suppose you go back to the Creation!\u201d said the clerk, not without satire. But Henchard stared, and quite forgot what was evidence and what was not. \u201cA man and a woman with a little child came into my tent,\u201d the woman continued. \u201cThey sat down and had a basin apiece. Ah, Lord\u2019s my life! I was of a more respectable station in the world then than I am now, being a land smuggler in a large way of business; and I used to season my furmity with rum for them who asked for\u2019t.", " These letters are, in fact, related to that unhappy business. Though, thank God, it is all over now.\u201d \u201cWhat became of the poor woman?\u201d asked Farfrae. \u201cLuckily she married, and married well,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cSo that these reproaches she poured out on me do not now cause me any twinges, as they might otherwise have done.... Just listen to what an angry woman will say!\u201d Farfrae, willing to humour Henchard, though quite uninterested, and bursting with yawns, gave well-mannered attention. \u201c\u2018For me,\u2019\u201d Henchard read, \u201c\u2018there is practically no future. A creature too unconventionally devoted to you\u2014who feels it impossible that she can be the wife of any other man; and who is yet no more to you than the first woman you meet in the street\u2014such am I. I quite acquit you of any intention to wrong me, yet you are the door through which wrong has come to me. That in the event of your present wife\u2019s death you will place me in her position is a consolation so far as it goes\u2014but how far does it go? Thus I sit here, forsaken by my few acquaintance, and forsaken by you!\u2019\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s how she went on to me,\u201d said Henchard, \u201cacres of words like that, when what had happened was what I could not cure.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Farfrae absently, \u201cit is the way wi\u2019 women.\u201d But the fact was that he knew very little of the sex; yet detecting a sort of resemblance in style between the effusions of the woman he worshipped and those of the supposed stranger, he concluded that Aphrodite ever spoke thus, whosesoever the personality she assumed.", " But Lord\u2019s my life\u2014the world\u2019s no memory; straightforward dealings don\u2019t bring profit\u2014\u2019tis the sly and the underhand that get on in these times!\u201d Mrs. Newson glanced round\u2014her daughter was still bending over the distant stalls. \u201cCan you call to mind,\u201d she said cautiously to the old woman, \u201cthe sale of a wife by her husband in your tent eighteen years ago to-day?\u201d The hag reflected, and half shook her head. \u201cIf it had been a big thing I should have minded it in a moment,\u201d she said. \u201cI can mind every serious fight o\u2019 married parties, every murder, every manslaughter, even every pocket-picking\u2014leastwise large ones\u2014that \u2019t has been my lot to witness. But a selling? Was it done quiet-like?\u201d \u201cWell, yes. I think so.\u201d The furmity woman half shook her head again. \u201cAnd yet,\u201d she said, \u201cI do. At any rate, I can mind a man doing something o\u2019 the sort\u2014a man in a cord jacket, with a basket of tools; but, Lord bless ye, we don\u2019t gi\u2019e it head-room, we don\u2019t, such as that. The only reason why I can mind the man is that he came back here to the next year\u2019s fair, and told me quite private-like that if a woman ever asked for him I was to say he had gone to\u2014where?\u2014Casterbridge\u2014yes\u2014to Casterbridge, said he. But, Lord\u2019s my life, I shouldn\u2019t ha\u2019 thought of it again!\u201d Mrs. Newson would have rewarded the old woman as far as her small means afforded had she not discreetly borne in mind that it was by that unscrupulous person\u2019s liquor her husband had been degraded."], "How many guineas does Henchard sell his wife and child for?": [" \u201cIf they don\u2019t take her for that, in ten seconds they\u2019ll have to give more,\u201d said the husband. \u201cVery well. Now auctioneer, add another.\u201d \u201cThree guineas\u2014going for three guineas!\u201d said the rheumy man. \u201cNo bid?\u201d said the husband. \u201cGood Lord, why she\u2019s cost me fifty times the money, if a penny. Go on.\u201d \u201cFour guineas!\u201d cried the auctioneer. \u201cI\u2019ll tell ye what\u2014I won\u2019t sell her for less than five,\u201d said the husband, bringing down his fist so that the basins danced. \u201cI\u2019ll sell her for five guineas to any man that will pay me the money, and treat her well; and he shall have her for ever, and never hear aught o\u2019 me. But she shan\u2019t go for less. Now then\u2014five guineas\u2014and she\u2019s yours. Susan, you agree?\u201d She bowed her head with absolute indifference. \u201cFive guineas,\u201d said the auctioneer, \u201cor she\u2019ll be withdrawn. Do anybody give it? The last time. Yes or no?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said a loud voice from the doorway. All eyes were turned. Standing in the triangular opening which formed the door of the tent was a sailor, who, unobserved by the rest, had arrived there within the last two or three minutes. A dead silence followed his affirmation. \u201cYou say you do?\u201d asked the husband, staring at him. \u201cI say so,\u201d replied the sailor. \u201cSaying is one thing, and paying is another. Where\u2019s the money?\u201d The sailor hesitated a moment, looked anew at the woman, came in, unfolded five crisp pieces of paper, and threw them down upon the tablecloth.", " This had brought them hither. \u201cWhy are there so many idlers round the Town Hall to-day?\u201d said Lucetta to her servant when the case was over. She had risen late, and had just looked out of the window. \u201cOh, please, ma\u2019am, \u2019tis this larry about Mr. Henchard. A woman has proved that before he became a gentleman he sold his wife for five guineas in a booth at a fair.\u201d In all the accounts which Henchard had given her of the separation from his wife Susan for so many years, of his belief in her death, and so on, he had never clearly explained the actual and immediate cause of that separation. The story she now heard for the first time. A gradual misery overspread Lucetta\u2019s face as she dwelt upon the promise wrung from her the night before. At bottom, then, Henchard was this. How terrible a contingency for a woman who should commit herself to his care. During the day she went out to the Ring and to other places, not coming in till nearly dusk. As soon as she saw Elizabeth-Jane after her return indoors she told her that she had resolved to go away from home to the seaside for a few days\u2014to Port-Bredy; Casterbridge was so gloomy. Elizabeth, seeing that she looked wan and disturbed, encouraged her in the idea, thinking a change would afford her relief. She could not help suspecting that the gloom which seemed to have come over Casterbridge in Lucetta\u2019s eyes might be partially owing to the fact that Farfrae was away from home.", " I did it for the man; and then he had more and more; till at last he quarrelled with his wife, and offered to sell her to the highest bidder. A sailor came in and bid five guineas, and paid the money, and led her away. And the man who sold his wife in that fashion is the man sitting there in the great big chair.\u201d The speaker concluded by nodding her head at Henchard and folding her arms. Everybody looked at Henchard. His face seemed strange, and in tint as if it had been powdered over with ashes. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to hear your life and adventures,\u201d said the second magistrate sharply, filling the pause which followed. \u201cYou\u2019ve been asked if you\u2019ve anything to say bearing on the case.\u201d \u201cThat bears on the case. It proves that he\u2019s no better than I, and has no right to sit there in judgment upon me.\u201d \u201c\u2019Tis a concocted story,\u201d said the clerk. \u201cSo hold your tongue!\u201d \u201cNo\u2014\u2019tis true.\u201d The words came from Henchard. \u201c\u2019Tis as true as the light,\u201d he said slowly. \u201cAnd upon my soul it does prove that I\u2019m no better than she! And to keep out of any temptation to treat her hard for her revenge, I\u2019ll leave her to you.\u201d The sensation in the court was indescribably great. Henchard left the chair, and came out, passing through a group of people on the steps and outside that was much larger than usual; for it seemed that the old furmity dealer had mysteriously hinted to the denizens of the lane in which she had been lodging since her arrival, that she knew a queer thing or two about their great local man Mr. Henchard, if she chose to tell it.", " She was fairly happy, and I never would have undeceived her till the day of her death. Your child died; she had another, and all went well. But a time came\u2014mind me, a time always does come. A time came\u2014it was some while after she and I and the child returned from America\u2014when somebody she had confided her history to, told her my claim to her was a mockery, and made a jest of her belief in my right. After that she was never happy with me. She pined and pined, and socked and sighed. She said she must leave me, and then came the question of our child. Then a man advised me how to act, and I did it, for I thought it was best. I left her at Falmouth, and went off to sea. When I got to the other side of the Atlantic there was a storm, and it was supposed that a lot of us, including myself, had been washed overboard. I got ashore at Newfoundland, and then I asked myself what I should do. \u201c\u2018Since I\u2019m here, here I\u2019ll bide,\u2019 I thought to myself; \u2018\u2019twill be most kindness to her, now she\u2019s taken against me, to let her believe me lost, for,\u2019 I thought, \u2018while she supposes us both alive she\u2019ll be miserable; but if she thinks me dead she\u2019ll go back to him, and the child will have a home.\u2019 I\u2019ve never returned to this country till a month ago, and I found that, as I supposed, she went to you, and my daughter with her. They told me in Falmouth that Susan was dead. But my Elizabeth-Jane\u2014where is she?\u201d \u201cDead likewise,\u201d said Henchard doggedly."], "How old is Henchard when he novel opens?": [" Still, I wouldn\u2019t call in a hurry, because\u2014well, you can guess how this money you\u2019ve come into made me feel.\u201d His voice slowly fell; he was conscious that in this room his accents and manner wore a roughness not observable in the street. He looked about the room at the novel hangings and ingenious furniture with which she had surrounded herself. \u201cUpon my life I didn\u2019t know such furniture as this could be bought in Casterbridge,\u201d he said. \u201cNor can it be,\u201d said she. \u201cNor will it till fifty years more of civilization have passed over the town. It took a waggon and four horses to get it here.\u201d \u201cH\u2019m. It looks as if you were living on capital.\u201d \u201cO no, I am not.\u201d \u201cSo much the better. But the fact is, your setting up like this makes my beaming towards you rather awkward.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d An answer was not really needed, and he did not furnish one. \u201cWell,\u201d he went on, \u201cthere\u2019s nobody in the world I would have wished to see enter into this wealth before you, Lucetta, and nobody, I am sure, who will become it more.\u201d He turned to her with congratulatory admiration so fervid that she shrank somewhat, notwithstanding that she knew him so well. \u201cI am greatly obliged to you for all that,\u201d said she, rather with an air of speaking ritual. The stint of reciprocal feeling was perceived, and Henchard showed chagrin at once\u2014nobody was more quick to show that than he. \u201cYou may be obliged or not for\u2019t. Though the things I say may not have the polish of what you\u2019ve lately learnt to expect for the first time in your life, they are real, my lady Lucetta.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s rather a rude way of speaking to me,\u201d pouted Lucetta, with stormy eyes.", " \u201cAnd are you going to bide in Casterbridge, sir?\u201d she asked. \u201cAh\u2014no!\u201d said the Scotchman, with melancholy fatality in his voice, \u201cI\u2019m only passing thirrough! I am on my way to Bristol, and on frae there to foreign parts.\u201d \u201cWe be truly sorry to hear it,\u201d said Solomon Longways. \u201cWe can ill afford to lose tuneful wynd-pipes like yours when they fall among us. And verily, to mak\u2019 acquaintance with a man a-come from so far, from the land o\u2019 perpetual snow, as we may say, where wolves and wild boars and other dangerous animalcules be as common as blackbirds here-about\u2014why, \u2019tis a thing we can\u2019t do every day; and there\u2019s good sound information for bide-at-homes like we when such a man opens his mouth.\u201d \u201cNay, but ye mistake my country,\u201d said the young man, looking round upon them with tragic fixity, till his eye lighted up and his cheek kindled with a sudden enthusiasm to right their errors. \u201cThere are not perpetual snow and wolves at all in it!\u2014except snow in winter, and\u2014well\u2014a little in summer just sometimes, and a \u2018gaberlunzie\u2019 or two stalking about here and there, if ye may call them dangerous. Eh, but you should take a summer jarreny to Edinboro\u2019, and Arthur\u2019s Seat, and all round there, and then go on to the lochs, and all the Highland scenery\u2014in May and June\u2014and you would never say \u2019tis the land of wolves and perpetual snow!\u201d \u201cOf course not\u2014it stands to reason,\u201d said Buzzford. \u201c\u2019Tis barren ignorance that leads to such words.", " To her surprise she found herself in one of the little-used alleys of the town. Looking round at the door which had given her egress, by the light of the solitary lamp fixed in the alley, she saw that it was arched and old\u2014older even than the house itself. The door was studded, and the keystone of the arch was a mask. Originally the mask had exhibited a comic leer, as could still be discerned; but generations of Casterbridge boys had thrown stones at the mask, aiming at its open mouth; and the blows thereon had chipped off the lips and jaws as if they had been eaten away by disease. The appearance was so ghastly by the weakly lamp-glimmer that she could not bear to look at it\u2014the first unpleasant feature of her visit. The position of the queer old door and the odd presence of the leering mask suggested one thing above all others as appertaining to the mansion\u2019s past history\u2014intrigue. By the alley it had been possible to come unseen from all sorts of quarters in the town\u2014the old play-house, the old bull-stake, the old cock-pit, the pool wherein nameless infants had been used to disappear. High-Place Hall could boast of its conveniences undoubtedly. She turned to come away in the nearest direction homeward, which was down the alley, but hearing footsteps approaching in that quarter, and having no great wish to be found in such a place at such a time she quickly retreated. There being no other way out she stood behind a brick pier till the intruder should have gone his ways.", " \u201cWhat\u2019s going on to-night?\u201d asked the girl, after singling out an old man and standing by him long enough to acquire a neighbourly right of converse. \u201cWell, ye must be a stranger sure,\u201d said the old man, without taking his eyes from the window. \u201cWhy, \u2019tis a great public dinner of the gentle-people and such like leading volk\u2014wi\u2019 the Mayor in the chair. As we plainer fellows bain\u2019t invited, they leave the winder-shutters open that we may get jist a sense o\u2019t out here. If you mount the steps you can see em. That\u2019s Mr. Henchard, the Mayor, at the end of the table, a facing ye; and that\u2019s the Council men right and left.... Ah, lots of them when they begun life were no more than I be now!\u201d \u201cHenchard!\u201d said Elizabeth-Jane, surprised, but by no means suspecting the whole force of the revelation. She ascended to the top of the steps. Her mother, though her head was bowed, had already caught from the inn-window tones that strangely riveted her attention, before the old man\u2019s words, \u201cMr. Henchard, the Mayor,\u201d reached her ears. She arose, and stepped up to her daughter\u2019s side as soon as she could do so without showing exceptional eagerness. The interior of the hotel dining-room was spread out before her, with its tables, and glass, and plate, and inmates. Facing the window, in the chair of dignity, sat a man about forty years of age; of heavy frame, large features, and commanding voice; his general build being rather coarse than compact."], "What town does Henchard head towards after giving up on the search for his family?": [" Then he said he would search no longer, and that he would go and settle in the district which he had had for some time in his mind. Next day he started, journeying south-westward, and did not pause, except for nights\u2019 lodgings, till he reached the town of Casterbridge, in a far distant part of Wessex. III. The highroad into the village of Weydon-Priors was again carpeted with dust. The trees had put on as of yore their aspect of dingy green, and where the Henchard family of three had once walked along, two persons not unconnected with the family walked now. The scene in its broad aspect had so much of its previous character, even to the voices and rattle from the neighbouring village down, that it might for that matter have been the afternoon following the previously recorded episode. Change was only to be observed in details; but here it was obvious that a long procession of years had passed by. One of the two who walked the road was she who had figured as the young wife of Henchard on the previous occasion; now her face had lost much of its rotundity; her skin had undergone a textural change; and though her hair had not lost colour it was considerably thinner than heretofore. She was dressed in the mourning clothes of a widow. Her companion, also in black, appeared as a well-formed young woman about eighteen, completely possessed of that ephemeral precious essence youth, which is itself beauty, irrespective of complexion or contour.", " Rigid in this position, more and more words fell successively upon her ear. But what amazed her most was the tone of her husband. He spoke merely in the accents of a man who made a present of his time. \u201cOne word,\u201d he was saying, as the crackling of paper denoted that Henchard was unfolding yet another sheet. \u201cIs it quite fair to this young woman\u2019s memory to read at such length to a stranger what was intended for your eye alone?\u201d \u201cWell, yes,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cBy not giving her name I make it an example of all womankind, and not a scandal to one.\u201d \u201cIf I were you I would destroy them,\u201d said Farfrae, giving more thought to the letters than he had hitherto done. \u201cAs another man\u2019s wife it would injure the woman if it were known.\u201d \u201cNo, I shall not destroy them,\u201d murmured Henchard, putting the letters away. Then he arose, and Lucetta heard no more. She went back to her bedroom in a semi-paralyzed state. For very fear she could not undress, but sat on the edge of the bed, waiting. Would Henchard let out the secret in his parting words? Her suspense was terrible. Had she confessed all to Donald in their early acquaintance he might possibly have got over it, and married her just the same\u2014unlikely as it had once seemed; but for her or any one else to tell him now would be fatal. The door slammed; she could hear her husband bolting it. After looking round in his customary way he came leisurely up the stairs.", " To pocket her pride and search for the first husband seemed, wisely or not, the best initiatory step. He had possibly drunk himself into his tomb. But he might, on the other hand, have had too much sense to do so; for in her time with him he had been given to bouts only, and was not a habitual drunkard. At any rate, the propriety of returning to him, if he lived, was unquestionable. The awkwardness of searching for him lay in enlightening Elizabeth, a proceeding which her mother could not endure to contemplate. She finally resolved to undertake the search without confiding to the girl her former relations with Henchard, leaving it to him if they found him to take what steps he might choose to that end. This will account for their conversation at the fair and the half-informed state at which Elizabeth was led onward. In this attitude they proceeded on their journey, trusting solely to the dim light afforded of Henchard\u2019s whereabouts by the furmity woman. The strictest economy was indispensable. Sometimes they might have been seen on foot, sometimes on farmers\u2019 waggons, sometimes in carriers\u2019 vans; and thus they drew near to Casterbridge. Elizabeth-Jane discovered to her alarm that her mother\u2019s health was not what it once had been, and there was ever and anon in her talk that renunciatory tone which showed that, but for the girl, she would not be very sorry to quit a life she was growing thoroughly weary of.", " While standing in the porch a moment he saw a thick jet of wood smoke suddenly start up from the red chimney of a cottage near, and knew that the occupant had just lit her fire. He went round to the door, and the housewife agreed to prepare him some breakfast for a trifling payment, which was done. Then he started on the search for his wife and child. The perplexing nature of the undertaking became apparent soon enough. Though he examined and inquired, and walked hither and thither day after day, no such characters as those he described had anywhere been seen since the evening of the fair. To add to the difficulty he could gain no sound of the sailor\u2019s name. As money was short with him he decided, after some hesitation, to spend the sailor\u2019s money in the prosecution of this search; but it was equally in vain. The truth was that a certain shyness of revealing his conduct prevented Michael Henchard from following up the investigation with the loud hue-and-cry such a pursuit demanded to render it effectual; and it was probably for this reason that he obtained no clue, though everything was done by him that did not involve an explanation of the circumstances under which he had lost her. Weeks counted up to months, and still he searched on, maintaining himself by small jobs of work in the intervals. By this time he had arrived at a seaport, and there he derived intelligence that persons answering somewhat to his description had emigrated a little time before."], "How many years pass between the second and third chapters?": [" \u201cYes\u2014fairly. \u201cWhere am I worst?\u201d \u201cUnder your eyes\u2014I notice a little brownness there.\u201d \u201cYes. That is my worst place, I know. How many years more do you think I shall last before I get hopelessly plain?\u201d There was something curious in the way in which Elizabeth, though the younger, had come to play the part of experienced sage in these discussions. \u201cIt may be five years,\u201d she said judicially. \u201cOr, with a quiet life, as many as ten. With no love you might calculate on ten.\u201d Lucetta seemed to reflect on this as on an unalterable, impartial verdict. She told Elizabeth-Jane no more of the past attachment she had roughly adumbrated as the experiences of a third person; and Elizabeth, who in spite of her philosophy was very tender-hearted, sighed that night in bed at the thought that her pretty, rich Lucetta did not treat her to the full confidence of names and dates in her confessions. For by the \u201cshe\u201d of Lucetta\u2019s story Elizabeth had not been beguiled. XXV. The next phase of the supersession of Henchard in Lucetta\u2019s heart was an experiment in calling on her performed by Farfrae with some apparent trepidation. Conventionally speaking he conversed with both Miss Templeman and her companion; but in fact it was rather that Elizabeth sat invisible in the room. Donald appeared not to see her at all, and answered her wise little remarks with curtly indifferent monosyllables, his looks and faculties hanging on the woman who could boast of a more Protean variety in her phases, moods, opinions, and also principles, than could Elizabeth.", " \u201cI don\u2019t forbid you to marry him,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cPromise not to quite forget me when\u2014\u2014\u201d He meant when Newson should come. She promised mechanically, in her agitation; and the same evening at dusk Henchard left the town, to whose development he had been one of the chief stimulants for many years. During the day he had bought a new tool-basket, cleaned up his old hay-knife and wimble, set himself up in fresh leggings, kneenaps and corduroys, and in other ways gone back to the working clothes of his young manhood, discarding for ever the shabby-genteel suit of cloth and rusty silk hat that since his decline had characterized him in the Casterbridge street as a man who had seen better days. He went secretly and alone, not a soul of the many who had known him being aware of his departure. Elizabeth-Jane accompanied him as far as the second bridge on the highway\u2014for the hour of her appointment with the unguessed visitor at Farfrae\u2019s had not yet arrived\u2014and parted from him with unfeigned wonder and sorrow, keeping him back a minute or two before finally letting him go. She watched his form diminish across the moor, the yellow rush-basket at his back moving up and down with each tread, and the creases behind his knees coming and going alternately till she could no longer see them. Though she did not know it Henchard formed at this moment much the same picture as he had presented when entering Casterbridge for the first time nearly a quarter of a century before; except, to be sure, that the serious addition to his years had considerably lessened the spring to his stride, that his state of hopelessness had weakened him, and imparted to his shoulders, as weighted by the basket, a perceptible bend.", " The tinge of indifference which had at first been visible in the Scotchman now disappeared. Henchard went on to describe his attempts to find his wife; the oath he swore; the solitary life he led during the years which followed. \u201cI have kept my oath for nineteen years,\u201d he went on; \u201cI have risen to what you see me now.\u201d \u201cAy!\u201d \u201cWell\u2014no wife could I hear of in all that time; and being by nature something of a woman-hater, I have found it no hardship to keep mostly at a distance from the sex. No wife could I hear of, I say, till this very day. And now\u2014she has come back.\u201d \u201cCome back, has she!\u201d \u201cThis morning\u2014this very morning. And what\u2019s to be done?\u201d \u201cCan ye no\u2019 take her and live with her, and make some amends?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019ve planned and proposed. But, Farfrae,\u201d said Henchard gloomily, \u201cby doing right with Susan I wrong another innocent woman.\u201d \u201cYe don\u2019t say that?\u201d \u201cIn the nature of things, Farfrae, it is almost impossible that a man of my sort should have the good fortune to tide through twenty years o\u2019 life without making more blunders than one. It has been my custom for many years to run across to Jersey in the the way of business, particularly in the potato and root season. I do a large trade wi\u2019 them in that line. Well, one autumn when stopping there I fell quite ill, and in my illness I sank into one of those gloomy fits I sometimes suffer from, on account o\u2019 the loneliness of my domestic life, when the world seems to have the blackness of hell, and, like Job, I could curse the day that gave me birth.\u201d \u201cAh, now, I never feel like it,\u201d said Farfrae.", " Henchard watched him with his mouth firmly set, the squareness of his jaw and the verticality of his profile being unduly marked. Farfrae came on with one hand in his pocket, and humming a tune in a way which told that the words were most in his mind. They were those of the song he had sung when he arrived years before at the Three Mariners, a poor young man, adventuring for life and fortune, and scarcely knowing witherward:\u2014 \u201cAnd here\u2019s a hand, my trusty fiere, And gie\u2019s a hand o\u2019 thine.\u201d Nothing moved Henchard like an old melody. He sank back. \u201cNo; I can\u2019t do it!\u201d he gasped. \u201cWhy does the infernal fool begin that now!\u201d At length Farfrae was silent, and Henchard looked out of the loft door. \u201cWill ye come up here?\u201d he said. \u201cAy, man,\u201d said Farfrae. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see ye. What\u2019s wrang?\u201d A minute later Henchard heard his feet on the lowest ladder. He heard him land on the first floor, ascend and land on the second, begin the ascent to the third. And then his head rose through the trap behind. \u201cWhat are you doing up here at this time?\u201d he asked, coming forward. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t ye take your holiday like the rest of the men?\u201d He spoke in a tone which had just severity enough in it to show that he remembered the untoward event of the forenoon, and his conviction that Henchard had been drinking. Henchard said nothing; but going back he closed the stair hatchway, and stamped upon it so that it went tight into its frame; he next turned to the wondering young man, who by this time observed that one of Henchard\u2019s arms was bound to his side."], "Who does Elizabeth-Jane believe to be her father?": [" Then hearing at some place\u2014I forget where\u2014that a man of the name of Henchard had been mayor here, I came back, and called at his house one morning. The old rascal!\u2014he said Elizabeth-Jane had died years ago.\u201d Elizabeth now gave earnest heed to his story. \u201cNow, it never crossed my mind that the man was selling me a packet,\u201d continued Newson. \u201cAnd, if you\u2019ll believe me, I was that upset, that I went back to the coach that had brought me, and took passage onward without lying in the town half-an-hour. Ha-ha!\u2014\u2019twas a good joke, and well carried out, and I give the man credit for\u2019t!\u201d Elizabeth-Jane was amazed at the intelligence. \u201cA joke?\u2014O no!\u201d she cried. \u201cThen he kept you from me, father, all those months, when you might have been here?\u201d The father admitted that such was the case. \u201cHe ought not to have done it!\u201d said Farfrae. Elizabeth sighed. \u201cI said I would never forget him. But O! I think I ought to forget him now!\u201d Newson, like a good many rovers and sojourners among strange men and strange moralities, failed to perceive the enormity of Henchard\u2019s crime, notwithstanding that he himself had been the chief sufferer therefrom. Indeed, the attack upon the absent culprit waxing serious, he began to take Henchard\u2019s part. \u201cWell, \u2019twas not ten words that he said, after all,\u201d Newson pleaded. \u201cAnd how could he know that I should be such a simpleton as to believe him? \u2019Twas as much my fault as his, poor fellow!\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Elizabeth-Jane firmly, in her revulsion of feeling.", " Henchard pushed to the door, and for some seconds made no other movement. He rose to his feet, and stood like a dark ruin, obscured by \u201cthe shade from his own soul up-thrown.\u201d But he was no longer the man to stand these reverses unmoved. His agitation was great, and he would fain have been gone, but before he could leave the dance had ended, the housekeeper had informed Elizabeth-Jane of the stranger who awaited her, and she entered the room immediately. \u201cOh\u2014it is\u2014Mr. Henchard!\u201d she said, starting back. \u201cWhat, Elizabeth?\u201d he cried, as she seized her hand. \u201cWhat do you say?\u2014_Mr._ Henchard? Don\u2019t, don\u2019t scourge me like that! Call me worthless old Henchard\u2014anything\u2014but don\u2019t \u2019ee be so cold as this! O my maid\u2014I see you have another\u2014a real father in my place. Then you know all; but don\u2019t give all your thought to him! Do ye save a little room for me!\u201d She flushed up, and gently drew her hand away. \u201cI could have loved you always\u2014I would have, gladly,\u201d she said. \u201cBut how can I when I know you have deceived me so\u2014so bitterly deceived me! You persuaded me that my father was not my father\u2014allowed me to live on in ignorance of the truth for years; and then when he, my warm-hearted real father, came to find me, cruelly sent him away with a wicked invention of my death, which nearly broke his heart. O how can I love as I once did a man who has served us like this!\u201d Henchard\u2019s lips half parted to begin an explanation.", " But money is scarce, and throats get dry. Why _should_ death rob life o\u2019 fourpence? I say there was no treason in it.\u201d \u201cWell, poor soul; she\u2019s helpless to hinder that or anything now,\u201d answered Mother Cuxsom. \u201cAnd all her shining keys will be took from her, and her cupboards opened; and little things a\u2019 didn\u2019t wish seen, anybody will see; and her wishes and ways will all be as nothing!\u201d XIX. Henchard and Elizabeth sat conversing by the fire. It was three weeks after Mrs. Henchard\u2019s funeral, the candles were not lighted, and a restless, acrobatic flame, poised on a coal, called from the shady walls the smiles of all shapes that could respond\u2014the old pier-glass, with gilt columns and huge entablature, the picture-frames, sundry knobs and handles, and the brass rosette at the bottom of each riband bell-pull on either side of the chimney-piece. \u201cElizabeth, do you think much of old times?\u201d said Henchard. \u201cYes, sir; often,\u201d she said. \u201cWho do you put in your pictures of \u2019em?\u201d \u201cMother and father\u2014nobody else hardly.\u201d Henchard always looked like one bent on resisting pain when Elizabeth-Jane spoke of Richard Newson as \u201cfather.\u201d \u201cAh! I am out of all that, am I not?\u201d he said.... \u201cWas Newson a kind father?\u201d \u201cYes, sir; very.\u201d Henchard\u2019s face settled into an expression of stolid loneliness which gradually modulated into something softer. \u201cSuppose I had been your real father?\u201d he said. \u201cWould you have cared for me as much as you cared for Richard Newson?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t think it,\u201d she said quickly.", " \u201cI can think of no other as my father, except my father.\u201d Henchard\u2019s wife was dissevered from him by death; his friend and helper Farfrae by estrangement; Elizabeth-Jane by ignorance. It seemed to him that only one of them could possibly be recalled, and that was the girl. His mind began vibrating between the wish to reveal himself to her and the policy of leaving well alone, till he could no longer sit still. He walked up and down, and then he came and stood behind her chair, looking down upon the top of her head. He could no longer restrain his impulse. \u201cWhat did your mother tell you about me\u2014my history?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat you were related by marriage.\u201d \u201cShe should have told more\u2014before you knew me! Then my task would not have been such a hard one.... Elizabeth, it is I who am your father, and not Richard Newson. Shame alone prevented your wretched parents from owning this to you while both of \u2019em were alive.\u201d The back of Elizabeth\u2019s head remained still, and her shoulders did not denote even the movements of breathing. Henchard went on: \u201cI\u2019d rather have your scorn, your fear, anything than your ignorance; \u2019tis that I hate! Your mother and I were man and wife when we were young. What you saw was our second marriage. Your mother was too honest. We had thought each other dead\u2014and\u2014Newson became her husband.\u201d This was the nearest approach Henchard could make to the full truth. As far as he personally was concerned he would have screened nothing; but he showed a respect for the young girl\u2019s sex and years worthy of a better man."], "Susan and Elizabeth-Jane follow the sound of ___ into Casterbridge.": [" When he reached his own house he found her there. \u201cO father!\u201d she said innocently. \u201cI have had a letter\u2014a strange one\u2014not signed. Somebody has asked me to meet him, either on the Budmouth Road at noon today, or in the evening at Mr. Farfrae\u2019s. He says he came to see me some time ago, but a trick was played him, so that he did not see me. I don\u2019t understand it; but between you and me I think Donald is at the bottom of the mystery, and that it is a relation of his who wants to pass an opinion on his choice. But I did not like to go till I had seen you. Shall I go?\u201d Henchard replied heavily, \u201cYes; go.\u201d The question of his remaining in Casterbridge was for ever disposed of by this closing in of Newson on the scene. Henchard was not the man to stand the certainty of condemnation on a matter so near his heart. And being an old hand at bearing anguish in silence, and haughty withal, he resolved to make as light as he could of his intentions, while immediately taking his measures. He surprised the young woman whom he had looked upon as his all in this world by saying to her, as if he did not care about her more: \u201cI am going to leave Casterbridge, Elizabeth-Jane.\u201d \u201cLeave Casterbridge!\u201d she cried, \u201cand leave\u2014me?\u201d \u201cYes, this little shop can be managed by you alone as well as by us both; I don\u2019t care about shops and streets and folk\u2014I would rather get into the country by myself, out of sight, and follow my own ways, and leave you to yours.\u201d She looked down and her tears fell silently.", " The seal had cracked, and the letter was open. Henchard had no reason to suppose the restriction one of serious weight, and his feeling for his late wife had not been of the nature of deep respect. \u201cSome trifling fancy or other of poor Susan\u2019s, I suppose,\u201d he said; and without curiosity he allowed his eyes to scan the letter:\u2014 MY DEAR MICHAEL,\u2014For the good of all three of us I have kept one thing a secret from you till now. I hope you will understand why; I think you will; though perhaps you may not forgive me. But, dear Michael, I have done it for the best. I shall be in my grave when you read this, and Elizabeth-Jane will have a home. Don\u2019t curse me Mike\u2014think of how I was situated. I can hardly write it, but here it is. Elizabeth-Jane is not your Elizabeth-Jane\u2014the child who was in my arms when you sold me. No; she died three months after that, and this living one is my other husband\u2019s. I christened her by the same name we had given to the first, and she filled up the ache I felt at the other\u2019s loss. Michael, I am dying, and I might have held my tongue; but I could not. Tell her husband of this or not, as you may judge; and forgive, if you can, a woman you once deeply wronged, as she forgives you. SUSAN HENCHARD Her husband regarded the paper as if it were a window-pane through which he saw for miles. His lips twitched, and he seemed to compress his frame, as if to bear better.", " \u201cYou hear, Susan?\u2014I don\u2019t drink now\u2014I haven\u2019t since that night.\u201d Those were his first words. He felt her bow her head in acknowledgment that she understood. After a minute or two he again began: \u201cIf I had known you were living, Susan! But there was every reason to suppose you and the child were dead and gone. I took every possible step to find you\u2014travelled\u2014advertised. My opinion at last was that you had started for some colony with that man, and had been drowned on your voyage. Why did you keep silent like this?\u201d \u201cO Michael! because of him\u2014what other reason could there be? I thought I owed him faithfulness to the end of one of our lives\u2014foolishly I believed there was something solemn and binding in the bargain; I thought that even in honour I dared not desert him when he had paid so much for me in good faith. I meet you now only as his widow\u2014I consider myself that, and that I have no claim upon you. Had he not died I should never have come\u2014never! Of that you may be sure.\u201d \u201cTut-tut! How could you be so simple?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. Yet it would have been very wicked\u2014if I had not thought like that!\u201d said Susan, almost crying. \u201cYes\u2014yes\u2014so it would. It is only that which makes me feel \u2019ee an innocent woman. But\u2014to lead me into this!\u201d \u201cWhat, Michael?\u201d she asked, alarmed. \u201cWhy, this difficulty about our living together again, and Elizabeth-Jane. She cannot be told all\u2014she would so despise us both that\u2014I could not bear it!\u201d \u201cThat was why she was brought up in ignorance of you.", " He had purchased in so depressed a market that the present moderate stiffness of prices was sufficient to pile for him a large heap of gold where a little one had been. \u201cWhy, he\u2019ll soon be Mayor!\u201d said Henchard. It was indeed hard that the speaker should, of all others, have to follow the triumphal chariot of this man to the Capitol. The rivalry of the masters was taken up by the men. September-night shades had fallen upon Casterbridge; the clocks had struck half-past eight, and the moon had risen. The streets of the town were curiously silent for such a comparatively early hour. A sound of jangling horse-bells and heavy wheels passed up the street. These were followed by angry voices outside Lucetta\u2019s house, which led her and Elizabeth-Jane to run to the windows, and pull up the blinds. The neighbouring Market House and Town Hall abutted against its next neighbour the Church except in the lower storey, where an arched thoroughfare gave admittance to a large square called Bull Stake. A stone post rose in the midst, to which the oxen had formerly been tied for baiting with dogs to make them tender before they were killed in the adjoining shambles. In a corner stood the stocks. The thoroughfare leading to this spot was now blocked by two four-horse waggons and horses, one laden with hay-trusses, the leaders having already passed each other, and become entangled head to tail. The passage of the vehicles might have been practicable if empty; but built up with hay to the bedroom windows as one was, it was impossible."], "What are the townspeople upset about at the public dinner?": [" Their hands were mostly kept in their pockets; they wore a leather strap round their hips or knees, and boots that required a great deal of lacing, but seemed never to get any. Instead of sighing at their adversities they spat, and instead of saying the iron had entered into their souls they said they were down on their luck. Jopp in his time of distress had often stood here; so had Mother Cuxsom, Christopher Coney, and poor Abel Whittle. The _mis\u00e9rables_ who would pause on the remoter bridge were of a politer stamp. They included bankrupts, hypochondriacs, persons who were what is called \u201cout of a situation\u201d from fault or lucklessness, the inefficient of the professional class\u2014shabby-genteel men, who did not know how to get rid of the weary time between breakfast and dinner, and the yet more weary time between dinner and dark. The eye of this species were mostly directed over the parapet upon the running water below. A man seen there looking thus fixedly into the river was pretty sure to be one whom the world did not treat kindly for some reason or other. While one in straits on the townward bridge did not mind who saw him so, and kept his back to the parapet to survey the passers-by, one in straits on this never faced the road, never turned his head at coming footsteps, but, sensitive to his own condition, watched the current whenever a stranger approached, as if some strange fish interested him, though every finned thing had been poached out of the river years before.", " \u201cWhat\u2019s going on to-night?\u201d asked the girl, after singling out an old man and standing by him long enough to acquire a neighbourly right of converse. \u201cWell, ye must be a stranger sure,\u201d said the old man, without taking his eyes from the window. \u201cWhy, \u2019tis a great public dinner of the gentle-people and such like leading volk\u2014wi\u2019 the Mayor in the chair. As we plainer fellows bain\u2019t invited, they leave the winder-shutters open that we may get jist a sense o\u2019t out here. If you mount the steps you can see em. That\u2019s Mr. Henchard, the Mayor, at the end of the table, a facing ye; and that\u2019s the Council men right and left.... Ah, lots of them when they begun life were no more than I be now!\u201d \u201cHenchard!\u201d said Elizabeth-Jane, surprised, but by no means suspecting the whole force of the revelation. She ascended to the top of the steps. Her mother, though her head was bowed, had already caught from the inn-window tones that strangely riveted her attention, before the old man\u2019s words, \u201cMr. Henchard, the Mayor,\u201d reached her ears. She arose, and stepped up to her daughter\u2019s side as soon as she could do so without showing exceptional eagerness. The interior of the hotel dining-room was spread out before her, with its tables, and glass, and plate, and inmates. Facing the window, in the chair of dignity, sat a man about forty years of age; of heavy frame, large features, and commanding voice; his general build being rather coarse than compact.", " XVI. On this account Henchard\u2019s manner towards Farfrae insensibly became more reserved. He was courteous\u2014too courteous\u2014and Farfrae was quite surprised at the good breeding which now for the first time showed itself among the qualities of a man he had hitherto thought undisciplined, if warm and sincere. The corn-factor seldom or never again put his arm upon the young man\u2019s shoulder so as to nearly weigh him down with the pressure of mechanized friendship. He left off coming to Donald\u2019s lodgings and shouting into the passage. \u201cHoy, Farfrae, boy, come and have some dinner with us! Don\u2019t sit here in solitary confinement!\u201d But in the daily routine of their business there was little change. Thus their lives rolled on till a day of public rejoicing was suggested to the country at large in celebration of a national event that had recently taken place. For some time Casterbridge, by nature slow, made no response. Then one day Donald Farfrae broached the subject to Henchard by asking if he would have any objection to lend some rick-cloths to himself and a few others, who contemplated getting up an entertainment of some sort on the day named, and required a shelter for the same, to which they might charge admission at the rate of so much a head. \u201cHave as many cloths as you like,\u201d Henchard replied. When his manager had gone about the business Henchard was fired with emulation. It certainly had been very remiss of him, as Mayor, he thought, to call no meeting ere this, to discuss what should be done on this holiday.", " Then hearing at some place\u2014I forget where\u2014that a man of the name of Henchard had been mayor here, I came back, and called at his house one morning. The old rascal!\u2014he said Elizabeth-Jane had died years ago.\u201d Elizabeth now gave earnest heed to his story. \u201cNow, it never crossed my mind that the man was selling me a packet,\u201d continued Newson. \u201cAnd, if you\u2019ll believe me, I was that upset, that I went back to the coach that had brought me, and took passage onward without lying in the town half-an-hour. Ha-ha!\u2014\u2019twas a good joke, and well carried out, and I give the man credit for\u2019t!\u201d Elizabeth-Jane was amazed at the intelligence. \u201cA joke?\u2014O no!\u201d she cried. \u201cThen he kept you from me, father, all those months, when you might have been here?\u201d The father admitted that such was the case. \u201cHe ought not to have done it!\u201d said Farfrae. Elizabeth sighed. \u201cI said I would never forget him. But O! I think I ought to forget him now!\u201d Newson, like a good many rovers and sojourners among strange men and strange moralities, failed to perceive the enormity of Henchard\u2019s crime, notwithstanding that he himself had been the chief sufferer therefrom. Indeed, the attack upon the absent culprit waxing serious, he began to take Henchard\u2019s part. \u201cWell, \u2019twas not ten words that he said, after all,\u201d Newson pleaded. \u201cAnd how could he know that I should be such a simpleton as to believe him? \u2019Twas as much my fault as his, poor fellow!\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Elizabeth-Jane firmly, in her revulsion of feeling."], "Where do Susan and Elizabeth-Jane decide to stay in Casterbridge?": [" \u201cMr. Henchard?\u201d came from it in the voice of Farfrae. Henchard turned his face. Finding that he had guessed rightly Farfrae told the man who accompanied him to drive home; while he alighted and went up to his former friend. \u201cI have heard that you think of emigrating, Mr. Henchard?\u201d he said. \u201cIs it true? I have a real reason for asking.\u201d Henchard withheld his answer for several instants, and then said, \u201cYes; it is true. I am going where you were going to a few years ago, when I prevented you and got you to bide here. \u2019Tis turn and turn about, isn\u2019t it! Do ye mind how we stood like this in the Chalk Walk when I persuaded \u2019ee to stay? You then stood without a chattel to your name, and I was the master of the house in Corn Street. But now I stand without a stick or a rag, and the master of that house is you.\u201d \u201cYes, yes; that\u2019s so! It\u2019s the way o\u2019 the warrld,\u201d said Farfrae. \u201cHa, ha, true!\u201d cried Henchard, throwing himself into a mood of jocularity. \u201cUp and down! I\u2019m used to it. What\u2019s the odds after all!\u201d \u201cNow listen to me, if it\u2019s no taking up your time,\u201d said Farfrae, \u201cjust as I listened to you. Don\u2019t go. Stay at home.\u201d \u201cBut I can do nothing else, man!\u201d said Henchard scornfully. \u201cThe little money I have will just keep body and soul together for a few weeks, and no more. I have not felt inclined to go back to journey-work yet; but I can\u2019t stay doing nothing, and my best chance is elsewhere.\u201d \u201cNo; but what I propose is this\u2014if ye will listen.", " The seal had cracked, and the letter was open.

Would Mr. Farfrae stay in Casterbridge despite his words and her father\u2019s dismissal? His occult breathings to her might be solvable by his course in that respect. The next day was windy\u2014so windy that walking in the garden she picked up a portion of the draft of a letter on business in Donald Farfrae\u2019s writing, which had flown over the wall from the office. The useless scrap she took indoors, and began to copy the calligraphy, which she much admired. The letter began \u201cDear Sir,\u201d and presently writing on a loose slip \u201cElizabeth-Jane,\u201d she laid the latter over \u201cSir,\u201d making the phrase \u201cDear Elizabeth-Jane.\u201d When she saw the effect a quick red ran up her face and warmed her through, though nobody was there to see what she had done. She quickly tore up the slip, and threw it away. After this she grew cool and laughed at herself, walked about the room, and laughed again; not joyfully, but distressfully rather. It was quickly known in Casterbridge that Farfrae and Henchard had decided to dispense with each other. Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s anxiety to know if Farfrae were going away from the town reached a pitch that disturbed her, for she could no longer conceal from herself the cause."], "What is the name of the Scotchman that Susan and Elizabeth-Jane follow to the inn?": [" Elizabeth fetched their simple provisions, as she had fetched the Scotchman\u2019s, and went up to the little chamber where she had left her mother, noiselessly pushing open the door with the edge of the tray. To her surprise her mother, instead of being reclined on the bed where she had left her was in an erect position, with lips parted. At Elizabeth\u2019s entry she lifted her finger. The meaning of this was soon apparent. The room allotted to the two women had at one time served as a dressing-room to the Scotchman\u2019s chamber, as was evidenced by signs of a door of communication between them\u2014now screwed up and pasted over with the wall paper. But, as is frequently the case with hotels of far higher pretensions than the Three Mariners, every word spoken in either of these rooms was distinctly audible in the other. Such sounds came through now. Thus silently conjured Elizabeth deposited the tray, and her mother whispered as she drew near, \u201c\u2019Tis he.\u201d \u201cWho?\u201d said the girl. \u201cThe Mayor.\u201d The tremors in Susan Henchard\u2019s tone might have led any person but one so perfectly unsuspicious of the truth as the girl was, to surmise some closer connection than the admitted simple kinship as a means of accounting for them. Two men were indeed talking in the adjoining chamber, the young Scotchman and Henchard, who, having entered the inn while Elizabeth-Jane was in the kitchen waiting for the supper, had been deferentially conducted upstairs by host Stannidge himself.", " She looked startled, jerked his foot warningly, and murmured, \u201cDid I?\u201d As soon as Elizabeth was gone to her own room Henchard resumed. \u201cBegad, I nearly forgot myself just now! What I meant was that the girl\u2019s hair certainly looked as if it would be darker, when she was a baby.\u201d \u201cIt did; but they alter so,\u201d replied Susan. \u201cTheir hair gets darker, I know\u2014but I wasn\u2019t aware it lightened ever?\u201d \u201cO yes.\u201d And the same uneasy expression came out on her face, to which the future held the key. It passed as Henchard went on: \u201cWell, so much the better. Now Susan, I want to have her called Miss Henchard\u2014not Miss Newson. Lots o\u2019 people do it already in carelessness\u2014it is her legal name\u2014so it may as well be made her usual name\u2014I don\u2019t like t\u2019other name at all for my own flesh and blood. I\u2019ll advertise it in the Casterbridge paper\u2014that\u2019s the way they do it. She won\u2019t object.\u201d \u201cNo. O no. But\u2014\u201d \u201cWell, then, I shall do it,\u201d he said, peremptorily. \u201cSurely, if she\u2019s willing, you must wish it as much as I?\u201d \u201cO yes\u2014if she agrees let us do it by all means,\u201d she replied. Then Mrs. Henchard acted somewhat inconsistently; it might have been called falsely, but that her manner was emotional and full of the earnestness of one who wishes to do right at great hazard. She went to Elizabeth-Jane, whom she found sewing in her own sitting-room upstairs, and told her what had been proposed about her surname. \u201cCan you agree\u2014is it not a slight upon Newson\u2014now he\u2019s dead and gone?\u201d Elizabeth reflected.", " \u201cBegad!\u201d he suddenly exclaimed, jumping up. \u201cI didn\u2019t think of that. Perhaps these are impostors\u2014and Susan and the child dead after all!\u201d However, a something in Elizabeth-Jane soon assured him that, as regarded her, at least, there could be little doubt. And a few hours would settle the question of her mother\u2019s identity; for he had arranged in his note to see her that evening. \u201cIt never rains but it pours!\u201d said Henchard. His keenly excited interest in his new friend the Scotchman was now eclipsed by this event, and Donald Farfrae saw so little of him during the rest of the day that he wondered at the suddenness of his employer\u2019s moods. In the meantime Elizabeth had reached the inn. Her mother, instead of taking the note with the curiosity of a poor woman expecting assistance, was much moved at sight of it. She did not read it at once, asking Elizabeth to describe her reception, and the very words Mr. Henchard used. Elizabeth\u2019s back was turned when her mother opened the letter. It ran thus:\u2014 \u201cMeet me at eight o\u2019clock this evening, if you can, at the Ring on the Budmouth road. The place is easy to find. I can say no more now. The news upsets me almost. The girl seems to be in ignorance. Keep her so till I have seen you. M. H.\u201d He said nothing about the enclosure of five guineas. The amount was significant; it may tacitly have said to her that he bought her back again. She waited restlessly for the close of the day, telling Elizabeth-Jane that she was invited to see Mr. Henchard; that she would go alone.", " The seal had cracked, and the letter was open. Henchard had no reason to suppose the restriction one of serious weight, and his feeling for his late wife had not been of the nature of deep respect. \u201cSome trifling fancy or other of poor Susan\u2019s, I suppose,\u201d he said; and without curiosity he allowed his eyes to scan the letter:\u2014 MY DEAR MICHAEL,\u2014For the good of all three of us I have kept one thing a secret from you till now. I hope you will understand why; I think you will; though perhaps you may not forgive me. But, dear Michael, I have done it for the best. I shall be in my grave when you read this, and Elizabeth-Jane will have a home. Don\u2019t curse me Mike\u2014think of how I was situated. I can hardly write it, but here it is. Elizabeth-Jane is not your Elizabeth-Jane\u2014the child who was in my arms when you sold me. No; she died three months after that, and this living one is my other husband\u2019s. I christened her by the same name we had given to the first, and she filled up the ache I felt at the other\u2019s loss. Michael, I am dying, and I might have held my tongue; but I could not. Tell her husband of this or not, as you may judge; and forgive, if you can, a woman you once deeply wronged, as she forgives you. SUSAN HENCHARD Her husband regarded the paper as if it were a window-pane through which he saw for miles. His lips twitched, and he seemed to compress his frame, as if to bear better."], "Where does Farfrae want to travel to?": [" \u201cIt is odd,\u201d said Henchard, \u201cthat two men should meet as we have done on a purely business ground, and that at the end of the first day I should wish to speak to \u2019ee on a family matter. But, damn it all, I am a lonely man, Farfrae: I have nobody else to speak to; and why shouldn\u2019t I tell it to \u2019ee?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be glad to hear it, if I can be of any service,\u201d said Donald, allowing his eyes to travel over the intricate wood-carvings of the chimney-piece, representing garlanded lyres, shields, and quivers, on either side of a draped ox-skull, and flanked by heads of Apollo and Diana in low relief. \u201cI\u2019ve not been always what I am now,\u201d continued Henchard, his firm deep voice being ever so little shaken. He was plainly under that strange influence which sometimes prompts men to confide to the new-found friend what they will not tell to the old. \u201cI began life as a working hay-trusser, and when I was eighteen I married on the strength o\u2019 my calling. Would you think me a married man?\u201d \u201cI heard in the town that you were a widower.\u201d \u201cAh, yes\u2014you would naturally have heard that. Well, I lost my wife nineteen years ago or so\u2014by my own fault.... This is how it came about. One summer evening I was travelling for employment, and she was walking at my side, carrying the baby, our only child. We came to a booth in a country fair. I was a drinking man at that time.\u201d Henchard paused a moment, threw himself back so that his elbow rested on the table, his forehead being shaded by his hand, which, however, did not hide the marks of introspective inflexibility on his features as he narrated in fullest detail the incidents of the transaction with the sailor.", " \u201cMy history is not gay or attractive,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd yet I can tell it, if you really want to know.\u201d The lady assured her that she did want to know; whereupon Elizabeth-Jane told the tale of her life as she understood it, which was in general the true one, except that the sale at the fair had no part therein. Contrary to the girl\u2019s expectation her new friend was not shocked. This cheered her; and it was not till she thought of returning to that home in which she had been treated so roughly of late that her spirits fell. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to return,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI think of going away. But what can I do? Where can I go?\u201d \u201cPerhaps it will be better soon,\u201d said her friend gently. \u201cSo I would not go far. Now what do you think of this: I shall soon want somebody to live in my house, partly as housekeeper, partly as companion; would you mind coming to me? But perhaps\u2014\u201d \u201cO yes,\u201d cried Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes. \u201cI would, indeed\u2014I would do anything to be independent; for then perhaps my father might get to love me. But, ah!\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cI am no accomplished person. And a companion to you must be that.\u201d \u201cO, not necessarily.\u201d \u201cNot? But I can\u2019t help using rural words sometimes, when I don\u2019t mean to.\u201d \u201cNever mind, I shall like to know them.\u201d \u201cAnd\u2014O, I know I shan\u2019t do!\u201d\u2014she cried with a distressful laugh. \u201cI accidentally learned to write round hand instead of ladies\u2019-hand. And, of course, you want some one who can write that?\u201d \u201cWell, no.\u201d \u201cWhat, not necessary to write ladies\u2019-hand?\u201d cried the joyous Elizabeth.", " Lucetta\u2019s eyes, full of tears, met Farfrae\u2019s. His, too, to her surprise, were moist at the scene. \u201cIt is very hard,\u201d she said with strong feelings. \u201cLovers ought not to be parted like that! O, if I had my wish, I\u2019d let people live and love at their pleasure!\u201d \u201cMaybe I can manage that they\u2019ll not be parted,\u201d said Farfrae. \u201cI want a young carter; and perhaps I\u2019ll take the old man too\u2014yes; he\u2019ll not be very expensive, and doubtless he will answer my pairrpose somehow.\u201d \u201cO, you are so good!\u201d she cried, delighted. \u201cGo and tell them, and let me know if you have succeeded!\u201d Farfrae went out, and she saw him speak to the group. The eyes of all brightened; the bargain was soon struck. Farfrae returned to her immediately it was concluded. \u201cIt is kind-hearted of you, indeed,\u201d said Lucetta. \u201cFor my part, I have resolved that all my servants shall have lovers if they want them! Do make the same resolve!\u201d Farfrae looked more serious, waving his head a half turn. \u201cI must be a little stricter than that,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cYou are a\u2014a thriving woman; and I am a struggling hay-and-corn merchant.\u201d \u201cI am a very ambitious woman.\u201d \u201cAh, well, I cannet explain. I don\u2019t know how to talk to ladies, ambitious or no; and that\u2019s true,\u201d said Donald with grave regret. \u201cI try to be civil to a\u2019 folk\u2014no more!\u201d \u201cI see you are as you say,\u201d replied she, sensibly getting the upper hand in these exchanges of sentiment.", " Of course I\u2019m glad to come if you want me.\u201d \u201cO, thank you,\u201d she said apprehensively. \u201cI am sorry to see \u2019ee looking so ill,\u201d he stammered with unconcealed compunction. She shook her head. \u201cHow can you be sorry,\u201d she asked, \u201cwhen you deliberately cause it?\u201d \u201cWhat!\u201d said Henchard uneasily. \u201cIs it anything I have done that has pulled you down like that?\u201d \u201cIt is all your doing,\u201d she said. \u201cI have no other grief. My happiness would be secure enough but for your threats. O Michael! don\u2019t wreck me like this! You might think that you have done enough! When I came here I was a young woman; now I am rapidly becoming an old one. Neither my husband nor any other man will regard me with interest long.\u201d Henchard was disarmed. His old feeling of supercilious pity for womankind in general was intensified by this suppliant appearing here as the double of the first. Moreover that thoughtless want of foresight which had led to all her trouble remained with poor Lucetta still; she had come to meet him here in this compromising way without perceiving the risk. Such a woman was very small deer to hunt; he felt ashamed, lost all zest and desire to humiliate Lucetta there and then, and no longer envied Farfrae his bargain. He had married money, but nothing more. Henchard was anxious to wash his hands of the game. \u201cWell, what do you want me to do?\u201d he said gently. \u201cI am sure I shall be very willing. My reading of those letters was only a sort of practical joke, and I revealed nothing.\u201d \u201cTo give me back the letters and any papers you may have that breathe of matrimony or worse.\u201d \u201cSo be it."], "According to Elizabeth, how do she and Donald Farfrae view life?": [" And she could see that Farfrae was still incredulous. Henchard, a poor man in his employ, was not to Farfrae\u2019s view the Henchard who had ruled him. Yet he was not only the same man, but that man with his sinister qualities, formerly latent, quickened into life by his buffetings. Farfrae, happy, and thinking no evil, persisted in making light of her fears. Thus they parted, and she went homeward, journeymen now being in the street, waggoners going to the harness-makers for articles left to be repaired, farm-horses going to the shoeing-smiths, and the sons of labour showing themselves generally on the move. Elizabeth entered her lodging unhappily, thinking she had done no good, and only made herself appear foolish by her weak note of warning. But Donald Farfrae was one of those men upon whom an incident is never absolutely lost. He revised impressions from a subsequent point of view, and the impulsive judgment of the moment was not always his permanent one. The vision of Elizabeth\u2019s earnest face in the rimy dawn came back to him several times during the day. Knowing the solidity of her character he did not treat her hints altogether as idle sounds. But he did not desist from a kindly scheme on Henchard\u2019s account that engaged him just then; and when he met Lawyer Joyce, the town-clerk, later in the day, he spoke of it as if nothing had occurred to damp it. \u201cAbout that little seedsman\u2019s shop,\u201d he said, \u201cthe shop overlooking the churchyard, which is to let.", " She saw that Donald and Mr. Henchard were inseparables. When walking together Henchard would lay his arm familiarly on his manager\u2019s shoulder, as if Farfrae were a younger brother, bearing so heavily that his slight frame bent under the weight. Occasionally she would hear a perfect cannonade of laughter from Henchard, arising from something Donald had said, the latter looking quite innocent and not laughing at all. In Henchard\u2019s somewhat lonely life he evidently found the young man as desirable for comradeship as he was useful for consultations. Donald\u2019s brightness of intellect maintained in the corn-factor the admiration it had won at the first hour of their meeting. The poor opinion, and but ill-concealed, that he entertained of the slim Farfrae\u2019s physical girth, strength, and dash was more than counterbalanced by the immense respect he had for his brains. Her quiet eye discerned that Henchard\u2019s tigerish affection for the younger man, his constant liking to have Farfrae near him, now and then resulted in a tendency to domineer, which, however, was checked in a moment when Donald exhibited marks of real offence. One day, looking down on their figures from on high, she heard the latter remark, as they stood in the doorway between the garden and yard, that their habit of walking and driving about together rather neutralized Farfrae\u2019s value as a second pair of eyes, which should be used in places where the principal was not.", " Susan Henchard entered a carriage for the first time in her life when she stepped into the plain brougham which drew up at the door on the wedding-day to take her and Elizabeth-Jane to church. It was a windless morning of warm November rain, which floated down like meal, and lay in a powdery form on the nap of hats and coats. Few people had gathered round the church door though they were well packed within. The Scotchman, who assisted as groomsman, was of course the only one present, beyond the chief actors, who knew the true situation of the contracting parties. He, however, was too inexperienced, too thoughtful, too judicial, too strongly conscious of the serious side of the business, to enter into the scene in its dramatic aspect. That required the special genius of Christopher Coney, Solomon Longways, Buzzford, and their fellows. But they knew nothing of the secret; though, as the time for coming out of church drew on, they gathered on the pavement adjoining, and expounded the subject according to their lights. \u201c\u2019Tis five-and-forty years since I had my settlement in this here town,\u201d said Coney; \u201cbut daze me if I ever see a man wait so long before to take so little! There\u2019s a chance even for thee after this, Nance Mockridge.\u201d The remark was addressed to a woman who stood behind his shoulder\u2014the same who had exhibited Henchard\u2019s bad bread in public when Elizabeth and her mother entered Casterbridge.", " It was a point in the highway near which the road to Mellstock branched off from the homeward direction. By diverging to that village, as he had intended to do, Farfrae might probably delay his return by a couple of hours. It soon appeared that his intention was to do so still, the light swerving towards Cuckoo Lane, the by-road aforesaid. Farfrae\u2019s off gig-lamp flashed in Henchard\u2019s face. At the same time Farfrae discerned his late antagonist. \u201cFarfrae\u2014Mr. Farfrae!\u201d cried the breathless Henchard, holding up his hand. Farfrae allowed the horse to turn several steps into the branch lane before he pulled up. He then drew rein, and said \u201cYes?\u201d over his shoulder, as one would towards a pronounced enemy. \u201cCome back to Casterbridge at once!\u201d Henchard said. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong at your house\u2014requiring your return. I\u2019ve run all the way here on purpose to tell ye.\u201d Farfrae was silent, and at his silence Henchard\u2019s soul sank within him. Why had he not, before this, thought of what was only too obvious? He who, four hours earlier, had enticed Farfrae into a deadly wrestle stood now in the darkness of late night-time on a lonely road, inviting him to come a particular way, where an assailant might have confederates, instead of going his purposed way, where there might be a better opportunity of guarding himself from attack. Henchard could almost feel this view of things in course of passage through Farfrae\u2019s mind."], "When Elizabeth delivers Henchard a note, who does she find in his office?": [" X. While she still sat under the Scotchman\u2019s eyes a man came up to the door, reaching it as Henchard opened the door of the inner office to admit Elizabeth. The newcomer stepped forward like the quicker cripple at Bethesda, and entered in her stead. She could hear his words to Henchard: \u201cJoshua Jopp, sir\u2014by appointment\u2014the new manager.\u201d \u201cThe new manager!\u2014he\u2019s in his office,\u201d said Henchard bluntly. \u201cIn his office!\u201d said the man, with a stultified air. \u201cI mentioned Thursday,\u201d said Henchard; \u201cand as you did not keep your appointment, I have engaged another manager. At first I thought he must be you. Do you think I can wait when business is in question?\u201d \u201cYou said Thursday or Saturday, sir,\u201d said the newcomer, pulling out a letter. \u201cWell, you are too late,\u201d said the corn-factor. \u201cI can say no more.\u201d \u201cYou as good as engaged me,\u201d murmured the man. \u201cSubject to an interview,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cI am sorry for you\u2014very sorry indeed. But it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d There was no more to be said, and the man came out, encountering Elizabeth-Jane in his passage. She could see that his mouth twitched with anger, and that bitter disappointment was written in his face everywhere. Elizabeth-Jane now entered, and stood before the master of the premises. His dark pupils\u2014which always seemed to have a red spark of light in them, though this could hardly be a physical fact\u2014turned indifferently round under his dark brows until they rested on her figure.", " He tore out the leaf, folded and directed it, and seemed about to throw it in through the open sash upon the dining-table; but, on second thoughts, edged himself through the loiterers, till he reached the door of the hotel, where one of the waiters who had been serving inside was now idly leaning against the doorpost. \u201cGive this to the Mayor at once,\u201d he said, handing in his hasty note. Elizabeth-Jane had seen his movements and heard the words, which attracted her both by their subject and by their accent\u2014a strange one for those parts. It was quaint and northerly. The waiter took the note, while the young stranger continued\u2014 \u201cAnd can ye tell me of a respectable hotel that\u2019s a little more moderate than this?\u201d The waiter glanced indifferently up and down the street. \u201cThey say the Three Mariners, just below here, is a very good place,\u201d he languidly answered; \u201cbut I have never stayed there myself.\u201d The Scotchman, as he seemed to be, thanked him, and strolled on in the direction of the Three Mariners aforesaid, apparently more concerned about the question of an inn than about the fate of his note, now that the momentary impulse of writing it was over. While he was disappearing slowly down the street the waiter left the door, and Elizabeth-Jane saw with some interest the note brought into the dining-room and handed to the Mayor. Henchard looked at it carelessly, unfolded it with one hand, and glanced it through.", " \u201cBegad!\u201d he suddenly exclaimed, jumping up. \u201cI didn\u2019t think of that. Perhaps these are impostors\u2014and Susan and the child dead after all!\u201d However, a something in Elizabeth-Jane soon assured him that, as regarded her, at least, there could be little doubt.

The amount was significant; it may tacitly have said to her that he bought her back again. She waited restlessly for the close of the day, telling Elizabeth-Jane that she was invited to see Mr. Henchard; that she would go alone.", " \u201cWe must get a place to lie down in,\u201d she murmured. \u201cI have seen\u2014Mr. Henchard; and that\u2019s all I wanted to do.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s enough for to-night, at any rate,\u201d Elizabeth-Jane replied soothingly. \u201cWe can think to-morrow what is best to do about him. The question now is\u2014is it not?\u2014how shall we find a lodging?\u201d As her mother did not reply Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s mind reverted to the words of the waiter, that the Three Mariners was an inn of moderate charges. A recommendation good for one person was probably good for another. \u201cLet\u2019s go where the young man has gone to,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is respectable. What do you say?\u201d Her mother assented, and down the street they went. In the meantime the Mayor\u2019s thoughtfulness, engendered by the note as stated, continued to hold him in abstraction; till, whispering to his neighbour to take his place, he found opportunity to leave the chair. This was just after the departure of his wife and Elizabeth. Outside the door of the assembly-room he saw the waiter, and beckoning to him asked who had brought the note which had been handed in a quarter of an hour before. \u201cA young man, sir\u2014a sort of traveller. He was a Scotchman seemingly.\u201d \u201cDid he say how he had got it?\u201d \u201cHe wrote it himself, sir, as he stood outside the window.\u201d \u201cOh\u2014wrote it himself.... Is the young man in the hotel?\u201d \u201cNo, sir. He went to the Three Mariners, I believe.\u201d The mayor walked up and down the vestibule of the hotel with his hands under his coat tails, as if he were merely seeking a cooler atmosphere than that of the room he had quitted."], "What does Henchard enclose in his return letter to Susan?": [" I\u2019m so bad at letters.\u201d \u201cAnd I will.\u201d \u201cNow, I haven\u2019t told you quite all yet. My wife Susan has my daughter with her\u2014the baby that was in her arms at the fair; and this girl knows nothing of me beyond that I am some sort of relation by marriage. She has grown up in the belief that the sailor to whom I made over her mother, and who is now dead, was her father, and her mother\u2019s husband. What her mother has always felt, she and I together feel now\u2014that we can\u2019t proclaim our disgrace to the girl by letting her know the truth. Now what would you do?\u2014I want your advice.\u201d \u201cI think I\u2019d run the risk, and tell her the truth. She\u2019ll forgive ye both.\u201d \u201cNever!\u201d said Henchard. \u201cI am not going to let her know the truth. Her mother and I be going to marry again; and it will not only help us to keep our child\u2019s respect, but it will be more proper. Susan looks upon herself as the sailor\u2019s widow, and won\u2019t think o\u2019 living with me as formerly without another religious ceremony\u2014and she\u2019s right.\u201d Farfrae thereupon said no more. The letter to the young Jersey woman was carefully framed by him, and the interview ended, Henchard saying, as the Scotchman left, \u201cI feel it a great relief, Farfrae, to tell some friend o\u2019 this! You see now that the Mayor of Casterbridge is not so thriving in his mind as it seems he might be from the state of his pocket.\u201d \u201cI do. And I\u2019m sorry for ye!\u201d said Farfrae. When he was gone Henchard copied the letter, and, enclosing a cheque, took it to the post-office, from which he walked back thoughtfully.", " The seal had cracked, and the letter was open. Henchard had no reason to suppose the restriction one of serious weight, and his feeling for his late wife had not been of the nature of deep respect. \u201cSome trifling fancy or other of poor Susan\u2019s, I suppose,\u201d he said; and without curiosity he allowed his eyes to scan the letter:\u2014 MY DEAR MICHAEL,\u2014For the good of all three of us I have kept one thing a secret from you till now.

His lips twitched, and he seemed to compress his frame, as if to bear better.", " Henchard unfolded another letter, and read it through likewise, stopping at the subscription as before. \u201cHer name I don\u2019t give,\u201d he said blandly. \u201cAs I didn\u2019t marry her, and another man did, I can scarcely do that in fairness to her.\u201d \u201cTr-rue, tr-rue,\u201d said Farfrae. \u201cBut why didn\u2019t you marry her when your wife Susan died?\u201d Farfrae asked this and the other questions in the comfortably indifferent tone of one whom the matter very remotely concerned. \u201cAh\u2014well you may ask that!\u201d said Henchard, the new-moon-shaped grin adumbrating itself again upon his mouth. \u201cIn spite of all her protestations, when I came forward to do so, as in generosity bound, she was not the woman for me.\u201d \u201cShe had already married another\u2014maybe?\u201d Henchard seemed to think it would be sailing too near the wind to descend further into particulars, and he answered \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cThe young lady must have had a heart that bore transplanting very readily!\u201d \u201cShe had, she had,\u201d said Henchard emphatically. He opened a third and fourth letter, and read. This time he approached the conclusion as if the signature were indeed coming with the rest. But again he stopped short. The truth was that, as may be divined, he had quite intended to effect a grand catastrophe at the end of this drama by reading out the name, he had come to the house with no other thought. But sitting here in cold blood he could not do it. Such a wrecking of hearts appalled even him.", " \u201cNow then, what is it, my young woman?\u201d he said blandly. \u201cCan I speak to you\u2014not on business, sir?\u201d said she. \u201cYes\u2014I suppose.\u201d He looked at her more thoughtfully. \u201cI am sent to tell you, sir,\u201d she innocently went on, \u201cthat a distant relative of yours by marriage, Susan Newson, a sailor\u2019s widow, is in the town, and to ask whether you would wish to see her.\u201d The rich _rouge-et-noir_ of his countenance underwent a slight change. \u201cOh\u2014Susan is\u2014still alive?\u201d he asked with difficulty. \u201cYes, sir.\u201d \u201cAre you her daughter?\u201d \u201cYes, sir\u2014her only daughter.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2014do you call yourself\u2014your Christian name?\u201d \u201cElizabeth-Jane, sir.\u201d \u201cNewson?\u201d \u201cElizabeth-Jane Newson.\u201d This at once suggested to Henchard that the transaction of his early married life at Weydon Fair was unrecorded in the family history. It was more than he could have expected. His wife had behaved kindly to him in return for his unkindness, and had never proclaimed her wrong to her child or to the world. \u201cI am\u2014a good deal interested in your news,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd as this is not a matter of business, but pleasure, suppose we go indoors.\u201d It was with a gentle delicacy of manner, surprising to Elizabeth, that he showed her out of the office and through the outer room, where Donald Farfrae was overhauling bins and samples with the inquiring inspection of a beginner in charge. Henchard preceded her through the door in the wall to the suddenly changed scene of the garden and flowers, and onward into the house."], "Who do Henchard and Farfrae quarrel over?": [" Come and live in your old house. We can spare some rooms very well\u2014I am sure my wife would not mind it at all\u2014until there\u2019s an opening for ye.\u201d Henchard started. Probably the picture drawn by the unsuspecting Donald of himself under the same roof with Lucetta was too striking to be received with equanimity. \u201cNo, no,\u201d he said gruffly; \u201cwe should quarrel.\u201d \u201cYou should hae a part to yourself,\u201d said Farfrae; \u201cand nobody to interfere wi\u2019 you. It will be a deal healthier than down there by the river where you live now.\u201d Still Henchard refused. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you ask,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, I can do no less than thank \u2019ee.\u201d They walked into the town together side by side, as they had done when Henchard persuaded the young Scotchman to remain. \u201cWill you come in and have some supper?\u201d said Farfrae when they reached the middle of the town, where their paths diverged right and left. \u201cNo, no.\u201d \u201cBy-the-bye, I had nearly forgot. I bought a good deal of your furniture. \u201cSo I have heard.\u201d \u201cWell, it was no that I wanted it so very much for myself; but I wish ye to pick out all that you care to have\u2014such things as may be endeared to ye by associations, or particularly suited to your use. And take them to your own house\u2014it will not be depriving me, we can do with less very well, and I will have plenty of opportunities of getting more.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2014give it to me for nothing?\u201d said Henchard. \u201cBut you paid the creditors for it!\u201d \u201cAh, yes; but maybe it\u2019s worth more to you than it is to me.\u201d Henchard was a little moved.", " \u201cNot at all!\u201d replied Henchard hotly. \u201cBut there, there, I don\u2019t wish to quarrel with \u2019ee. I come with an honest proposal for silencing your Jersey enemies, and you ought to be thankful.\u201d \u201cHow can you speak so!\u201d she answered, firing quickly. \u201cKnowing that my only crime was the indulging in a foolish girl\u2019s passion for you with too little regard for correctness, and that I was what I call innocent all the time they called me guilty, you ought not to be so cutting! I suffered enough at that worrying time, when you wrote to tell me of your wife\u2019s return and my consequent dismissal, and if I am a little independent now, surely the privilege is due to me!\u201d \u201cYes, it is,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is not by what is, in this life, but by what appears, that you are judged; and I therefore think you ought to accept me\u2014for your own good name\u2019s sake. What is known in your native Jersey may get known here.\u201d \u201cHow you keep on about Jersey! I am English!\u201d \u201cYes, yes. Well, what do you say to my proposal?\u201d For the first time in their acquaintance Lucetta had the move; and yet she was backward. \u201cFor the present let things be,\u201d she said with some embarrassment. \u201cTreat me as an acquaintance, and I\u2019ll treat you as one. Time will\u2014\u201d She stopped; and he said nothing to fill the gap for awhile, there being no pressure of half acquaintance to drive them into speech if they were not minded for it. \u201cThat\u2019s the way the wind blows, is it?\u201d he said at last grimly, nodding an affirmative to his own thoughts.", " It was a point in the highway near which the road to Mellstock branched off from the homeward direction. By diverging to that village, as he had intended to do, Farfrae might probably delay his return by a couple of hours. It soon appeared that his intention was to do so still, the light swerving towards Cuckoo Lane, the by-road aforesaid. Farfrae\u2019s off gig-lamp flashed in Henchard\u2019s face. At the same time Farfrae discerned his late antagonist. \u201cFarfrae\u2014Mr. Farfrae!\u201d cried the breathless Henchard, holding up his hand. Farfrae allowed the horse to turn several steps into the branch lane before he pulled up. He then drew rein, and said \u201cYes?\u201d over his shoulder, as one would towards a pronounced enemy. \u201cCome back to Casterbridge at once!\u201d Henchard said. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong at your house\u2014requiring your return. I\u2019ve run all the way here on purpose to tell ye.\u201d Farfrae was silent, and at his silence Henchard\u2019s soul sank within him. Why had he not, before this, thought of what was only too obvious? He who, four hours earlier, had enticed Farfrae into a deadly wrestle stood now in the darkness of late night-time on a lonely road, inviting him to come a particular way, where an assailant might have confederates, instead of going his purposed way, where there might be a better opportunity of guarding himself from attack. Henchard could almost feel this view of things in course of passage through Farfrae\u2019s mind.", " But he paused for a moment, and their eyes met. Donald went up to him, for he saw in Henchard\u2019s look that he began to regret this. \u201cCome,\u201d said Donald quietly, \u201ca man o\u2019 your position should ken better, sir! It is tyrannical and no worthy of you.\u201d \u201c\u2019Tis not tyrannical!\u201d murmured Henchard, like a sullen boy. \u201cIt is to make him remember!\u201d He presently added, in a tone of one bitterly hurt: \u201cWhy did you speak to me before them like that, Farfrae? You might have stopped till we were alone. Ah\u2014I know why! I\u2019ve told ye the secret o\u2019 my life\u2014fool that I was to do\u2019t\u2014and you take advantage of me!\u201d \u201cI had forgot it,\u201d said Farfrae simply. Henchard looked on the ground, said nothing more, and turned away. During the day Farfrae learnt from the men that Henchard had kept Abel\u2019s old mother in coals and snuff all the previous winter, which made him less antagonistic to the corn-factor. But Henchard continued moody and silent, and when one of the men inquired of him if some oats should be hoisted to an upper floor or not, he said shortly, \u201cAsk Mr. Farfrae. He\u2019s master here!\u201d Morally he was; there could be no doubt of it. Henchard, who had hitherto been the most admired man in his circle, was the most admired no longer. One day the daughters of a deceased farmer in Durnover wanted an opinion of the value of their haystack, and sent a messenger to ask Mr. Farfrae to oblige them with one. The messenger, who was a child, met in the yard not Farfrae, but Henchard."], "What does Farfrae construct for his festival event?": [" XVI. On this account Henchard\u2019s manner towards Farfrae insensibly became more reserved. He was courteous\u2014too courteous\u2014and Farfrae was quite surprised at the good breeding which now for the first time showed itself among the qualities of a man he had hitherto thought undisciplined, if warm and sincere. The corn-factor seldom or never again put his arm upon the young man\u2019s shoulder so as to nearly weigh him down with the pressure of mechanized friendship. He left off coming to Donald\u2019s lodgings and shouting into the passage. \u201cHoy, Farfrae, boy, come and have some dinner with us! Don\u2019t sit here in solitary confinement!\u201d But in the daily routine of their business there was little change. Thus their lives rolled on till a day of public rejoicing was suggested to the country at large in celebration of a national event that had recently taken place. For some time Casterbridge, by nature slow, made no response. Then one day Donald Farfrae broached the subject to Henchard by asking if he would have any objection to lend some rick-cloths to himself and a few others, who contemplated getting up an entertainment of some sort on the day named, and required a shelter for the same, to which they might charge admission at the rate of so much a head. \u201cHave as many cloths as you like,\u201d Henchard replied. When his manager had gone about the business Henchard was fired with emulation. It certainly had been very remiss of him, as Mayor, he thought, to call no meeting ere this, to discuss what should be done on this holiday.", " These letters are, in fact, related to that unhappy business. Though, thank God, it is all over now.\u201d \u201cWhat became of the poor woman?\u201d asked Farfrae. \u201cLuckily she married, and married well,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cSo that these reproaches she poured out on me do not now cause me any twinges, as they might otherwise have done.... Just listen to what an angry woman will say!\u201d Farfrae, willing to humour Henchard, though quite uninterested, and bursting with yawns, gave well-mannered attention. \u201c\u2018For me,\u2019\u201d Henchard read, \u201c\u2018there is practically no future. A creature too unconventionally devoted to you\u2014who feels it impossible that she can be the wife of any other man; and who is yet no more to you than the first woman you meet in the street\u2014such am I. I quite acquit you of any intention to wrong me, yet you are the door through which wrong has come to me. That in the event of your present wife\u2019s death you will place me in her position is a consolation so far as it goes\u2014but how far does it go? Thus I sit here, forsaken by my few acquaintance, and forsaken by you!\u2019\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s how she went on to me,\u201d said Henchard, \u201cacres of words like that, when what had happened was what I could not cure.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Farfrae absently, \u201cit is the way wi\u2019 women.\u201d But the fact was that he knew very little of the sex; yet detecting a sort of resemblance in style between the effusions of the woman he worshipped and those of the supposed stranger, he concluded that Aphrodite ever spoke thus, whosesoever the personality she assumed.", " Henchard watched him with his mouth firmly set, the squareness of his jaw and the verticality of his profile being unduly marked. Farfrae came on with one hand in his pocket, and humming a tune in a way which told that the words were most in his mind. They were those of the song he had sung when he arrived years before at the Three Mariners, a poor young man, adventuring for life and fortune, and scarcely knowing witherward:\u2014 \u201cAnd here\u2019s a hand, my trusty fiere, And gie\u2019s a hand o\u2019 thine.\u201d Nothing moved Henchard like an old melody. He sank back. \u201cNo; I can\u2019t do it!\u201d he gasped. \u201cWhy does the infernal fool begin that now!\u201d At length Farfrae was silent, and Henchard looked out of the loft door. \u201cWill ye come up here?\u201d he said. \u201cAy, man,\u201d said Farfrae. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see ye. What\u2019s wrang?\u201d A minute later Henchard heard his feet on the lowest ladder. He heard him land on the first floor, ascend and land on the second, begin the ascent to the third. And then his head rose through the trap behind. \u201cWhat are you doing up here at this time?\u201d he asked, coming forward. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t ye take your holiday like the rest of the men?\u201d He spoke in a tone which had just severity enough in it to show that he remembered the untoward event of the forenoon, and his conviction that Henchard had been drinking. Henchard said nothing; but going back he closed the stair hatchway, and stamped upon it so that it went tight into its frame; he next turned to the wondering young man, who by this time observed that one of Henchard\u2019s arms was bound to his side.", " It was a point in the highway near which the road to Mellstock branched off from the homeward direction. By diverging to that village, as he had intended to do, Farfrae might probably delay his return by a couple of hours. It soon appeared that his intention was to do so still, the light swerving towards Cuckoo Lane, the by-road aforesaid. Farfrae\u2019s off gig-lamp flashed in Henchard\u2019s face. At the same time Farfrae discerned his late antagonist. \u201cFarfrae\u2014Mr. Farfrae!\u201d cried the breathless Henchard, holding up his hand. Farfrae allowed the horse to turn several steps into the branch lane before he pulled up. He then drew rein, and said \u201cYes?\u201d over his shoulder, as one would towards a pronounced enemy. \u201cCome back to Casterbridge at once!\u201d Henchard said. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong at your house\u2014requiring your return.

Henchard could almost feel this view of things in course of passage through Farfrae\u2019s mind."], "Who does Elizabeth-Jane dance with at the festival ball?": [" The latter moved on into the dark dense old avenues, or rather vaults of living woodwork, which ran along the town boundary, and stood reflecting. A man followed in a few minutes, and her face being to-wards the shine from the tent he recognized her. It was Farfrae\u2014just come from the dialogue with Henchard which had signified his dismissal. \u201cAnd it\u2019s you, Miss Newson?\u2014and I\u2019ve been looking for ye everywhere!\u201d he said, overcoming a sadness imparted by the estrangement with the corn-merchant. \u201cMay I walk on with you as far as your street-corner?\u201d She thought there might be something wrong in this, but did not utter any objection. So together they went on, first down the West Walk, and then into the Bowling Walk, till Farfrae said, \u201cIt\u2019s like that I\u2019m going to leave you soon.\u201d She faltered, \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cOh\u2014as a mere matter of business\u2014nothing more. But we\u2019ll not concern ourselves about it\u2014it is for the best. I hoped to have another dance with you.\u201d She said she could not dance\u2014in any proper way. \u201cNay, but you do! It\u2019s the feeling for it rather than the learning of steps that makes pleasant dancers.... I fear I offended your father by getting up this! And now, perhaps, I\u2019ll have to go to another part o\u2019 the warrld altogether!\u201d This seemed such a melancholy prospect that Elizabeth-Jane breathed a sigh\u2014letting it off in fragments that he might not hear her. But darkness makes people truthful, and the Scotchman went on impulsively\u2014perhaps he had heard her after all: \u201cI wish I was richer, Miss Newson; and your stepfather had not been offended, I would ask you something in a short time\u2014yes, I would ask you to-night.", " She was one of those people whom nothing surprises, and though to her, a total stranger, his request must have seemed odd, she willingly volunteered to go up and inform the master and mistress of the house that \u201ca humble old friend\u201d had come. On second thought she said that he had better not wait in the kitchen, but come up into the little back-parlour, which was empty. He thereupon followed her thither, and she left him. Just as she got across the landing to the door of the best parlour a dance was struck up, and she returned to say that she would wait till that was over before announcing him\u2014Mr. and Mrs. Farfrae having both joined in the figure. The door of the front room had been taken off its hinges to give more space, and that of the room Henchard sat in being ajar, he could see fractional parts of the dancers whenever their gyrations brought them near the doorway, chiefly in the shape of the skirts of dresses and streaming curls of hair; together with about three-fifths of the band in profile, including the restless shadow of a fiddler\u2019s elbow, and the tip of the bass-viol bow. The gaiety jarred upon Henchard\u2019s spirits; and he could not quite understand why Farfrae, a much-sobered man, and a widower, who had had his trials, should have cared for it all, notwithstanding the fact that he was quite a young man still, and quickly kindled to enthusiasm by dance and song. That the quiet Elizabeth, who had long ago appraised life at a moderate value, and who knew in spite of her maidenhood that marriage was as a rule no dancing matter, should have had zest for this revelry surprised him still more.", " \u201cHe won\u2019t be that, because he\u2019s shortly going to leave me.\u201d He looked towards Donald, who had come near. \u201cMr. Farfrae\u2019s time as my manager is drawing to a close\u2014isn\u2019t it, Farfrae?\u201d The young man, who could now read the lines and folds of Henchard\u2019s strongly-traced face as if they were clear verbal inscriptions, quietly assented; and when people deplored the fact, and asked why it was, he simply replied that Mr. Henchard no longer required his help. Henchard went home, apparently satisfied. But in the morning, when his jealous temper had passed away, his heart sank within him at what he had said and done. He was the more disturbed when he found that this time Farfrae was determined to take him at his word. XVII. Elizabeth-Jane had perceived from Henchard\u2019s manner that in assenting to dance she had made a mistake of some kind. In her simplicity she did not know what it was till a hint from a nodding acquaintance enlightened her. As the Mayor\u2019s stepdaughter, she learnt, she had not been quite in her place in treading a measure amid such a mixed throng as filled the dancing pavilion. Thereupon her ears, cheeks, and chin glowed like live coals at the dawning of the idea that her tastes were not good enough for her position, and would bring her into disgrace. This made her very miserable, and she looked about for her mother; but Mrs. Henchard, who had less idea of conventionality than Elizabeth herself, had gone away, leaving her daughter to return at her own pleasure.", " Donald Farfrae had discovered in a screened corner a new bird-cage, shrouded in newspaper, and at the bottom of the cage a little ball of feathers\u2014the dead body of a goldfinch. Nobody could tell her how the bird and cage had come there, though that the poor little songster had been starved to death was evident. The sadness of the incident had made an impression on her. She had not been able to forget it for days, despite Farfrae\u2019s tender banter; and now when the matter had been nearly forgotten it was again revived. \u201cOh, please ma\u2019am, we know how the bird-cage came there. That farmer\u2019s man who called on the evening of the wedding\u2014he was seen wi\u2019 it in his hand as he came up the street; and \u2019tis thoughted that he put it down while he came in with his message, and then went away forgetting where he had left it.\u201d This was enough to set Elizabeth thinking, and in thinking she seized hold of the idea, at one feminine bound, that the caged bird had been brought by Henchard for her as a wedding gift and token of repentance. He had not expressed to her any regrets or excuses for what he had done in the past; but it was a part of his nature to extenuate nothing, and live on as one of his own worst accusers. She went out, looked at the cage, buried the starved little singer, and from that hour her heart softened towards the self-alienated man. When her husband came in she told him her solution of the bird-cage mystery; and begged Donald to help her in finding out, as soon as possible, whither Henchard had banished himself, that she might make her peace with him; try to do something to render his life less that of an outcast, and more tolerable to him."], "Who is Henchard having an affair with?": [" She steadily refused to have anything to do with the affair, and cutting him short, because of her anxiety to get indoors before her husband should miss her, left him on the pavement. He watched her till she had vanished, and then went home. When he got there he sat down in the fireless chimney corner looking at the iron dogs, and the wood laid across them for heating the morning kettle. A movement upstairs disturbed him, and Henchard came down from his bedroom, where he seemed to have been rummaging boxes. \u201cI wish,\u201d said Henchard, \u201cyou would do me a service, Jopp, now\u2014to-night, I mean, if you can. Leave this at Mrs. Farfrae\u2019s for her. I should take it myself, of course, but I don\u2019t wish to be seen there.\u201d He handed a package in brown paper, sealed. Henchard had been as good as his word. Immediately on coming indoors he had searched over his few belongings, and every scrap of Lucetta\u2019s writing that he possessed was here. Jopp indifferently expressed his willingness. \u201cWell, how have ye got on to-day?\u201d his lodger asked. \u201cAny prospect of an opening?\u201d \u201cI am afraid not,\u201d said Jopp, who had not told the other of his application to Farfrae. \u201cThere never will be in Casterbridge,\u201d declared Henchard decisively. \u201cYou must roam further afield.\u201d He said goodnight to Jopp, and returned to his own part of the house. Jopp sat on till his eyes were attracted by the shadow of the candle-snuff on the wall, and looking at the original he found that it had formed itself into a head like a red-hot cauliflower.", " \u201cBut where are the folk?\u201d said Henchard, after the lapse of half-an-hour, during which time only two men and a woman had stood up to dance. \u201cThe shops are all shut. Why don\u2019t they come?\u201d \u201cThey are at Farfrae\u2019s affair in the West Walk,\u201d answered a Councilman who stood in the field with the Mayor. \u201cA few, I suppose. But where are the body o\u2019 \u2019em?\u201d \u201cAll out of doors are there.\u201d \u201cThen the more fools they!\u201d Henchard walked away moodily. One or two young fellows gallantly came to climb the poles, to save the hams from being wasted; but as there were no spectators, and the whole scene presented the most melancholy appearance Henchard gave orders that the proceedings were to be suspended, and the entertainment closed, the food to be distributed among the poor people of the town. In a short time nothing was left in the field but a few hurdles, the tents, and the poles. Henchard returned to his house, had tea with his wife and daughter, and then walked out. It was now dusk. He soon saw that the tendency of all promenaders was towards a particular spot in the Walks, and eventually proceeded thither himself. The notes of a stringed band came from the enclosure that Farfrae had erected\u2014the pavilion as he called it\u2014and when the Mayor reached it he perceived that a gigantic tent had been ingeniously constructed without poles or ropes. The densest point of the avenue of sycamores had been selected, where the boughs made a closely interlaced vault overhead; to these boughs the canvas had been hung, and a barrel roof was the result.", " His well-known haughty indifference to the society of womankind, his silent avoidance of converse with the sex, contributed a piquancy to what would otherwise have been an unromantic matter enough. That such a poor fragile woman should be his choice was inexplicable, except on the ground that the engagement was a family affair in which sentimental passion had no place; for it was known that they were related in some way. Mrs. Henchard was so pale that the boys called her \u201cThe Ghost.\u201d Sometimes Henchard overheard this epithet when they passed together along the Walks\u2014as the avenues on the walls were named\u2014at which his face would darken with an expression of destructiveness towards the speakers ominous to see; but he said nothing. He pressed on the preparations for his union, or rather reunion, with this pale creature in a dogged, unflinching spirit which did credit to his conscientiousness. Nobody would have conceived from his outward demeanour that there was no amatory fire or pulse of romance acting as stimulant to the bustle going on in his gaunt, great house; nothing but three large resolves\u2014one, to make amends to his neglected Susan, another, to provide a comfortable home for Elizabeth-Jane under his paternal eye; and a third, to castigate himself with the thorns which these restitutory acts brought in their train; among them the lowering of his dignity in public opinion by marrying so comparatively humble a woman.", " But Farfrae had been so cursed quick in his movements as to give old-fashioned people in authority no chance of the initiative. However, it was not too late; and on second thoughts he determined to take upon his own shoulders the responsibility of organizing some amusements, if the other Councilmen would leave the matter in his hands. To this they quite readily agreed, the majority being fine old crusted characters who had a decided taste for living without worry. So Henchard set about his preparations for a really brilliant thing\u2014such as should be worthy of the venerable town. As for Farfrae\u2019s little affair, Henchard nearly forgot it; except once now and then when, on it coming into his mind, he said to himself, \u201cCharge admission at so much a head\u2014just like a Scotchman!\u2014who is going to pay anything a head?\u201d The diversions which the Mayor intended to provide were to be entirely free. He had grown so dependent upon Donald that he could scarcely resist calling him in to consult. But by sheer self-coercion he refrained. No, he thought, Farfrae would be suggesting such improvements in his damned luminous way that in spite of himself he, Henchard, would sink to the position of second fiddle, and only scrape harmonies to his manager\u2019s talents. Everybody applauded the Mayor\u2019s proposed entertainment, especially when it became known that he meant to pay for it all himself. Close to the town was an elevated green spot surrounded by an ancient square earthwork\u2014earthworks square and not square, were as common as blackberries hereabout\u2014a spot whereon the Casterbridge people usually held any kind of merry-making, meeting, or sheep-fair that required more space than the streets would afford."], "Which character digs up Susan\u2019s body after her funeral?": [" \u201cUpon the head of his bed he pinned a piece of paper, with some writing upon it,\u201d continued Abel Whittle. \u201cBut not being a man o\u2019 letters, I can\u2019t read writing; so I don\u2019t know what it is. I can get it and show ye.\u201d They stood in silence while he ran into the cottage; returning in a moment with a crumpled scrap of paper. On it there was pencilled as follows:\u2014 MICHAEL HENCHARD\u2019S WILL. \u201cThat Elizabeth-Jane Farfrae be not told of my death, or made to grieve on account of me. \u201c& that I be not bury\u2019d in consecrated ground. \u201c& that no sexton be asked to toll the bell. \u201c& that nobody is wished to see my dead body. \u201c& that no murners walk behind me at my funeral. \u201c& that no flours be planted on my grave. \u201c& that no man remember me. \u201cTo this I put my name. \u201cMICHAEL HENCHARD.\u201d \u201cWhat are we to do?\u201d said Donald, when he had handed the paper to her. She could not answer distinctly. \u201cO Donald!\u201d she cried at last through her tears, \u201cwhat bitterness lies there! O I would not have minded so much if it had not been for my unkindness at that last parting!... But there\u2019s no altering\u2014so it must be.\u201d What Henchard had written in the anguish of his dying was respected as far as practicable by Elizabeth-Jane, though less from a sense of the sacredness of last words, as such, than from her independent knowledge that the man who wrote them meant what he said. She knew the directions to be a piece of the same stuff that his whole life was made of, and hence were not to be tampered with to give herself a mournful pleasure, or her husband credit for large-heartedness.", " \u201cElizabeth, come here!\u201d said Henchard; and she obeyed. \u201cWhy do you lower yourself so confoundedly?\u201d he said with suppressed passion. \u201cHaven\u2019t I told you o\u2019t fifty times? Hey? Making yourself a drudge for a common workwoman of such a character as hers! Why, ye\u2019ll disgrace me to the dust!\u201d Now these words were uttered loud enough to reach Nance inside the barn door, who fired up immediately at the slur upon her personal character. Coming to the door she cried regardless of consequences, \u201cCome to that, Mr. Henchard, I can let \u2019ee know she\u2019ve waited on worse!\u201d \u201cThen she must have had more charity than sense,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cO no, she hadn\u2019t. \u2019Twere not for charity but for hire; and at a public-house in this town!\u201d \u201cIt is not true!\u201d cried Henchard indignantly. \u201cJust ask her,\u201d said Nance, folding her naked arms in such a manner that she could comfortably scratch her elbows. Henchard glanced at Elizabeth-Jane, whose complexion, now pink and white from confinement, lost nearly all of the former colour. \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d he said to her. \u201cAnything or nothing?\u201d \u201cIt is true,\u201d said Elizabeth-Jane. \u201cBut it was only\u2014\u201d \u201cDid you do it, or didn\u2019t you? Where was it?\u201d \u201cAt the Three Mariners; one evening for a little while, when we were staying there.\u201d Nance glanced triumphantly at Henchard, and sailed into the barn; for assuming that she was to be discharged on the instant she had resolved to make the most of her victory.", " \u201cYou hear, Susan?\u2014I don\u2019t drink now\u2014I haven\u2019t since that night.\u201d Those were his first words. He felt her bow her head in acknowledgment that she understood. After a minute or two he again began: \u201cIf I had known you were living, Susan! But there was every reason to suppose you and the child were dead and gone. I took every possible step to find you\u2014travelled\u2014advertised. My opinion at last was that you had started for some colony with that man, and had been drowned on your voyage. Why did you keep silent like this?\u201d \u201cO Michael! because of him\u2014what other reason could there be? I thought I owed him faithfulness to the end of one of our lives\u2014foolishly I believed there was something solemn and binding in the bargain; I thought that even in honour I dared not desert him when he had paid so much for me in good faith. I meet you now only as his widow\u2014I consider myself that, and that I have no claim upon you. Had he not died I should never have come\u2014never! Of that you may be sure.\u201d \u201cTut-tut! How could you be so simple?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. Yet it would have been very wicked\u2014if I had not thought like that!\u201d said Susan, almost crying. \u201cYes\u2014yes\u2014so it would. It is only that which makes me feel \u2019ee an innocent woman. But\u2014to lead me into this!\u201d \u201cWhat, Michael?\u201d she asked, alarmed. \u201cWhy, this difficulty about our living together again, and Elizabeth-Jane. She cannot be told all\u2014she would so despise us both that\u2014I could not bear it!\u201d \u201cThat was why she was brought up in ignorance of you.", " Whether it were that his northern energy was an overmastering force among the easy-going Wessex worthies, or whether it was sheer luck, the fact remained that whatever he touched he prospered in. Like Jacob in Padan-Aram, he would no sooner humbly limit himself to the ringstraked-and-spotted exceptions of trade than the ringstraked-and-spotted would multiply and prevail. But most probably luck had little to do with it. Character is Fate, said Novalis, and Farfrae\u2019s character was just the reverse of Henchard\u2019s, who might not inaptly be described as Faust has been described\u2014as a vehement gloomy being who had quitted the ways of vulgar men without light to guide him on a better way. Farfrae duly received the request to discontinue attentions to Elizabeth-Jane. His acts of that kind had been so slight that the request was almost superfluous. Yet he had felt a considerable interest in her, and after some cogitation he decided that it would be as well to enact no Romeo part just then\u2014for the young girl\u2019s sake no less than his own. Thus the incipient attachment was stifled down. A time came when, avoid collision with his former friend as he might, Farfrae was compelled, in sheer self-defence, to close with Henchard in mortal commercial combat. He could no longer parry the fierce attacks of the latter by simple avoidance. As soon as their war of prices began everybody was interested, and some few guessed the end."], "Who is Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s father?": [" Henchard pushed to the door, and for some seconds made no other movement. He rose to his feet, and stood like a dark ruin, obscured by \u201cthe shade from his own soul up-thrown.\u201d But he was no longer the man to stand these reverses unmoved. His agitation was great, and he would fain have been gone, but before he could leave the dance had ended, the housekeeper had informed Elizabeth-Jane of the stranger who awaited her, and she entered the room immediately. \u201cOh\u2014it is\u2014Mr. Henchard!\u201d she said, starting back. \u201cWhat, Elizabeth?\u201d he cried, as she seized her hand. \u201cWhat do you say?\u2014_Mr._ Henchard? Don\u2019t, don\u2019t scourge me like that! Call me worthless old Henchard\u2014anything\u2014but don\u2019t \u2019ee be so cold as this! O my maid\u2014I see you have another\u2014a real father in my place. Then you know all; but don\u2019t give all your thought to him! Do ye save a little room for me!\u201d She flushed up, and gently drew her hand away. \u201cI could have loved you always\u2014I would have, gladly,\u201d she said. \u201cBut how can I when I know you have deceived me so\u2014so bitterly deceived me! You persuaded me that my father was not my father\u2014allowed me to live on in ignorance of the truth for years; and then when he, my warm-hearted real father, came to find me, cruelly sent him away with a wicked invention of my death, which nearly broke his heart. O how can I love as I once did a man who has served us like this!\u201d Henchard\u2019s lips half parted to begin an explanation.", " But money is scarce, and throats get dry. Why _should_ death rob life o\u2019 fourpence? I say there was no treason in it.\u201d \u201cWell, poor soul; she\u2019s helpless to hinder that or anything now,\u201d answered Mother Cuxsom. \u201cAnd all her shining keys will be took from her, and her cupboards opened; and little things a\u2019 didn\u2019t wish seen, anybody will see; and her wishes and ways will all be as nothing!\u201d XIX. Henchard and Elizabeth sat conversing by the fire. It was three weeks after Mrs. Henchard\u2019s funeral, the candles were not lighted, and a restless, acrobatic flame, poised on a coal, called from the shady walls the smiles of all shapes that could respond\u2014the old pier-glass, with gilt columns and huge entablature, the picture-frames, sundry knobs and handles, and the brass rosette at the bottom of each riband bell-pull on either side of the chimney-piece. \u201cElizabeth, do you think much of old times?\u201d said Henchard. \u201cYes, sir; often,\u201d she said. \u201cWho do you put in your pictures of \u2019em?\u201d \u201cMother and father\u2014nobody else hardly.\u201d Henchard always looked like one bent on resisting pain when Elizabeth-Jane spoke of Richard Newson as \u201cfather.\u201d \u201cAh! I am out of all that, am I not?\u201d he said.... \u201cWas Newson a kind father?\u201d \u201cYes, sir; very.\u201d Henchard\u2019s face settled into an expression of stolid loneliness which gradually modulated into something softer. \u201cSuppose I had been your real father?\u201d he said. \u201cWould you have cared for me as much as you cared for Richard Newson?\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t think it,\u201d she said quickly.", " \u201cI can think of no other as my father, except my father.\u201d Henchard\u2019s wife was dissevered from him by death; his friend and helper Farfrae by estrangement; Elizabeth-Jane by ignorance. It seemed to him that only one of them could possibly be recalled, and that was the girl. His mind began vibrating between the wish to reveal himself to her and the policy of leaving well alone, till he could no longer sit still. He walked up and down, and then he came and stood behind her chair, looking down upon the top of her head. He could no longer restrain his impulse. \u201cWhat did your mother tell you about me\u2014my history?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat you were related by marriage.\u201d \u201cShe should have told more\u2014before you knew me! Then my task would not have been such a hard one.... Elizabeth, it is I who am your father, and not Richard Newson. Shame alone prevented your wretched parents from owning this to you while both of \u2019em were alive.\u201d The back of Elizabeth\u2019s head remained still, and her shoulders did not denote even the movements of breathing. Henchard went on: \u201cI\u2019d rather have your scorn, your fear, anything than your ignorance; \u2019tis that I hate! Your mother and I were man and wife when we were young. What you saw was our second marriage. Your mother was too honest. We had thought each other dead\u2014and\u2014Newson became her husband.\u201d This was the nearest approach Henchard could make to the full truth. As far as he personally was concerned he would have screened nothing; but he showed a respect for the young girl\u2019s sex and years worthy of a better man.", " He\u2014Mr. Newson\u2014whom my poor mother married by such a strange mistake\u201d (Henchard was glad that he had disguised matters here), \u201cwas very kind\u2014O so kind!\u201d (she spoke with tears in her eyes); \u201cbut that is not the same thing as being one\u2019s real father after all. Now, father, breakfast is ready!\u201d she said cheerfully. Henchard bent and kissed her cheek. The moment and the act he had prefigured for weeks with a thrill of pleasure; yet it was no less than a miserable insipidity to him now that it had come. His reinstation of her mother had been chiefly for the girl\u2019s sake, and the fruition of the whole scheme was such dust and ashes as this. XX. Of all the enigmas which ever confronted a girl there can have been seldom one like that which followed Henchard\u2019s announcement of himself to Elizabeth as her father. He had done it in an ardour and an agitation which had half carried the point of affection with her; yet, behold, from the next morning onwards his manner was constrained as she had never seen it before. The coldness soon broke out into open chiding. One grievous failing of Elizabeth\u2019s was her occasional pretty and picturesque use of dialect words\u2014those terrible marks of the beast to the truly genteel. It was dinner-time\u2014they never met except at meals\u2014and she happened to say when he was rising from table, wishing to show him something, \u201cIf you\u2019ll bide where you be a minute, father, I\u2019ll get it.\u201d \u201c\u2018Bide where you be,\u2019\u201d he echoed sharply, \u201cGood God, are you only fit to carry wash to a pig-trough, that ye use such words as those?\u201d She reddened with shame and sadness."], "What does Elizabeth-Jane bring to Nance Mockridge?": [" Don\u2019t I pay her a dozen pound a year to do things for \u2019ee?\u201d Elizabeth shrank so visibly at the exclamation that he became sorry a few minutes after, and said that he did not mean to be rough. These domestic exhibitions were the small protruding needlerocks which suggested rather than revealed what was underneath. But his passion had less terror for her than his coldness. The increasing frequency of the latter mood told her the sad news that he disliked her with a growing dislike. The more interesting that her appearance and manners became under the softening influences which she could now command, and in her wisdom did command, the more she seemed to estrange him. Sometimes she caught him looking at her with a louring invidiousness that she could hardly bear. Not knowing his secret it was cruel mockery that she should for the first time excite his animosity when she had taken his surname. But the most terrible ordeal was to come. Elizabeth had latterly been accustomed of an afternoon to present a cup of cider or ale and bread-and-cheese to Nance Mockridge, who worked in the yard wimbling hay-bonds. Nance accepted this offering thankfully at first; afterwards as a matter of course. On a day when Henchard was on the premises he saw his stepdaughter enter the hay-barn on this errand; and, as there was no clear spot on which to deposit the provisions, she at once set to work arranging two trusses of hay as a table, Mockridge meanwhile standing with her hands on her hips, easefully looking at the preparations on her behalf.", " \u201cElizabeth, come here!\u201d said Henchard; and she obeyed. \u201cWhy do you lower yourself so confoundedly?\u201d he said with suppressed passion. \u201cHaven\u2019t I told you o\u2019t fifty times? Hey? Making yourself a drudge for a common workwoman of such a character as hers! Why, ye\u2019ll disgrace me to the dust!\u201d Now these words were uttered loud enough to reach Nance inside the barn door, who fired up immediately at the slur upon her personal character. Coming to the door she cried regardless of consequences, \u201cCome to that, Mr. Henchard, I can let \u2019ee know she\u2019ve waited on worse!\u201d \u201cThen she must have had more charity than sense,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cO no, she hadn\u2019t. \u2019Twere not for charity but for hire; and at a public-house in this town!\u201d \u201cIt is not true!\u201d cried Henchard indignantly. \u201cJust ask her,\u201d said Nance, folding her naked arms in such a manner that she could comfortably scratch her elbows. Henchard glanced at Elizabeth-Jane, whose complexion, now pink and white from confinement, lost nearly all of the former colour. \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d he said to her. \u201cAnything or nothing?\u201d \u201cIt is true,\u201d said Elizabeth-Jane. \u201cBut it was only\u2014\u201d \u201cDid you do it, or didn\u2019t you? Where was it?\u201d \u201cAt the Three Mariners; one evening for a little while, when we were staying there.\u201d Nance glanced triumphantly at Henchard, and sailed into the barn; for assuming that she was to be discharged on the instant she had resolved to make the most of her victory.", " Getting a schoolboy to write ours for us; and giving him a penny, do ye mind, not to tell other folks what he\u2019d put inside, do ye mind?\u201d By this time Jopp had pushed his finger under the seals, and unfastened the letters, tumbling them over and picking up one here and there at random, which he read aloud. These passages soon began to uncover the secret which Lucetta had so earnestly hoped to keep buried, though the epistles, being allusive only, did not make it altogether plain. \u201cMrs. Farfrae wrote that!\u201d said Nance Mockridge. \u201c\u2019Tis a humbling thing for us, as respectable women, that one of the same sex could do it. And now she\u2019s avowed herself to another man!\u201d \u201cSo much the better for her,\u201d said the aged furmity-woman. \u201cAh, I saved her from a real bad marriage, and she\u2019s never been the one to thank me.\u201d \u201cI say, what a good foundation for a skimmity-ride,\u201d said Nance. \u201cTrue,\u201d said Mrs. Cuxsom, reflecting. \u201c\u2019Tis as good a ground for a skimmity-ride as ever I knowed; and it ought not to be wasted. The last one seen in Casterbridge must have been ten years ago, if a day.\u201d At this moment there was a shrill whistle, and the landlady said to the man who had been called Charl, \u201c\u2019Tis Jim coming in. Would ye go and let down the bridge for me?\u201d Without replying Charl and his comrade Joe rose, and receiving a lantern from her went out at the back door and down the garden-path, which ended abruptly at the edge of the stream already mentioned.", " Now there\u2019s a better-looking woman than she that nobody notices at all, because she\u2019s akin to that hontish fellow Henchard.\u201d \u201cI could worship ye, Buzz, for saying that,\u201d remarked Nance Mockridge. \u201cI do like to see the trimming pulled off such Christmas candles. I am quite unequal to the part of villain myself, or I\u2019d gi\u2019e all my small silver to see that lady toppered.... And perhaps I shall soon,\u201d she added significantly. \u201cThat\u2019s not a noble passiont for a \u2019oman to keep up,\u201d said Longways. Nance did not reply, but every one knew what she meant. The ideas diffused by the reading of Lucetta\u2019s letters at Peter\u2019s Finger had condensed into a scandal, which was spreading like a miasmatic fog through Mixen Lane, and thence up the back streets of Casterbridge. The mixed assemblage of idlers known to each other presently fell apart into two bands by a process of natural selection, the frequenters of Peter\u2019s Finger going off Mixen Lanewards, where most of them lived, while Coney, Buzzford, Longways, and that connection remained in the street. \u201cYou know what\u2019s brewing down there, I suppose?\u201d said Buzzford mysteriously to the others. Coney looked at him. \u201cNot the skimmity-ride?\u201d Buzzford nodded. \u201cI have my doubts if it will be carried out,\u201d said Longways. \u201cIf they are getting it up they are keeping it mighty close. \u201cI heard they were thinking of it a fortnight ago, at all events.\u201d \u201cIf I were sure o\u2019t I\u2019d lay information,\u201d said Longways emphatically."], "Who does Henchard grow increasingly cold towards?": [" In this frame of mind, though without strong feeling, he had strolled up the alley and into High-Place Hall by the postern at which Elizabeth had so nearly encountered him. He had gone on thence into the court, and inquired of a man whom he saw unpacking china from a crate if Miss Le Sueur was living there. Miss Le Sueur had been the name under which he had known Lucetta\u2014or \u201cLucette,\u201d as she had called herself at that time. The man replied in the negative; that Miss Templeman only had come. Henchard went away, concluding that Lucetta had not as yet settled in. He was in this interested stage of the inquiry when he witnessed Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s departure the next day. On hearing her announce the address there suddenly took possession of him the strange thought that Lucetta and Miss Templeman were one and the same person, for he could recall that in her season of intimacy with him the name of the rich relative whom he had deemed somewhat a mythical personage had been given as Templeman. Though he was not a fortune-hunter, the possibility that Lucetta had been sublimed into a lady of means by some munificent testament on the part of this relative lent a charm to her image which it might not otherwise have acquired. He was getting on towards the dead level of middle age, when material things increasingly possess the mind. But Henchard was not left long in suspense. Lucetta was rather addicted to scribbling, as had been shown by the torrent of letters after the _fiasco_ in their marriage arrangements, and hardly had Elizabeth gone away when another note came to the Mayor\u2019s house from High-Place Hall.", " \u201cNever mind\u2014all in good time,\u201d said he. \u201cJudge me by my future works\u2014good-bye!\u201d He retreated, and stood at the upper side of the Amphitheatre while his wife passed out through the lower way, and descended under the trees to the town. Then Henchard himself went homeward, going so fast that by the time he reached his door he was almost upon the heels of the unconscious woman from whom he had just parted. He watched her up the street, and turned into his house. XII. On entering his own door after watching his wife out of sight, the Mayor walked on through the tunnel-shaped passage into the garden, and thence by the back door towards the stores and granaries. A light shone from the office-window, and there being no blind to screen the interior Henchard could see Donald Farfrae still seated where he had left him, initiating himself into the managerial work of the house by overhauling the books. Henchard entered, merely observing, \u201cDon\u2019t let me interrupt you, if ye will stay so late.\u201d He stood behind Farfrae\u2019s chair, watching his dexterity in clearing up the numerical fogs which had been allowed to grow so thick in Henchard\u2019s books as almost to baffle even the Scotchman\u2019s perspicacity. The corn-factor\u2019s mien was half admiring, and yet it was not without a dash of pity for the tastes of any one who could care to give his mind to such finnikin details. Henchard himself was mentally and physically unfit for grubbing subtleties from soiled paper; he had in a modern sense received the education of Achilles, and found penmanship a tantalizing art.", " \u201cThese few grains will be sufficient to show ye with,\u201d came in the young fellow\u2019s voice; and after a pause, during which some operation seemed to be intently watched by them both, he exclaimed, \u201cThere, now, do you taste that.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s complete!\u2014quite restored, or\u2014well\u2014nearly.\u201d \u201cQuite enough restored to make good seconds out of it,\u201d said the Scotchman. \u201cTo fetch it back entirely is impossible; Nature won\u2019t stand so much as that, but heere you go a great way towards it. Well, sir, that\u2019s the process, I don\u2019t value it, for it can be but of little use in countries where the weather is more settled than in ours; and I\u2019ll be only too glad if it\u2019s of service to you.\u201d \u201cBut hearken to me,\u201d pleaded Henchard. \u201cMy business you know, is in corn and in hay, but I was brought up as a hay-trusser simply, and hay is what I understand best though I now do more in corn than in the other. If you\u2019ll accept the place, you shall manage the corn branch entirely, and receive a commission in addition to salary.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re liberal\u2014very liberal, but no, no\u2014I cannet!\u201d the young man still replied, with some distress in his accents. \u201cSo be it!\u201d said Henchard conclusively. \u201cNow\u2014to change the subject\u2014one good turn deserves another; don\u2019t stay to finish that miserable supper. Come to my house, I can find something better for \u2019ee than cold ham and ale.\u201d Donald Farfrae was grateful\u2014said he feared he must decline\u2014that he wished to leave early next day.", " If he were doomed to be bereft of her, so it must be. In the situation which their marriage would create he could see no _locus standi_ for himself at all. Farfrae would never recognize him more than superciliously; his poverty ensured that, no less than his past conduct. And so Elizabeth would grow to be a stranger to him, and the end of his life would be friendless solitude. With such a possibility impending he could not help watchfulness. Indeed, within certain lines, he had the right to keep an eye upon her as his charge. The meetings seemed to become matters of course with them on special days of the week. At last full proof was given him. He was standing behind a wall close to the place at which Farfrae encountered her. He heard the young man address her as \u201cDearest Elizabeth-Jane,\u201d and then kiss her, the girl looking quickly round to assure herself that nobody was near. When they were gone their way Henchard came out from the wall, and mournfully followed them to Casterbridge. The chief looming trouble in this engagement had not decreased. Both Farfrae and Elizabeth-Jane, unlike the rest of the people, must suppose Elizabeth to be his actual daughter, from his own assertion while he himself had the same belief; and though Farfrae must have so far forgiven him as to have no objection to own him as a father-in-law, intimate they could never be. Thus would the girl, who was his only friend, be withdrawn from him by degrees through her husband\u2019s influence, and learn to despise him."], "After leaving Henchard\u2019s house, where does Elizabeth-Jane move to?": [" At the last moment of leaving Port-Bredy, Farfrae, like John Gilpin, had been detained by important customers, whom, even in the exceptional circumstances, he was not the man to neglect. Moreover, there was a convenience in Lucetta arriving first at her house. Nobody there as yet knew what had happened; and she was best in a position to break the news to the inmates, and give directions for her husband\u2019s accommodation. He had, therefore, sent on his two-days\u2019 bride in a hired brougham, whilst he went across the country to a certain group of wheat and barley ricks a few miles off, telling her the hour at which he might be expected the same evening. This accounted for her trotting out to meet him after their separation of four hours. By a strenuous effort, after leaving Henchard she calmed herself in readiness to receive Donald at High-Place Hall when he came on from his lodgings. One supreme fact empowered her to this, the sense that, come what would, she had secured him. Half-an-hour after her arrival he walked in, and she met him with a relieved gladness, which a month\u2019s perilous absence could not have intensified. \u201cThere is one thing I have not done; and yet it is important,\u201d she said earnestly, when she had finished talking about the adventure with the bull. \u201cThat is, broken the news of our marriage to my dear Elizabeth-Jane.\u201d \u201cAh, and you have not?\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cI gave her a lift from the barn homewards; but I did not tell her either; for I thought she might have heard of it in the town, and was keeping back her congratulations from shyness, and all that.\u201d \u201cShe can hardly have heard of it.", " Had she watched she would have been surprised. She would have seen that the pedestrian on coming up made straight for the arched doorway: that as he paused with his hand upon the latch the lamplight fell upon the face of Henchard. But Elizabeth-Jane clung so closely to her nook that she discerned nothing of this. Henchard passed in, as ignorant of her presence as she was ignorant of his identity, and disappeared in the darkness. Elizabeth came out a second time into the alley, and made the best of her way home. Henchard\u2019s chiding, by begetting in her a nervous fear of doing anything definable as unladylike, had operated thus curiously in keeping them unknown to each other at a critical moment. Much might have resulted from recognition\u2014at the least a query on either side in one and the selfsame form: What could he or she possibly be doing there? Henchard, whatever his business at the lady\u2019s house, reached his own home only a few minutes later than Elizabeth-Jane. Her plan was to broach the question of leaving his roof this evening; the events of the day had urged her to the course. But its execution depended upon his mood, and she anxiously awaited his manner towards her. She found that it had changed. He showed no further tendency to be angry; he showed something worse. Absolute indifference had taken the place of irritability; and his coldness was such that it encouraged her to departure, even more than hot temper could have done.", " Although Farfrae had never so passionately liked Henchard as Henchard had liked him, he had, on the other hand, never so passionately hated in the same direction as his former friend had done, and he was therefore not the least indisposed to assist Elizabeth-Jane in her laudable plan. But it was by no means easy to set about discovering Henchard. He had apparently sunk into the earth on leaving Mr. and Mrs. Farfrae\u2019s door. Elizabeth-Jane remembered what he had once attempted; and trembled. But though she did not know it Henchard had become a changed man since then\u2014as far, that is, as change of emotional basis can justify such a radical phrase; and she needed not to fear. In a few days Farfrae\u2019s inquiries elicited that Henchard had been seen by one who knew him walking steadily along the Melchester highway eastward, at twelve o\u2019clock at night\u2014in other words, retracing his steps on the road by which he had come. This was enough; and the next morning Farfrae might have been discovered driving his gig out of Casterbridge in that direction, Elizabeth-Jane sitting beside him, wrapped in a thick flat fur\u2014the victorine of the period\u2014her complexion somewhat richer than formerly, and an incipient matronly dignity, which the serene Minerva-eyes of one \u201cwhose gestures beamed with mind\u201d made becoming, settling on her face. Having herself arrived at a promising haven from at least the grosser troubles of her life, her object was to place Henchard in some similar quietude before he should sink into that lower stage of existence which was only too possible to him now.", " On this account he entered the house through his garden, and going up to his apartments found them in a particularly disturbed state, his boxes being hauled out upon the landing, and his bookcase standing in three pieces. These phenomena, however, seemed to cause him not the least surprise. \u201cWhen will everything be sent up?\u201d he said to the mistress of the house, who was superintending. \u201cI am afraid not before eight, sir,\u201d said she. \u201cYou see we wasn\u2019t aware till this morning that you were going to move, or we could have been forwarder.\u201d \u201cA\u2014well, never mind, never mind!\u201d said Farfrae cheerily. \u201cEight o\u2019clock will do well enough if it be not later. Now, don\u2019t ye be standing here talking, or it will be twelve, I doubt.\u201d Thus speaking he went out by the front door and up the street. During this interval Henchard and Lucetta had had experiences of a different kind. After Elizabeth\u2019s departure for the muff the corn-merchant opened himself frankly, holding her hand within his arm, though she would fain have withdrawn it. \u201cDear Lucetta, I have been very, very anxious to see you these two or three days,\u201d he said, \u201cever since I saw you last! I have thought over the way I got your promise that night. You said to me, \u2018If I were a man I should not insist.\u2019 That cut me deep. I felt that there was some truth in it. I don\u2019t want to make you wretched; and to marry me just now would do that as nothing else could\u2014it is but too plain."], "Who takes in Elizabeth-Jane at her new residence?": [" \u201cI am the most distant fellow in the world when I don\u2019t care for a man,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when a man takes my fancy he takes it strong. Now I am sure you can eat another breakfast? You couldn\u2019t have eaten much so early, even if they had anything at that place to gi\u2019e thee, which they hadn\u2019t; so come to my house and we will have a solid, staunch tuck-in, and settle terms in black-and-white if you like; though my word\u2019s my bond. I can always make a good meal in the morning. I\u2019ve got a splendid cold pigeon-pie going just now. You can have some home-brewed if you want to, you know.\u201d \u201cIt is too airly in the morning for that,\u201d said Farfrae with a smile. \u201cWell, of course, I didn\u2019t know. I don\u2019t drink it because of my oath, but I am obliged to brew for my work-people.\u201d Thus talking they returned, and entered Henchard\u2019s premises by the back way or traffic entrance. Here the matter was settled over the breakfast, at which Henchard heaped the young Scotchman\u2019s plate to a prodigal fulness. He would not rest satisfied till Farfrae had written for his luggage from Bristol, and dispatched the letter to the post-office. When it was done this man of strong impulses declared that his new friend should take up his abode in his house\u2014at least till some suitable lodgings could be found. He then took Farfrae round and showed him the place, and the stores of grain, and other stock; and finally entered the offices where the younger of them has already been discovered by Elizabeth.", " Elizabeth-Jane could, however, add a capping touch to information so new to her in the bulk. The lady, she said, had arrived that day. When the lamps were lighted, and it was yet not so dark as to render chimneys, attics, and roofs invisible, Elizabeth, almost with a lover\u2019s feeling, thought she would like to look at the outside of High-Place Hall. She went up the street in that direction. The Hall, with its grey _fa\u00e7ade_ and parapet, was the only residence of its sort so near the centre of the town. It had, in the first place, the characteristics of a country mansion\u2014birds\u2019 nests in its chimneys, damp nooks where fungi grew and irregularities of surface direct from Nature\u2019s trowel. At night the forms of passengers were patterned by the lamps in black shadows upon the pale walls. This evening motes of straw lay around, and other signs of the premises having been in that lawless condition which accompanies the entry of a new tenant. The house was entirely of stone, and formed an example of dignity without great size. It was not altogether aristocratic, still less consequential, yet the old-fashioned stranger instinctively said \u201cBlood built it, and Wealth enjoys it\u201d however vague his opinions of those accessories might be. Yet as regards the enjoying it the stranger would have been wrong, for until this very evening, when the new lady had arrived, the house had been empty for a year or two while before that interval its occupancy had been irregular.", " Newson had stayed in Casterbridge three days after the wedding party (whose gaiety, as might have been surmised, was of his making rather than of the married couple\u2019s), and was stared at and honoured as became the returned Crusoe of the hour. But whether or not because Casterbridge was difficult to excite by dramatic returns and disappearances through having been for centuries an assize town, in which sensational exits from the world, antipodean absences, and such like, were half-yearly occurrences, the inhabitants did not altogether lose their equanimity on his account. On the fourth morning he was discovered disconsolately climbing a hill, in his craving to get a glimpse of the sea from somewhere or other. The contiguity of salt water proved to be such a necessity of his existence that he preferred Budmouth as a place of residence, notwithstanding the society of his daughter in the other town. Thither he went, and settled in lodgings in a green-shuttered cottage which had a bow-window, jutting out sufficiently to afford glimpses of a vertical strip of blue sea to any one opening the sash, and leaning forward far enough to look through a narrow lane of tall intervening houses. Elizabeth-Jane was standing in the middle of her upstairs parlour, critically surveying some re-arrangement of articles with her head to one side, when the housemaid came in with the announcement, \u201cOh, please ma\u2019am, we know now how that bird-cage came there.\u201d In exploring her new domain during the first week of residence, gazing with critical satisfaction on this cheerful room and that, penetrating cautiously into dark cellars, sallying forth with gingerly tread to the garden, now leaf-strewn by autumn winds, and thus, like a wise field-marshal, estimating the capabilities of the site whereon she was about to open her housekeeping campaign\u2014Mrs.", " He was always so. Now, surely, if he takes so warmly to people who are not related to him at all, may he not take as warmly to his own kin?\u201d While they debated this question a procession of five large waggons went past, laden with hay up to the bedroom windows. They came in from the country, and the steaming horses had probably been travelling a great part of the night. To the shaft of each hung a little board, on which was painted in white letters, \u201cHenchard, corn-factor and hay-merchant.\u201d The spectacle renewed his wife\u2019s conviction that, for her daughter\u2019s sake, she should strain a point to rejoin him. The discussion was continued during breakfast, and the end of it was that Mrs. Henchard decided, for good or for ill, to send Elizabeth-Jane with a message to Henchard, to the effect that his relative Susan, a sailor\u2019s widow, was in the town; leaving it to him to say whether or not he would recognize her. What had brought her to this determination were chiefly two things. He had been described as a lonely widower; and he had expressed shame for a past transaction of his life. There was promise in both. \u201cIf he says no,\u201d she enjoined, as Elizabeth-Jane stood, bonnet on, ready to depart; \u201cif he thinks it does not become the good position he has reached to in the town, to own\u2014to let us call on him as\u2014his distant kinfolk, say, \u2018Then, sir, we would rather not intrude; we will leave Casterbridge as quietly as we have come, and go back to our own country.\u2019 ...I almost feel that I would rather he did say so, as I have not seen him for so many years, and we are so\u2014little allied to him!\u201d \u201cAnd if he say yes?\u201d inquired the more sanguine one."], "What arrives in Casterbridge, infuriating Henchard?": [" In truth, a great change had come over him with regard to her, and he was developing the dream of a future lit by her filial presence, as though that way alone could happiness lie. He was disturbed by another knock at the door, and rose to open it, rather deprecating a call from anybody just then. A stoutly built man stood on the doorstep, with an alien, unfamiliar air about his figure and bearing\u2014an air which might have been called colonial by people of cosmopolitan experience. It was the man who had asked the way at Peter\u2019s finger. Henchard nodded, and looked inquiry. \u201cGood morning, good morning,\u201d said the stranger with profuse heartiness. \u201cIs it Mr. Henchard I am talking to?\u201d \u201cMy name is Henchard.\u201d \u201cThen I\u2019ve caught \u2019ee at home\u2014that\u2019s right. Morning\u2019s the time for business, says I. Can I have a few words with you?\u201d \u201cBy all means,\u201d Henchard answered, showing the way in. \u201cYou may remember me?\u201d said his visitor, seating himself. Henchard observed him indifferently, and shook his head. \u201cWell\u2014perhaps you may not. My name is Newson.\u201d Henchard\u2019s face and eyes seemed to die. The other did not notice it. \u201cI know the name well,\u201d Henchard said at last, looking on the floor. \u201cI make no doubt of that. Well, the fact is, I\u2019ve been looking for \u2019ee this fortnight past. I landed at Havenpool and went through Casterbridge on my way to Falmouth, and when I got there, they told me you had some years before been living at Casterbridge.", " When he reached his own house he found her there. \u201cO father!\u201d she said innocently. \u201cI have had a letter\u2014a strange one\u2014not signed. Somebody has asked me to meet him, either on the Budmouth Road at noon today, or in the evening at Mr. Farfrae\u2019s. He says he came to see me some time ago, but a trick was played him, so that he did not see me. I don\u2019t understand it; but between you and me I think Donald is at the bottom of the mystery, and that it is a relation of his who wants to pass an opinion on his choice. But I did not like to go till I had seen you. Shall I go?\u201d Henchard replied heavily, \u201cYes; go.\u201d The question of his remaining in Casterbridge was for ever disposed of by this closing in of Newson on the scene. Henchard was not the man to stand the certainty of condemnation on a matter so near his heart. And being an old hand at bearing anguish in silence, and haughty withal, he resolved to make as light as he could of his intentions, while immediately taking his measures. He surprised the young woman whom he had looked upon as his all in this world by saying to her, as if he did not care about her more: \u201cI am going to leave Casterbridge, Elizabeth-Jane.\u201d \u201cLeave Casterbridge!\u201d she cried, \u201cand leave\u2014me?\u201d \u201cYes, this little shop can be managed by you alone as well as by us both; I don\u2019t care about shops and streets and folk\u2014I would rather get into the country by myself, out of sight, and follow my own ways, and leave you to yours.\u201d She looked down and her tears fell silently.", " This had brought them hither. \u201cWhy are there so many idlers round the Town Hall to-day?\u201d said Lucetta to her servant when the case was over. She had risen late, and had just looked out of the window. \u201cOh, please, ma\u2019am, \u2019tis this larry about Mr. Henchard. A woman has proved that before he became a gentleman he sold his wife for five guineas in a booth at a fair.\u201d In all the accounts which Henchard had given her of the separation from his wife Susan for so many years, of his belief in her death, and so on, he had never clearly explained the actual and immediate cause of that separation. The story she now heard for the first time. A gradual misery overspread Lucetta\u2019s face as she dwelt upon the promise wrung from her the night before. At bottom, then, Henchard was this. How terrible a contingency for a woman who should commit herself to his care. During the day she went out to the Ring and to other places, not coming in till nearly dusk. As soon as she saw Elizabeth-Jane after her return indoors she told her that she had resolved to go away from home to the seaside for a few days\u2014to Port-Bredy; Casterbridge was so gloomy. Elizabeth, seeing that she looked wan and disturbed, encouraged her in the idea, thinking a change would afford her relief. She could not help suspecting that the gloom which seemed to have come over Casterbridge in Lucetta\u2019s eyes might be partially owing to the fact that Farfrae was away from home.", " \u201cVery well,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll come.\u201d \u201cBut please will Mr. Farfrae come?\u201d said the child. \u201cI am going that way.... Why Mr. Farfrae?\u201d said Henchard, with the fixed look of thought. \u201cWhy do people always want Mr. Farfrae?\u201d \u201cI suppose because they like him so\u2014that\u2019s what they say.\u201d \u201cOh\u2014I see\u2014that\u2019s what they say\u2014hey? They like him because he\u2019s cleverer than Mr. Henchard, and because he knows more; and, in short, Mr. Henchard can\u2019t hold a candle to him\u2014hey?\u201d \u201cYes\u2014that\u2019s just it, sir\u2014some of it.\u201d \u201cOh, there\u2019s more? Of course there\u2019s more! What besides? Come, here\u2019s a sixpence for a fairing.\u201d \u201c\u2018And he\u2019s better tempered, and Henchard\u2019s a fool to him,\u2019 they say. And when some of the women were a-walking home they said, \u2018He\u2019s a diment\u2014he\u2019s a chap o\u2019 wax\u2014he\u2019s the best\u2014he\u2019s the horse for my money,\u2019 says they. And they said, \u2018He\u2019s the most understanding man o\u2019 them two by long chalks. I wish he was the master instead of Henchard,\u2019 they said.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ll talk any nonsense,\u201d Henchard replied with covered gloom. \u201cWell, you can go now. And _I_ am coming to value the hay, d\u2019ye hear?\u2014I.\u201d The boy departed, and Henchard murmured, \u201cWish he were master here, do they?\u201d He went towards Durnover. On his way he overtook Farfrae. They walked on together, Henchard looking mostly on the ground. \u201cYou\u2019re no yoursel\u2019 the day?\u201d Donald inquired. \u201cYes, I am very well,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cBut ye are a bit down\u2014surely ye are down?"], "Who begins to call on Lucetta with increasing frequency?": [" Don\u2019t I pay her a dozen pound a year to do things for \u2019ee?\u201d Elizabeth shrank so visibly at the exclamation that he became sorry a few minutes after, and said that he did not mean to be rough. These domestic exhibitions were the small protruding needlerocks which suggested rather than revealed what was underneath. But his passion had less terror for her than his coldness. The increasing frequency of the latter mood told her the sad news that he disliked her with a growing dislike. The more interesting that her appearance and manners became under the softening influences which she could now command, and in her wisdom did command, the more she seemed to estrange him. Sometimes she caught him looking at her with a louring invidiousness that she could hardly bear. Not knowing his secret it was cruel mockery that she should for the first time excite his animosity when she had taken his surname. But the most terrible ordeal was to come. Elizabeth had latterly been accustomed of an afternoon to present a cup of cider or ale and bread-and-cheese to Nance Mockridge, who worked in the yard wimbling hay-bonds. Nance accepted this offering thankfully at first; afterwards as a matter of course. On a day when Henchard was on the premises he saw his stepdaughter enter the hay-barn on this errand; and, as there was no clear spot on which to deposit the provisions, she at once set to work arranging two trusses of hay as a table, Mockridge meanwhile standing with her hands on her hips, easefully looking at the preparations on her behalf.", " The man has got on a blue coat and kerseymere leggings; he has black whiskers, and a reddish face. \u2019Tis a stuffed figure, with a falseface.\u201d The din was increasing now\u2014then it lessened a little. \u201cThere\u2014I shan\u2019t see, after all!\u201d cried the disappointed first maid. \u201cThey have gone into a back street\u2014that\u2019s all,\u201d said the one who occupied the enviable position in the attic. \u201cThere\u2014now I have got \u2019em all endways nicely!\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s the woman like? Just say, and I can tell in a moment if \u2019tis meant for one I\u2019ve in mind.\u201d \u201cMy\u2014why\u2014\u2019tis dressed just as _she_ was dressed when she sat in the front seat at the time the play-actors came to the Town Hall!\u201d Lucetta started to her feet, and almost at the instant the door of the room was quickly and softly opened. Elizabeth-Jane advanced into the firelight. \u201cI have come to see you,\u201d she said breathlessly. \u201cI did not stop to knock\u2014forgive me! I see you have not shut your shutters, and the window is open.\u201d Without waiting for Lucetta\u2019s reply she crossed quickly to the window and pulled out one of the shutters. Lucetta glided to her side. \u201cLet it be\u2014hush!\u201d she said peremporily, in a dry voice, while she seized Elizabeth-Jane by the hand, and held up her finger. Their intercourse had been so low and hurried that not a word had been lost of the conversation without, which had thus proceeded:\u2014 \u201cHer neck is uncovered, and her hair in bands, and her back-comb in place; she\u2019s got on a puce silk, and white stockings, and coloured shoes.\u201d Again Elizabeth-Jane attempted to close the window, but Lucetta held her by main force.", " Yet not quite like or respect them.\u201d Lucetta winced again. Her past was by no means secure from investigation, even in Casterbridge. For one thing Henchard had never returned to her the cloud of letters she had written and sent him in her first excitement. Possibly they were destroyed; but she could have wished that they had never been written. The rencounter with Farfrae and his bearings towards Lucetta had made the reflective Elizabeth more observant of her brilliant and amiable companion. A few days afterwards, when her eyes met Lucetta\u2019s as the latter was going out, she somehow knew that Miss Templeman was nourishing a hope of seeing the attractive Scotchman. The fact was printed large all over Lucetta\u2019s cheeks and eyes to any one who could read her as Elizabeth-Jane was beginning to do. Lucetta passed on and closed the street door. A seer\u2019s spirit took possession of Elizabeth, impelling her to sit down by the fire and divine events so surely from data already her own that they could be held as witnessed. She followed Lucetta thus mentally\u2014saw her encounter Donald somewhere as if by chance\u2014saw him wear his special look when meeting women, with an added intensity because this one was Lucetta. She depicted his impassioned manner; beheld the indecision of both between their lothness to separate and their desire not to be observed; depicted their shaking of hands; how they probably parted with frigidity in their general contour and movements, only in the smaller features showing the spark of passion, thus invisible to all but themselves.", " The latter appeared, surprised in the midst of her lucubrations. As soon as she saw Henchard she went across to him dutifully. \u201cElizabeth-Jane,\u201d he said, taking her hand, \u201cI want you to hear this.\u201d And turning to Lucetta: \u201cWill you, or will you not, marry me? \u201cIf you\u2014wish it, I must agree!\u201d \u201cYou say yes?\u201d \u201cI do.\u201d No sooner had she given the promise than she fell back in a fainting state. \u201cWhat dreadful thing drives her to say this, father, when it is such a pain to her?\u201d asked Elizabeth, kneeling down by Lucetta. \u201cDon\u2019t compel her to do anything against her will! I have lived with her, and know that she cannot bear much.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be a no\u2019thern simpleton!\u201d said Henchard drily. \u201cThis promise will leave him free for you, if you want him, won\u2019t it?\u201d At this Lucetta seemed to wake from her swoon with a start. \u201cHim? Who are you talking about?\u201d she said wildly. \u201cNobody, as far as I am concerned,\u201d said Elizabeth firmly. \u201cOh\u2014well. Then it is my mistake,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cBut the business is between me and Miss Templeman. She agrees to be my wife.\u201d \u201cBut don\u2019t dwell on it just now,\u201d entreated Elizabeth, holding Lucetta\u2019s hand. \u201cI don\u2019t wish to, if she promises,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cI have, I have,\u201d groaned Lucetta, her limbs hanging like fluid, from very misery and faintness. \u201cMichael, please don\u2019t argue it any more!\u201d \u201cI will not,\u201d he said. And taking up his hat he went away. Elizabeth-Jane continued to kneel by Lucetta."], "Who does Henchard hire to get rid of Donald Farfrae?": [" \u201cFor maircy\u2019s sake, what object\u2019s this?\u201d said Farfrae, following Abel into the yard, Henchard being some way in the rear by this time. \u201cYe see, Mr. Farfrae,\u201d gibbered Abel with a resigned smile of terror, \u201che said he\u2019d mortify my flesh if so be I didn\u2019t get up sooner, and now he\u2019s a-doing on\u2019t! Ye see it can\u2019t be helped, Mr. Farfrae; things do happen queer sometimes! Yes\u2014I\u2019ll go to Blackmoor Vale half naked as I be, since he do command; but I shall kill myself afterwards; I can\u2019t outlive the disgrace, for the women-folk will be looking out of their winders at my mortification all the way along, and laughing me to scorn as a man \u2019ithout breeches! You know how I feel such things, Maister Farfrae, and how forlorn thoughts get hold upon me. Yes\u2014I shall do myself harm\u2014I feel it coming on!\u201d \u201cGet back home, and slip on your breeches, and come to wark like a man! If ye go not, you\u2019ll ha\u2019e your death standing there!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m afeard I mustn\u2019t! Mr. Henchard said\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care what Mr. Henchard said, nor anybody else! \u2019Tis simple foolishness to do this. Go and dress yourself instantly Whittle.\u201d \u201cHullo, hullo!\u201d said Henchard, coming up behind. \u201cWho\u2019s sending him back?\u201d All the men looked towards Farfrae. \u201cI am,\u201d said Donald. \u201cI say this joke has been carried far enough.\u201d \u201cAnd I say it hasn\u2019t! Get up in the waggon, Whittle.\u201d \u201cNot if I am manager,\u201d said Farfrae. \u201cHe either goes home, or I march out of this yard for good.\u201d Henchard looked at him with a face stern and red.", " One day he answered her inquiry for his health by saying that he could not endure Abel Whittle\u2019s pitying eyes upon him while they worked together in the yard. \u201cHe is such a fool,\u201d said Henchard, \u201cthat he can never get out of his mind the time when I was master there.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll come and wimble for you instead of him, if you will allow me,\u201d said she. Her motive on going to the yard was to get an opportunity of observing the general position of affairs on Farfrae\u2019s premises now that her stepfather was a workman there. Henchard\u2019s threats had alarmed her so much that she wished to see his behaviour when the two were face to face. For two or three days after her arrival Donald did not make any appearance. Then one afternoon the green door opened, and through came, first Farfrae, and at his heels Lucetta. Donald brought his wife forward without hesitation, it being obvious that he had no suspicion whatever of any antecedents in common between her and the now journeyman hay-trusser. Henchard did not turn his eyes toward either of the pair, keeping them fixed on the bond he twisted, as if that alone absorbed him. A feeling of delicacy, which ever prompted Farfrae to avoid anything that might seem like triumphing over a fallen rival, led him to keep away from the hay-barn where Henchard and his daughter were working, and to go on to the corn department. Meanwhile Lucetta, never having been informed that Henchard had entered her husband\u2019s service, rambled straight on to the barn, where she came suddenly upon Henchard, and gave vent to a little \u201cOh!\u201d which the happy and busy Donald was too far off to hear.", " \u201cElizabeth, come here!\u201d said Henchard; and she obeyed. \u201cWhy do you lower yourself so confoundedly?\u201d he said with suppressed passion. \u201cHaven\u2019t I told you o\u2019t fifty times? Hey? Making yourself a drudge for a common workwoman of such a character as hers! Why, ye\u2019ll disgrace me to the dust!\u201d Now these words were uttered loud enough to reach Nance inside the barn door, who fired up immediately at the slur upon her personal character. Coming to the door she cried regardless of consequences, \u201cCome to that, Mr. Henchard, I can let \u2019ee know she\u2019ve waited on worse!\u201d \u201cThen she must have had more charity than sense,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cO no, she hadn\u2019t. \u2019Twere not for charity but for hire; and at a public-house in this town!\u201d \u201cIt is not true!\u201d cried Henchard indignantly. \u201cJust ask her,\u201d said Nance, folding her naked arms in such a manner that she could comfortably scratch her elbows. Henchard glanced at Elizabeth-Jane, whose complexion, now pink and white from confinement, lost nearly all of the former colour. \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d he said to her. \u201cAnything or nothing?\u201d \u201cIt is true,\u201d said Elizabeth-Jane. \u201cBut it was only\u2014\u201d \u201cDid you do it, or didn\u2019t you? Where was it?\u201d \u201cAt the Three Mariners; one evening for a little while, when we were staying there.\u201d Nance glanced triumphantly at Henchard, and sailed into the barn; for assuming that she was to be discharged on the instant she had resolved to make the most of her victory.", " A provisional resource suggested itself. \u201cMiss Henchard\u2014will you go on an errand for me as soon as breakfast is over?\u2014Ah, that\u2019s very good of you. Will you go and order\u2014\u201d Here she enumerated several commissions at sundry shops, which would occupy Elizabeth\u2019s time for the next hour or two, at least. \u201cAnd have you ever seen the Museum?\u201d Elizabeth-Jane had not. \u201cThen you should do so at once. You can finish the morning by going there. It is an old house in a back street\u2014I forget where\u2014but you\u2019ll find out\u2014and there are crowds of interesting things\u2014skeletons, teeth, old pots and pans, ancient boots and shoes, birds\u2019 eggs\u2014all charmingly instructive. You\u2019ll be sure to stay till you get quite hungry.\u201d Elizabeth hastily put on her things and departed. \u201cI wonder why she wants to get rid of me to-day!\u201d she said sorrowfully as she went. That her absence, rather than her services or instruction, was in request, had been readily apparent to Elizabeth-Jane, simple as she seemed, and difficult as it was to attribute a motive for the desire. She had not been gone ten minutes when one of Lucetta\u2019s servants was sent to Henchard\u2019s with a note. The contents were briefly:\u2014 DEAR MICHAEL,\u2014You will be standing in view of my house to-day for two or three hours in the course of your business, so do please call and see me. I am sadly disappointed that you have not come before, for can I help anxiety about my own equivocal relation to you?\u2014especially now my aunt\u2019s fortune has brought me more prominently before society?"], "What does Lucetta claim to suffer from so she doesn\u2019t have to speak to Henchard?": [" Therefore I agree to an indefinite engagement\u2014to put off all thought of marriage for a year or two.\u201d \u201cBut\u2014but\u2014can I do nothing of a different kind?\u201d said Lucetta. \u201cI am full of gratitude to you\u2014you have saved my life. And your care of me is like coals of fire on my head! I am a monied person now. Surely I can do something in return for your goodness\u2014something practical?\u201d Henchard remained in thought. He had evidently not expected this. \u201cThere is one thing you might do, Lucetta,\u201d he said. \u201cBut not exactly of that kind.\u201d \u201cThen of what kind is it?\u201d she asked with renewed misgiving. \u201cI must tell you a secret to ask it.\u2014You may have heard that I have been unlucky this year? I did what I have never done before\u2014speculated rashly; and I lost. That\u2019s just put me in a strait. \u201cAnd you would wish me to advance some money?\u201d \u201cNo, no!\u201d said Henchard, almost in anger. \u201cI\u2019m not the man to sponge on a woman, even though she may be so nearly my own as you. No, Lucetta; what you can do is this and it would save me. My great creditor is Grower, and it is at his hands I shall suffer if at anybody\u2019s; while a fortnight\u2019s forbearance on his part would be enough to allow me to pull through. This may be got out of him in one way\u2014that you would let it be known to him that you are my intended\u2014that we are to be quietly married in the next fortnight.\u2014Now stop, you haven\u2019t heard all! Let him have this story, without, of course, any prejudice to the fact that the actual engagement between us is to be a long one.", " This probability threw Henchard into a defensive attitude, and instead of considering how best to right the wrong, and acquaint Elizabeth\u2019s father with the truth at once, he bethought himself of ways to keep the position he had accidentally won. Towards the young woman herself his affection grew more jealously strong with each new hazard to which his claim to her was exposed. He watched the distant highway expecting to see Newson return on foot, enlightened and indignant, to claim his child. But no figure appeared. Possibly he had spoken to nobody on the coach, but buried his grief in his own heart. His grief!\u2014what was it, after all, to that which he, Henchard, would feel at the loss of her? Newson\u2019s affection cooled by years, could not equal his who had been constantly in her presence. And thus his jealous soul speciously argued to excuse the separation of father and child. He returned to the house half expecting that she would have vanished. No; there she was\u2014just coming out from the inner room, the marks of sleep upon her eyelids, and exhibiting a generally refreshed air. \u201cO father!\u201d she said smiling. \u201cI had no sooner lain down than I napped, though I did not mean to. I wonder I did not dream about poor Mrs. Farfrae, after thinking of her so; but I did not. How strange it is that we do not often dream of latest events, absorbing as they may be.\u201d \u201cI am glad you have been able to sleep,\u201d he said, taking her hand with anxious proprietorship\u2014an act which gave her a pleasant surprise.", " Henchard had come up, accidentally encountering the young man, whose face seemed to inquire, \u201cDo we speak to each other?\u201d She saw her stepfather throw a shine into his eye which answered \u201cNo!\u201d Elizabeth-Jane sighed. \u201cAre you particularly interested in anybody out there?\u201d said Lucetta. \u201cO, no,\u201d said her companion, a quick red shooting over her face. Luckily Farfrae\u2019s figure was immediately covered by the apple-tree. Lucetta looked hard at her. \u201cQuite sure?\u201d she said. \u201cO yes,\u201d said Elizabeth-Jane. Again Lucetta looked out. \u201cThey are all farmers, I suppose?\u201d she said. \u201cNo. There\u2019s Mr. Bulge\u2014he\u2019s a wine merchant; there\u2019s Benjamin Brownlet\u2014a horse dealer; and Kitson, the pig breeder; and Yopper, the auctioneer; besides maltsters, and millers\u2014and so on.\u201d Farfrae stood out quite distinctly now; but she did not mention him. The Saturday afternoon slipped on thus desultorily. The market changed from the sample-showing hour to the idle hour before starting homewards, when tales were told. Henchard had not called on Lucetta though he had stood so near. He must have been too busy, she thought. He would come on Sunday or Monday. The days came but not the visitor, though Lucetta repeated her dressing with scrupulous care. She got disheartened. It may at once be declared that Lucetta no longer bore towards Henchard all that warm allegiance which had characterized her in their first acquaintance, the then unfortunate issue of things had chilled pure love considerably.", " But I\u2019ll find out; I\u2019ll go to her now. And, Donald, you don\u2019t mind her living on with me just the same as before? She is so quiet and unassuming.\u201d \u201cO no, indeed I don\u2019t,\u201d Farfrae answered with, perhaps, a faint awkwardness. \u201cBut I wonder if she would care to?\u201d \u201cO yes!\u201d said Lucetta eagerly. \u201cI am sure she would like to. Besides, poor thing, she has no other home.\u201d Farfrae looked at her and saw that she did not suspect the secret of her more reserved friend. He liked her all the better for the blindness. \u201cArrange as you like with her by all means,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is I who have come to your house, not you to mine.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll run and speak to her,\u201d said Lucetta. When she got upstairs to Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s room the latter had taken off her out-door things, and was resting over a book. Lucetta found in a moment that she had not yet learnt the news. \u201cI did not come down to you, Miss Templeman,\u201d she said simply. \u201cI was coming to ask if you had quite recovered from your fright, but I found you had a visitor. What are the bells ringing for, I wonder? And the band, too, is playing. Somebody must be married; or else they are practising for Christmas.\u201d Lucetta uttered a vague \u201cYes,\u201d and seating herself by the other young woman looked musingly at her. \u201cWhat a lonely creature you are,\u201d she presently said; \u201cnever knowing what\u2019s going on, or what people are talking about everywhere with keen interest."], "What does Elizabeth-Jane refuse to give Lucetta?": [" \u201cGive up business, and go away from here. We have plenty of money, and why should we stay?\u201d Farfrae seemed seriously disposed to discuss this move, and they talked thereon till a visitor was announced. Their neighbour Alderman Vatt came in. \u201cYou\u2019ve heard, I suppose of poor Doctor Chalkfield\u2019s death? Yes\u2014died this afternoon at five,\u201d said Mr. Vatt. Chalkfield was the Councilman who had succeeded to the Mayoralty in the preceding November. Farfrae was sorry at the intelligence, and Mr. Vatt continued: \u201cWell, we know he\u2019s been going some days, and as his family is well provided for we must take it all as it is. Now I have called to ask \u2019ee this\u2014quite privately. If I should nominate \u2019ee to succeed him, and there should be no particular opposition, will \u2019ee accept the chair?\u201d \u201cBut there are folk whose turn is before mine; and I\u2019m over young, and may be thought pushing!\u201d said Farfrae after a pause. \u201cNot at all. I don\u2019t speak for myself only, several have named it. You won\u2019t refuse?\u201d \u201cWe thought of going away,\u201d interposed Lucetta, looking at Farfrae anxiously. \u201cIt was only a fancy,\u201d Farfrae murmured. \u201cI wouldna refuse if it is the wish of a respectable majority in the Council.\u201d \u201cVery well, then, look upon yourself as elected. We have had older men long enough.\u201d When he was gone Farfrae said musingly, \u201cSee now how it\u2019s ourselves that are ruled by the Powers above us! We plan this, but we do that.", " \u201cI know many who have not been so! There was Sandy Macfarlane, who started to America to try his fortune, and he was drowned; and Archibald Leith, he was murdered! And poor Willie Dunbleeze and Maitland Macfreeze\u2014they fell into bad courses, and went the way of all such!\u201d \u201cWhy\u2014you old goosey\u2014I was only speaking in a general sense, of course! You are always so literal. Now when we have finished tea, sing me that funny song about high-heeled shoon and siller tags, and the one-and-forty wooers.\u201d \u201cNo, no. I couldna sing to-night! It\u2019s Henchard\u2014he hates me; so that I may not be his friend if I would. I would understand why there should be a wee bit of envy; but I cannet see a reason for the whole intensity of what he feels. Now, can you, Lucetta? It is more like old-fashioned rivalry in love than just a bit of rivalry in trade.\u201d Lucetta had grown somewhat wan. \u201cNo,\u201d she replied. \u201cI give him employment\u2014I cannet refuse it. But neither can I blind myself to the fact that with a man of passions such as his, there is no safeguard for conduct!\u201d \u201cWhat have you heard\u2014O Donald, dearest?\u201d said Lucetta in alarm. The words on her lips were \u201canything about me?\u201d\u2014but she did not utter them. She could not, however, suppress her agitation, and her eyes filled with tears. \u201cNo, no\u2014it is not so serious as ye fancy,\u201d declared Farfrae soothingly; though he did not know its seriousness so well as she. \u201cI wish you would do what we have talked of,\u201d mournfully remarked Lucetta.", " It was only too obvious that conscience had ruled well enough till new love had intervened and usurped that rule. In feeling this she herself forgot for the moment her partially justifying argument\u2014that having discovered Henchard\u2019s infirmities of temper, she had some excuse for not risking her happiness in his hands after once escaping them. The only thing she could say was, \u201cI was a poor girl then; and now my circumstances have altered, so I am hardly the same person.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s true. And it makes the case awkward for me. But I don\u2019t want to touch your money. I am quite willing that every penny of your property shall remain to your personal use. Besides, that argument has nothing in it. The man you are thinking of is no better than I.\u201d \u201cIf you were as good as he you would leave me!\u201d she cried passionately. This unluckily aroused Henchard. \u201cYou cannot in honour refuse me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd unless you give me your promise this very night to be my wife, before a witness, I\u2019ll reveal our intimacy\u2014in common fairness to other men!\u201d A look of resignation settled upon her. Henchard saw its bitterness; and had Lucetta\u2019s heart been given to any other man in the world than Farfrae he would probably have had pity upon her at that moment. But the supplanter was the upstart (as Henchard called him) who had mounted into prominence upon his shoulders, and he could bring himself to show no mercy. Without another word she rang the bell, and directed that Elizabeth-Jane should be fetched from her room.", " The latter appeared, surprised in the midst of her lucubrations. As soon as she saw Henchard she went across to him dutifully. \u201cElizabeth-Jane,\u201d he said, taking her hand, \u201cI want you to hear this.\u201d And turning to Lucetta: \u201cWill you, or will you not, marry me? \u201cIf you\u2014wish it, I must agree!\u201d \u201cYou say yes?\u201d \u201cI do.\u201d No sooner had she given the promise than she fell back in a fainting state. \u201cWhat dreadful thing drives her to say this, father, when it is such a pain to her?\u201d asked Elizabeth, kneeling down by Lucetta. \u201cDon\u2019t compel her to do anything against her will! I have lived with her, and know that she cannot bear much.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be a no\u2019thern simpleton!\u201d said Henchard drily. \u201cThis promise will leave him free for you, if you want him, won\u2019t it?\u201d At this Lucetta seemed to wake from her swoon with a start. \u201cHim? Who are you talking about?\u201d she said wildly. \u201cNobody, as far as I am concerned,\u201d said Elizabeth firmly. \u201cOh\u2014well. Then it is my mistake,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cBut the business is between me and Miss Templeman. She agrees to be my wife.\u201d \u201cBut don\u2019t dwell on it just now,\u201d entreated Elizabeth, holding Lucetta\u2019s hand. \u201cI don\u2019t wish to, if she promises,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cI have, I have,\u201d groaned Lucetta, her limbs hanging like fluid, from very misery and faintness. \u201cMichael, please don\u2019t argue it any more!\u201d \u201cI will not,\u201d he said. And taking up his hat he went away. Elizabeth-Jane continued to kneel by Lucetta."], "Which character profits as the price of corn rises?": [" Henchard\u2019s rejoicings couldn\u2019t say good morning to this,\u201d said one. \u201cA man must be a headstrong stunpoll to think folk would go up to that bleak place to-day.\u201d The other answered that people said it was not only in such things as those that the Mayor was wanting. \u201cWhere would his business be if it were not for this young fellow? \u2019Twas verily Fortune sent him to Henchard. His accounts were like a bramblewood when Mr. Farfrae came. He used to reckon his sacks by chalk strokes all in a row like garden-palings, measure his ricks by stretching with his arms, weigh his trusses by a lift, judge his hay by a chaw, and settle the price with a curse. But now this accomplished young man does it all by ciphering and mensuration. Then the wheat\u2014that sometimes used to taste so strong o\u2019 mice when made into bread that people could fairly tell the breed\u2014Farfrae has a plan for purifying, so that nobody would dream the smallest four-legged beast had walked over it once. O yes, everybody is full of him, and the care Mr. Henchard has to keep him, to be sure!\u201d concluded this gentleman. \u201cBut he won\u2019t do it for long, good-now,\u201d said the other. \u201cNo!\u201d said Henchard to himself behind the tree. \u201cOr if he do, he\u2019ll be honeycombed clean out of all the character and standing that he\u2019s built up in these eighteen year!\u201d He went back to the dancing pavilion. Farfrae was footing a quaint little dance with Elizabeth-Jane\u2014an old country thing, the only one she knew, and though he considerately toned down his movements to suit her demurer gait, the pattern of the shining little nails in the soles of his boots became familiar to the eyes of every bystander.", " And then,\u201d cried Farfrae impetuously, his face alight, \u201cI sold it a few weeks after, when it happened to go up again! And so, by contenting mysel\u2019 with small profits frequently repeated, I soon made five hundred pounds\u2014yes!\u201d\u2014(bringing down his hand upon the table, and quite forgetting where he was)\u2014\u201cwhile the others by keeping theirs in hand made nothing at all!\u201d Lucetta regarded him with a critical interest. He was quite a new type of person to her. At last his eye fell upon the lady\u2019s and their glances met. \u201cAy, now, I\u2019m wearying you!\u201d he exclaimed. She said, \u201cNo, indeed,\u201d colouring a shade. \u201cWhat then?\u201d \u201cQuite otherwise. You are most interesting.\u201d It was now Farfrae who showed the modest pink. \u201cI mean all you Scotchmen,\u201d she added in hasty correction. \u201cSo free from Southern extremes. We common people are all one way or the other\u2014warm or cold, passionate or frigid. You have both temperatures going on in you at the same time.\u201d \u201cBut how do you mean that? Ye were best to explain clearly, ma\u2019am.\u201d \u201cYou are animated\u2014then you are thinking of getting on. You are sad the next moment\u2014then you are thinking of Scotland and friends.\u201d \u201cYes. I think of home sometimes!\u201d he said simply. \u201cSo do I\u2014as far as I can. But it was an old house where I was born, and they pulled it down for improvements, so I seem hardly to have any home to think of now.\u201d Lucetta did not add, as she might have done, that the house was in St. Helier, and not in Bath.", " A yellow flood of reflected sunlight filled the room for a few instants. It was produced by the passing of a load of newly trussed hay from the country, in a waggon marked with Farfrae\u2019s name. Beside it rode Farfrae himself on horseback. Lucetta\u2019s face became\u2014as a woman\u2019s face becomes when the man she loves rises upon her gaze like an apparition. A turn of the eye by Henchard, a glance from the window, and the secret of her inaccessibility would have been revealed. But Henchard in estimating her tone was looking down so plumb-straight that he did not note the warm consciousness upon Lucetta\u2019s face. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have thought it\u2014I shouldn\u2019t have thought it of women!\u201d he said emphatically by-and-by, rising and shaking himself into activity; while Lucetta was so anxious to divert him from any suspicion of the truth that she asked him to be in no hurry. Bringing him some apples she insisted upon paring one for him. He would not take it. \u201cNo, no; such is not for me,\u201d he said drily, and moved to the door. At going out he turned his eye upon her. \u201cYou came to live in Casterbridge entirely on my account,\u201d he said. \u201cYet now you are here you won\u2019t have anything to say to my offer!\u201d He had hardly gone down the staircase when she dropped upon the sofa and jumped up again in a fit of desperation. \u201cI will love him!\u201d she cried passionately; \u201cas for _him_\u2014he\u2019s hot-tempered and stern, and it would be madness to bind myself to him knowing that.", " \u201cI am again out of a foreman,\u201d said the corn-factor. \u201cAre you in a place?\u201d \u201cNot so much as a beggar\u2019s, sir.\u201d \u201cHow much do you ask?\u201d Jopp named his price, which was very moderate. \u201cWhen can you come?\u201d \u201cAt this hour and moment, sir,\u201d said Jopp, who, standing hands-pocketed at the street corner till the sun had faded the shoulders of his coat to scarecrow green, had regularly watched Henchard in the market-place, measured him, and learnt him, by virtue of the power which the still man has in his stillness of knowing the busy one better than he knows himself. Jopp too, had had a convenient experience; he was the only one in Casterbridge besides Henchard and the close-lipped Elizabeth who knew that Lucetta came truly from Jersey, and but proximately from Bath. \u201cI know Jersey too, sir,\u201d he said. \u201cWas living there when you used to do business that way. O yes\u2014have often seen ye there.\u201d \u201cIndeed! Very good. Then the thing is settled. The testimonials you showed me when you first tried for\u2019t are sufficient.\u201d That characters deteriorated in time of need possibly did not occur to Henchard. Jopp said, \u201cThank you,\u201d and stood more firmly, in the consciousness that at last he officially belonged to that spot. \u201cNow,\u201d said Henchard, digging his strong eyes into Jopp\u2019s face, \u201cone thing is necessary to me, as the biggest corn-and-hay dealer in these parts. The Scotchman, who\u2019s taking the town trade so bold into his hands, must be cut out."], "What does Henchard blackmail Lucetta into agreeing to?": [" \u201cI\u2019ll think of it, mother,\u201d she answered. When, later in the day, she saw Henchard, she adverted to the matter at once, in a way which showed that the line of feeling started by her mother had been persevered in. \u201cDo you wish this change so very much, sir?\u201d she asked. \u201cWish it? Why, my blessed fathers, what an ado you women make about a trifle! I proposed it\u2014that\u2019s all. Now, \u2019Lizabeth-Jane, just please yourself. Curse me if I care what you do. Now, you understand, don\u2019t \u2019ee go agreeing to it to please me.\u201d Here the subject dropped, and nothing more was said, and nothing was done, and Elizabeth still passed as Miss Newson, and not by her legal name. Meanwhile the great corn and hay traffic conducted by Henchard throve under the management of Donald Farfrae as it had never thriven before. It had formerly moved in jolts; now it went on oiled casters. The old crude _viv\u00e2 voce_ system of Henchard, in which everything depended upon his memory, and bargains were made by the tongue alone, was swept away. Letters and ledgers took the place of \u201cI\u2019ll do\u2019t,\u201d and \u201cyou shall hae\u2019t\u201d; and, as in all such cases of advance, the rugged picturesqueness of the old method disappeared with its inconveniences. The position of Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s room\u2014rather high in the house, so that it commanded a view of the hay-stores and granaries across the garden\u2014afforded her opportunity for accurate observation of what went on there.", " The latter appeared, surprised in the midst of her lucubrations. As soon as she saw Henchard she went across to him dutifully. \u201cElizabeth-Jane,\u201d he said, taking her hand, \u201cI want you to hear this.\u201d And turning to Lucetta: \u201cWill you, or will you not, marry me? \u201cIf you\u2014wish it, I must agree!\u201d \u201cYou say yes?\u201d \u201cI do.\u201d No sooner had she given the promise than she fell back in a fainting state. \u201cWhat dreadful thing drives her to say this, father, when it is such a pain to her?\u201d asked Elizabeth, kneeling down by Lucetta. \u201cDon\u2019t compel her to do anything against her will! I have lived with her, and know that she cannot bear much.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be a no\u2019thern simpleton!\u201d said Henchard drily. \u201cThis promise will leave him free for you, if you want him, won\u2019t it?\u201d At this Lucetta seemed to wake from her swoon with a start. \u201cHim? Who are you talking about?\u201d she said wildly. \u201cNobody, as far as I am concerned,\u201d said Elizabeth firmly. \u201cOh\u2014well. Then it is my mistake,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cBut the business is between me and Miss Templeman. She agrees to be my wife.\u201d \u201cBut don\u2019t dwell on it just now,\u201d entreated Elizabeth, holding Lucetta\u2019s hand. \u201cI don\u2019t wish to, if she promises,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cI have, I have,\u201d groaned Lucetta, her limbs hanging like fluid, from very misery and faintness. \u201cMichael, please don\u2019t argue it any more!\u201d \u201cI will not,\u201d he said. And taking up his hat he went away. Elizabeth-Jane continued to kneel by Lucetta.", " Yet not quite like or respect them.\u201d Lucetta winced again. Her past was by no means secure from investigation, even in Casterbridge. For one thing Henchard had never returned to her the cloud of letters she had written and sent him in her first excitement. Possibly they were destroyed; but she could have wished that they had never been written. The rencounter with Farfrae and his bearings towards Lucetta had made the reflective Elizabeth more observant of her brilliant and amiable companion. A few days afterwards, when her eyes met Lucetta\u2019s as the latter was going out, she somehow knew that Miss Templeman was nourishing a hope of seeing the attractive Scotchman. The fact was printed large all over Lucetta\u2019s cheeks and eyes to any one who could read her as Elizabeth-Jane was beginning to do. Lucetta passed on and closed the street door. A seer\u2019s spirit took possession of Elizabeth, impelling her to sit down by the fire and divine events so surely from data already her own that they could be held as witnessed. She followed Lucetta thus mentally\u2014saw her encounter Donald somewhere as if by chance\u2014saw him wear his special look when meeting women, with an added intensity because this one was Lucetta. She depicted his impassioned manner; beheld the indecision of both between their lothness to separate and their desire not to be observed; depicted their shaking of hands; how they probably parted with frigidity in their general contour and movements, only in the smaller features showing the spark of passion, thus invisible to all but themselves.", " Henchard had come up, accidentally encountering the young man, whose face seemed to inquire, \u201cDo we speak to each other?\u201d She saw her stepfather throw a shine into his eye which answered \u201cNo!\u201d Elizabeth-Jane sighed. \u201cAre you particularly interested in anybody out there?\u201d said Lucetta. \u201cO, no,\u201d said her companion, a quick red shooting over her face. Luckily Farfrae\u2019s figure was immediately covered by the apple-tree. Lucetta looked hard at her. \u201cQuite sure?\u201d she said. \u201cO yes,\u201d said Elizabeth-Jane. Again Lucetta looked out. \u201cThey are all farmers, I suppose?\u201d she said. \u201cNo. There\u2019s Mr. Bulge\u2014he\u2019s a wine merchant; there\u2019s Benjamin Brownlet\u2014a horse dealer; and Kitson, the pig breeder; and Yopper, the auctioneer; besides maltsters, and millers\u2014and so on.\u201d Farfrae stood out quite distinctly now; but she did not mention him. The Saturday afternoon slipped on thus desultorily. The market changed from the sample-showing hour to the idle hour before starting homewards, when tales were told. Henchard had not called on Lucetta though he had stood so near. He must have been too busy, she thought. He would come on Sunday or Monday. The days came but not the visitor, though Lucetta repeated her dressing with scrupulous care. She got disheartened. It may at once be declared that Lucetta no longer bore towards Henchard all that warm allegiance which had characterized her in their first acquaintance, the then unfortunate issue of things had chilled pure love considerably."], "What does Lucetta do after discovering Henchard\u2019s secret?": [" I could not bear it either.\u201d \u201cWell\u2014we must talk of a plan for keeping her in her present belief, and getting matters straight in spite of it. You have heard I am in a large way of business here\u2014that I am Mayor of the town, and churchwarden, and I don\u2019t know what all?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d she murmured. \u201cThese things, as well as the dread of the girl discovering our disgrace, makes it necessary to act with extreme caution. So that I don\u2019t see how you two can return openly to my house as the wife and daughter I once treated badly, and banished from me; and there\u2019s the rub o\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll go away at once. I only came to see\u2014\u201d \u201cNo, no, Susan; you are not to go\u2014you mistake me!\u201d he said with kindly severity. \u201cI have thought of this plan: that you and Elizabeth take a cottage in the town as the widow Mrs. Newson and her daughter; that I meet you, court you, and marry you. Elizabeth-Jane coming to my house as my stepdaughter. The thing is so natural and easy that it is half done in thinking o\u2019t. This would leave my shady, headstrong, disgraceful life as a young man absolutely unopened; the secret would be yours and mine only; and I should have the pleasure of seeing my own only child under my roof, as well as my wife.\u201d \u201cI am quite in your hands, Michael,\u201d she said meekly. \u201cI came here for the sake of Elizabeth; for myself, if you tell me to leave again to-morrow morning, and never come near you more, I am content to go.\u201d \u201cNow, now; we don\u2019t want to hear that,\u201d said Henchard gently.", " Could he have heard such conversation as passed he would have been enlightened thus much:\u2014 _He_.\u2014\u201cYou like walking this way, Miss Henchard\u2014and is it not so?\u201d (uttered in his undulatory accents, and with an appraising, pondering gaze at her). _She_.\u2014\u201cO yes. I have chosen this road latterly. I have no great reason for it.\u201d _He_.\u2014\u201cBut that may make a reason for others.\u201d _She_ (reddening).\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t know that. My reason, however, such as it is, is that I wish to get a glimpse of the sea every day.\u201d _He_.\u2014\u201cIs it a secret why?\u201d _She_ ( reluctantly ).\u2014\u201cYes.\u201d _He_ (with the pathos of one of his native ballads).\u2014\u201cAh, I doubt there will be any good in secrets! A secret cast a deep shadow over my life. And well you know what it was.\u201d Elizabeth admitted that she did, but she refrained from confessing why the sea attracted her. She could not herself account for it fully, not knowing the secret possibly to be that, in addition to early marine associations, her blood was a sailor\u2019s. \u201cThank you for those new books, Mr. Farfrae,\u201d she added shyly. \u201cI wonder if I ought to accept so many!\u201d \u201cAy! why not? It gives me more pleasure to get them for you, than you to have them!\u201d \u201cIt cannot.\u201d They proceeded along the road together till they reached the town, and their paths diverged. Henchard vowed that he would leave them to their own devices, put nothing in the way of their courses, whatever they might mean.", " But I\u2019ll find out; I\u2019ll go to her now. And, Donald, you don\u2019t mind her living on with me just the same as before? She is so quiet and unassuming.\u201d \u201cO no, indeed I don\u2019t,\u201d Farfrae answered with, perhaps, a faint awkwardness. \u201cBut I wonder if she would care to?\u201d \u201cO yes!\u201d said Lucetta eagerly. \u201cI am sure she would like to. Besides, poor thing, she has no other home.\u201d Farfrae looked at her and saw that she did not suspect the secret of her more reserved friend. He liked her all the better for the blindness. \u201cArrange as you like with her by all means,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is I who have come to your house, not you to mine.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll run and speak to her,\u201d said Lucetta. When she got upstairs to Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s room the latter had taken off her out-door things, and was resting over a book. Lucetta found in a moment that she had not yet learnt the news. \u201cI did not come down to you, Miss Templeman,\u201d she said simply. \u201cI was coming to ask if you had quite recovered from your fright, but I found you had a visitor. What are the bells ringing for, I wonder? And the band, too, is playing. Somebody must be married; or else they are practising for Christmas.\u201d Lucetta uttered a vague \u201cYes,\u201d and seating herself by the other young woman looked musingly at her. \u201cWhat a lonely creature you are,\u201d she presently said; \u201cnever knowing what\u2019s going on, or what people are talking about everywhere with keen interest.", " A messenger was despatched to Budmouth, late as it had grown; the night wore on, and the other doctor came in the small hours. Lucetta had been much soothed by Donald\u2019s arrival; he seldom or never left her side; and when, immediately after his entry, she had tried to lisp out to him the secret which so oppressed her, he checked her feeble words, lest talking should be dangerous, assuring her there was plenty of time to tell him everything. Up to this time he knew nothing of the skimmington-ride. The dangerous illness and miscarriage of Mrs. Farfrae was soon rumoured through the town, and an apprehensive guess having been given as to its cause by the leaders in the exploit, compunction and fear threw a dead silence over all particulars of their orgie; while those immediately around Lucetta would not venture to add to her husband\u2019s distress by alluding to the subject. What, and how much, Farfrae\u2019s wife ultimately explained to him of her past entanglement with Henchard, when they were alone in the solitude of that sad night, cannot be told. That she informed him of the bare facts of her peculiar intimacy with the corn-merchant became plain from Farfrae\u2019s own statements. But in respect of her subsequent conduct\u2014her motive in coming to Casterbridge to unite herself with Henchard\u2014her assumed justification in abandoning him when she discovered reasons for fearing him (though in truth her inconsequent passion for another man at first sight had most to do with that abandonment)\u2014her method of reconciling to her conscience a marriage with the second when she was in a measure committed to the first: to what extent she spoke of these things remained Farfrae\u2019s secret alone."], "Where do Lucetta and Elizabeth-Jane hide from the bull?": [" It was not till they observed this dangling stick that the young women were really alarmed; for it revealed to them that the bull was an old one, too savage to be driven, which had in some way escaped, the staff being the means by which the drover controlled him and kept his horns at arms\u2019 length. They looked round for some shelter or hiding-place, and thought of the barn hard by. As long as they had kept their eyes on the bull he had shown some deference in his manner of approach; but no sooner did they turn their backs to seek the barn than he tossed his head and decided to thoroughly terrify them. This caused the two helpless girls to run wildly, whereupon the bull advanced in a deliberate charge. The barn stood behind a green slimy pond, and it was closed save as to one of the usual pair of doors facing them, which had been propped open by a hurdle-stick, and for this opening they made. The interior had been cleared by a recent bout of threshing except at one end, where there was a stack of dry clover. Elizabeth-Jane took in the situation. \u201cWe must climb up there,\u201d she said. But before they had even approached it they heard the bull scampering through the pond without, and in a second he dashed into the barn, knocking down the hurdle-stake in passing; the heavy door slammed behind him; and all three were imprisoned in the barn together. The mistaken creature saw them, and stalked towards the end of the barn into which they had fled.", " The girls doubled so adroitly that their pursuer was against the wall when the fugitives were already half way to the other end. By the time that his length would allow him to turn and follow them thither they had crossed over; thus the pursuit went on, the hot air from his nostrils blowing over them like a sirocco, and not a moment being attainable by Elizabeth or Lucetta in which to open the door. What might have happened had their situation continued cannot be said; but in a few moments a rattling of the door distracted their adversary\u2019s attention, and a man appeared. He ran forward towards the leading-staff, seized it, and wrenched the animal\u2019s head as if he would snap it off. The wrench was in reality so violent that the thick neck seemed to have lost its stiffness and to become half-paralyzed, whilst the nose dropped blood. The premeditated human contrivance of the nose-ring was too cunning for impulsive brute force, and the creature flinched. The man was seen in the partial gloom to be large-framed and unhesitating. He led the bull to the door, and the light revealed Henchard. He made the bull fast without, and re-entered to the succour of Lucetta; for he had not perceived Elizabeth, who had climbed on to the clover-heap. Lucetta was hysterical, and Henchard took her in his arms and carried her to the door. \u201cYou\u2014have saved me!\u201d she cried, as soon as she could speak. \u201cI have returned your kindness,\u201d he responded tenderly.", " The latter appeared, surprised in the midst of her lucubrations. As soon as she saw Henchard she went across to him dutifully. \u201cElizabeth-Jane,\u201d he said, taking her hand, \u201cI want you to hear this.\u201d And turning to Lucetta: \u201cWill you, or will you not, marry me? \u201cIf you\u2014wish it, I must agree!\u201d \u201cYou say yes?\u201d \u201cI do.\u201d No sooner had she given the promise than she fell back in a fainting state. \u201cWhat dreadful thing drives her to say this, father, when it is such a pain to her?\u201d asked Elizabeth, kneeling down by Lucetta. \u201cDon\u2019t compel her to do anything against her will! I have lived with her, and know that she cannot bear much.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be a no\u2019thern simpleton!\u201d said Henchard drily. \u201cThis promise will leave him free for you, if you want him, won\u2019t it?\u201d At this Lucetta seemed to wake from her swoon with a start. \u201cHim? Who are you talking about?\u201d she said wildly. \u201cNobody, as far as I am concerned,\u201d said Elizabeth firmly. \u201cOh\u2014well. Then it is my mistake,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cBut the business is between me and Miss Templeman.

And taking up his hat he went away. Elizabeth-Jane continued to kneel by Lucetta.", " \u201cYou once saved me.\u201d \u201cHow\u2014comes it to be you\u2014you?\u201d she asked, not heeding his reply. \u201cI came out here to look for you. I have been wanting to tell you something these two or three days; but you have been away, and I could not. Perhaps you cannot talk now?\u201d \u201cOh\u2014no! Where is Elizabeth?\u201d \u201cHere am I!\u201d cried the missing one cheerfully; and without waiting for the ladder to be placed she slid down the face of the clover-stack to the floor. Henchard supporting Lucetta on one side, and Elizabeth-Jane on the other, they went slowly along the rising road. They had reached the top and were descending again when Lucetta, now much recovered, recollected that she had dropped her muff in the barn. \u201cI\u2019ll run back,\u201d said Elizabeth-Jane. \u201cI don\u2019t mind it at all, as I am not tired as you are.\u201d She thereupon hastened down again to the barn, the others pursuing their way. Elizabeth soon found the muff, such an article being by no means small at that time. Coming out she paused to look for a moment at the bull, now rather to be pitied with his bleeding nose, having perhaps rather intended a practical joke than a murder. Henchard had secured him by jamming the staff into the hinge of the barn-door, and wedging it there with a stake. At length she turned to hasten onward after her contemplation, when she saw a green-and-black gig approaching from the contrary direction, the vehicle being driven by Farfrae."], "Who witnesses Lucetta\u2019s wedding in Port-Bredy?": [" Elizabeth saw her friend depart for Port-Bredy, and took charge of High-Place Hall till her return. After two or three days of solitude and incessant rain Henchard called at the house. He seemed disappointed to hear of Lucetta\u2019s absence and though he nodded with outward indifference he went away handling his beard with a nettled mien. The next day he called again. \u201cIs she come now?\u201d he asked. \u201cYes. She returned this morning,\u201d replied his stepdaughter. \u201cBut she is not indoors. She has gone for a walk along the turnpike-road to Port-Bredy. She will be home by dusk.\u201d After a few words, which only served to reveal his restless impatience, he left the house again. XXIX. At this hour Lucetta was bounding along the road to Port-Bredy just as Elizabeth had announced. That she had chosen for her afternoon walk the road along which she had returned to Casterbridge three hours earlier in a carriage was curious\u2014if anything should be called curious in concatenations of phenomena wherein each is known to have its accounting cause. It was the day of the chief market\u2014Saturday\u2014and Farfrae for once had been missed from his corn-stand in the dealers\u2019 room. Nevertheless, it was known that he would be home that night\u2014\u201cfor Sunday,\u201d as Casterbridge expressed it. Lucetta, in continuing her walk, had at length reached the end of the ranked trees which bordered the highway in this and other directions out of the town.", " Grower was!\u201d \u201cMarriage?\u201d \u201cYes. With Mr. Farfrae. O Michael! I am already his wife. We were married this week at Port-Bredy. There were reasons against our doing it here. Mr. Grower was a witness because he happened to be at Port-Bredy at the time.\u201d Henchard stood as if idiotized. She was so alarmed at his silence that she murmured something about lending him sufficient money to tide over the perilous fortnight. \u201cMarried him?\u201d said Henchard at length. \u201cMy good\u2014what, married him whilst\u2014bound to marry me?\u201d \u201cIt was like this,\u201d she explained, with tears in her eyes and quavers in her voice; \u201cdon\u2019t\u2014don\u2019t be cruel! I loved him so much, and I thought you might tell him of the past\u2014and that grieved me! And then, when I had promised you, I learnt of the rumour that you had\u2014sold your first wife at a fair like a horse or cow! How could I keep my promise after hearing that? I could not risk myself in your hands; it would have been letting myself down to take your name after such a scandal. But I knew I should lose Donald if I did not secure him at once\u2014for you would carry out your threat of telling him of our former acquaintance, as long as there was a chance of keeping me for yourself by doing so. But you will not do so now, will you, Michael? for it is too late to separate us.\u201d The notes of St. Peter\u2019s bells in full peal had been wafted to them while he spoke, and now the genial thumping of the town band, renowned for its unstinted use of the drum-stick, throbbed down the street.", " This had brought them hither. \u201cWhy are there so many idlers round the Town Hall to-day?\u201d said Lucetta to her servant when the case was over. She had risen late, and had just looked out of the window. \u201cOh, please, ma\u2019am, \u2019tis this larry about Mr. Henchard. A woman has proved that before he became a gentleman he sold his wife for five guineas in a booth at a fair.\u201d In all the accounts which Henchard had given her of the separation from his wife Susan for so many years, of his belief in her death, and so on, he had never clearly explained the actual and immediate cause of that separation. The story she now heard for the first time. A gradual misery overspread Lucetta\u2019s face as she dwelt upon the promise wrung from her the night before. At bottom, then, Henchard was this. How terrible a contingency for a woman who should commit herself to his care. During the day she went out to the Ring and to other places, not coming in till nearly dusk. As soon as she saw Elizabeth-Jane after her return indoors she told her that she had resolved to go away from home to the seaside for a few days\u2014to Port-Bredy; Casterbridge was so gloomy. Elizabeth, seeing that she looked wan and disturbed, encouraged her in the idea, thinking a change would afford her relief. She could not help suspecting that the gloom which seemed to have come over Casterbridge in Lucetta\u2019s eyes might be partially owing to the fact that Farfrae was away from home.", " \u201cThen this racket they are making is on account of it, I suppose?\u201d said he. \u201cYes\u2014I think he has told them, or else Mr. Grower has.... May I leave you now? My\u2014he was detained at Port-Bredy to-day, and sent me on a few hours before him.\u201d \u201cThen it is _his wife\u2019s_ life I have saved this afternoon.\u201d \u201cYes\u2014and he will be for ever grateful to you.\u201d \u201cI am much obliged to him.... O you false woman!\u201d burst from Henchard. \u201cYou promised me!\u201d \u201cYes, yes! But it was under compulsion, and I did not know all your past\u2014\u2014\u201d \u201cAnd now I\u2019ve a mind to punish you as you deserve! One word to this bran-new husband of how you courted me, and your precious happiness is blown to atoms!\u201d \u201cMichael\u2014pity me, and be generous!\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t deserve pity! You did; but you don\u2019t now.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll help you to pay off your debt.\u201d \u201cA pensioner of Farfrae\u2019s wife\u2014not I! Don\u2019t stay with me longer\u2014I shall say something worse. Go home!\u201d She disappeared under the trees of the south walk as the band came round the corner, awaking the echoes of every stock and stone in celebration of her happiness. Lucetta took no heed, but ran up the back street and reached her own home unperceived. XXX. Farfrae\u2019s words to his landlady had referred to the removal of his boxes and other effects from his late lodgings to Lucetta\u2019s house. The work was not heavy, but it had been much hindered on account of the frequent pauses necessitated by exclamations of surprise at the event, of which the good woman had been briefly informed by letter a few hours earlier."], "After giving up all of his assets, what is Henchard\u2019s last valuable possession?": [" Rigid in this position, more and more words fell successively upon her ear. But what amazed her most was the tone of her husband. He spoke merely in the accents of a man who made a present of his time. \u201cOne word,\u201d he was saying, as the crackling of paper denoted that Henchard was unfolding yet another sheet. \u201cIs it quite fair to this young woman\u2019s memory to read at such length to a stranger what was intended for your eye alone?\u201d \u201cWell, yes,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cBy not giving her name I make it an example of all womankind, and not a scandal to one.\u201d \u201cIf I were you I would destroy them,\u201d said Farfrae, giving more thought to the letters than he had hitherto done. \u201cAs another man\u2019s wife it would injure the woman if it were known.\u201d \u201cNo, I shall not destroy them,\u201d murmured Henchard, putting the letters away. Then he arose, and Lucetta heard no more. She went back to her bedroom in a semi-paralyzed state. For very fear she could not undress, but sat on the edge of the bed, waiting. Would Henchard let out the secret in his parting words? Her suspense was terrible. Had she confessed all to Donald in their early acquaintance he might possibly have got over it, and married her just the same\u2014unlikely as it had once seemed; but for her or any one else to tell him now would be fatal. The door slammed; she could hear her husband bolting it. After looking round in his customary way he came leisurely up the stairs.", " The produce if honestly offered would have created no scandal; but the blunder of misrepresentation, coming at such a moment, dragged Henchard\u2019s name into the ditch. The details of his failure were of the ordinary kind. One day Elizabeth-Jane was passing the King\u2019s Arms, when she saw people bustling in and out more than usual where there was no market. A bystander informed her, with some surprise at her ignorance, that it was a meeting of the Commissioners under Mr. Henchard\u2019s bankruptcy. She felt quite tearful, and when she heard that he was present in the hotel she wished to go in and see him, but was advised not to intrude that day. The room in which debtor and creditors had assembled was a front one, and Henchard, looking out of the window, had caught sight of Elizabeth-Jane through the wire blind. His examination had closed, and the creditors were leaving. The appearance of Elizabeth threw him into a reverie, till, turning his face from the window, and towering above all the rest, he called their attention for a moment more. His countenance had somewhat changed from its flush of prosperity; the black hair and whiskers were the same as ever, but a film of ash was over the rest. \u201cGentlemen,\u201d he said, \u201cover and above the assets that we\u2019ve been talking about, and that appear on the balance-sheet, there be these. It all belongs to ye, as much as everything else I\u2019ve got, and I don\u2019t wish to keep it from you, not I.\u201d Saying this, he took his gold watch from his pocket and laid it on the table; then his purse\u2014the yellow canvas moneybag, such as was carried by all farmers and dealers\u2014untying it, and shaking the money out upon the table beside the watch.", " One afternoon the daughter was not indoors when Henchard came, and he said drily, \u201cThis is a very good opportunity for me to ask you to name the happy day, Susan.\u201d The poor woman smiled faintly; she did not enjoy pleasantries on a situation into which she had entered solely for the sake of her girl\u2019s reputation. She liked them so little, indeed, that there was room for wonder why she had countenanced deception at all, and had not bravely let the girl know her history. But the flesh is weak; and the true explanation came in due course. \u201cO Michael!\u201d she said, \u201cI am afraid all this is taking up your time and giving trouble\u2014when I did not expect any such thing!\u201d And she looked at him and at his dress as a man of affluence, and at the furniture he had provided for the room\u2014ornate and lavish to her eyes. \u201cNot at all,\u201d said Henchard, in rough benignity. \u201cThis is only a cottage\u2014it costs me next to nothing. And as to taking up my time\u201d\u2014here his red and black visage kindled with satisfaction\u2014\u201cI\u2019ve a splendid fellow to superintend my business now\u2014a man whose like I\u2019ve never been able to lay hands on before. I shall soon be able to leave everything to him, and have more time to call my own than I\u2019ve had for these last twenty years.\u201d Henchard\u2019s visits here grew so frequent and so regular that it soon became whispered, and then openly discussed in Casterbridge that the masterful, coercive Mayor of the town was raptured and enervated by the genteel widow Mrs. Newson.", " She felt none of those ups and downs of spirit which beset so many people without cause; never\u2014to paraphrase a recent poet\u2014never a gloom in Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s soul but she well knew how it came there; and her present cheerfulness was fairly proportionate to her solid guarantees for the same. It might have been supposed that, given a girl rapidly becoming good-looking, comfortably circumstanced, and for the first time in her life commanding ready money, she would go and make a fool of herself by dress. But no. The reasonableness of almost everything that Elizabeth did was nowhere more conspicuous than in this question of clothes. To keep in the rear of opportunity in matters of indulgence is as valuable a habit as to keep abreast of opportunity in matters of enterprise. This unsophisticated girl did it by an innate perceptiveness that was almost genius. Thus she refrained from bursting out like a water-flower that spring, and clothing herself in puffings and knick-knacks, as most of the Casterbridge girls would have done in her circumstances. Her triumph was tempered by circumspection, she had still that field-mouse fear of the coulter of destiny despite fair promise, which is common among the thoughtful who have suffered early from poverty and oppression. \u201cI won\u2019t be too gay on any account,\u201d she would say to herself. \u201cIt would be tempting Providence to hurl mother and me down, and afflict us again as He used to do.\u201d We now see her in a black silk bonnet, velvet mantle or silk spencer, dark dress, and carrying a sunshade."], "Who purchases Henchard\u2019s failed business?": [" \u201cI have to go to Mellstock,\u201d said Farfrae coldly, as he loosened his reins to move on. \u201cBut,\u201d implored Henchard, \u201cthe matter is more serious than your business at Mellstock. It is\u2014your wife! She is ill. I can tell you particulars as we go along.\u201d The very agitation and abruptness of Henchard increased Farfrae\u2019s suspicion that this was a _ruse_ to decoy him on to the next wood, where might be effectually compassed what, from policy or want of nerve, Henchard had failed to do earlier in the day. He started the horse. \u201cI know what you think,\u201d deprecated Henchard running after, almost bowed down with despair as he perceived the image of unscrupulous villainy that he assumed in his former friend\u2019s eyes. \u201cBut I am not what you think!\u201d he cried hoarsely. \u201cBelieve me, Farfrae; I have come entirely on your own and your wife\u2019s account. She is in danger. I know no more; and they want you to come. Your man has gone the other way in a mistake. O Farfrae! don\u2019t mistrust me\u2014I am a wretched man; but my heart is true to you still!\u201d Farfrae, however, did distrust him utterly. He knew his wife was with child, but he had left her not long ago in perfect health; and Henchard\u2019s treachery was more credible than his story. He had in his time heard bitter ironies from Henchard\u2019s lips, and there might be ironies now. He quickened the horse\u2019s pace, and had soon risen into the high country lying between there and Mellstock, Henchard\u2019s spasmodic run after him lending yet more substance to his thought of evil purposes.", " \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for your blasted advice it might have been a fine day enough! Why did ye let me go on, hey?\u2014when a word of doubt from you or anybody would have made me think twice! For you can never be sure of weather till \u2019tis past.\u201d \u201cMy advice, sir, was to do what you thought best.\u201d \u201cA useful fellow! And the sooner you help somebody else in that way the better!\u201d Henchard continued his address to Jopp in similar terms till it ended in Jopp\u2019s dismissal there and then, Henchard turning upon his heel and leaving him. \u201cYou shall be sorry for this, sir; sorry as a man can be!\u201d said Jopp, standing pale, and looking after the corn-merchant as he disappeared in the crowd of market-men hard by. XXVII. It was the eve of harvest. Prices being low Farfrae was buying. As was usual, after reckoning too surely on famine weather the local farmers had flown to the other extreme, and (in Farfrae\u2019s opinion) were selling off too recklessly\u2014calculating with just a trifle too much certainty upon an abundant yield. So he went on buying old corn at its comparatively ridiculous price: for the produce of the previous year, though not large, had been of excellent quality. When Henchard had squared his affairs in a disastrous way, and got rid of his burdensome purchases at a monstrous loss, the harvest began. There were three days of excellent weather, and then\u2014\u201cWhat if that curst conjuror should be right after all!\u201d said Henchard.", " \u201cI look as at a picture merely. But,\u201d she went on, turning pleasantly to him, \u201cI may do so now\u2014I may look for you. You are always there, are you not? Ah\u2014I don\u2019t mean it seriously! But it is amusing to look for somebody one knows in a crowd, even if one does not want him. It takes off the terrible oppressiveness of being surrounded by a throng, and having no point of junction with it through a single individual.\u201d \u201cAy! Maybe you\u2019ll be very lonely, ma\u2019am?\u201d \u201cNobody knows how lonely.\u201d \u201cBut you are rich, they say?\u201d \u201cIf so, I don\u2019t know how to enjoy my riches. I came to Casterbridge thinking I should like to live here. But I wonder if I shall.\u201d \u201cWhere did ye come from, ma\u2019am?\u201d \u201cThe neighbourhood of Bath.\u201d \u201cAnd I from near Edinboro\u2019,\u201d he murmured. \u201cIt\u2019s better to stay at home, and that\u2019s true; but a man must live where his money is made. It is a great pity, but it\u2019s always so! Yet I\u2019ve done very well this year. O yes,\u201d he went on with ingenuous enthusiasm. \u201cYou see that man with the drab kerseymere coat? I bought largely of him in the autumn when wheat was down, and then afterwards when it rose a little I sold off all I had! It brought only a small profit to me; while the farmers kept theirs, expecting higher figures\u2014yes, though the rats were gnawing the ricks hollow. Just when I sold the markets went lower, and I bought up the corn of those who had been holding back at less price than my first purchases.", " Then hearing at some place\u2014I forget where\u2014that a man of the name of Henchard had been mayor here, I came back, and called at his house one morning. The old rascal!\u2014he said Elizabeth-Jane had died years ago.\u201d Elizabeth now gave earnest heed to his story. \u201cNow, it never crossed my mind that the man was selling me a packet,\u201d continued Newson. \u201cAnd, if you\u2019ll believe me, I was that upset, that I went back to the coach that had brought me, and took passage onward without lying in the town half-an-hour. Ha-ha!\u2014\u2019twas a good joke, and well carried out, and I give the man credit for\u2019t!\u201d Elizabeth-Jane was amazed at the intelligence. \u201cA joke?\u2014O no!\u201d she cried. \u201cThen he kept you from me, father, all those months, when you might have been here?\u201d The father admitted that such was the case. \u201cHe ought not to have done it!\u201d said Farfrae. Elizabeth sighed. \u201cI said I would never forget him. But O! I think I ought to forget him now!\u201d Newson, like a good many rovers and sojourners among strange men and strange moralities, failed to perceive the enormity of Henchard\u2019s crime, notwithstanding that he himself had been the chief sufferer therefrom. Indeed, the attack upon the absent culprit waxing serious, he began to take Henchard\u2019s part. \u201cWell, \u2019twas not ten words that he said, after all,\u201d Newson pleaded. \u201cAnd how could he know that I should be such a simpleton as to believe him? \u2019Twas as much my fault as his, poor fellow!\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Elizabeth-Jane firmly, in her revulsion of feeling."], "Who owns the cottage Henchard moves into after declaring bankruptcy?": [" The ex-Mayor had left the home of his prosperity, and gone into Jopp\u2019s cottage by the Priory Mill\u2014the sad purlieu to which he had wandered on the night of his discovery that she was not his daughter. Thither she went. Elizabeth thought it odd that he had fixed on this spot to retire to, but assumed that necessity had no choice. Trees which seemed old enough to have been planted by the friars still stood around, and the back hatch of the original mill yet formed a cascade which had raised its terrific roar for centuries. The cottage itself was built of old stones from the long dismantled Priory, scraps of tracery, moulded window-jambs, and arch-labels, being mixed in with the rubble of the walls. In this cottage he occupied a couple of rooms, Jopp, whom Henchard had employed, abused, cajoled, and dismissed by turns, being the householder. But even here her stepfather could not be seen. \u201cNot by his daughter?\u201d pleaded Elizabeth. \u201cBy nobody\u2014at present: that\u2019s his order,\u201d she was informed. Afterwards she was passing by the corn-stores and hay-barns which had been the headquarters of his business. She knew that he ruled there no longer; but it was with amazement that she regarded the familiar gateway. A smear of decisive lead-coloured paint had been laid on to obliterate Henchard\u2019s name, though its letters dimly loomed through like ships in a fog. Over these, in fresh white, spread the name of Farfrae.", " The produce if honestly offered would have created no scandal; but the blunder of misrepresentation, coming at such a moment, dragged Henchard\u2019s name into the ditch. The details of his failure were of the ordinary kind. One day Elizabeth-Jane was passing the King\u2019s Arms, when she saw people bustling in and out more than usual where there was no market. A bystander informed her, with some surprise at her ignorance, that it was a meeting of the Commissioners under Mr. Henchard\u2019s bankruptcy. She felt quite tearful, and when she heard that he was present in the hotel she wished to go in and see him, but was advised not to intrude that day. The room in which debtor and creditors had assembled was a front one, and Henchard, looking out of the window, had caught sight of Elizabeth-Jane through the wire blind. His examination had closed, and the creditors were leaving. The appearance of Elizabeth threw him into a reverie, till, turning his face from the window, and towering above all the rest, he called their attention for a moment more. His countenance had somewhat changed from its flush of prosperity; the black hair and whiskers were the same as ever, but a film of ash was over the rest. \u201cGentlemen,\u201d he said, \u201cover and above the assets that we\u2019ve been talking about, and that appear on the balance-sheet, there be these. It all belongs to ye, as much as everything else I\u2019ve got, and I don\u2019t wish to keep it from you, not I.\u201d Saying this, he took his gold watch from his pocket and laid it on the table; then his purse\u2014the yellow canvas moneybag, such as was carried by all farmers and dealers\u2014untying it, and shaking the money out upon the table beside the watch.", " Abel Whittle was edging his skeleton in at the wicket, and she said, \u201cMr. Farfrae is master here?\u201d \u201cYaas, Miss Henchet,\u201d he said, \u201cMr. Farfrae have bought the concern and all of we work-folk with it; and \u2019tis better for us than \u2019twas\u2014though I shouldn\u2019t say that to you as a daughter-law. We work harder, but we bain\u2019t made afeard now. It was fear made my few poor hairs so thin! No busting out, no slamming of doors, no meddling with yer eternal soul and all that; and though \u2019tis a shilling a week less I\u2019m the richer man; for what\u2019s all the world if yer mind is always in a larry, Miss Henchet?\u201d The intelligence was in a general sense true; and Henchard\u2019s stores, which had remained in a paralyzed condition during the settlement of his bankruptcy, were stirred into activity again when the new tenant had possession. Thenceforward the full sacks, looped with the shining chain, went scurrying up and down under the cat-head, hairy arms were thrust out from the different door-ways, and the grain was hauled in; trusses of hay were tossed anew in and out of the barns, and the wimbles creaked; while the scales and steel-yards began to be busy where guess-work had formerly been the rule. XXXII. Two bridges stood near the lower part of Casterbridge town. The first, of weather-stained brick, was immediately at the end of High Street, where a diverging branch from that thoroughfare ran round to the low-lying Durnover lanes; so that the precincts of the bridge formed the merging point of respectability and indigence.", " They were now a score of miles at least from home, but, by resting the horse for a couple of hours at a village they had just traversed, it would be possible to get back to Casterbridge that same day, while to go much further afield would reduce them to the necessity of camping out for the night, \u201cand that will make a hole in a sovereign,\u201d said Farfrae. She pondered the position, and agreed with him. He accordingly drew rein, but before reversing their direction paused a moment and looked vaguely round upon the wide country which the elevated position disclosed. While they looked a solitary human form came from under the clump of trees, and crossed ahead of them. The person was some labourer; his gait was shambling, his regard fixed in front of him as absolutely as if he wore blinkers; and in his hand he carried a few sticks. Having crossed the road he descended into a ravine, where a cottage revealed itself, which he entered. \u201cIf it were not so far away from Casterbridge I should say that must be poor Whittle. \u2019Tis just like him,\u201d observed Elizabeth-Jane. \u201cAnd it may be Whittle, for he\u2019s never been to the yard these three weeks, going away without saying any word at all; and I owing him for two days\u2019 work, without knowing who to pay it to.\u201d The possibility led them to alight, and at least make an inquiry at the cottage. Farfrae hitched the reins to the gate-post, and they approached what was of humble dwellings surely the humblest."], "Where does Henchard break his vow of sobriety?": [" Well, before I go, let me ask this: Though you are not the young man I thought you were, what\u2019s the difference? Can\u2019t ye stay just the same? Have you really made up your mind about this American notion? I won\u2019t mince matters. I feel you would be invaluable to me\u2014that needn\u2019t be said\u2014and if you will bide and be my manager, I will make it worth your while.\u201d \u201cMy plans are fixed,\u201d said the young man, in negative tones. \u201cI have formed a scheme, and so we need na say any more about it. But will you not drink with me, sir? I find this Casterbridge ale warreming to the stomach.\u201d \u201cNo, no; I fain would, but I can\u2019t,\u201d said Henchard gravely, the scraping of his chair informing the listeners that he was rising to leave. \u201cWhen I was a young man I went in for that sort of thing too strong\u2014far too strong\u2014and was well-nigh ruined by it! I did a deed on account of it which I shall be ashamed of to my dying day. It made such an impression on me that I swore, there and then, that I\u2019d drink nothing stronger than tea for as many years as I was old that day. I have kept my oath; and though, Farfrae, I am sometimes that dry in the dog days that I could drink a quarter-barrel to the pitching, I think o\u2019 my oath, and touch no strong drink at all.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll no\u2019 press ye, sir\u2014I\u2019ll no\u2019 press ye. I respect your vow.\u201d \u201cWell, I shall get a manager somewhere, no doubt,\u201d said Henchard, with strong feeling in his tones.", " The second bridge, of stone, was further out on the highway\u2014in fact, fairly in the meadows, though still within the town boundary. These bridges had speaking countenances. Every projection in each was worn down to obtuseness, partly by weather, more by friction from generations of loungers, whose toes and heels had from year to year made restless movements against these parapets, as they had stood there meditating on the aspect of affairs. In the case of the more friable bricks and stones even the flat faces were worn into hollows by the same mixed mechanism. The masonry of the top was clamped with iron at each joint; since it had been no uncommon thing for desperate men to wrench the coping off and throw it down the river, in reckless defiance of the magistrates. For to this pair of bridges gravitated all the failures of the town; those who had failed in business, in love, in sobriety, in crime. Why the unhappy hereabout usually chose the bridges for their meditations in preference to a railing, a gate, or a stile, was not so clear. There was a marked difference of quality between the personages who haunted the near bridge of brick and the personages who haunted the far one of stone. Those of lowest character preferred the former, adjoining the town; they did not mind the glare of the public eye. They had been of comparatively no account during their successes; and though they might feel dispirited, they had no particular sense of shame in their ruin.", " I won\u2019t be a slave to the past\u2014I\u2019ll love where I choose!\u201d Yet having decided to break away from Henchard one might have supposed her capable of aiming higher than Farfrae. But Lucetta reasoned nothing: she feared hard words from the people with whom she had been earlier associated; she had no relatives left; and with native lightness of heart took kindly to what fate offered. Elizabeth-Jane, surveying the position of Lucetta between her two lovers from the crystalline sphere of a straightforward mind, did not fail to perceive that her father, as she called him, and Donald Farfrae became more desperately enamoured of her friend every day. On Farfrae\u2019s side it was the unforced passion of youth. On Henchard\u2019s the artificially stimulated coveting of maturer age. The pain she experienced from the almost absolute obliviousness to her existence that was shown by the pair of them became at times half dissipated by her sense of its humourousness. When Lucetta had pricked her finger they were as deeply concerned as if she were dying; when she herself had been seriously sick or in danger they uttered a conventional word of sympathy at the news, and forgot all about it immediately. But, as regarded Henchard, this perception of hers also caused her some filial grief; she could not help asking what she had done to be neglected so, after the professions of solicitude he had made. As regarded Farfrae, she thought, after honest reflection, that it was quite natural.", " At the last moment of leaving Port-Bredy, Farfrae, like John Gilpin, had been detained by important customers, whom, even in the exceptional circumstances, he was not the man to neglect. Moreover, there was a convenience in Lucetta arriving first at her house. Nobody there as yet knew what had happened; and she was best in a position to break the news to the inmates, and give directions for her husband\u2019s accommodation. He had, therefore, sent on his two-days\u2019 bride in a hired brougham, whilst he went across the country to a certain group of wheat and barley ricks a few miles off, telling her the hour at which he might be expected the same evening. This accounted for her trotting out to meet him after their separation of four hours. By a strenuous effort, after leaving Henchard she calmed herself in readiness to receive Donald at High-Place Hall when he came on from his lodgings. One supreme fact empowered her to this, the sense that, come what would, she had secured him. Half-an-hour after her arrival he walked in, and she met him with a relieved gladness, which a month\u2019s perilous absence could not have intensified. \u201cThere is one thing I have not done; and yet it is important,\u201d she said earnestly, when she had finished talking about the adventure with the bull. \u201cThat is, broken the news of our marriage to my dear Elizabeth-Jane.\u201d \u201cAh, and you have not?\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cI gave her a lift from the barn homewards; but I did not tell her either; for I thought she might have heard of it in the town, and was keeping back her congratulations from shyness, and all that.\u201d \u201cShe can hardly have heard of it."], "Who becomes the new Mayor of Casterbridge after Henchard\u2019s replacement dies?": [" A yellow flood of reflected sunlight filled the room for a few instants. It was produced by the passing of a load of newly trussed hay from the country, in a waggon marked with Farfrae\u2019s name. Beside it rode Farfrae himself on horseback. Lucetta\u2019s face became\u2014as a woman\u2019s face becomes when the man she loves rises upon her gaze like an apparition. A turn of the eye by Henchard, a glance from the window, and the secret of her inaccessibility would have been revealed. But Henchard in estimating her tone was looking down so plumb-straight that he did not note the warm consciousness upon Lucetta\u2019s face. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have thought it\u2014I shouldn\u2019t have thought it of women!\u201d he said emphatically by-and-by, rising and shaking himself into activity; while Lucetta was so anxious to divert him from any suspicion of the truth that she asked him to be in no hurry. Bringing him some apples she insisted upon paring one for him. He would not take it. \u201cNo, no; such is not for me,\u201d he said drily, and moved to the door. At going out he turned his eye upon her. \u201cYou came to live in Casterbridge entirely on my account,\u201d he said. \u201cYet now you are here you won\u2019t have anything to say to my offer!\u201d He had hardly gone down the staircase when she dropped upon the sofa and jumped up again in a fit of desperation. \u201cI will love him!\u201d she cried passionately; \u201cas for _him_\u2014he\u2019s hot-tempered and stern, and it would be madness to bind myself to him knowing that.", " When this was all done, and Henchard had become in a measure broken in, he came to work daily on the home premises like the rest. And thus the once flourishing merchant and Mayor and what not stood as a day-labourer in the barns and granaries he formerly had owned. \u201cI have worked as a journeyman before now, ha\u2019n\u2019t I?\u201d he would say in his defiant way; \u201cand why shouldn\u2019t I do it again?\u201d But he looked a far different journeyman from the one he had been in his earlier days. Then he had worn clean, suitable clothes, light and cheerful in hue; leggings yellow as marigolds, corduroys immaculate as new flax, and a neckerchief like a flower-garden. Now he wore the remains of an old blue cloth suit of his gentlemanly times, a rusty silk hat, and a once black satin stock, soiled and shabby. Clad thus he went to and fro, still comparatively an active man\u2014for he was not much over forty\u2014and saw with the other men in the yard Donald Farfrae going in and out the green door that led to the garden, and the big house, and Lucetta. At the beginning of the winter it was rumoured about Casterbridge that Mr. Farfrae, already in the Town Council, was to be proposed for Mayor in a year or two. \u201cYes, she was wise, she was wise in her generation!\u201d said Henchard to himself when he heard of this one day on his way to Farfrae\u2019s hay-barn. He thought it over as he wimbled his bonds, and the piece of news acted as a reviviscent breath to that old view of his\u2014of Donald Farfrae as his triumphant rival who rode rough-shod over him.", " \u201cWhat\u2019s going on to-night?\u201d asked the girl, after singling out an old man and standing by him long enough to acquire a neighbourly right of converse. \u201cWell, ye must be a stranger sure,\u201d said the old man, without taking his eyes from the window. \u201cWhy, \u2019tis a great public dinner of the gentle-people and such like leading volk\u2014wi\u2019 the Mayor in the chair. As we plainer fellows bain\u2019t invited, they leave the winder-shutters open that we may get jist a sense o\u2019t out here. If you mount the steps you can see em. That\u2019s Mr. Henchard, the Mayor, at the end of the table, a facing ye; and that\u2019s the Council men right and left.... Ah, lots of them when they begun life were no more than I be now!\u201d \u201cHenchard!\u201d said Elizabeth-Jane, surprised, but by no means suspecting the whole force of the revelation. She ascended to the top of the steps. Her mother, though her head was bowed, had already caught from the inn-window tones that strangely riveted her attention, before the old man\u2019s words, \u201cMr. Henchard, the Mayor,\u201d reached her ears. She arose, and stepped up to her daughter\u2019s side as soon as she could do so without showing exceptional eagerness. The interior of the hotel dining-room was spread out before her, with its tables, and glass, and plate, and inmates. Facing the window, in the chair of dignity, sat a man about forty years of age; of heavy frame, large features, and commanding voice; his general build being rather coarse than compact.", " But there could be no doubt that he was in reality still possessed to the full by the new idea, whatever that might be. At length he went back to the door of the dining-room, paused, and found that the songs, toasts, and conversation were proceeding quite satisfactorily without his presence. The Corporation, private residents, and major and minor tradesmen had, in fact, gone in for comforting beverages to such an extent that they had quite forgotten, not only the Mayor, but all those vast, political, religious, and social differences which they felt necessary to maintain in the daytime, and which separated them like iron grills. Seeing this the Mayor took his hat, and when the waiter had helped him on with a thin holland overcoat, went out and stood under the portico. Very few persons were now in the street; and his eyes, by a sort of attraction, turned and dwelt upon a spot about a hundred yards further down. It was the house to which the writer of the note had gone\u2014the Three Mariners\u2014whose two prominent Elizabethan gables, bow-window, and passage-light could be seen from where he stood. Having kept his eyes on it for a while he strolled in that direction. This ancient house of accommodation for man and beast, now, unfortunately, pulled down, was built of mellow sandstone, with mullioned windows of the same material, markedly out of perpendicular from the settlement of foundations."], "Where does Lucetta meet Henchard to beg him for her letters?": [" Of course I\u2019m glad to come if you want me.\u201d \u201cO, thank you,\u201d she said apprehensively. \u201cI am sorry to see \u2019ee looking so ill,\u201d he stammered with unconcealed compunction. She shook her head. \u201cHow can you be sorry,\u201d she asked, \u201cwhen you deliberately cause it?\u201d \u201cWhat!\u201d said Henchard uneasily. \u201cIs it anything I have done that has pulled you down like that?\u201d \u201cIt is all your doing,\u201d she said. \u201cI have no other grief. My happiness would be secure enough but for your threats. O Michael! don\u2019t wreck me like this! You might think that you have done enough! When I came here I was a young woman; now I am rapidly becoming an old one. Neither my husband nor any other man will regard me with interest long.\u201d Henchard was disarmed. His old feeling of supercilious pity for womankind in general was intensified by this suppliant appearing here as the double of the first. Moreover that thoughtless want of foresight which had led to all her trouble remained with poor Lucetta still; she had come to meet him here in this compromising way without perceiving the risk. Such a woman was very small deer to hunt; he felt ashamed, lost all zest and desire to humiliate Lucetta there and then, and no longer envied Farfrae his bargain. He had married money, but nothing more. Henchard was anxious to wash his hands of the game. \u201cWell, what do you want me to do?\u201d he said gently. \u201cI am sure I shall be very willing. My reading of those letters was only a sort of practical joke, and I revealed nothing.\u201d \u201cTo give me back the letters and any papers you may have that breathe of matrimony or worse.\u201d \u201cSo be it.", " Henchard, with withering humility of demeanour, touched the brim of his hat to her as Whittle and the rest had done, to which she breathed a dead-alive \u201cGood afternoon.\u201d \u201cI beg your pardon, ma\u2019am?\u201d said Henchard, as if he had not heard. \u201cI said good afternoon,\u201d she faltered. \u201cO yes, good afternoon, ma\u2019am,\u201d he replied, touching his hat again. \u201cI am glad to see you, ma\u2019am.\u201d Lucetta looked embarrassed, and Henchard continued: \u201cFor we humble workmen here feel it a great honour that a lady should look in and take an interest in us.\u201d She glanced at him entreatingly; the sarcasm was too bitter, too unendurable. \u201cCan you tell me the time, ma\u2019am?\u201d he asked. \u201cYes,\u201d she said hastily; \u201chalf-past four.\u201d \u201cThank \u2019ee. An hour and a half longer before we are released from work. Ah, ma\u2019am, we of the lower classes know nothing of the gay leisure that such as you enjoy!\u201d As soon as she could do so Lucetta left him, nodded and smiled to Elizabeth-Jane, and joined her husband at the other end of the enclosure, where she could be seen leading him away by the outer gates, so as to avoid passing Henchard again. That she had been taken by surprise was obvious. The result of this casual rencounter was that the next morning a note was put into Henchard\u2019s hand by the postman. \u201cWill you,\u201d said Lucetta, with as much bitterness as she could put into a small communication, \u201cwill you kindly undertake not to speak to me in the biting undertones you used to-day, if I walk through the yard at any time?", " They were written whilst I thought your conduct to me cruel; but now I know more particulars of the position you were in I see how inconsiderate my reproaches were. \u201cNow you will, I am sure, perceive that the one condition which will make any future happiness possible for me is that the past connection between our lives be kept secret outside this isle. Speak of it I know you will not; and I can trust you not to write of it. One safe-guard more remains to be mentioned\u2014that no writings of mine, or trifling articles belonging to me, should be left in your possession through neglect or forgetfulness. To this end may I request you to return to me any such you may have, particularly the letters written in the first abandonment of feeling. \u201cFor the handsome sum you forwarded to me as a plaster to the wound I heartily thank you. \u201cI am now on my way to Bristol, to see my only relative. She is rich, and I hope will do something for me. I shall return through Casterbridge and Budmouth, where I shall take the packet-boat. Can you meet me with the letters and other trifles? I shall be in the coach which changes horses at the Antelope Hotel at half-past five Wednesday evening; I shall be wearing a Paisley shawl with a red centre, and thus may easily be found. I should prefer this plan of receiving them to having them sent.\u2014I remain still, yours; ever, \u201cLUCETTA\u201d Henchard breathed heavily. \u201cPoor thing\u2014better you had not known me!", " Yet not quite like or respect them.\u201d Lucetta winced again. Her past was by no means secure from investigation, even in Casterbridge. For one thing Henchard had never returned to her the cloud of letters she had written and sent him in her first excitement. Possibly they were destroyed; but she could have wished that they had never been written. The rencounter with Farfrae and his bearings towards Lucetta had made the reflective Elizabeth more observant of her brilliant and amiable companion. A few days afterwards, when her eyes met Lucetta\u2019s as the latter was going out, she somehow knew that Miss Templeman was nourishing a hope of seeing the attractive Scotchman. The fact was printed large all over Lucetta\u2019s cheeks and eyes to any one who could read her as Elizabeth-Jane was beginning to do. Lucetta passed on and closed the street door.

She followed Lucetta thus mentally\u2014saw her encounter Donald somewhere as if by chance\u2014saw him wear his special look when meeting women, with an added intensity because this one was Lucetta. She depicted his impassioned manner; beheld the indecision of both between their lothness to separate and their desire not to be observed; depicted their shaking of hands; how they probably parted with frigidity in their general contour and movements, only in the smaller features showing the spark of passion, thus invisible to all but themselves."], "Who is waiting for Lucetta when she returns from her meeting with Henchard?": [" Yet not quite like or respect them.\u201d Lucetta winced again.

As soon as she saw Henchard she went across to him dutifully. \u201cElizabeth-Jane,\u201d he said, taking her hand, \u201cI want you to hear this.\u201d And turning to Lucetta: \u201cWill you, or will you not, marry me? \u201cIf you\u2014wish it, I must agree!\u201d \u201cYou say yes?\u201d \u201cI do.\u201d No sooner had she given the promise than she fell back in a fainting state. \u201cWhat dreadful thing drives her to say this, father, when it is such a pain to her?\u201d asked Elizabeth, kneeling down by Lucetta. \u201cDon\u2019t compel her to do anything against her will! I have lived with her, and know that she cannot bear much.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be a no\u2019thern simpleton!\u201d said Henchard drily. \u201cThis promise will leave him free for you, if you want him, won\u2019t it?\u201d At this Lucetta seemed to wake from her swoon with a start. \u201cHim? Who are you talking about?\u201d she said wildly. \u201cNobody, as far as I am concerned,\u201d said Elizabeth firmly. \u201cOh\u2014well. Then it is my mistake,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cBut the business is between me and Miss Templeman. She agrees to be my wife.\u201d \u201cBut don\u2019t dwell on it just now,\u201d entreated Elizabeth, holding Lucetta\u2019s hand. \u201cI don\u2019t wish to, if she promises,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cI have, I have,\u201d groaned Lucetta, her limbs hanging like fluid, from very misery and faintness. \u201cMichael, please don\u2019t argue it any more!\u201d \u201cI will not,\u201d he said. And taking up his hat he went away. Elizabeth-Jane continued to kneel by Lucetta.", " One day Henchard was at this spot when a masculine figure came along the road from Budmouth, and lingered. Applying his telescope to his eye Henchard expected that Farfrae\u2019s features would be disclosed as usual. But the lenses revealed that today the man was not Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s lover. It was one clothed as a merchant captain, and as he turned in the scrutiny of the road he revealed his face. Henchard lived a lifetime the moment he saw it. The face was Newson\u2019s. Henchard dropped the glass, and for some seconds made no other movement. Newson waited, and Henchard waited\u2014if that could be called a waiting which was a transfixture. But Elizabeth-Jane did not come. Something or other had caused her to neglect her customary walk that day. Perhaps Farfrae and she had chosen another road for variety\u2019s sake. But what did that amount to? She might be here to-morrow, and in any case Newson, if bent on a private meeting and a revelation of the truth to her, would soon make his opportunity. Then he would tell her not only of his paternity, but of the ruse by which he had been once sent away. Elizabeth\u2019s strict nature would cause her for the first time to despise her stepfather, would root out his image as that of an arch-deceiver, and Newson would reign in her heart in his stead. But Newson did not see anything of her that morning. Having stood still awhile he at last retraced his steps, and Henchard felt like a condemned man who has a few hours\u2019 respite.", " Farfrae flung open the door of the ground-floor sitting-room, saying, \u201cThere he is waiting for you,\u201d and Elizabeth entered. In the arm-chair sat the broad-faced genial man who had called on Henchard on a memorable morning between one and two years before this time, and whom the latter had seen mount the coach and depart within half-an-hour of his arrival. It was Richard Newson. The meeting with the light-hearted father from whom she had been separated half-a-dozen years, as if by death, need hardly be detailed. It was an affecting one, apart from the question of paternity. Henchard\u2019s departure was in a moment explained. When the true facts came to be handled the difficulty of restoring her to her old belief in Newson was not so great as might have seemed likely, for Henchard\u2019s conduct itself was a proof that those facts were true. Moreover, she had grown up under Newson\u2019s paternal care; and even had Henchard been her father in nature, this father in early domiciliation might almost have carried the point against him, when the incidents of her parting with Henchard had a little worn off. Newson\u2019s pride in what she had grown up to be was more than he could express. He kissed her again and again. \u201cI\u2019ve saved you the trouble to come and meet me\u2014ha-ha!\u201d said Newson. \u201cThe fact is that Mr. Farfrae here, he said, \u2018Come up and stop with me for a day or two, Captain Newson, and I\u2019ll bring her round.\u2019 \u2018Faith,\u2019 says I, \u2018so I will\u2019; and here I am.\u201d \u201cWell, Henchard is gone,\u201d said Farfrae, shutting the door."], "Where are Mother Cuxsom and Nance Mockridge going when they run into Jopp?": [" Henchard\u2019s packet next met his gaze. He knew there had been something of the nature of wooing between Henchard and the now Mrs. Farfrae; and his vague ideas on the subject narrowed themselves down to these: Henchard had a parcel belonging to Mrs. Farfrae, and he had reasons for not returning that parcel to her in person. What could be inside it? So he went on and on till, animated by resentment at Lucetta\u2019s haughtiness, as he thought it, and curiosity to learn if there were any weak sides to this transaction with Henchard, he examined the package. The pen and all its relations being awkward tools in Henchard\u2019s hands he had affixed the seals without an impression, it never occurring to him that the efficacy of such a fastening depended on this. Jopp was far less of a tyro; he lifted one of the seals with his penknife, peeped in at the end thus opened, saw that the bundle consisted of letters; and, having satisfied himself thus far, sealed up the end again by simply softening the wax with the candle, and went off with the parcel as requested. His path was by the river-side at the foot of the town. Coming into the light at the bridge which stood at the end of High Street he beheld lounging thereon Mother Cuxsom and Nance Mockridge. \u201cWe be just going down Mixen Lane way, to look into Peter\u2019s Finger afore creeping to bed,\u201d said Mrs. Cuxsom. \u201cThere\u2019s a fiddle and tambourine going on there.", " Getting a schoolboy to write ours for us; and giving him a penny, do ye mind, not to tell other folks what he\u2019d put inside, do ye mind?\u201d By this time Jopp had pushed his finger under the seals, and unfastened the letters, tumbling them over and picking up one here and there at random, which he read aloud. These passages soon began to uncover the secret which Lucetta had so earnestly hoped to keep buried, though the epistles, being allusive only, did not make it altogether plain. \u201cMrs. Farfrae wrote that!\u201d said Nance Mockridge. \u201c\u2019Tis a humbling thing for us, as respectable women, that one of the same sex could do it. And now she\u2019s avowed herself to another man!\u201d \u201cSo much the better for her,\u201d said the aged furmity-woman. \u201cAh, I saved her from a real bad marriage, and she\u2019s never been the one to thank me.\u201d \u201cI say, what a good foundation for a skimmity-ride,\u201d said Nance. \u201cTrue,\u201d said Mrs. Cuxsom, reflecting. \u201c\u2019Tis as good a ground for a skimmity-ride as ever I knowed; and it ought not to be wasted. The last one seen in Casterbridge must have been ten years ago, if a day.\u201d At this moment there was a shrill whistle, and the landlady said to the man who had been called Charl, \u201c\u2019Tis Jim coming in. Would ye go and let down the bridge for me?\u201d Without replying Charl and his comrade Joe rose, and receiving a lantern from her went out at the back door and down the garden-path, which ended abruptly at the edge of the stream already mentioned.", " Don\u2019t I pay her a dozen pound a year to do things for \u2019ee?\u201d Elizabeth shrank so visibly at the exclamation that he became sorry a few minutes after, and said that he did not mean to be rough. These domestic exhibitions were the small protruding needlerocks which suggested rather than revealed what was underneath. But his passion had less terror for her than his coldness. The increasing frequency of the latter mood told her the sad news that he disliked her with a growing dislike. The more interesting that her appearance and manners became under the softening influences which she could now command, and in her wisdom did command, the more she seemed to estrange him. Sometimes she caught him looking at her with a louring invidiousness that she could hardly bear. Not knowing his secret it was cruel mockery that she should for the first time excite his animosity when she had taken his surname. But the most terrible ordeal was to come. Elizabeth had latterly been accustomed of an afternoon to present a cup of cider or ale and bread-and-cheese to Nance Mockridge, who worked in the yard wimbling hay-bonds. Nance accepted this offering thankfully at first; afterwards as a matter of course. On a day when Henchard was on the premises he saw his stepdaughter enter the hay-barn on this errand; and, as there was no clear spot on which to deposit the provisions, she at once set to work arranging two trusses of hay as a table, Mockridge meanwhile standing with her hands on her hips, easefully looking at the preparations on her behalf.", " So much for man\u2019s rivalry, he thought. Death was to have the oyster, and Farfrae and himself the shells. But about Elizabeth-Jane; in the midst of his gloom she seemed to him as a pin-point of light. He had liked the look on her face as she answered him from the stairs. There had been affection in it, and above all things what he desired now was affection from anything that was good and pure. She was not his own, yet, for the first time, he had a faint dream that he might get to like her as his own,\u2014if she would only continue to love him. Jopp was just going to bed when Henchard got home. As the latter entered the door Jopp said, \u201cThis is rather bad about Mrs. Farfrae\u2019s illness.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Henchard shortly, though little dreaming of Jopp\u2019s complicity in the night\u2019s harlequinade, and raising his eyes just sufficiently to observe that Jopp\u2019s face was lined with anxiety. \u201cSomebody has called for you,\u201d continued Jopp, when Henchard was shutting himself into his own apartment. \u201cA kind of traveller, or sea-captain of some sort.\u201d \u201cOh?\u2014who could he be?\u201d \u201cHe seemed a well-be-doing man\u2014had grey hair and a broadish face; but he gave no name, and no message.\u201d \u201cNor do I gi\u2019e him any attention.\u201d And, saying this, Henchard closed his door. The divergence to Mellstock delayed Farfrae\u2019s return very nearly the two hours of Henchard\u2019s estimate. Among the other urgent reasons for his presence had been the need of his authority to send to Budmouth for a second physician; and when at length Farfrae did come back he was in a state bordering on distraction at his misconception of Henchard\u2019s motives."], "What does a \u201cskimmity ride\u201d publicly reproach?": [" Getting a schoolboy to write ours for us; and giving him a penny, do ye mind, not to tell other folks what he\u2019d put inside, do ye mind?\u201d By this time Jopp had pushed his finger under the seals, and unfastened the letters, tumbling them over and picking up one here and there at random, which he read aloud.

He had crossed on the plank without hesitation, and seemed to see nothing odd in the transit. He thanked them, and walked between them up the garden. \u201cWhat place is this?\u201d he asked, when they reached the door. \u201cA public-house.\u201d \u201cAh, perhaps it will suit me to put up at. Now then, come in and wet your whistle at my expense for the lift over you have given me.\u201d They followed him into the inn, where the increased light exhibited him as one who would stand higher in an estimate by the eye than in one by the ear. He was dressed with a certain clumsy richness\u2014his coat being furred, and his head covered by a cap of seal-skin, which, though the nights were chilly, must have been warm for the daytime, spring being somewhat advanced. In his hand he carried a small mahogany case, strapped, and clamped with brass. Apparently surprised at the kind of company which confronted him through the kitchen door, he at once abandoned his idea of putting up at the house; but taking the situation lightly, he called for glasses of the best, paid for them as he stood in the passage, and turned to proceed on his way by the front door. This was barred, and while the landlady was unfastening it the conversation about the skimmington was continued in the sitting-room, and reached his ears. \u201cWhat do they mean by a \u2018skimmity-ride\u2019?\u201d he asked.", " Now there\u2019s a better-looking woman than she that nobody notices at all, because she\u2019s akin to that hontish fellow Henchard.\u201d \u201cI could worship ye, Buzz, for saying that,\u201d remarked Nance Mockridge. \u201cI do like to see the trimming pulled off such Christmas candles. I am quite unequal to the part of villain myself, or I\u2019d gi\u2019e all my small silver to see that lady toppered.... And perhaps I shall soon,\u201d she added significantly. \u201cThat\u2019s not a noble passiont for a \u2019oman to keep up,\u201d said Longways. Nance did not reply, but every one knew what she meant. The ideas diffused by the reading of Lucetta\u2019s letters at Peter\u2019s Finger had condensed into a scandal, which was spreading like a miasmatic fog through Mixen Lane, and thence up the back streets of Casterbridge. The mixed assemblage of idlers known to each other presently fell apart into two bands by a process of natural selection, the frequenters of Peter\u2019s Finger going off Mixen Lanewards, where most of them lived, while Coney, Buzzford, Longways, and that connection remained in the street. \u201cYou know what\u2019s brewing down there, I suppose?\u201d said Buzzford mysteriously to the others. Coney looked at him. \u201cNot the skimmity-ride?\u201d Buzzford nodded. \u201cI have my doubts if it will be carried out,\u201d said Longways. \u201cIf they are getting it up they are keeping it mighty close. \u201cI heard they were thinking of it a fortnight ago, at all events.\u201d \u201cIf I were sure o\u2019t I\u2019d lay information,\u201d said Longways emphatically.", " Nobody else need know: you could go with me to Mr. Grower and just let me speak to \u2019ee before him as if we were on such terms. We\u2019ll ask him to keep it secret. He will willingly wait then. At the fortnight\u2019s end I shall be able to face him; and I can coolly tell him all is postponed between us for a year or two. Not a soul in the town need know how you\u2019ve helped me. Since you wish to be of use, there\u2019s your way.\u201d It being now what the people called the \u201cpinking in\u201d of the day, that is, the quarter-hour just before dusk, he did not at first observe the result of his own words upon her. \u201cIf it were anything else,\u201d she began, and the dryness of her lips was represented in her voice. \u201cBut it is such a little thing!\u201d he said, with a deep reproach. \u201cLess than you have offered\u2014just the beginning of what you have so lately promised! I could have told him as much myself, but he would not have believed me.\u201d \u201cIt is not because I won\u2019t\u2014it is because I absolutely can\u2019t,\u201d she said, with rising distress. \u201cYou are provoking!\u201d he burst out. \u201cIt is enough to make me force you to carry out at once what you have promised.\u201d \u201cI cannot!\u201d she insisted desperately. \u201cWhy? When I have only within these few minutes released you from your promise to do the thing offhand.\u201d \u201cBecause\u2014he was a witness!\u201d \u201cWitness?

Let\u2019s hear what you mean?\u201d \u201cWitness of my marriage\u2014Mr."], "Where do Henchard and Farfrae meet to fight?": [" \u201cYou must have done it a\u2019 purpose!\u201d said Farfrae\u2019s waggoner. \u201cYou can hear my horses\u2019 bells half-a-mile such a night as this!\u201d \u201cIf ye\u2019d been minding your business instead of zwailing along in such a gawk-hammer way, you would have zeed me!\u201d retorted the wroth representative of Henchard. However, according to the strict rule of the road it appeared that Henchard\u2019s man was most in the wrong, he therefore attempted to back into the High Street. In doing this the near hind-wheel rose against the churchyard wall and the whole mountainous load went over, two of the four wheels rising in the air, and the legs of the thill horse. Instead of considering how to gather up the load the two men closed in a fight with their fists. Before the first round was quite over Henchard came upon the spot, somebody having run for him. Henchard sent the two men staggering in contrary directions by collaring one with each hand, turned to the horse that was down, and extricated him after some trouble. He then inquired into the circumstances; and seeing the state of his waggon and its load began hotly rating Farfrae\u2019s man. Lucetta and Elizabeth-Jane had by this time run down to the street corner, whence they watched the bright heap of new hay lying in the moon\u2019s rays, and passed and repassed by the forms of Henchard and the waggoners. The women had witnessed what nobody else had seen\u2014the origin of the mishap; and Lucetta spoke.", " But the _solicitus timor_ of his love\u2014the dependence upon Elizabeth\u2019s regard into which he had declined (or, in another sense, to which he had advanced)\u2014denaturalized him. He would often weigh and consider for hours together the meaning of such and such a deed or phrase of hers, when a blunt settling question would formerly have been his first instinct. And now, uneasy at the thought of a passion for Farfrae which should entirely displace her mild filial sympathy with himself, he observed her going and coming more narrowly. There was nothing secret in Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s movements beyond what habitual reserve induced, and it may at once be owned on her account that she was guilty of occasional conversations with Donald when they chanced to meet. Whatever the origin of her walks on the Budmouth Road, her return from those walks was often coincident with Farfrae\u2019s emergence from Corn Street for a twenty minutes\u2019 blow on that rather windy highway\u2014just to winnow the seeds and chaff out of him before sitting down to tea, as he said. Henchard became aware of this by going to the Ring, and, screened by its enclosure, keeping his eye upon the road till he saw them meet. His face assumed an expression of extreme anguish. \u201cOf her, too, he means to rob me!\u201d he whispered. \u201cBut he has the right. I do not wish to interfere.\u201d The meeting, in truth, was of a very innocent kind, and matters were by no means so far advanced between the young people as Henchard\u2019s jealous grief inferred.", " It was a point in the highway near which the road to Mellstock branched off from the homeward direction. By diverging to that village, as he had intended to do, Farfrae might probably delay his return by a couple of hours. It soon appeared that his intention was to do so still, the light swerving towards Cuckoo Lane, the by-road aforesaid. Farfrae\u2019s off gig-lamp flashed in Henchard\u2019s face. At the same time Farfrae discerned his late antagonist. \u201cFarfrae\u2014Mr. Farfrae!\u201d cried the breathless Henchard, holding up his hand. Farfrae allowed the horse to turn several steps into the branch lane before he pulled up. He then drew rein, and said \u201cYes?\u201d over his shoulder, as one would towards a pronounced enemy. \u201cCome back to Casterbridge at once!\u201d Henchard said. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong at your house\u2014requiring your return. I\u2019ve run all the way here on purpose to tell ye.\u201d Farfrae was silent, and at his silence Henchard\u2019s soul sank within him. Why had he not, before this, thought of what was only too obvious? He who, four hours earlier, had enticed Farfrae into a deadly wrestle stood now in the darkness of late night-time on a lonely road, inviting him to come a particular way, where an assailant might have confederates, instead of going his purposed way, where there might be a better opportunity of guarding himself from attack. Henchard could almost feel this view of things in course of passage through Farfrae\u2019s mind.", " I have kept my oath for twenty-one years; and now I can drink with a good conscience.... If I don\u2019t do for him\u2014well, I am a fearful practical joker when I choose! He has taken away everything from me, and by heavens, if I meet him I won\u2019t answer for my deeds!\u201d These half-uttered words alarmed Elizabeth\u2014all the more by reason of the still determination of Henchard\u2019s mien. \u201cWhat will you do?\u201d she asked cautiously, while trembling with disquietude, and guessing Henchard\u2019s allusion only too well. Henchard did not answer, and they went on till they had reached his cottage. \u201cMay I come in?\u201d she said. \u201cNo, no; not to-day,\u201d said Henchard; and she went away; feeling that to caution Farfrae was almost her duty, as it was certainly her strong desire. As on the Sunday, so on the week-days, Farfrae and Lucetta might have been seen flitting about the town like two butterflies\u2014or rather like a bee and a butterfly in league for life. She seemed to take no pleasure in going anywhere except in her husband\u2019s company; and hence when business would not permit him to waste an afternoon she remained indoors waiting for the time to pass till his return, her face being visible to Elizabeth-Jane from her window aloft. The latter, however, did not say to herself that Farfrae should be thankful for such devotion, but, full of her reading, she cited Rosalind\u2019s exclamation: \u201cMistress, know yourself; down on your knees and thank Heaven fasting for a good man\u2019s love.\u201d She kept her eye upon Henchard also."], "What does Lucetta suffer from upon seeing the \u201cskimmity ride\u201d?": [" Getting a schoolboy to write ours for us; and giving him a penny, do ye mind, not to tell other folks what he\u2019d put inside, do ye mind?\u201d By this time Jopp had pushed his finger under the seals, and unfastened the letters, tumbling them over and picking up one here and there at random, which he read aloud. These passages soon began to uncover the secret which Lucetta had so earnestly hoped to keep buried, though the epistles, being allusive only, did not make it altogether plain. \u201cMrs. Farfrae wrote that!\u201d said Nance Mockridge. \u201c\u2019Tis a humbling thing for us, as respectable women, that one of the same sex could do it. And now she\u2019s avowed herself to another man!\u201d \u201cSo much the better for her,\u201d said the aged furmity-woman. \u201cAh, I saved her from a real bad marriage, and she\u2019s never been the one to thank me.\u201d \u201cI say, what a good foundation for a skimmity-ride,\u201d said Nance. \u201cTrue,\u201d said Mrs. Cuxsom, reflecting. \u201c\u2019Tis as good a ground for a skimmity-ride as ever I knowed; and it ought not to be wasted. The last one seen in Casterbridge must have been ten years ago, if a day.\u201d At this moment there was a shrill whistle, and the landlady said to the man who had been called Charl, \u201c\u2019Tis Jim coming in. Would ye go and let down the bridge for me?\u201d Without replying Charl and his comrade Joe rose, and receiving a lantern from her went out at the back door and down the garden-path, which ended abruptly at the edge of the stream already mentioned.", " He was a middle-aged man, with hair and whiskers prematurely grey, and a broad and genial face. He had crossed on the plank without hesitation, and seemed to see nothing odd in the transit. He thanked them, and walked between them up the garden. \u201cWhat place is this?\u201d he asked, when they reached the door. \u201cA public-house.\u201d \u201cAh, perhaps it will suit me to put up at. Now then, come in and wet your whistle at my expense for the lift over you have given me.\u201d They followed him into the inn, where the increased light exhibited him as one who would stand higher in an estimate by the eye than in one by the ear. He was dressed with a certain clumsy richness\u2014his coat being furred, and his head covered by a cap of seal-skin, which, though the nights were chilly, must have been warm for the daytime, spring being somewhat advanced. In his hand he carried a small mahogany case, strapped, and clamped with brass. Apparently surprised at the kind of company which confronted him through the kitchen door, he at once abandoned his idea of putting up at the house; but taking the situation lightly, he called for glasses of the best, paid for them as he stood in the passage, and turned to proceed on his way by the front door. This was barred, and while the landlady was unfastening it the conversation about the skimmington was continued in the sitting-room, and reached his ears. \u201cWhat do they mean by a \u2018skimmity-ride\u2019?\u201d he asked.", " Now there\u2019s a better-looking woman than she that nobody notices at all, because she\u2019s akin to that hontish fellow Henchard.\u201d \u201cI could worship ye, Buzz, for saying that,\u201d remarked Nance Mockridge. \u201cI do like to see the trimming pulled off such Christmas candles. I am quite unequal to the part of villain myself, or I\u2019d gi\u2019e all my small silver to see that lady toppered.... And perhaps I shall soon,\u201d she added significantly. \u201cThat\u2019s not a noble passiont for a \u2019oman to keep up,\u201d said Longways. Nance did not reply, but every one knew what she meant. The ideas diffused by the reading of Lucetta\u2019s letters at Peter\u2019s Finger had condensed into a scandal, which was spreading like a miasmatic fog through Mixen Lane, and thence up the back streets of Casterbridge. The mixed assemblage of idlers known to each other presently fell apart into two bands by a process of natural selection, the frequenters of Peter\u2019s Finger going off Mixen Lanewards, where most of them lived, while Coney, Buzzford, Longways, and that connection remained in the street. \u201cYou know what\u2019s brewing down there, I suppose?\u201d said Buzzford mysteriously to the others. Coney looked at him. \u201cNot the skimmity-ride?\u201d Buzzford nodded. \u201cI have my doubts if it will be carried out,\u201d said Longways. \u201cIf they are getting it up they are keeping it mighty close. \u201cI heard they were thinking of it a fortnight ago, at all events.\u201d \u201cIf I were sure o\u2019t I\u2019d lay information,\u201d said Longways emphatically.", " She had recovered herself. \u201cThe bells are ringing on that account,\u201d she said. \u201cMy husband is downstairs. He will live here till a more suitable house is ready for us; and I have told him that I want you to stay with me just as before.\u201d \u201cLet me think of it alone,\u201d the girl quickly replied, corking up the turmoil of her feeling with grand control. \u201cYou shall. I am sure we shall be happy together.\u201d Lucetta departed to join Donald below, a vague uneasiness floating over her joy at seeing him quite at home there. Not on account of her friend Elizabeth did she feel it: for of the bearings of Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s emotions she had not the least suspicion; but on Henchard\u2019s alone. Now the instant decision of Susan Henchard\u2019s daughter was to dwell in that house no more. Apart from her estimate of the propriety of Lucetta\u2019s conduct, Farfrae had been so nearly her avowed lover that she felt she could not abide there. It was still early in the evening when she hastily put on her things and went out. In a few minutes, knowing the ground, she had found a suitable lodging, and arranged to enter it that night. Returning and entering noiselessly she took off her pretty dress and arrayed herself in a plain one, packing up the other to keep as her best; for she would have to be very economical now. She wrote a note to leave for Lucetta, who was closely shut up in the drawing-room with Farfrae; and then Elizabeth-Jane called a man with a wheel-barrow; and seeing her boxes put into it she trotted off down the street to her rooms."], "Who tells Henchard that Lucetta is dead?": [" The latter appeared, surprised in the midst of her lucubrations. As soon as she saw Henchard she went across to him dutifully. \u201cElizabeth-Jane,\u201d he said, taking her hand, \u201cI want you to hear this.\u201d And turning to Lucetta: \u201cWill you, or will you not, marry me? \u201cIf you\u2014wish it, I must agree!\u201d \u201cYou say yes?\u201d \u201cI do.\u201d No sooner had she given the promise than she fell back in a fainting state. \u201cWhat dreadful thing drives her to say this, father, when it is such a pain to her?\u201d asked Elizabeth, kneeling down by Lucetta. \u201cDon\u2019t compel her to do anything against her will! I have lived with her, and know that she cannot bear much.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be a no\u2019thern simpleton!\u201d said Henchard drily. \u201cThis promise will leave him free for you, if you want him, won\u2019t it?\u201d At this Lucetta seemed to wake from her swoon with a start. \u201cHim? Who are you talking about?\u201d she said wildly. \u201cNobody, as far as I am concerned,\u201d said Elizabeth firmly. \u201cOh\u2014well. Then it is my mistake,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cBut the business is between me and Miss Templeman. She agrees to be my wife.\u201d \u201cBut don\u2019t dwell on it just now,\u201d entreated Elizabeth, holding Lucetta\u2019s hand. \u201cI don\u2019t wish to, if she promises,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cI have, I have,\u201d groaned Lucetta, her limbs hanging like fluid, from very misery and faintness. \u201cMichael, please don\u2019t argue it any more!\u201d \u201cI will not,\u201d he said. And taking up his hat he went away. Elizabeth-Jane continued to kneel by Lucetta.", " She was fairly happy, and I never would have undeceived her till the day of her death. Your child died; she had another, and all went well. But a time came\u2014mind me, a time always does come. A time came\u2014it was some while after she and I and the child returned from America\u2014when somebody she had confided her history to, told her my claim to her was a mockery, and made a jest of her belief in my right. After that she was never happy with me. She pined and pined, and socked and sighed. She said she must leave me, and then came the question of our child. Then a man advised me how to act, and I did it, for I thought it was best. I left her at Falmouth, and went off to sea. When I got to the other side of the Atlantic there was a storm, and it was supposed that a lot of us, including myself, had been washed overboard. I got ashore at Newfoundland, and then I asked myself what I should do. \u201c\u2018Since I\u2019m here, here I\u2019ll bide,\u2019 I thought to myself; \u2018\u2019twill be most kindness to her, now she\u2019s taken against me, to let her believe me lost, for,\u2019 I thought, \u2018while she supposes us both alive she\u2019ll be miserable; but if she thinks me dead she\u2019ll go back to him, and the child will have a home.\u2019 I\u2019ve never returned to this country till a month ago, and I found that, as I supposed, she went to you, and my daughter with her. They told me in Falmouth that Susan was dead. But my Elizabeth-Jane\u2014where is she?\u201d \u201cDead likewise,\u201d said Henchard doggedly.", " Henchard, with withering humility of demeanour, touched the brim of his hat to her as Whittle and the rest had done, to which she breathed a dead-alive \u201cGood afternoon.\u201d \u201cI beg your pardon, ma\u2019am?\u201d said Henchard, as if he had not heard. \u201cI said good afternoon,\u201d she faltered. \u201cO yes, good afternoon, ma\u2019am,\u201d he replied, touching his hat again. \u201cI am glad to see you, ma\u2019am.\u201d Lucetta looked embarrassed, and Henchard continued: \u201cFor we humble workmen here feel it a great honour that a lady should look in and take an interest in us.\u201d She glanced at him entreatingly; the sarcasm was too bitter, too unendurable. \u201cCan you tell me the time, ma\u2019am?\u201d he asked. \u201cYes,\u201d she said hastily; \u201chalf-past four.\u201d \u201cThank \u2019ee. An hour and a half longer before we are released from work. Ah, ma\u2019am, we of the lower classes know nothing of the gay leisure that such as you enjoy!\u201d As soon as she could do so Lucetta left him, nodded and smiled to Elizabeth-Jane, and joined her husband at the other end of the enclosure, where she could be seen leading him away by the outer gates, so as to avoid passing Henchard again. That she had been taken by surprise was obvious. The result of this casual rencounter was that the next morning a note was put into Henchard\u2019s hand by the postman. \u201cWill you,\u201d said Lucetta, with as much bitterness as she could put into a small communication, \u201cwill you kindly undertake not to speak to me in the biting undertones you used to-day, if I walk through the yard at any time?", " In this frame of mind, though without strong feeling, he had strolled up the alley and into High-Place Hall by the postern at which Elizabeth had so nearly encountered him. He had gone on thence into the court, and inquired of a man whom he saw unpacking china from a crate if Miss Le Sueur was living there. Miss Le Sueur had been the name under which he had known Lucetta\u2014or \u201cLucette,\u201d as she had called herself at that time. The man replied in the negative; that Miss Templeman only had come. Henchard went away, concluding that Lucetta had not as yet settled in. He was in this interested stage of the inquiry when he witnessed Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s departure the next day. On hearing her announce the address there suddenly took possession of him the strange thought that Lucetta and Miss Templeman were one and the same person, for he could recall that in her season of intimacy with him the name of the rich relative whom he had deemed somewhat a mythical personage had been given as Templeman. Though he was not a fortune-hunter, the possibility that Lucetta had been sublimed into a lady of means by some munificent testament on the part of this relative lent a charm to her image which it might not otherwise have acquired. He was getting on towards the dead level of middle age, when material things increasingly possess the mind. But Henchard was not left long in suspense. Lucetta was rather addicted to scribbling, as had been shown by the torrent of letters after the _fiasco_ in their marriage arrangements, and hardly had Elizabeth gone away when another note came to the Mayor\u2019s house from High-Place Hall."], "Who unexpectedly shows up at Henchard\u2019s home?": [" It is not for myself I want it, but for our unlucky fellow-townsman Henchard. It would be a new beginning for him, if a small one; and I have told the Council that I would head a private subscription among them to set him up in it\u2014that I would be fifty pounds, if they would make up the other fifty among them.\u201d \u201cYes, yes; so I\u2019ve heard; and there\u2019s nothing to say against it for that matter,\u201d the town-clerk replied, in his plain, frank way. \u201cBut, Farfrae, others see what you don\u2019t. Henchard hates \u2019ee\u2014ay, hates \u2019ee; and \u2019tis right that you should know it. To my knowledge he was at the Three Mariners last night, saying in public that about you which a man ought not to say about another.\u201d \u201cIs that so\u2014ah, is that so?\u201d said Farfrae, looking down. \u201cWhy should he do it?\u201d added the young man bitterly; \u201cwhat harm have I done him that he should try to wrong me?\u201d \u201cGod only knows,\u201d said Joyce, lifting his eyebrows. \u201cIt shows much long-suffering in you to put up with him, and keep him in your employ.\u201d \u201cBut I cannet discharge a man who was once a good friend to me. How can I forget that when I came here \u2019twas he enabled me to make a footing for mysel\u2019? No, no. As long as I\u2019ve a day\u2019s work to offer he shall do it if he chooses. \u2019Tis not I who will deny him such a little as that. But I\u2019ll drop the idea of establishing him in a shop till I can think more about it.\u201d It grieved Farfrae much to give up this scheme.", " He need have made no inquiries beforehand, for on drawing near Farfrae\u2019s residence it was plain to the least observant that festivity prevailed within, and that Donald himself shared it, his voice being distinctly audible in the street, giving strong expression to a song of his dear native country that he loved so well as never to have revisited it. Idlers were standing on the pavement in front; and wishing to escape the notice of these Henchard passed quickly on to the door. It was wide open, the hall was lighted extravagantly, and people were going up and down the stairs. His courage failed him; to enter footsore, laden, and poorly dressed into the midst of such resplendency was to bring needless humiliation upon her he loved, if not to court repulse from her husband. Accordingly he went round into the street at the back that he knew so well, entered the garden, and came quietly into the house through the kitchen, temporarily depositing the bird and cage under a bush outside, to lessen the awkwardness of his arrival. Solitude and sadness had so emolliated Henchard that he now feared circumstances he would formerly have scorned, and he began to wish that he had not taken upon himself to arrive at such a juncture. However, his progress was made unexpectedly easy by his discovering alone in the kitchen an elderly woman who seemed to be acting as provisional housekeeper during the convulsions from which Farfrae\u2019s establishment was just then suffering.", " \u201cHe thought highly of me once,\u201d he murmured. \u201cNow he\u2019ll hate me and despise me for ever!\u201d He became possessed by an overpowering wish to see Farfrae again that night, and by some desperate pleading to attempt the well-nigh impossible task of winning pardon for his late mad attack. But as he walked towards Farfrae\u2019s door he recalled the unheeded doings in the yard while he had lain above in a sort of stupor. Farfrae he remembered had gone to the stable and put the horse into the gig; while doing so Whittle had brought him a letter; Farfrae had then said that he would not go towards Budmouth as he had intended\u2014that he was unexpectedly summoned to Weatherbury, and meant to call at Mellstock on his way thither, that place lying but one or two miles out of his course. He must have come prepared for a journey when he first arrived in the yard, unsuspecting enmity; and he must have driven off (though in a changed direction) without saying a word to any one on what had occurred between themselves. It would therefore be useless to call at Farfrae\u2019s house till very late. There was no help for it but to wait till his return, though waiting was almost torture to his restless and self-accusing soul. He walked about the streets and outskirts of the town, lingering here and there till he reached the stone bridge of which mention has been made, an accustomed halting-place with him now. Here he spent a long time, the purl of waters through the weirs meeting his ear, and the Casterbridge lights glimmering at no great distance off.", " \u201cWell,\u201d said the lady, a little of the whiteness of her teeth appearing with the word through the black fleece that protected her face, \u201chave you decided?\u201d \u201cYes, quite,\u201d said the other eagerly. \u201cYour father is willing?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cThen come along.\u201d \u201cWhen?\u201d \u201cNow\u2014as soon as you like. I had a good mind to send to you to come to my house, thinking you might not venture up here in the wind. But as I like getting out of doors, I thought I would come and see first.\u201d \u201cIt was my own thought.\u201d \u201cThat shows we shall agree. Then can you come to-day? My house is so hollow and dismal that I want some living thing there.\u201d \u201cI think I might be able to,\u201d said the girl, reflecting. Voices were borne over to them at that instant on the wind and raindrops from the other side of the wall. There came such words as \u201csacks,\u201d \u201cquarters,\u201d \u201cthreshing,\u201d \u201ctailing,\u201d \u201cnext Saturday\u2019s market,\u201d each sentence being disorganized by the gusts like a face in a cracked mirror. Both the women listened. \u201cWho are those?\u201d said the lady. \u201cOne is my father. He rents that yard and barn.\u201d The lady seemed to forget the immediate business in listening to the technicalities of the corn trade. At last she said suddenly, \u201cDid you tell him where you were going to?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cO\u2014how was that?\u201d \u201cI thought it safer to get away first\u2014as he is so uncertain in his temper.\u201d \u201cPerhaps you are right.... Besides, I have never told you my name. It is Miss Templeman.... Are they gone\u2014on the other side?\u201d \u201cNo."], "Where does Elizabeth-Jane live after Lucetta\u2019s death?": [" They sat down to breakfast, and Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s thoughts reverted to Lucetta. Their sadness added charm to a countenance whose beauty had ever lain in its meditative soberness. \u201cFather,\u201d she said, as soon as she recalled herself to the outspread meal, \u201cit is so kind of you to get this nice breakfast with your own hands, and I idly asleep the while.\u201d \u201cI do it every day,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou have left me; everybody has left me; how should I live but by my own hands.\u201d \u201cYou are very lonely, are you not?\u201d \u201cAy, child\u2014to a degree that you know nothing of! It is my own fault. You are the only one who has been near me for weeks. And you will come no more.\u201d \u201cWhy do you say that? Indeed I will, if you would like to see me.\u201d Henchard signified dubiousness. Though he had so lately hoped that Elizabeth-Jane might again live in his house as daughter, he would not ask her to do so now. Newson might return at any moment, and what Elizabeth would think of him for his deception it were best to bear apart from her. When they had breakfasted his stepdaughter still lingered, till the moment arrived at which Henchard was accustomed to go to his daily work. Then she arose, and with assurance of coming again soon went up the hill in the morning sunlight. \u201cAt this moment her heart is as warm towards me as mine is towards her, she would live with me here in this humble cottage for the asking! Yet before the evening probably he will have come, and then she will scorn me!\u201d This reflection, constantly repeated by Henchard to himself, accompanied him everywhere through the day.", " \u201c\u2019Tis me!\u201d she said, with a face pale as death. \u201cA procession\u2014a scandal\u2014an effigy of me, and him!\u201d The look of Elizabeth betrayed that the latter knew it already. \u201cLet us shut it out,\u201d coaxed Elizabeth-Jane, noting that the rigid wildness of Lucetta\u2019s features was growing yet more rigid and wild with the meaning of the noise and laughter. \u201cLet us shut it out!\u201d \u201cIt is of no use!\u201d she shrieked. \u201cHe will see it, won\u2019t he? Donald will see it! He is just coming home\u2014and it will break his heart\u2014he will never love me any more\u2014and O, it will kill me\u2014kill me!\u201d Elizabeth-Jane was frantic now. \u201cO, can\u2019t something be done to stop it?\u201d she cried. \u201cIs there nobody to do it\u2014not one?\u201d She relinquished Lucetta\u2019s hands, and ran to the door. Lucetta herself, saying recklessly \u201cI will see it!\u201d turned to the window, threw up the sash, and went out upon the balcony. Elizabeth immediately followed, and put her arm round her to pull her in. Lucetta\u2019s eyes were straight upon the spectacle of the uncanny revel, now dancing rapidly. The numerous lights round the two effigies threw them up into lurid distinctness; it was impossible to mistake the pair for other than the intended victims. \u201cCome in, come in,\u201d implored Elizabeth; \u201cand let me shut the window!\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s me\u2014she\u2019s me\u2014even to the parasol\u2014my green parasol!\u201d cried Lucetta with a wild laugh as she stepped in. She stood motionless for one second\u2014then fell heavily to the floor.", " The latter appeared, surprised in the midst of her lucubrations. As soon as she saw Henchard she went across to him dutifully. \u201cElizabeth-Jane,\u201d he said, taking her hand, \u201cI want you to hear this.\u201d And turning to Lucetta: \u201cWill you, or will you not, marry me? \u201cIf you\u2014wish it, I must agree!\u201d \u201cYou say yes?\u201d \u201cI do.\u201d No sooner had she given the promise than she fell back in a fainting state. \u201cWhat dreadful thing drives her to say this, father, when it is such a pain to her?\u201d asked Elizabeth, kneeling down by Lucetta. \u201cDon\u2019t compel her to do anything against her will! I have lived with her, and know that she cannot bear much.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be a no\u2019thern simpleton!\u201d said Henchard drily. \u201cThis promise will leave him free for you, if you want him, won\u2019t it?\u201d At this Lucetta seemed to wake from her swoon with a start. \u201cHim? Who are you talking about?\u201d she said wildly. \u201cNobody, as far as I am concerned,\u201d said Elizabeth firmly. \u201cOh\u2014well. Then it is my mistake,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cBut the business is between me and Miss Templeman. She agrees to be my wife.\u201d \u201cBut don\u2019t dwell on it just now,\u201d entreated Elizabeth, holding Lucetta\u2019s hand. \u201cI don\u2019t wish to, if she promises,\u201d said Henchard. \u201cI have, I have,\u201d groaned Lucetta, her limbs hanging like fluid, from very misery and faintness. \u201cMichael, please don\u2019t argue it any more!\u201d \u201cI will not,\u201d he said. And taking up his hat he went away. Elizabeth-Jane continued to kneel by Lucetta.", " When the young woman came in, sweetly unconscious of the turn in the tide, Lucetta went up to her, and said quite sincerely\u2014 \u201cI\u2019m so glad you\u2019ve come. You\u2019ll live with me a long time, won\u2019t you?\u201d Elizabeth as a watch-dog to keep her father off\u2014what a new idea. Yet it was not unpleasing. Henchard had neglected her all these days, after compromising her indescribably in the past. The least he could have done when he found himself free, and herself affluent, would have been to respond heartily and promptly to her invitation. Her emotions rose, fell, undulated, filled her with wild surmise at their suddenness; and so passed Lucetta\u2019s experiences of that day. XXIV. Poor Elizabeth-Jane, little thinking what her malignant star had done to blast the budding attentions she had won from Donald Farfrae, was glad to hear Lucetta\u2019s words about remaining. For in addition to Lucetta\u2019s house being a home, that raking view of the market-place which it afforded had as much attraction for her as for Lucetta. The _carrefour_ was like the regulation Open Place in spectacular dramas, where the incidents that occur always happen to bear on the lives of the adjoining residents. Farmers, merchants, dairymen, quacks, hawkers, appeared there from week to week, and disappeared as the afternoon wasted away. It was the node of all orbits. From Saturday to Saturday was as from day to day with the two young women now."], "What does Henchard begin to fear?": [" Henchard watched him with his mouth firmly set, the squareness of his jaw and the verticality of his profile being unduly marked. Farfrae came on with one hand in his pocket, and humming a tune in a way which told that the words were most in his mind. They were those of the song he had sung when he arrived years before at the Three Mariners, a poor young man, adventuring for life and fortune, and scarcely knowing witherward:\u2014 \u201cAnd here\u2019s a hand, my trusty fiere, And gie\u2019s a hand o\u2019 thine.\u201d Nothing moved Henchard like an old melody. He sank back. \u201cNo; I can\u2019t do it!\u201d he gasped. \u201cWhy does the infernal fool begin that now!\u201d At length Farfrae was silent, and Henchard looked out of the loft door. \u201cWill ye come up here?\u201d he said. \u201cAy, man,\u201d said Farfrae. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see ye. What\u2019s wrang?\u201d A minute later Henchard heard his feet on the lowest ladder. He heard him land on the first floor, ascend and land on the second, begin the ascent to the third. And then his head rose through the trap behind. \u201cWhat are you doing up here at this time?\u201d he asked, coming forward. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t ye take your holiday like the rest of the men?\u201d He spoke in a tone which had just severity enough in it to show that he remembered the untoward event of the forenoon, and his conviction that Henchard had been drinking. Henchard said nothing; but going back he closed the stair hatchway, and stamped upon it so that it went tight into its frame; he next turned to the wondering young man, who by this time observed that one of Henchard\u2019s arms was bound to his side.", " Henchard pushed to the door, and for some seconds made no other movement. He rose to his feet, and stood like a dark ruin, obscured by \u201cthe shade from his own soul up-thrown.\u201d But he was no longer the man to stand these reverses unmoved. His agitation was great, and he would fain have been gone, but before he could leave the dance had ended, the housekeeper had informed Elizabeth-Jane of the stranger who awaited her, and she entered the room immediately. \u201cOh\u2014it is\u2014Mr. Henchard!\u201d she said, starting back. \u201cWhat, Elizabeth?\u201d he cried, as she seized her hand. \u201cWhat do you say?\u2014_Mr._ Henchard? Don\u2019t, don\u2019t scourge me like that! Call me worthless old Henchard\u2014anything\u2014but don\u2019t \u2019ee be so cold as this! O my maid\u2014I see you have another\u2014a real father in my place. Then you know all; but don\u2019t give all your thought to him! Do ye save a little room for me!\u201d She flushed up, and gently drew her hand away. \u201cI could have loved you always\u2014I would have, gladly,\u201d she said. \u201cBut how can I when I know you have deceived me so\u2014so bitterly deceived me! You persuaded me that my father was not my father\u2014allowed me to live on in ignorance of the truth for years; and then when he, my warm-hearted real father, came to find me, cruelly sent him away with a wicked invention of my death, which nearly broke his heart. O how can I love as I once did a man who has served us like this!\u201d Henchard\u2019s lips half parted to begin an explanation.", " Elizabeth and her mother were passively accepted as sojourners, and shown to a small bedroom under one of the gables, where they sat down. The principle of the inn seemed to be to compensate for the antique awkwardness, crookedness, and obscurity of the passages, floors, and windows, by quantities of clean linen spread about everywhere, and this had a dazzling effect upon the travellers. \u201c\u2019Tis too good for us\u2014we can\u2019t meet it!\u201d said the elder woman, looking round the apartment with misgiving as soon as they were left alone. \u201cI fear it is, too,\u201d said Elizabeth. \u201cBut we must be respectable.\u201d \u201cWe must pay our way even before we must be respectable,\u201d replied her mother. \u201cMr. Henchard is too high for us to make ourselves known to him, I much fear; so we\u2019ve only our own pockets to depend on.\u201d \u201cI know what I\u2019ll do,\u201d said Elizabeth-Jane after an interval of waiting, during which their needs seemed quite forgotten under the press of business below. And leaving the room, she descended the stairs and penetrated to the bar. If there was one good thing more than another which characterized this single-hearted girl it was a willingness to sacrifice her personal comfort and dignity to the common weal. \u201cAs you seem busy here to-night, and mother\u2019s not well off, might I take out part of our accommodation by helping?\u201d she asked of the landlady. The latter, who remained as fixed in the arm-chair as if she had been melted into it when in a liquid state, and could not now be unstuck, looked the girl up and down inquiringly, with her hands on the chair-arms.", " \u201cBut the mountains, and the mists and the rocks, they are there! And don\u2019t they seem like home?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cThey do to me\u2014they do to me,\u201d he murmured. And his mind could be seen flying away northwards. Whether its origin were national or personal, it was quite true what Lucetta had said, that the curious double strands in Farfrae\u2019s thread of life\u2014the commercial and the romantic\u2014were very distinct at times. Like the colours in a variegated cord those contrasts could be seen intertwisted, yet not mingling. \u201cYou are wishing you were back again,\u201d she said. \u201cAh, no, ma\u2019am,\u201d said Farfrae, suddenly recalling himself. The fair without the windows was now raging thick and loud. It was the chief hiring fair of the year, and differed quite from the market of a few days earlier. In substance it was a whitey-brown crowd flecked with white\u2014this being the body of labourers waiting for places. The long bonnets of the women, like waggon-tilts, their cotton gowns and checked shawls, mixed with the carters\u2019 smockfrocks; for they, too, entered into the hiring. Among the rest, at the corner of the pavement, stood an old shepherd, who attracted the eyes of Lucetta and Farfrae by his stillness. He was evidently a chastened man. The battle of life had been a sharp one with him, for, to begin with, he was a man of small frame. He was now so bowed by hard work and years that, approaching from behind, a person could hardly see his head."], "Who does Elizabeth-Jane meet at Farfrae\u2019s house?": [" I could not bear it either.\u201d \u201cWell\u2014we must talk of a plan for keeping her in her present belief, and getting matters straight in spite of it. You have heard I am in a large way of business here\u2014that I am Mayor of the town, and churchwarden, and I don\u2019t know what all?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d she murmured. \u201cThese things, as well as the dread of the girl discovering our disgrace, makes it necessary to act with extreme caution. So that I don\u2019t see how you two can return openly to my house as the wife and daughter I once treated badly, and banished from me; and there\u2019s the rub o\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll go away at once. I only came to see\u2014\u201d \u201cNo, no, Susan; you are not to go\u2014you mistake me!\u201d he said with kindly severity. \u201cI have thought of this plan: that you and Elizabeth take a cottage in the town as the widow Mrs. Newson and her daughter; that I meet you, court you, and marry you. Elizabeth-Jane coming to my house as my stepdaughter. The thing is so natural and easy that it is half done in thinking o\u2019t. This would leave my shady, headstrong, disgraceful life as a young man absolutely unopened; the secret would be yours and mine only; and I should have the pleasure of seeing my own only child under my roof, as well as my wife.\u201d \u201cI am quite in your hands, Michael,\u201d she said meekly. \u201cI came here for the sake of Elizabeth; for myself, if you tell me to leave again to-morrow morning, and never come near you more, I am content to go.\u201d \u201cNow, now; we don\u2019t want to hear that,\u201d said Henchard gently.", " But the _solicitus timor_ of his love\u2014the dependence upon Elizabeth\u2019s regard into which he had declined (or, in another sense, to which he had advanced)\u2014denaturalized him. He would often weigh and consider for hours together the meaning of such and such a deed or phrase of hers, when a blunt settling question would formerly have been his first instinct. And now, uneasy at the thought of a passion for Farfrae which should entirely displace her mild filial sympathy with himself, he observed her going and coming more narrowly. There was nothing secret in Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s movements beyond what habitual reserve induced, and it may at once be owned on her account that she was guilty of occasional conversations with Donald when they chanced to meet. Whatever the origin of her walks on the Budmouth Road, her return from those walks was often coincident with Farfrae\u2019s emergence from Corn Street for a twenty minutes\u2019 blow on that rather windy highway\u2014just to winnow the seeds and chaff out of him before sitting down to tea, as he said. Henchard became aware of this by going to the Ring, and, screened by its enclosure, keeping his eye upon the road till he saw them meet. His face assumed an expression of extreme anguish. \u201cOf her, too, he means to rob me!\u201d he whispered. \u201cBut he has the right. I do not wish to interfere.\u201d The meeting, in truth, was of a very innocent kind, and matters were by no means so far advanced between the young people as Henchard\u2019s jealous grief inferred.", " \u201cNot at all.\u201d \u201cBut where do you live?\u201d \u201cIn Casterbridge, or rather I shall be living here after twelve o\u2019clock to-day.\u201d Elizabeth expressed her astonishment. \u201cI have been staying at Budmouth for a few days while my house was getting ready. The house I am going into is that one they call High-Place Hall\u2014the old stone one looking down the lane to the market. Two or three rooms are fit for occupation, though not all: I sleep there to-night for the first time. Now will you think over my proposal, and meet me here the first fine day next week, and say if you are still in the same mind?\u201d Elizabeth, her eyes shining at this prospect of a change from an unbearable position, joyfully assented; and the two parted at the gate of the churchyard. XXI. As a maxim glibly repeated from childhood remains practically unmarked till some mature experience enforces it, so did this High-Place Hall now for the first time really show itself to Elizabeth-Jane, though her ears had heard its name on a hundred occasions. Her mind dwelt upon nothing else but the stranger, and the house, and her own chance of living there, all the rest of the day. In the afternoon she had occasion to pay a few bills in the town and do a little shopping when she learnt that what was a new discovery to herself had become a common topic about the streets. High-Place Hall was undergoing repair; a lady was coming there to live shortly; all the shop-people knew it, and had already discounted the chance of her being a customer.", " \u201cBegad!\u201d he suddenly exclaimed, jumping up. \u201cI didn\u2019t think of that. Perhaps these are impostors\u2014and Susan and the child dead after all!\u201d However, a something in Elizabeth-Jane soon assured him that, as regarded her, at least, there could be little doubt. And a few hours would settle the question of her mother\u2019s identity; for he had arranged in his note to see her that evening. \u201cIt never rains but it pours!\u201d said Henchard. His keenly excited interest in his new friend the Scotchman was now eclipsed by this event, and Donald Farfrae saw so little of him during the rest of the day that he wondered at the suddenness of his employer\u2019s moods. In the meantime Elizabeth had reached the inn. Her mother, instead of taking the note with the curiosity of a poor woman expecting assistance, was much moved at sight of it. She did not read it at once, asking Elizabeth to describe her reception, and the very words Mr. Henchard used. Elizabeth\u2019s back was turned when her mother opened the letter. It ran thus:\u2014 \u201cMeet me at eight o\u2019clock this evening, if you can, at the Ring on the Budmouth road. The place is easy to find. I can say no more now. The news upsets me almost. The girl seems to be in ignorance. Keep her so till I have seen you. M. H.\u201d He said nothing about the enclosure of five guineas. The amount was significant; it may tacitly have said to her that he bought her back again. She waited restlessly for the close of the day, telling Elizabeth-Jane that she was invited to see Mr. Henchard; that she would go alone."], "What do Newson and Farfrae plan during their evening at Farfrae\u2019s?": [" Farfrae flung open the door of the ground-floor sitting-room, saying, \u201cThere he is waiting for you,\u201d and Elizabeth entered. In the arm-chair sat the broad-faced genial man who had called on Henchard on a memorable morning between one and two years before this time, and whom the latter had seen mount the coach and depart within half-an-hour of his arrival. It was Richard Newson. The meeting with the light-hearted father from whom she had been separated half-a-dozen years, as if by death, need hardly be detailed. It was an affecting one, apart from the question of paternity. Henchard\u2019s departure was in a moment explained. When the true facts came to be handled the difficulty of restoring her to her old belief in Newson was not so great as might have seemed likely, for Henchard\u2019s conduct itself was a proof that those facts were true. Moreover, she had grown up under Newson\u2019s paternal care; and even had Henchard been her father in nature, this father in early domiciliation might almost have carried the point against him, when the incidents of her parting with Henchard had a little worn off. Newson\u2019s pride in what she had grown up to be was more than he could express. He kissed her again and again. \u201cI\u2019ve saved you the trouble to come and meet me\u2014ha-ha!\u201d said Newson. \u201cThe fact is that Mr. Farfrae here, he said, \u2018Come up and stop with me for a day or two, Captain Newson, and I\u2019ll bring her round.\u2019 \u2018Faith,\u2019 says I, \u2018so I will\u2019; and here I am.\u201d \u201cWell, Henchard is gone,\u201d said Farfrae, shutting the door.", " One day Henchard was at this spot when a masculine figure came along the road from Budmouth, and lingered. Applying his telescope to his eye Henchard expected that Farfrae\u2019s features would be disclosed as usual. But the lenses revealed that today the man was not Elizabeth-Jane\u2019s lover. It was one clothed as a merchant captain, and as he turned in the scrutiny of the road he revealed his face. Henchard lived a lifetime the moment he saw it. The face was Newson\u2019s. Henchard dropped the glass, and for some seconds made no other movement. Newson waited, and Henchard waited\u2014if that could be called a waiting which was a transfixture. But Elizabeth-Jane did not come. Something or other had caused her to neglect her customary walk that day. Perhaps Farfrae and she had chosen another road for variety\u2019s sake. But what did that amount to? She might be here to-morrow, and in any case Newson, if bent on a private meeting and a revelation of the truth to her, would soon make his opportunity. Then he would tell her not only of his paternity, but of the ruse by which he had been once sent away. Elizabeth\u2019s strict nature would cause her for the first time to despise her stepfather, would root out his image as that of an arch-deceiver, and Newson would reign in her heart in his stead. But Newson did not see anything of her that morning. Having stood still awhile he at last retraced his steps, and Henchard felt like a condemned man who has a few hours\u2019 respite.", " He had expected questions to close in round him, and unmask his fabrication in five minutes; yet such questioning had not come. But surely they would come; Newson\u2019s departure could be but momentary; he would learn all by inquiries in the town; and return to curse him, and carry his last treasure away! He hastily put on his hat, and went out in the direction that Newson had taken. Newson\u2019s back was soon visible up the road, crossing Bull-stake. Henchard followed, and saw his visitor stop at the King\u2019s Arms, where the morning coach which had brought him waited half-an-hour for another coach which crossed there. The coach Newson had come by was now about to move again. Newson mounted, his luggage was put in, and in a few minutes the vehicle disappeared with him. He had not so much as turned his head. It was an act of simple faith in Henchard\u2019s words\u2014faith so simple as to be almost sublime. The young sailor who had taken Susan Henchard on the spur of the moment and on the faith of a glance at her face, more than twenty years before, was still living and acting under the form of the grizzled traveller who had taken Henchard\u2019s words on trust so absolute as to shame him as he stood. Was Elizabeth-Jane to remain his by virtue of this hardy invention of a moment? \u201cPerhaps not for long,\u201d said he. Newson might converse with his fellow-travellers, some of whom might be Casterbridge people; and the trick would be discovered.", " I could not bear it either.\u201d \u201cWell\u2014we must talk of a plan for keeping her in her present belief, and getting matters straight in spite of it. You have heard I am in a large way of business here\u2014that I am Mayor of the town, and churchwarden, and I don\u2019t know what all?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d she murmured. \u201cThese things, as well as the dread of the girl discovering our disgrace, makes it necessary to act with extreme caution. So that I don\u2019t see how you two can return openly to my house as the wife and daughter I once treated badly, and banished from me; and there\u2019s the rub o\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll go away at once. I only came to see\u2014\u201d \u201cNo, no, Susan; you are not to go\u2014you mistake me!\u201d he said with kindly severity. \u201cI have thought of this plan: that you and Elizabeth take a cottage in the town as the widow Mrs. Newson and her daughter; that I meet you, court you, and marry you.

Now, surely, if he takes so warmly to people who are not related to him at all, may he not take as warmly to his own kin?\u201d While they debated this question a procession of five large waggons went past, laden with hay up to the bedroom windows. They came in from the country, and the steaming horses had probably been travelling a great part of the night. To the shaft of each hung a little board, on which was painted in white letters, \u201cHenchard, corn-factor and hay-merchant.\u201d The spectacle renewed his wife\u2019s conviction that, for her daughter\u2019s sake, she should strain a point to rejoin him. The discussion was continued during breakfast, and the end of it was that Mrs. Henchard decided, for good or for ill, to send Elizabeth-Jane with a message to Henchard, to the effect that his relative Susan, a sailor\u2019s widow, was in the town; leaving it to him to say whether or not he would recognize her. What had brought her to this determination were chiefly two things. He had been described as a lonely widower; and he had expressed shame for a past transaction of his life. There was promise in both. \u201cIf he says no,\u201d she enjoined, as Elizabeth-Jane stood, bonnet on, ready to depart; \u201cif he thinks it does not become the good position he has reached to in the town, to own\u2014to let us call on him as\u2014his distant kinfolk, say, \u2018Then, sir, we would rather not intrude; we will leave Casterbridge as quietly as we have come, and go back to our own country.\u2019 ...I almost feel that I would rather he did say so, as I have not seen him for so many years, and we are so\u2014little allied to him!\u201d \u201cAnd if he say yes?\u201d inquired the more sanguine one.", " To pocket her pride and search for the first husband seemed, wisely or not, the best initiatory step. He had possibly drunk himself into his tomb. But he might, on the other hand, have had too much sense to do so; for in her time with him he had been given to bouts only, and was not a habitual drunkard. At any rate, the propriety of returning to him, if he lived, was unquestionable. The awkwardness of searching for him lay in enlightening Elizabeth, a proceeding which her mother could not endure to contemplate. She finally resolved to undertake the search without confiding to the girl her former relations with Henchard, leaving it to him if they found him to take what steps he might choose to that end. This will account for their conversation at the fair and the half-informed state at which Elizabeth was led onward. In this attitude they proceeded on their journey, trusting solely to the dim light afforded of Henchard\u2019s whereabouts by the furmity woman. The strictest economy was indispensable. Sometimes they might have been seen on foot, sometimes on farmers\u2019 waggons, sometimes in carriers\u2019 vans; and thus they drew near to Casterbridge. Elizabeth-Jane discovered to her alarm that her mother\u2019s health was not what it once had been, and there was ever and anon in her talk that renunciatory tone which showed that, but for the girl, she would not be very sorry to quit a life she was growing thoroughly weary of.", " At the last moment of leaving Port-Bredy, Farfrae, like John Gilpin, had been detained by important customers, whom, even in the exceptional circumstances, he was not the man to neglect. Moreover, there was a convenience in Lucetta arriving first at her house. Nobody there as yet knew what had happened; and she was best in a position to break the news to the inmates, and give directions for her husband\u2019s accommodation. He had, therefore, sent on his two-days\u2019 bride in a hired brougham, whilst he went across the country to a certain group of wheat and barley ricks a few miles off, telling her the hour at which he might be expected the same evening. This accounted for her trotting out to meet him after their separation of four hours. By a strenuous effort, after leaving Henchard she calmed herself in readiness to receive Donald at High-Place Hall when he came on from his lodgings. One supreme fact empowered her to this, the sense that, come what would, she had secured him. Half-an-hour after her arrival he walked in, and she met him with a relieved gladness, which a month\u2019s perilous absence could not have intensified. \u201cThere is one thing I have not done; and yet it is important,\u201d she said earnestly, when she had finished talking about the adventure with the bull. \u201cThat is, broken the news of our marriage to my dear Elizabeth-Jane.\u201d \u201cAh, and you have not?\u201d he said thoughtfully. \u201cI gave her a lift from the barn homewards; but I did not tell her either; for I thought she might have heard of it in the town, and was keeping back her congratulations from shyness, and all that.\u201d \u201cShe can hardly have heard of it.", " Henchard\u2019s packet next met his gaze. He knew there had been something of the nature of wooing between Henchard and the now Mrs. Farfrae; and his vague ideas on the subject narrowed themselves down to these: Henchard had a parcel belonging to Mrs. Farfrae, and he had reasons for not returning that parcel to her in person. What could be inside it? So he went on and on till, animated by resentment at Lucetta\u2019s haughtiness, as he thought it, and curiosity to learn if there were any weak sides to this transaction with Henchard, he examined the package. The pen and all its relations being awkward tools in Henchard\u2019s hands he had affixed the seals without an impression, it never occurring to him that the efficacy of such a fastening depended on this. Jopp was far less of a tyro; he lifted one of the seals with his penknife, peeped in at the end thus opened, saw that the bundle consisted of letters; and, having satisfied himself thus far, sealed up the end again by simply softening the wax with the candle, and went off with the parcel as requested. His path was by the river-side at the foot of the town. Coming into the light at the bridge which stood at the end of High Street he beheld lounging thereon Mother Cuxsom and Nance Mockridge. \u201cWe be just going down Mixen Lane way, to look into Peter\u2019s Finger afore creeping to bed,\u201d said Mrs. Cuxsom. \u201cThere\u2019s a fiddle and tambourine going on there."], "What does Henchard leave as a wedding gift for Elizabeth-Jane?": [" Donald Farfrae had discovered in a screened corner a new bird-cage, shrouded in newspaper, and at the bottom of the cage a little ball of feathers\u2014the dead body of a goldfinch. Nobody could tell her how the bird and cage had come there, though that the poor little songster had been starved to death was evident. The sadness of the incident had made an impression on her. She had not been able to forget it for days, despite Farfrae\u2019s tender banter; and now when the matter had been nearly forgotten it was again revived. \u201cOh, please ma\u2019am, we know how the bird-cage came there. That farmer\u2019s man who called on the evening of the wedding\u2014he was seen wi\u2019 it in his hand as he came up the street; and \u2019tis thoughted that he put it down while he came in with his message, and then went away forgetting where he had left it.\u201d This was enough to set Elizabeth thinking, and in thinking she seized hold of the idea, at one feminine bound, that the caged bird had been brought by Henchard for her as a wedding gift and token of repentance. He had not expressed to her any regrets or excuses for what he had done in the past; but it was a part of his nature to extenuate nothing, and live on as one of his own worst accusers. She went out, looked at the cage, buried the starved little singer, and from that hour her heart softened towards the self-alienated man. When her husband came in she told him her solution of the bird-cage mystery; and begged Donald to help her in finding out, as soon as possible, whither Henchard had banished himself, that she might make her peace with him; try to do something to render his life less that of an outcast, and more tolerable to him.", " When he reached his own house he found her there. \u201cO father!\u201d she said innocently. \u201cI have had a letter\u2014a strange one\u2014not signed. Somebody has asked me to meet him, either on the Budmouth Road at noon today, or in the evening at Mr. Farfrae\u2019s. He says he came to see me some time ago, but a trick was played him, so that he did not see me. I don\u2019t understand it; but between you and me I think Donald is at the bottom of the mystery, and that it is a relation of his who wants to pass an opinion on his choice. But I did not like to go till I had seen you. Shall I go?\u201d Henchard replied heavily, \u201cYes; go.\u201d The question of his remaining in Casterbridge was for ever disposed of by this closing in of Newson on the scene. Henchard was not the man to stand the certainty of condemnation on a matter so near his heart. And being an old hand at bearing anguish in silence, and haughty withal, he resolved to make as light as he could of his intentions, while immediately taking his measures. He surprised the young woman whom he had looked upon as his all in this world by saying to her, as if he did not care about her more: \u201cI am going to leave Casterbridge, Elizabeth-Jane.\u201d \u201cLeave Casterbridge!\u201d she cried, \u201cand leave\u2014me?\u201d \u201cYes, this little shop can be managed by you alone as well as by us both; I don\u2019t care about shops and streets and folk\u2014I would rather get into the country by myself, out of sight, and follow my own ways, and leave you to yours.\u201d She looked down and her tears fell silently.", " Henchard ran to the gate of the field he worked in, and hailed the speaker, who was a stranger. \u201cYes\u2014I\u2019ve come from there, maister,\u201d he said, in answer to Henchard\u2019s inquiry. \u201cI trade up and down, ye know; though, what with this travelling without horses that\u2019s getting so common, my work will soon be done.\u201d \u201cAnything moving in the old place, mid I ask?\u201d \u201cAll the same as usual.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve heard that Mr. Farfrae, the late mayor, is thinking of getting married. Now is that true or not?\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t say for the life o\u2019 me. O no, I should think not.\u201d \u201cBut yes, John\u2014you forget,\u201d said a woman inside the waggon-tilt. \u201cWhat were them packages we carr\u2019d there at the beginning o\u2019 the week? Surely they said a wedding was coming off soon\u2014on Martin\u2019s Day?\u201d The man declared he remembered nothing about it; and the waggon went on jangling over the hill. Henchard was convinced that the woman\u2019s memory served her well. The date was an extremely probable one, there being no reason for delay on either side. He might, for that matter, write and inquire of Elizabeth; but his instinct for sequestration had made the course difficult. Yet before he left her she had said that for him to be absent from her wedding was not as she wished it to be. The remembrance would continually revive in him now that it was not Elizabeth and Farfrae who had driven him away from them, but his own haughty sense that his presence was no longer desired.", " I could not bear it either.\u201d \u201cWell\u2014we must talk of a plan for keeping her in her present belief, and getting matters straight in spite of it. You have heard I am in a large way of business here\u2014that I am Mayor of the town, and churchwarden, and I don\u2019t know what all?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d she murmured. \u201cThese things, as well as the dread of the girl discovering our disgrace, makes it necessary to act with extreme caution. So that I don\u2019t see how you two can return openly to my house as the wife and daughter I once treated badly, and banished from me; and there\u2019s the rub o\u2019t.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll go away at once. I only came to see\u2014\u201d \u201cNo, no, Susan; you are not to go\u2014you mistake me!\u201d he said with kindly severity. \u201cI have thought of this plan: that you and Elizabeth take a cottage in the town as the widow Mrs. Newson and her daughter; that I meet you, court you, and marry you. Elizabeth-Jane coming to my house as my stepdaughter. The thing is so natural and easy that it is half done in thinking o\u2019t. This would leave my shady, headstrong, disgraceful life as a young man absolutely unopened; the secret would be yours and mine only; and I should have the pleasure of seeing my own only child under my roof, as well as my wife.\u201d \u201cI am quite in your hands, Michael,\u201d she said meekly. \u201cI came here for the sake of Elizabeth; for myself, if you tell me to leave again to-morrow morning, and never come near you more, I am content to go.\u201d \u201cNow, now; we don\u2019t want to hear that,\u201d said Henchard gently."]}
