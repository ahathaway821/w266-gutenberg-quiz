O, then, by day Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough To mask thy monstrous visage?

Mark Antony shall say I am not well, And for thy humour, I will stay at home. Enter Decius. Here\u2019s Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so. DECIUS. Caesar, all hail! Good morrow, worthy Caesar. I come to fetch you to the Senate-house. CAESAR. And you are come in very happy time To bear my greeting to the Senators, And tell them that I will not come today. Cannot, is false; and that I dare not, falser: I will not come today. Tell them so, Decius. CALPHURNIA. Say he is sick. CAESAR. Shall Caesar send a lie?

Now as you are a Roman, tell me true. MESSALA. Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell, For certain she is dead, and by strange manner. BRUTUS. Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala. With meditating that she must die once, I have the patience to endure it now. MESSALA. Even so great men great losses should endure. CASSIUS.

I urg\u2019d you further; then you scratch\u2019d your head, And too impatiently stamp\u2019d with your foot; Yet I insisted, yet you answer\u2019d not, But with an angry wafture of your hand Gave sign for me to leave you.", " CASCA. Why, you were with him, were you not? BRUTUS. I should not then ask Casca what had chanc\u2019d. CASCA. Why, there was a crown offer\u2019d him; and being offer\u2019d him, he put it by with the back of his hand, thus; and then the people fell a-shouting. BRUTUS. What was the second noise for? CASCA. Why, for that too. CASSIUS. They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for? CASCA. Why, for that too. BRUTUS. Was the crown offer\u2019d him thrice? CASCA. Ay, marry, was\u2019t, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler than other; and at every putting-by mine honest neighbours shouted. CASSIUS. Who offer\u2019d him the crown? CASCA. Why, Antony. BRUTUS. Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca. CASCA. I can as well be hang\u2019d, as tell the manner of it: it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown; yet \u2019twas not a crown neither, \u2019twas one of these coronets; and, as I told you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it.", " Stoop then, and wash.

If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony May safely come to him, and be resolv\u2019d How Caesar hath deserv\u2019d to lie in death, Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead So well as Brutus living; but will follow The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus Thorough the hazards of this untrod state, With all true faith."], "What does Brutusadmit to Cassius?": [" [_Exeunt Lucilius and Titinius._] BRUTUS.

O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb That carries anger as the flint bears fire, Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark, And straight is cold again. CASSIUS.

A flatterer\u2019s would not, though they do appear As huge as high Olympus. CASSIUS. Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come, Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius, For Cassius is a-weary of the world: Hated by one he loves; brav\u2019d by his brother; Check\u2019d like a bondman; all his faults observ\u2019d, Set in a note-book, learn\u2019d and conn\u2019d by rote, To cast into my teeth.

And then he offered it the third time; he put it the third time by; and still, as he refus\u2019d it, the rabblement hooted, and clapp\u2019d their chopt hands, and threw up their sweaty night-caps, and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refus\u2019d the crown, that it had, almost, choked Caesar, for he swooned, and fell down at it. And for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air. CASSIUS. But, soft! I pray you. What, did Caesar swoon? CASCA. He fell down in the market-place, and foam\u2019d at mouth, and was speechless. BRUTUS. \u2019Tis very like: he hath the falling-sickness. CASSIUS. No, Caesar hath it not; but you, and I, And honest Casca, we have the falling-sickness. CASCA. I know not what you mean by that; but I am sure Caesar fell down.", " CASCA.

BRUTUS. Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca. CASCA. I can as well be hang\u2019d, as tell the manner of it: it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown; yet \u2019twas not a crown neither, \u2019twas one of these coronets; and, as I told you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it.", " If the tag-rag people did not clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and displeased them, as they use to do the players in the theatre, I am no true man.

Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common herd was glad he refused the crown, he pluck\u2019d me ope his doublet, and offer\u2019d them his throat to cut. And I had been a man of any occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so he fell. When he came to himself again, he said, if he had done or said anything amiss, he desir\u2019d their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three or four wenches where I stood cried, \u201cAlas, good soul!\u201d and forgave him with all their hearts. But there\u2019s no heed to be taken of them: if Caesar had stabb\u2019d their mothers, they would have done no less. BRUTUS. And, after that, he came thus sad away?", " CASCA. Ay. CASSIUS.

But those that understood him smil\u2019d at one another and shook their heads; but for mine own part, it was Greek to me.

She dreamt tonight she saw my statue, Which like a fountain with an hundred spouts Did run pure blood; and many lusty Romans Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it. And these does she apply for warnings and portents And evils imminent; and on her knee Hath begg\u2019d that I will stay at home today. DECIUS. This dream is all amiss interpreted: It was a vision fair and fortunate.
