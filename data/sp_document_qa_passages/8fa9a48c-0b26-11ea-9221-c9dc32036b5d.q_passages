{"Who is Orsinoin love with at the beginning of the play?": [" Farewell. [_Exit Clown._] DUKE. Let all the rest give place. [_Exeunt Curio and Attendants._] Once more, Cesario, Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty. Tell her my love, more noble than the world, Prizes not quantity of dirty lands; The parts that fortune hath bestow\u2019d upon her, Tell her I hold as giddily as fortune; But \u2019tis that miracle and queen of gems That nature pranks her in attracts my soul. VIOLA. But if she cannot love you, sir? DUKE. I cannot be so answer\u2019d. VIOLA. Sooth, but you must. Say that some lady, as perhaps there is, Hath for your love as great a pang of heart As you have for Olivia: you cannot love her; You tell her so. Must she not then be answer\u2019d? DUKE. There is no woman\u2019s sides Can bide the beating of so strong a passion As love doth give my heart: no woman\u2019s heart So big, to hold so much; they lack retention. Alas, their love may be called appetite, No motion of the liver, but the palate, That suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt; But mine is all as hungry as the sea, And can digest as much. Make no compare Between that love a woman can bear me And that I owe Olivia. VIOLA. Ay, but I know\u2014 DUKE. What dost thou know? VIOLA. Too well what love women to men may owe. In faith, they are as true of heart as we. My father had a daughter loved a man, As it might be perhaps, were I a woman, I should your lordship. DUKE. And what\u2019s her history? VIOLA. A blank, my lord.", " It shall be inventoried and every particle and utensil labelled to my will: as, item, two lips indifferent red; item, two grey eyes with lids to them; item, one neck, one chin, and so forth. Were you sent hither to praise me? VIOLA. I see you what you are, you are too proud; But, if you were the devil, you are fair. My lord and master loves you. O, such love Could be but recompens\u2019d though you were crown\u2019d The nonpareil of beauty! OLIVIA. How does he love me? VIOLA. With adorations, fertile tears, With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire. OLIVIA. Your lord does know my mind, I cannot love him: Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble, Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth; In voices well divulg\u2019d, free, learn\u2019d, and valiant, And in dimension and the shape of nature, A gracious person. But yet I cannot love him. He might have took his answer long ago. VIOLA. If I did love you in my master\u2019s flame, With such a suff\u2019ring, such a deadly life, In your denial I would find no sense, I would not understand it. OLIVIA. Why, what would you? VIOLA. Make me a willow cabin at your gate, And call upon my soul within the house; Write loyal cantons of contemned love, And sing them loud even in the dead of night; Hallow your name to the reverberate hills, And make the babbling gossip of the air Cry out Olivia! O, you should not rest Between the elements of air and earth, But you should pity me.", " She never told her love, But let concealment, like a worm i\u2019 th\u2019 bud, Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought, And with a green and yellow melancholy She sat like patience on a monument, Smiling at grief. Was not this love, indeed? We men may say more, swear more, but indeed, Our shows are more than will; for still we prove Much in our vows, but little in our love. DUKE. But died thy sister of her love, my boy? VIOLA. I am all the daughters of my father\u2019s house, And all the brothers too: and yet I know not. Sir, shall I to this lady? DUKE. Ay, that\u2019s the theme. To her in haste. Give her this jewel; say My love can give no place, bide no denay. [_Exeunt._] SCENE V. Olivia\u2019s garden. Enter Sir Toby, Sir Andrew and Fabian. SIR TOBY. Come thy ways, Signior Fabian. FABIAN. Nay, I\u2019ll come. If I lose a scruple of this sport, let me be boiled to death with melancholy. SIR TOBY. Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame? FABIAN. I would exult, man. You know he brought me out o\u2019 favour with my lady about a bear-baiting here. SIR TOBY. To anger him we\u2019ll have the bear again, and we will fool him black and blue, shall we not, Sir Andrew? SIR ANDREW. And we do not, it is pity of our lives. Enter Maria. SIR TOBY. Here comes the little villain. How now, my metal of India? MARIA. Get ye all three into the box-tree. Malvolio\u2019s coming down this walk; he has been yonder i\u2019 the sun practising behaviour to his own shadow this half hour: observe him, for the love of mockery; for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him.", " OLIVIA. O what a deal of scorn looks beautiful In the contempt and anger of his lip! A murd\u2019rous guilt shows not itself more soon Than love that would seem hid. Love\u2019s night is noon. Cesario, by the roses of the spring, By maidhood, honour, truth, and everything, I love thee so, that maugre all thy pride, Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide. Do not extort thy reasons from this clause, For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause; But rather reason thus with reason fetter: Love sought is good, but given unsought is better. VIOLA. By innocence I swear, and by my youth, I have one heart, one bosom, and one truth, And that no woman has; nor never none Shall mistress be of it, save I alone. And so adieu, good madam; never more Will I my master\u2019s tears to you deplore. OLIVIA. Yet come again: for thou perhaps mayst move That heart, which now abhors, to like his love. [_Exeunt._] SCENE II. A Room in Olivia\u2019s House. Enter Sir Toby, Sir Andrew and Fabian. SIR ANDREW. No, faith, I\u2019ll not stay a jot longer. SIR TOBY. Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason. FABIAN. You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew. SIR ANDREW. Marry, I saw your niece do more favours to the Count\u2019s servingman than ever she bestowed upon me; I saw\u2019t i\u2019 th\u2019 orchard. SIR TOBY. Did she see thee the while, old boy? Tell me that. SIR ANDREW. As plain as I see you now. FABIAN. This was a great argument of love in her toward you."], "Complete the quote:\"If music be the food of _____, play on.\"": [" ACT I. SCENE I. An Apartment in the Duke\u2019s Palace. Enter Orsino, Duke of Illyria, Curio, and other Lords; Musicians attending. DUKE. If music be the food of love, play on, Give me excess of it; that, surfeiting, The appetite may sicken and so die. That strain again, it had a dying fall; O, it came o\u2019er my ear like the sweet sound That breathes upon a bank of violets, Stealing and giving odour. Enough; no more; \u2019Tis not so sweet now as it was before. O spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou, That notwithstanding thy capacity Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there, Of what validity and pitch soever, But falls into abatement and low price Even in a minute! So full of shapes is fancy, That it alone is high fantastical. CURIO. Will you go hunt, my lord? DUKE. What, Curio? CURIO. The hart. DUKE. Why so I do, the noblest that I have. O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first, Methought she purg\u2019d the air of pestilence; That instant was I turn\u2019d into a hart, And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds, E\u2019er since pursue me. How now? what news from her? Enter Valentine. VALENTINE. So please my lord, I might not be admitted, But from her handmaid do return this answer: The element itself, till seven years\u2019 heat, Shall not behold her face at ample view; But like a cloistress she will veiled walk, And water once a day her chamber round With eye-offending brine: all this to season A brother\u2019s dead love, which she would keep fresh And lasting in her sad remembrance.", " Come, but one verse. CURIO. He is not here, so please your lordship, that should sing it. DUKE. Who was it? CURIO. Feste, the jester, my lord, a fool that the Lady Olivia\u2019s father took much delight in. He is about the house. DUKE. Seek him out, and play the tune the while. [_Exit Curio. Music plays._] Come hither, boy. If ever thou shalt love, In the sweet pangs of it remember me: For such as I am, all true lovers are, Unstaid and skittish in all motions else, Save in the constant image of the creature That is belov\u2019d. How dost thou like this tune? VIOLA. It gives a very echo to the seat Where love is throned. DUKE. Thou dost speak masterly. My life upon\u2019t, young though thou art, thine eye Hath stayed upon some favour that it loves. Hath it not, boy? VIOLA. A little, by your favour. DUKE. What kind of woman is\u2019t? VIOLA. Of your complexion. DUKE. She is not worth thee, then. What years, i\u2019 faith? VIOLA. About your years, my lord. DUKE. Too old, by heaven! Let still the woman take An elder than herself; so wears she to him, So sways she level in her husband\u2019s heart. For, boy, however we do praise ourselves, Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm, More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn, Than women\u2019s are. VIOLA. I think it well, my lord. DUKE. Then let thy love be younger than thyself, Or thy affection cannot hold the bent: For women are as roses, whose fair flower Being once display\u2019d, doth fall that very hour.", " VIOLA. Yes, being kept together, and put to use. CLOWN. I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring a Cressida to this Troilus. VIOLA. I understand you, sir; \u2019tis well begged. CLOWN. The matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but a beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is within, sir. I will conster to them whence you come; who you are and what you would are out of my welkin. I might say \u201celement\u201d, but the word is overworn. [_Exit._] VIOLA. This fellow is wise enough to play the fool, And to do that well, craves a kind of wit: He must observe their mood on whom he jests, The quality of persons, and the time, And like the haggard, check at every feather That comes before his eye. This is a practice As full of labour as a wise man\u2019s art: For folly, that he wisely shows, is fit; But wise men, folly-fall\u2019n, quite taint their wit. Enter Sir Toby and Sir Andrew. SIR TOBY. Save you, gentleman. VIOLA. And you, sir. SIR ANDREW. _Dieu vous garde, monsieur._ VIOLA. _Et vous aussi; votre serviteur._ SIR ANDREW. I hope, sir, you are, and I am yours. SIR TOBY. Will you encounter the house? My niece is desirous you should enter, if your trade be to her. VIOLA. I am bound to your niece, sir, I mean, she is the list of my voyage. SIR TOBY. Taste your legs, sir, put them to motion. VIOLA. My legs do better understand me, sir, than I understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs.", " OLIVIA. Whence came you, sir? VIOLA. I can say little more than I have studied, and that question\u2019s out of my part. Good gentle one, give me modest assurance, if you be the lady of the house, that I may proceed in my speech. OLIVIA. Are you a comedian? VIOLA. No, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangs of malice I swear, I am not that I play. Are you the lady of the house? OLIVIA. If I do not usurp myself, I am. VIOLA. Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself; for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve. But this is from my commission. I will on with my speech in your praise, and then show you the heart of my message. OLIVIA. Come to what is important in\u2019t: I forgive you the praise. VIOLA. Alas, I took great pains to study it, and \u2019tis poetical. OLIVIA. It is the more like to be feigned; I pray you keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates; and allowed your approach, rather to wonder at you than to hear you. If you be mad, be gone; if you have reason, be brief: \u2019tis not that time of moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue. MARIA. Will you hoist sail, sir? Here lies your way. VIOLA. No, good swabber, I am to hull here a little longer. Some mollification for your giant, sweet lady. Tell me your mind. I am a messenger. OLIVIA.

If that this simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not, what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but calamity, so beauty\u2019s a flower. The lady bade take away the fool, therefore, I say again, take her away. OLIVIA. Sir, I bade them take away you. CLOWN. Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, _cucullus non facit monachum:_ that\u2019s as much to say, I wear not motley in my brain. Good madonna, give me leave to prove you a fool. OLIVIA. Can you do it? CLOWN. Dexteriously, good madonna. OLIVIA. Make your proof. CLOWN. I must catechize you for it, madonna. Good my mouse of virtue, answer me. OLIVIA. Well sir, for want of other idleness, I\u2019ll \u2019bide your proof. CLOWN. Good madonna, why mourn\u2019st thou? OLIVIA. Good fool, for my brother\u2019s death. CLOWN. I think his soul is in hell, madonna. OLIVIA. I know his soul is in heaven, fool. CLOWN. The more fool you, madonna, to mourn for your brother\u2019s soul being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen. OLIVIA. What think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend? MALVOLIO. Yes; and shall do, till the pangs of death shake him. Infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the better fool. CLOWN. God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the better increasing your folly!

Today, my lord; and for three months before, No int\u2019rim, not a minute\u2019s vacancy, Both day and night did we keep company. Enter Olivia and Attendants. DUKE. Here comes the Countess, now heaven walks on earth. But for thee, fellow, fellow, thy words are madness. Three months this youth hath tended upon me; But more of that anon. Take him aside. OLIVIA.

What do you say, Cesario? Good my lord\u2014 VIOLA. My lord would speak, my duty hushes me. OLIVIA. If it be aught to the old tune, my lord, It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear As howling after music. DUKE. Still so cruel? OLIVIA. Still so constant, lord. DUKE. What, to perverseness?

Even what it please my lord that shall become him. DUKE. Why should I not, had I the heart to do it, Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death, Kill what I love?\u2014a savage jealousy That sometime savours nobly.

How say you to that, Malvolio? MALVOLIO. I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal; I saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool, that has no more brain than a stone. Look you now, he\u2019s out of his guard already; unless you laugh and minister occasion to him, he is gagged. I protest I take these wise men, that crow so at these set kind of fools, no better than the fools\u2019 zanies. OLIVIA. O, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste with a distempered appetite. To be generous, guiltless, and of free disposition, is to take those things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon bullets. There is no slander in an allowed fool, though he do nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet man, though he do nothing but reprove. CLOWN.

Now will not I deliver his letter, for the behaviour of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good capacity and breeding; his employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less. Therefore this letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no terror in the youth. He will find it comes from a clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth, set upon Aguecheek notable report of valour, and drive the gentleman (as I know his youth will aptly receive it) into a most hideous opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and impetuosity.

Orsino, noble sir, Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me: Antonio never yet was thief or pirate, Though, I confess, on base and ground enough, Orsino\u2019s enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither: That most ingrateful boy there by your side From the rude sea\u2019s enraged and foamy mouth Did I redeem; a wreck past hope he was. His life I gave him, and did thereto add My love, without retention or restraint, All his in dedication. For his sake Did I expose myself, pure for his love, Into the danger of this adverse town; Drew to defend him when he was beset; Where being apprehended, his false cunning (Not meaning to partake with me in danger) Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance, And grew a twenty years\u2019 removed thing While one would wink; denied me mine own purse, Which I had recommended to his use Not half an hour before.", " VIOLA.

There is a fair behaviour in thee, Captain; And though that nature with a beauteous wall Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee I will believe thou hast a mind that suits With this thy fair and outward character.

Faith, I can cut a caper. SIR TOBY. And I can cut the mutton to\u2019t. SIR ANDREW. And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as any man in Illyria. SIR TOBY. Wherefore are these things hid? Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before \u2019em? Are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall\u2019s picture? Why dost thou not go to church in a galliard, and come home in a coranto?

I pray you, bring your hand to th\u2019 buttery bar and let it drink. SIR ANDREW. Wherefore, sweetheart? What\u2019s your metaphor? MARIA. It\u2019s dry, sir. SIR ANDREW. Why, I think so; I am not such an ass but I can keep my hand dry. But what\u2019s your jest? MARIA. A dry jest, sir. SIR ANDREW. Are you full of them? MARIA. Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers\u2019 ends: marry, now I let go your hand, I am barren. [_Exit Maria._] SIR TOBY. O knight, thou lack\u2019st a cup of canary: When did I see thee so put down? SIR ANDREW. Never in your life, I think, unless you see canary put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has; but I am a great eater of beef, and I believe that does harm to my wit. SIR TOBY. No question. SIR ANDREW. And I thought that, I\u2019d forswear it. I\u2019ll ride home tomorrow, Sir Toby. SIR TOBY. _Pourquoy_, my dear knight? SIR ANDREW. What is _pourquoy?_ Do, or not do? I would I had bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in fencing, dancing, and bear-baiting. O, had I but followed the arts! SIR TOBY. Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair. SIR ANDREW. Why, would that have mended my hair?", " PRIEST.

SIR ANDREW. \u2019Has broke my head across, and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too. For the love of God, your help! I had rather than forty pound I were at home. OLIVIA. Who has done this, Sir Andrew? SIR ANDREW. The Count\u2019s gentleman, one Cesario. We took him for a coward, but he\u2019s the very devil incardinate. DUKE. My gentleman, Cesario? SIR ANDREW. \u2019Od\u2019s lifelings, here he is!\u2014You broke my head for nothing; and that that I did, I was set on to do\u2019t by Sir Toby. VIOLA. Why do you speak to me?

Sad, lady? I could be sad: this does make some obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering. But what of that? If it please the eye of one, it is with me as the very true sonnet is: \u2018Please one and please all.\u2019 OLIVIA. Why, how dost thou, man? What is the matter with thee? MALVOLIO. Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It did come to his hands, and commands shall be executed. I think we do know the sweet Roman hand. OLIVIA. Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio? MALVOLIO. To bed? Ay, sweetheart, and I\u2019ll come to thee. OLIVIA. God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so, and kiss thy hand so oft? MARIA. How do you, Malvolio? MALVOLIO. At your request?

Good Mistress Mary Accost,\u2014 SIR TOBY. You mistake, knight: accost is front her, board her, woo her, assail her. SIR ANDREW. By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company.

What, for being a Puritan? Thy exquisite reason, dear knight? SIR ANDREW. I have no exquisite reason for\u2019t, but I have reason good enough. MARIA. The devil a Puritan that he is, or anything constantly but a time-pleaser, an affectioned ass that cons state without book and utters it by great swarths; the best persuaded of himself, so crammed (as he thinks) with excellencies, that it is his grounds of faith that all that look on him love him. And on that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause to work. SIR TOBY. What wilt thou do? MARIA. I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love, wherein by the colour of his beard, the shape of his leg, the manner of his gait, the expressure of his eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall find himself most feelingly personated.

There is no woman\u2019s sides Can bide the beating of so strong a passion As love doth give my heart: no woman\u2019s heart So big, to hold so much; they lack retention. Alas, their love may be called appetite, No motion of the liver, but the palate, That suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt; But mine is all as hungry as the sea, And can digest as much. Make no compare Between that love a woman can bear me And that I owe Olivia. VIOLA. Ay, but I know\u2014 DUKE. What dost thou know? VIOLA. Too well what love women to men may owe.

Of charity, what kin are you to me? What countryman? What name? What parentage? VIOLA. Of Messaline: Sebastian was my father; Such a Sebastian was my brother too: So went he suited to his watery tomb. If spirits can assume both form and suit, You come to fright us. SEBASTIAN.

Were you a woman, as the rest goes even, I should my tears let fall upon your cheek, And say, \u2018Thrice welcome, drowned Viola.\u2019 VIOLA. My father had a mole upon his brow. SEBASTIAN.

It were a bad recompense for your love, to lay any of them on you. ANTONIO. Let me know of you whither you are bound. SEBASTIAN. No, sooth, sir; my determinate voyage is mere extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty, that you will not extort from me what I am willing to keep in. Therefore it charges me in manners the rather to express myself. You must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian, which I called Roderigo; my father was that Sebastian of Messaline whom I know you have heard of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both born in an hour. If the heavens had been pleased, would we had so ended! But you, sir, altered that, for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned. ANTONIO. Alas the day! SEBASTIAN.

Belike you slew great number of his people. ANTONIO. Th\u2019 offence is not of such a bloody nature, Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel Might well have given us bloody argument. It might have since been answered in repaying What we took from them, which for traffic\u2019s sake, Most of our city did. Only myself stood out, For which, if I be lapsed in this place, I shall pay dear. SEBASTIAN. Do not then walk too open. ANTONIO. It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here\u2019s my purse. In the south suburbs, at the Elephant, Is best to lodge. I will bespeak our diet Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge With viewing of the town. There shall you have me. SEBASTIAN. Why I your purse? ANTONIO. Haply your eye shall light upon some toy You have desire to purchase; and your store, I think, is not for idle markets, sir. SEBASTIAN.

Sad, lady? I could be sad: this does make some obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering. But what of that? If it please the eye of one, it is with me as the very true sonnet is: \u2018Please one and please all.\u2019 OLIVIA. Why, how dost thou, man? What is the matter with thee? MALVOLIO. Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It did come to his hands, and commands shall be executed. I think we do know the sweet Roman hand. OLIVIA. Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio? MALVOLIO.

This concurs directly with the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may appear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that in the letter. \u2018Cast thy humble slough,\u2019 says she; \u2018be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants, let thy tongue tang with arguments of state, put thyself into the trick of singularity,\u2019 and consequently, sets down the manner how: as, a sad face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the habit of some sir of note, and so forth.", " He\u2019s fortified against any denial.

Why, of mankind. OLIVIA. What manner of man? MALVOLIO. Of very ill manner; he\u2019ll speak with you, will you or no. OLIVIA. Of what personage and years is he? MALVOLIO. Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy; as a squash is before \u2019tis a peascod, or a codling, when \u2019tis almost an apple. \u2019Tis with him in standing water, between boy and man. He is very well-favoured, and he speaks very shrewishly. One would think his mother\u2019s milk were scarce out of him. OLIVIA. Let him approach. Call in my gentlewoman. MALVOLIO.

Tell me why? OLIVIA. Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing, Though I confess, much like the character: But out of question, \u2019tis Maria\u2019s hand. And now I do bethink me, it was she First told me thou wast mad; then cam\u2019st in smiling, And in such forms which here were presuppos\u2019d Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content.

Come on, sir, hold! SIR ANDREW. Nay, let him alone, I\u2019ll go another way to work with him. I\u2019ll have an action of battery against him, if there be any law in Illyria. Though I struck him first, yet it\u2019s no matter for that. SEBASTIAN. Let go thy hand! SIR TOBY. Come, sir, I will not let you go. Come, my young soldier, put up your iron: you are well fleshed. Come on. SEBASTIAN. I will be free from thee. What wouldst thou now? If thou dar\u2019st tempt me further, draw thy sword. [_Draws._] SIR TOBY. What, what? Nay, then, I must have an ounce or two of this malapert blood from you. [_Draws._] Enter Olivia. OLIVIA. Hold, Toby! On thy life I charge thee hold! SIR TOBY. Madam. OLIVIA. Will it be ever thus? Ungracious wretch, Fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves, Where manners ne\u2019er were preach\u2019d! Out of my sight! Be not offended, dear Cesario. Rudesby, be gone! [_Exeunt Sir Toby, Sir Andrew and Fabian._] I prithee, gentle friend, Let thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway In this uncivil and unjust extent Against thy peace.", " I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade me; for every reason excites to this, that my lady loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of late, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered, and in this she manifests herself to my love, and with a kind of injunction, drives me to these habits of her liking. I thank my stars, I am happy. I will be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of putting on. Jove and my stars be praised!\u2014Here is yet a postscript. [_Reads._] _Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thou entertain\u2019st my love, let it appear in thy smiling; thy smiles become thee well. Therefore in my presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee._ Jove, I thank thee. I will smile, I will do everything that thou wilt have me. [_Exit._] FABIAN. I will not give my part of this sport for a pension of thousands to be paid from the Sophy. SIR TOBY. I could marry this wench for this device. SIR ANDREW. So could I too. SIR TOBY. And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest. Enter Maria. SIR ANDREW. Nor I neither. FABIAN. Here comes my noble gull-catcher. SIR TOBY. Wilt thou set thy foot o\u2019 my neck? SIR ANDREW. Or o\u2019 mine either? SIR TOBY. Shall I play my freedom at tray-trip, and become thy bond-slave? SIR ANDREW. I\u2019 faith, or I either? SIR TOBY. Why, thou hast put him in such a dream, that when the image of it leaves him he must run mad.", " VIOLA. Yes, being kept together, and put to use. CLOWN. I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring a Cressida to this Troilus. VIOLA. I understand you, sir; \u2019tis well begged. CLOWN. The matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but a beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is within, sir. I will conster to them whence you come; who you are and what you would are out of my welkin. I might say \u201celement\u201d, but the word is overworn. [_Exit._] VIOLA. This fellow is wise enough to play the fool, And to do that well, craves a kind of wit: He must observe their mood on whom he jests, The quality of persons, and the time, And like the haggard, check at every feather That comes before his eye. This is a practice As full of labour as a wise man\u2019s art: For folly, that he wisely shows, is fit; But wise men, folly-fall\u2019n, quite taint their wit. Enter Sir Toby and Sir Andrew. SIR TOBY. Save you, gentleman. VIOLA. And you, sir. SIR ANDREW. _Dieu vous garde, monsieur._ VIOLA. _Et vous aussi; votre serviteur._ SIR ANDREW. I hope, sir, you are, and I am yours. SIR TOBY. Will you encounter the house? My niece is desirous you should enter, if your trade be to her. VIOLA. I am bound to your niece, sir, I mean, she is the list of my voyage. SIR TOBY. Taste your legs, sir, put them to motion. VIOLA. My legs do better understand me, sir, than I understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs."], "Why does Viola disguise herself as a man?": [" VIOLA. Who governs here? CAPTAIN. A noble duke, in nature as in name. VIOLA. What is his name? CAPTAIN. Orsino. VIOLA. Orsino! I have heard my father name him. He was a bachelor then. CAPTAIN. And so is now, or was so very late; For but a month ago I went from hence, And then \u2019twas fresh in murmur, (as, you know, What great ones do, the less will prattle of) That he did seek the love of fair Olivia. VIOLA. What\u2019s she? CAPTAIN. A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count That died some twelvemonth since; then leaving her In the protection of his son, her brother, Who shortly also died; for whose dear love They say, she hath abjur\u2019d the company And sight of men. VIOLA. O that I served that lady, And might not be delivered to the world, Till I had made mine own occasion mellow, What my estate is. CAPTAIN. That were hard to compass, Because she will admit no kind of suit, No, not the Duke\u2019s. VIOLA. There is a fair behaviour in thee, Captain; And though that nature with a beauteous wall Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee I will believe thou hast a mind that suits With this thy fair and outward character. I pray thee, and I\u2019ll pay thee bounteously, Conceal me what I am, and be my aid For such disguise as haply shall become The form of my intent. I\u2019ll serve this duke; Thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him. It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing, And speak to him in many sorts of music, That will allow me very worth his service.", " And one thing more, that you be never so hardy to come again in his affairs, unless it be to report your lord\u2019s taking of this. Receive it so. VIOLA. She took the ring of me: I\u2019ll none of it. MALVOLIO. Come sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and her will is it should be so returned. If it be worth stooping for, there it lies in your eye; if not, be it his that finds it. [_Exit._] VIOLA. I left no ring with her; what means this lady? Fortune forbid my outside have not charm\u2019d her! She made good view of me, indeed, so much, That methought her eyes had lost her tongue, For she did speak in starts distractedly. She loves me, sure, the cunning of her passion Invites me in this churlish messenger. None of my lord\u2019s ring? Why, he sent her none. I am the man; if it be so, as \u2019tis, Poor lady, she were better love a dream. Disguise, I see thou art a wickedness Wherein the pregnant enemy does much. How easy is it for the proper false In women\u2019s waxen hearts to set their forms! Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we, For such as we are made of, such we be. How will this fadge? My master loves her dearly, And I, poor monster, fond as much on him, And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me. What will become of this? As I am man, My state is desperate for my master\u2019s love; As I am woman (now alas the day!) What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe! O time, thou must untangle this, not I, It is too hard a knot for me t\u2019untie!", " VIOLA. With the same \u2019haviour that your passion bears Goes on my master\u2019s griefs. OLIVIA. Here, wear this jewel for me, \u2019tis my picture. Refuse it not, it hath no tongue to vex you. And I beseech you come again tomorrow. What shall you ask of me that I\u2019ll deny, That honour sav\u2019d, may upon asking give? VIOLA. Nothing but this, your true love for my master. OLIVIA. How with mine honour may I give him that Which I have given to you? VIOLA. I will acquit you. OLIVIA. Well, come again tomorrow. Fare thee well; A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell. [_Exit._] Enter Sir Toby and Fabian. SIR TOBY. Gentleman, God save thee. VIOLA. And you, sir. SIR TOBY. That defence thou hast, betake thee to\u2019t. Of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know not, but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as the hunter, attends thee at the orchard end. Dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for thy assailant is quick, skilful, and deadly. VIOLA. You mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrel to me. My remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offence done to any man. SIR TOBY. You\u2019ll find it otherwise, I assure you. Therefore, if you hold your life at any price, betake you to your guard, for your opposite hath in him what youth, strength, skill, and wrath, can furnish man withal. VIOLA. I pray you, sir, what is he? SIR TOBY. He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier, and on carpet consideration, but he is a devil in private brawl.", " So did I abuse Myself, my servant, and, I fear me, you. Under your hard construction must I sit; To force that on you in a shameful cunning, Which you knew none of yours. What might you think? Have you not set mine honour at the stake, And baited it with all th\u2019 unmuzzled thoughts That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving Enough is shown. A cypress, not a bosom, Hides my heart: so let me hear you speak. VIOLA. I pity you. OLIVIA. That\u2019s a degree to love. VIOLA. No, not a grize; for \u2019tis a vulgar proof That very oft we pity enemies. OLIVIA. Why then methinks \u2019tis time to smile again. O world, how apt the poor are to be proud! If one should be a prey, how much the better To fall before the lion than the wolf! [_Clock strikes._] The clock upbraids me with the waste of time. Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you. And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest, Your wife is like to reap a proper man. There lies your way, due west. VIOLA. Then westward ho! Grace and good disposition attend your ladyship! You\u2019ll nothing, madam, to my lord by me? OLIVIA. Stay: I prithee tell me what thou think\u2019st of me. VIOLA. That you do think you are not what you are. OLIVIA. If I think so, I think the same of you. VIOLA. Then think you right; I am not what I am. OLIVIA. I would you were as I would have you be. VIOLA. Would it be better, madam, than I am? I wish it might, for now I am your fool."], "Who is trying to court Olivia at the beginning of the play?": [" But though I could not with such estimable wonder overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly publish her, she bore a mind that envy could not but call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more. ANTONIO. Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment. SEBASTIAN. O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble. ANTONIO. If you will not murder me for my love, let me be your servant. SEBASTIAN. If you will not undo what you have done, that is, kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not. Fare ye well at once; my bosom is full of kindness, and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, that upon the least occasion more, mine eyes will tell tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino\u2019s court: farewell. [_Exit._] ANTONIO. The gentleness of all the gods go with thee! I have many enemies in Orsino\u2019s court, Else would I very shortly see thee there: But come what may, I do adore thee so, That danger shall seem sport, and I will go. [_Exit._] SCENE II. A street. Enter Viola; Malvolio at several doors. MALVOLIO. Were you not even now with the Countess Olivia? VIOLA. Even now, sir; on a moderate pace I have since arrived but hither. MALVOLIO. She returns this ring to you, sir; you might have saved me my pains, to have taken it away yourself. She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord into a desperate assurance she will none of him.", " OLIVIA. Whence came you, sir? VIOLA. I can say little more than I have studied, and that question\u2019s out of my part. Good gentle one, give me modest assurance, if you be the lady of the house, that I may proceed in my speech. OLIVIA. Are you a comedian? VIOLA. No, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangs of malice I swear, I am not that I play. Are you the lady of the house? OLIVIA. If I do not usurp myself, I am. VIOLA. Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself; for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve. But this is from my commission. I will on with my speech in your praise, and then show you the heart of my message. OLIVIA. Come to what is important in\u2019t: I forgive you the praise. VIOLA. Alas, I took great pains to study it, and \u2019tis poetical. OLIVIA. It is the more like to be feigned; I pray you keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates; and allowed your approach, rather to wonder at you than to hear you. If you be mad, be gone; if you have reason, be brief: \u2019tis not that time of moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue. MARIA. Will you hoist sail, sir? Here lies your way. VIOLA. No, good swabber, I am to hull here a little longer. Some mollification for your giant, sweet lady. Tell me your mind. I am a messenger. OLIVIA.

And on that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause to work. SIR TOBY. What wilt thou do? MARIA. I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love, wherein by the colour of his beard, the shape of his leg, the manner of his gait, the expressure of his eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall find himself most feelingly personated.

Enough; no more; \u2019Tis not so sweet now as it was before. O spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou, That notwithstanding thy capacity Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there, Of what validity and pitch soever, But falls into abatement and low price Even in a minute! So full of shapes is fancy, That it alone is high fantastical. CURIO. Will you go hunt, my lord? DUKE. What, Curio? CURIO. The hart. DUKE. Why so I do, the noblest that I have. O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first, Methought she purg\u2019d the air of pestilence; That instant was I turn\u2019d into a hart, And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds, E\u2019er since pursue me. How now? what news from her? Enter Valentine. VALENTINE. So please my lord, I might not be admitted, But from her handmaid do return this answer: The element itself, till seven years\u2019 heat, Shall not behold her face at ample view; But like a cloistress she will veiled walk, And water once a day her chamber round With eye-offending brine: all this to season A brother\u2019s dead love, which she would keep fresh And lasting in her sad remembrance.", " And one thing more, that you be never so hardy to come again in his affairs, unless it be to report your lord\u2019s taking of this.

Fortune forbid my outside have not charm\u2019d her! She made good view of me, indeed, so much, That methought her eyes had lost her tongue, For she did speak in starts distractedly. She loves me, sure, the cunning of her passion Invites me in this churlish messenger. None of my lord\u2019s ring? Why, he sent her none.

My master loves her dearly, And I, poor monster, fond as much on him, And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me. What will become of this? As I am man, My state is desperate for my master\u2019s love; As I am woman (now alas the day!) What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!

There is no woman\u2019s sides Can bide the beating of so strong a passion As love doth give my heart: no woman\u2019s heart So big, to hold so much; they lack retention. Alas, their love may be called appetite, No motion of the liver, but the palate, That suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt; But mine is all as hungry as the sea, And can digest as much. Make no compare Between that love a woman can bear me And that I owe Olivia. VIOLA. Ay, but I know\u2014 DUKE. What dost thou know? VIOLA. Too well what love women to men may owe.

O, such love Could be but recompens\u2019d though you were crown\u2019d The nonpareil of beauty! OLIVIA. How does he love me? VIOLA. With adorations, fertile tears, With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire. OLIVIA. Your lord does know my mind, I cannot love him: Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble, Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth; In voices well divulg\u2019d, free, learn\u2019d, and valiant, And in dimension and the shape of nature, A gracious person. But yet I cannot love him. He might have took his answer long ago. VIOLA. If I did love you in my master\u2019s flame, With such a suff\u2019ring, such a deadly life, In your denial I would find no sense, I would not understand it. OLIVIA. Why, what would you? VIOLA. Make me a willow cabin at your gate, And call upon my soul within the house; Write loyal cantons of contemned love, And sing them loud even in the dead of night; Hallow your name to the reverberate hills, And make the babbling gossip of the air Cry out Olivia!

Let still the woman take An elder than herself; so wears she to him, So sways she level in her husband\u2019s heart. For, boy, however we do praise ourselves, Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm, More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn, Than women\u2019s are. VIOLA. I think it well, my lord. DUKE.

It might have since been answered in repaying What we took from them, which for traffic\u2019s sake, Most of our city did. Only myself stood out, For which, if I be lapsed in this place, I shall pay dear. SEBASTIAN. Do not then walk too open. ANTONIO. It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here\u2019s my purse. In the south suburbs, at the Elephant, Is best to lodge. I will bespeak our diet Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge With viewing of the town. There shall you have me. SEBASTIAN. Why I your purse? ANTONIO. Haply your eye shall light upon some toy You have desire to purchase; and your store, I think, is not for idle markets, sir. SEBASTIAN. I\u2019ll be your purse-bearer, and leave you for an hour. ANTONIO. To th\u2019 Elephant. SEBASTIAN. I do remember. [_Exeunt._] SCENE IV. Olivia\u2019s garden. Enter Olivia and Maria. OLIVIA.

These clothes are good enough to drink in, and so be these boots too; and they be not, let them hang themselves in their own straps. MARIA.

OLIVIA. Are you a comedian? VIOLA. No, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangs of malice I swear, I am not that I play. Are you the lady of the house? OLIVIA. If I do not usurp myself, I am.

I will on with my speech in your praise, and then show you the heart of my message. OLIVIA. Come to what is important in\u2019t: I forgive you the praise. VIOLA. Alas, I took great pains to study it, and \u2019tis poetical. OLIVIA. It is the more like to be feigned; I pray you keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates; and allowed your approach, rather to wonder at you than to hear you. If you be mad, be gone; if you have reason, be brief: \u2019tis not that time of moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue. MARIA. Will you hoist sail, sir? Here lies your way. VIOLA. No, good swabber, I am to hull here a little longer. Some mollification for your giant, sweet lady. Tell me your mind. I am a messenger. OLIVIA.

No, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness. MALVOLIO. Go, hang yourselves all! You are idle, shallow things. I am not of your element. You shall know more hereafter. [_Exit._] SIR TOBY. Is\u2019t possible? FABIAN. If this were played upon a stage now, I could condemn it as an improbable fiction. SIR TOBY. His very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man. MARIA. Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint. FABIAN. Why, we shall make him mad indeed. MARIA. The house will be the quieter. SIR TOBY. Come, we\u2019ll have him in a dark room and bound. My niece is already in the belief that he\u2019s mad.

Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts On his behalf. OLIVIA. O, by your leave, I pray you. I bade you never speak again of him. But would you undertake another suit, I had rather hear you to solicit that Than music from the spheres. VIOLA. Dear lady\u2014 OLIVIA. Give me leave, beseech you.

The lady bade take away the fool, therefore, I say again, take her away. OLIVIA. Sir, I bade them take away you. CLOWN. Misprision in the highest degree!

Take away the fool, gentlemen. OLIVIA. What think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend? MALVOLIO. Yes; and shall do, till the pangs of death shake him. Infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the better fool. CLOWN. God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the better increasing your folly!

What is his name? CAPTAIN. Orsino. VIOLA. Orsino! I have heard my father name him. He was a bachelor then. CAPTAIN. And so is now, or was so very late; For but a month ago I went from hence, And then \u2019twas fresh in murmur, (as, you know, What great ones do, the less will prattle of) That he did seek the love of fair Olivia. VIOLA. What\u2019s she? CAPTAIN. A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count That died some twelvemonth since; then leaving her In the protection of his son, her brother, Who shortly also died; for whose dear love They say, she hath abjur\u2019d the company And sight of men. VIOLA. O that I served that lady, And might not be delivered to the world, Till I had made mine own occasion mellow, What my estate is. CAPTAIN. That were hard to compass, Because she will admit no kind of suit, No, not the Duke\u2019s. VIOLA. There is a fair behaviour in thee, Captain; And though that nature with a beauteous wall Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee I will believe thou hast a mind that suits With this thy fair and outward character. I pray thee, and I\u2019ll pay thee bounteously, Conceal me what I am, and be my aid For such disguise as haply shall become The form of my intent. I\u2019ll serve this duke; Thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him. It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing, And speak to him in many sorts of music, That will allow me very worth his service.", " VIOLA. How can this be? DUKE. When came he to this town? ANTONIO. Today, my lord; and for three months before, No int\u2019rim, not a minute\u2019s vacancy, Both day and night did we keep company. Enter Olivia and Attendants. DUKE. Here comes the Countess, now heaven walks on earth. But for thee, fellow, fellow, thy words are madness. Three months this youth hath tended upon me; But more of that anon. Take him aside. OLIVIA. What would my lord, but that he may not have, Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable? Cesario, you do not keep promise with me. VIOLA. Madam? DUKE. Gracious Olivia\u2014 OLIVIA. What do you say, Cesario? Good my lord\u2014 VIOLA. My lord would speak, my duty hushes me. OLIVIA. If it be aught to the old tune, my lord, It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear As howling after music. DUKE. Still so cruel? OLIVIA. Still so constant, lord. DUKE. What, to perverseness? You uncivil lady, To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars My soul the faithfull\u2019st off\u2019rings hath breathed out That e\u2019er devotion tender\u2019d! What shall I do? OLIVIA.

An apple cleft in two is not more twin Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian? OLIVIA. Most wonderful! SEBASTIAN. Do I stand there? I never had a brother: Nor can there be that deity in my nature Of here and everywhere. I had a sister, Whom the blind waves and surges have devoured. Of charity, what kin are you to me? What countryman? What name? What parentage? VIOLA. Of Messaline: Sebastian was my father; Such a Sebastian was my brother too: So went he suited to his watery tomb. If spirits can assume both form and suit, You come to fright us. SEBASTIAN. A spirit I am indeed, But am in that dimension grossly clad, Which from the womb I did participate. Were you a woman, as the rest goes even, I should my tears let fall upon your cheek, And say, \u2018Thrice welcome, drowned Viola.\u2019 VIOLA. My father had a mole upon his brow. SEBASTIAN. And so had mine. VIOLA. And died that day when Viola from her birth Had numbered thirteen years. SEBASTIAN. O, that record is lively in my soul! He finished indeed his mortal act That day that made my sister thirteen years. VIOLA. If nothing lets to make us happy both But this my masculine usurp\u2019d attire, Do not embrace me till each circumstance Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump That I am Viola; which to confirm, I\u2019ll bring you to a captain in this town, Where lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle help I was preserv\u2019d to serve this noble count.", " [_Exit._] OLIVIA. I do I know not what, and fear to find Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind. Fate, show thy force, ourselves we do not owe. What is decreed must be; and be this so! [_Exit._] ACT II. SCENE I. The sea-coast. Enter Antonio and Sebastian. ANTONIO. Will you stay no longer? Nor will you not that I go with you? SEBASTIAN. By your patience, no; my stars shine darkly over me; the malignancy of my fate might perhaps distemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you your leave that I may bear my evils alone. It were a bad recompense for your love, to lay any of them on you. ANTONIO. Let me know of you whither you are bound. SEBASTIAN. No, sooth, sir; my determinate voyage is mere extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty, that you will not extort from me what I am willing to keep in. Therefore it charges me in manners the rather to express myself. You must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian, which I called Roderigo; my father was that Sebastian of Messaline whom I know you have heard of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both born in an hour. If the heavens had been pleased, would we had so ended! But you, sir, altered that, for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned. ANTONIO. Alas the day! SEBASTIAN. A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled me, was yet of many accounted beautiful.", " DUKE. O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame To pay this debt of love but to a brother, How will she love, when the rich golden shaft Hath kill\u2019d the flock of all affections else That live in her; when liver, brain, and heart, These sovereign thrones, are all supplied and fill\u2019d Her sweet perfections with one self king! Away before me to sweet beds of flowers, Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers. [_Exeunt._] SCENE II. The sea-coast. Enter Viola, a Captain and Sailors. VIOLA. What country, friends, is this? CAPTAIN. This is Illyria, lady. VIOLA. And what should I do in Illyria? My brother he is in Elysium. Perchance he is not drown\u2019d. What think you, sailors? CAPTAIN. It is perchance that you yourself were sav\u2019d. VIOLA. O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be. CAPTAIN. True, madam; and to comfort you with chance, Assure yourself, after our ship did split, When you, and those poor number sav\u2019d with you, Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother, Most provident in peril, bind himself, (Courage and hope both teaching him the practice) To a strong mast that liv\u2019d upon the sea; Where, like Arion on the dolphin\u2019s back, I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves So long as I could see. VIOLA. For saying so, there\u2019s gold! Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope, Whereto thy speech serves for authority, The like of him. Know\u2019st thou this country? CAPTAIN. Ay, madam, well, for I was bred and born Not three hours\u2019 travel from this very place."], "Who tells Viola about Duke Orsino?": [" Come, but one verse. CURIO. He is not here, so please your lordship, that should sing it. DUKE. Who was it? CURIO. Feste, the jester, my lord, a fool that the Lady Olivia\u2019s father took much delight in. He is about the house. DUKE. Seek him out, and play the tune the while. [_Exit Curio. Music plays._] Come hither, boy. If ever thou shalt love, In the sweet pangs of it remember me: For such as I am, all true lovers are, Unstaid and skittish in all motions else, Save in the constant image of the creature That is belov\u2019d. How dost thou like this tune? VIOLA. It gives a very echo to the seat Where love is throned. DUKE. Thou dost speak masterly. My life upon\u2019t, young though thou art, thine eye Hath stayed upon some favour that it loves. Hath it not, boy? VIOLA. A little, by your favour. DUKE. What kind of woman is\u2019t? VIOLA. Of your complexion. DUKE. She is not worth thee, then. What years, i\u2019 faith? VIOLA. About your years, my lord. DUKE. Too old, by heaven! Let still the woman take An elder than herself; so wears she to him, So sways she level in her husband\u2019s heart. For, boy, however we do praise ourselves, Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm, More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn, Than women\u2019s are. VIOLA. I think it well, my lord. DUKE. Then let thy love be younger than thyself, Or thy affection cannot hold the bent: For women are as roses, whose fair flower Being once display\u2019d, doth fall that very hour.", " VIOLA. Who governs here? CAPTAIN. A noble duke, in nature as in name. VIOLA. What is his name? CAPTAIN. Orsino. VIOLA. Orsino! I have heard my father name him. He was a bachelor then. CAPTAIN. And so is now, or was so very late; For but a month ago I went from hence, And then \u2019twas fresh in murmur, (as, you know, What great ones do, the less will prattle of) That he did seek the love of fair Olivia. VIOLA. What\u2019s she? CAPTAIN. A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count That died some twelvemonth since; then leaving her In the protection of his son, her brother, Who shortly also died; for whose dear love They say, she hath abjur\u2019d the company And sight of men. VIOLA. O that I served that lady, And might not be delivered to the world, Till I had made mine own occasion mellow, What my estate is. CAPTAIN. That were hard to compass, Because she will admit no kind of suit, No, not the Duke\u2019s. VIOLA. There is a fair behaviour in thee, Captain; And though that nature with a beauteous wall Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee I will believe thou hast a mind that suits With this thy fair and outward character. I pray thee, and I\u2019ll pay thee bounteously, Conceal me what I am, and be my aid For such disguise as haply shall become The form of my intent. I\u2019ll serve this duke; Thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him. It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing, And speak to him in many sorts of music, That will allow me very worth his service.", " Farewell. [_Exit Clown._] DUKE. Let all the rest give place. [_Exeunt Curio and Attendants._] Once more, Cesario, Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty. Tell her my love, more noble than the world, Prizes not quantity of dirty lands; The parts that fortune hath bestow\u2019d upon her, Tell her I hold as giddily as fortune; But \u2019tis that miracle and queen of gems That nature pranks her in attracts my soul. VIOLA. But if she cannot love you, sir? DUKE. I cannot be so answer\u2019d. VIOLA. Sooth, but you must. Say that some lady, as perhaps there is, Hath for your love as great a pang of heart As you have for Olivia: you cannot love her; You tell her so. Must she not then be answer\u2019d? DUKE. There is no woman\u2019s sides Can bide the beating of so strong a passion As love doth give my heart: no woman\u2019s heart So big, to hold so much; they lack retention. Alas, their love may be called appetite, No motion of the liver, but the palate, That suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt; But mine is all as hungry as the sea, And can digest as much. Make no compare Between that love a woman can bear me And that I owe Olivia. VIOLA. Ay, but I know\u2014 DUKE. What dost thou know? VIOLA. Too well what love women to men may owe. In faith, they are as true of heart as we. My father had a daughter loved a man, As it might be perhaps, were I a woman, I should your lordship. DUKE. And what\u2019s her history? VIOLA. A blank, my lord.", " What dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in? I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard. SIR ANDREW. Ay, \u2019tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a dam\u2019d-colour\u2019d stock. Shall we set about some revels? SIR TOBY. What shall we do else? Were we not born under Taurus? SIR ANDREW. Taurus? That\u2019s sides and heart. SIR TOBY. No, sir, it is legs and thighs. Let me see thee caper. Ha, higher: ha, ha, excellent! [_Exeunt._] SCENE IV. A Room in the Duke\u2019s Palace. Enter Valentine and Viola in man\u2019s attire. VALENTINE. If the duke continue these favours towards you, Cesario, you are like to be much advanced; he hath known you but three days, and already you are no stranger. VIOLA. You either fear his humour or my negligence, that you call in question the continuance of his love. Is he inconstant, sir, in his favours? VALENTINE. No, believe me. Enter Duke, Curio and Attendants. VIOLA. I thank you. Here comes the Count. DUKE. Who saw Cesario, ho? VIOLA. On your attendance, my lord, here. DUKE. Stand you awhile aloof.\u2014Cesario, Thou know\u2019st no less but all; I have unclasp\u2019d To thee the book even of my secret soul. Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her, Be not denied access, stand at her doors, And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow Till thou have audience. VIOLA. Sure, my noble lord, If she be so abandon\u2019d to her sorrow As it is spoke, she never will admit me."], "Why does the ship\u2019s captain help Viola find a disguise?": [" VIOLA. Who governs here?

Fortune forbid my outside have not charm\u2019d her! She made good view of me, indeed, so much, That methought her eyes had lost her tongue, For she did speak in starts distractedly. She loves me, sure, the cunning of her passion Invites me in this churlish messenger. None of my lord\u2019s ring? Why, he sent her none.

These clothes are good enough to drink in, and so be these boots too; and they be not, let them hang themselves in their own straps. MARIA.

Why, would that have mended my hair?", " What else may hap, to time I will commit; Only shape thou thy silence to my wit. CAPTAIN. Be you his eunuch and your mute I\u2019ll be; When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see. VIOLA. I thank thee. Lead me on. [_Exeunt._] SCENE III. A Room in Olivia\u2019s House. Enter Sir Toby and Maria. SIR TOBY. What a plague means my niece to take the death of her brother thus? I am sure care\u2019s an enemy to life. MARIA. By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o\u2019 nights; your cousin, my lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours. SIR TOBY. Why, let her except, before excepted. MARIA. Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of order. SIR TOBY. Confine? I\u2019ll confine myself no finer than I am. These clothes are good enough to drink in, and so be these boots too; and they be not, let them hang themselves in their own straps. MARIA. That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard my lady talk of it yesterday; and of a foolish knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer. SIR TOBY. Who? Sir Andrew Aguecheek? MARIA. Ay, he. SIR TOBY. He\u2019s as tall a man as any\u2019s in Illyria. MARIA. What\u2019s that to th\u2019 purpose? SIR TOBY. Why, he has three thousand ducats a year. MARIA. Ay, but he\u2019ll have but a year in all these ducats. He\u2019s a very fool, and a prodigal. SIR TOBY. Fie, that you\u2019ll say so! he plays o\u2019 the viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages word for word without book, and hath all the good gifts of nature.", " SIR TOBY. Excellent! I smell a device. SIR ANDREW. I have\u2019t in my nose too. SIR TOBY. He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop, that they come from my niece, and that she is in love with him. MARIA. My purpose is indeed a horse of that colour. SIR ANDREW. And your horse now would make him an ass. MARIA. Ass, I doubt not. SIR ANDREW. O \u2019twill be admirable! MARIA. Sport royal, I warrant you. I know my physic will work with him. I will plant you two, and let the fool make a third, where he shall find the letter. Observe his construction of it. For this night, to bed, and dream on the event. Farewell. [_Exit._] SIR TOBY. Good night, Penthesilea. SIR ANDREW. Before me, she\u2019s a good wench. SIR TOBY. She\u2019s a beagle true bred, and one that adores me. What o\u2019 that? SIR ANDREW. I was adored once too. SIR TOBY. Let\u2019s to bed, knight. Thou hadst need send for more money. SIR ANDREW. If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out. SIR TOBY. Send for money, knight; if thou hast her not i\u2019 th\u2019 end, call me cut. SIR ANDREW. If I do not, never trust me, take it how you will. SIR TOBY. Come, come, I\u2019ll go burn some sack, \u2019tis too late to go to bed now. Come, knight, come, knight. [_Exeunt._] SCENE IV. A Room in the Duke\u2019s Palace. Enter Duke, Viola, Curio and others. DUKE. Give me some music. Now, good morrow, friends. Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song, That old and antique song we heard last night; Methought it did relieve my passion much, More than light airs and recollected terms Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times."], "When they meet, what does Sir Toby compliment Sir Andrew Aguecheek on?": [" MARIA. He hath indeed, almost natural: for, besides that he\u2019s a fool, he\u2019s a great quarreller; and, but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath in quarrelling, \u2019tis thought among the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave. SIR TOBY. By this hand, they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him. Who are they? MARIA. They that add, moreover, he\u2019s drunk nightly in your company. SIR TOBY. With drinking healths to my niece; I\u2019ll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat, and drink in Illyria. He\u2019s a coward and a coystril that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o\u2019 the toe like a parish top. What, wench! _Castiliano vulgo:_ for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface. Enter Sir Andrew. AGUECHEEK. Sir Toby Belch! How now, Sir Toby Belch? SIR TOBY. Sweet Sir Andrew! SIR ANDREW. Bless you, fair shrew. MARIA. And you too, sir. SIR TOBY. Accost, Sir Andrew, accost. SIR ANDREW. What\u2019s that? SIR TOBY. My niece\u2019s chamber-maid. SIR ANDREW. Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance. MARIA. My name is Mary, sir. SIR ANDREW. Good Mistress Mary Accost,\u2014 SIR TOBY. You mistake, knight: accost is front her, board her, woo her, assail her. SIR ANDREW. By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company. Is that the meaning of accost? MARIA. Fare you well, gentlemen. SIR TOBY. And thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never draw sword again.", " SIR ANDREW. And you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have fools in hand? MARIA. Sir, I have not you by the hand. SIR ANDREW. Marry, but you shall have, and here\u2019s my hand. MARIA. Now, sir, thought is free. I pray you, bring your hand to th\u2019 buttery bar and let it drink. SIR ANDREW. Wherefore, sweetheart? What\u2019s your metaphor? MARIA. It\u2019s dry, sir. SIR ANDREW. Why, I think so; I am not such an ass but I can keep my hand dry. But what\u2019s your jest? MARIA. A dry jest, sir. SIR ANDREW. Are you full of them? MARIA. Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers\u2019 ends: marry, now I let go your hand, I am barren. [_Exit Maria._] SIR TOBY. O knight, thou lack\u2019st a cup of canary: When did I see thee so put down? SIR ANDREW. Never in your life, I think, unless you see canary put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has; but I am a great eater of beef, and I believe that does harm to my wit. SIR TOBY. No question. SIR ANDREW. And I thought that, I\u2019d forswear it. I\u2019ll ride home tomorrow, Sir Toby. SIR TOBY. _Pourquoy_, my dear knight? SIR ANDREW. What is _pourquoy?_ Do, or not do? I would I had bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in fencing, dancing, and bear-baiting. O, had I but followed the arts! SIR TOBY. Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair. SIR ANDREW. Why, would that have mended my hair?", " PRIEST. A contract of eternal bond of love, Confirmed by mutual joinder of your hands, Attested by the holy close of lips, Strengthen\u2019d by interchangement of your rings, And all the ceremony of this compact Sealed in my function, by my testimony; Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave, I have travelled but two hours. DUKE. O thou dissembling cub! What wilt thou be When time hath sowed a grizzle on thy case? Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow? Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet Where thou and I henceforth may never meet. VIOLA. My lord, I do protest\u2014 OLIVIA. O, do not swear. Hold little faith, though thou has too much fear. Enter Sir Andrew. SIR ANDREW. For the love of God, a surgeon! Send one presently to Sir Toby. OLIVIA. What\u2019s the matter? SIR ANDREW. \u2019Has broke my head across, and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too. For the love of God, your help! I had rather than forty pound I were at home. OLIVIA. Who has done this, Sir Andrew? SIR ANDREW. The Count\u2019s gentleman, one Cesario. We took him for a coward, but he\u2019s the very devil incardinate. DUKE. My gentleman, Cesario? SIR ANDREW. \u2019Od\u2019s lifelings, here he is!\u2014You broke my head for nothing; and that that I did, I was set on to do\u2019t by Sir Toby. VIOLA. Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you: You drew your sword upon me without cause, But I bespake you fair and hurt you not.", " SIR TOBY. Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature. SIR ANDREW. But it becomes me well enough, does\u2019t not? SIR TOBY. Excellent, it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I hope to see a houswife take thee between her legs, and spin it off. SIR ANDREW. Faith, I\u2019ll home tomorrow, Sir Toby; your niece will not be seen, or if she be, it\u2019s four to one she\u2019ll none of me; the Count himself here hard by woos her. SIR TOBY. She\u2019ll none o\u2019 the Count; she\u2019ll not match above her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I have heard her swear\u2019t. Tut, there\u2019s life in\u2019t, man. SIR ANDREW. I\u2019ll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o\u2019 the strangest mind i\u2019 the world; I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether. SIR TOBY. Art thou good at these kick-shawses, knight? SIR ANDREW. As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the degree of my betters; and yet I will not compare with an old man. SIR TOBY. What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight? SIR ANDREW. Faith, I can cut a caper. SIR TOBY. And I can cut the mutton to\u2019t. SIR ANDREW. And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as any man in Illyria. SIR TOBY. Wherefore are these things hid? Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before \u2019em? Are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall\u2019s picture? Why dost thou not go to church in a galliard, and come home in a coranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace."], "Orsino sends Cesario, his new favorite servant, on a very important errand. What is it?": [" SIR TOBY. I mean, to go, sir, to enter. VIOLA. I will answer you with gait and entrance: but we are prevented. Enter Olivia and Maria. Most excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rain odours on you! SIR ANDREW. That youth\u2019s a rare courtier. \u2018Rain odours,\u2019 well. VIOLA. My matter hath no voice, lady, but to your own most pregnant and vouchsafed car. SIR ANDREW. \u2018Odours,\u2019 \u2018pregnant,\u2019 and \u2018vouchsafed.\u2019\u2014I\u2019ll get \u2019em all three ready. OLIVIA. Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing. [_Exeunt Sir Toby, Sir Andrew and Maria._] Give me your hand, sir. VIOLA. My duty, madam, and most humble service. OLIVIA. What is your name? VIOLA. Cesario is your servant\u2019s name, fair princess. OLIVIA. My servant, sir! \u2019Twas never merry world, Since lowly feigning was call\u2019d compliment: Y\u2019are servant to the Count Orsino, youth. VIOLA. And he is yours, and his must needs be yours. Your servant\u2019s servant is your servant, madam. OLIVIA. For him, I think not on him: for his thoughts, Would they were blanks rather than fill\u2019d with me! VIOLA. Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts On his behalf. OLIVIA. O, by your leave, I pray you. I bade you never speak again of him. But would you undertake another suit, I had rather hear you to solicit that Than music from the spheres. VIOLA. Dear lady\u2014 OLIVIA. Give me leave, beseech you. I did send, After the last enchantment you did here, A ring in chase of you.", " MALVOLIO. \u2018Some achieve greatness\u2019\u2014 OLIVIA. What say\u2019st thou?

MALVOLIO. \u2018And wished to see thee cross-gartered.\u2019 OLIVIA. Cross-gartered? MALVOLIO. \u2018Go to: thou art made, if thou desir\u2019st to be so:\u2019\u2014 OLIVIA. Am I made? MALVOLIO. \u2018If not, let me see thee a servant still.\u2019 OLIVIA. Why, this is very midsummer madness. Enter Servant. SERVANT. Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino\u2019s is returned; I could hardly entreat him back. He attends your ladyship\u2019s pleasure. OLIVIA. I\u2019ll come to him. [_Exit Servant._] Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where\u2019s my cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a special care of him; I would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry. [_Exeunt Olivia and Maria._] MALVOLIO. O ho, do you come near me now? No worse man than Sir Toby to look to me. This concurs directly with the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may appear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that in the letter. \u2018Cast thy humble slough,\u2019 says she; \u2018be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants, let thy tongue tang with arguments of state, put thyself into the trick of singularity,\u2019 and consequently, sets down the manner how: as, a sad face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the habit of some sir of note, and so forth.", " But though I could not with such estimable wonder overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly publish her, she bore a mind that envy could not but call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more. ANTONIO. Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment. SEBASTIAN. O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble. ANTONIO. If you will not murder me for my love, let me be your servant. SEBASTIAN. If you will not undo what you have done, that is, kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not. Fare ye well at once; my bosom is full of kindness, and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, that upon the least occasion more, mine eyes will tell tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino\u2019s court: farewell. [_Exit._] ANTONIO. The gentleness of all the gods go with thee! I have many enemies in Orsino\u2019s court, Else would I very shortly see thee there: But come what may, I do adore thee so, That danger shall seem sport, and I will go. [_Exit._] SCENE II. A street. Enter Viola; Malvolio at several doors. MALVOLIO. Were you not even now with the Countess Olivia? VIOLA. Even now, sir; on a moderate pace I have since arrived but hither. MALVOLIO.

She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord into a desperate assurance she will none of him.", " OLIVIA. Whence came you, sir? VIOLA. I can say little more than I have studied, and that question\u2019s out of my part. Good gentle one, give me modest assurance, if you be the lady of the house, that I may proceed in my speech. OLIVIA. Are you a comedian? VIOLA. No, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangs of malice I swear, I am not that I play. Are you the lady of the house? OLIVIA. If I do not usurp myself, I am. VIOLA. Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself; for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve. But this is from my commission. I will on with my speech in your praise, and then show you the heart of my message. OLIVIA. Come to what is important in\u2019t: I forgive you the praise. VIOLA. Alas, I took great pains to study it, and \u2019tis poetical. OLIVIA. It is the more like to be feigned; I pray you keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates; and allowed your approach, rather to wonder at you than to hear you. If you be mad, be gone; if you have reason, be brief: \u2019tis not that time of moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue. MARIA. Will you hoist sail, sir? Here lies your way. VIOLA. No, good swabber, I am to hull here a little longer. Some mollification for your giant, sweet lady. Tell me your mind. I am a messenger. OLIVIA. Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office. VIOLA. It alone concerns your ear."], "Why is Viola reluctant to carry out Orsino\u2019s command of delivering a love letter to Olivia?": [" By your leave, wax.

What I am and what I would are as secret as maidenhead: to your ears, divinity; to any other\u2019s, profanation. OLIVIA. Give us the place alone: we will hear this divinity.

In his bosom? In what chapter of his bosom? VIOLA. To answer by the method, in the first of his heart. OLIVIA. O, I have read it; it is heresy. Have you no more to say? VIOLA. Good madam, let me see your face. OLIVIA. Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face? You are now out of your text: but we will draw the curtain and show you the picture.

Alas, their love may be called appetite, No motion of the liver, but the palate, That suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt; But mine is all as hungry as the sea, And can digest as much. Make no compare Between that love a woman can bear me And that I owe Olivia. VIOLA. Ay, but I know\u2014 DUKE. What dost thou know? VIOLA. Too well what love women to men may owe.

Here comes the Countess, now heaven walks on earth. But for thee, fellow, fellow, thy words are madness. Three months this youth hath tended upon me; But more of that anon. Take him aside. OLIVIA.

SIR ANDREW. Nay, by my troth, I know not; but I know to be up late is to be up late. SIR TOBY. A false conclusion; I hate it as an unfilled can. To be up after midnight, and to go to bed then is early: so that to go to bed after midnight is to go to bed betimes. Does not our lives consist of the four elements? SIR ANDREW. Faith, so they say, but I think it rather consists of eating and drinking. SIR TOBY. Th\u2019art a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink. Marian, I say! a stoup of wine. Enter Clown. SIR ANDREW.

By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. I had rather than forty shillings I had such a leg, and so sweet a breath to sing, as the fool has. In sooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling last night when thou spok\u2019st of Pigrogromitus, of the Vapians passing the equinoctial of Queubus; \u2019twas very good, i\u2019 faith. I sent thee sixpence for thy leman. Hadst it? CLOWN. I did impeticos thy gratillity; for Malvolio\u2019s nose is no whipstock. My lady has a white hand, and the Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses.

Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain; The spinsters and the knitters in the sun, And the free maids, that weave their thread with bones Do use to chant it: it is silly sooth, And dallies with the innocence of love Like the old age. CLOWN. Are you ready, sir? DUKE. Ay; prithee, sing. [_Music._] The Clown\u2019s song. _ Come away, come away, death. And in sad cypress let me be laid. Fly away, fly away, breath; I am slain by a fair cruel maid. My shroud of white, stuck all with yew, O, prepare it! My part of death no one so true Did share it._ _ Not a flower, not a flower sweet, On my black coffin let there be strown: Not a friend, not a friend greet My poor corpse where my bones shall be thrown: A thousand thousand sighs to save, Lay me, O, where Sad true lover never find my grave, To weep there._ DUKE. There\u2019s for thy pains. CLOWN. No pains, sir; I take pleasure in singing, sir. DUKE. I\u2019ll pay thy pleasure, then. CLOWN. Truly sir, and pleasure will be paid one time or another. DUKE. Give me now leave to leave thee. CLOWN. Now the melancholy god protect thee, and the tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, for thy mind is a very opal.

Fortune forbid my outside have not charm\u2019d her! She made good view of me, indeed, so much, That methought her eyes had lost her tongue, For she did speak in starts distractedly. She loves me, sure, the cunning of her passion Invites me in this churlish messenger. None of my lord\u2019s ring? Why, he sent her none. I am the man; if it be so, as \u2019tis, Poor lady, she were better love a dream. Disguise, I see thou art a wickedness Wherein the pregnant enemy does much. How easy is it for the proper false In women\u2019s waxen hearts to set their forms! Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we, For such as we are made of, such we be. How will this fadge? My master loves her dearly, And I, poor monster, fond as much on him, And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me. What will become of this? As I am man, My state is desperate for my master\u2019s love; As I am woman (now alas the day!) What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!

DUKE. O thou dissembling cub! What wilt thou be When time hath sowed a grizzle on thy case? Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow? Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet Where thou and I henceforth may never meet. VIOLA. My lord, I do protest\u2014 OLIVIA. O, do not swear. Hold little faith, though thou has too much fear. Enter Sir Andrew. SIR ANDREW. For the love of God, a surgeon! Send one presently to Sir Toby. OLIVIA. What\u2019s the matter? SIR ANDREW. \u2019Has broke my head across, and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too. For the love of God, your help! I had rather than forty pound I were at home. OLIVIA. Who has done this, Sir Andrew? SIR ANDREW. The Count\u2019s gentleman, one Cesario. We took him for a coward, but he\u2019s the very devil incardinate. DUKE. My gentleman, Cesario? SIR ANDREW. \u2019Od\u2019s lifelings, here he is!\u2014You broke my head for nothing; and that that I did, I was set on to do\u2019t by Sir Toby. VIOLA. Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you: You drew your sword upon me without cause, But I bespake you fair and hurt you not."], "What kind of song does Feste sing for Orsino?": [" Why, this is the best fooling, when all is done. Now, a song. SIR TOBY. Come on, there is sixpence for you. Let\u2019s have a song. SIR ANDREW. There\u2019s a testril of me too: if one knight give a\u2014 CLOWN. Would you have a love-song, or a song of good life? SIR TOBY. A love-song, a love-song. SIR ANDREW. Ay, ay. I care not for good life. CLOWN. [_sings._] _O mistress mine, where are you roaming? O stay and hear, your true love\u2019s coming, That can sing both high and low. Trip no further, pretty sweeting. Journeys end in lovers meeting, Every wise man\u2019s son doth know._ SIR ANDREW. Excellent good, i\u2019 faith. SIR TOBY. Good, good. CLOWN. _What is love? \u2019Tis not hereafter, Present mirth hath present laughter. What\u2019s to come is still unsure. In delay there lies no plenty, Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty. Youth\u2019s a stuff will not endure._ SIR ANDREW. A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight. SIR TOBY. A contagious breath. SIR ANDREW. Very sweet and contagious, i\u2019 faith. SIR TOBY. To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion. But shall we make the welkin dance indeed? Shall we rouse the night-owl in a catch that will draw three souls out of one weaver? Shall we do that? SIR ANDREW. And you love me, let\u2019s do\u2019t: I am dog at a catch. CLOWN. By\u2019r lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well. SIR ANDREW. Most certain. Let our catch be, \u201cThou knave.\u201d CLOWN. \u201cHold thy peace, thou knave\u201d knight? I shall be constrain\u2019d in\u2019t to call thee knave, knight.", " Come, but one verse. CURIO. He is not here, so please your lordship, that should sing it. DUKE. Who was it? CURIO. Feste, the jester, my lord, a fool that the Lady Olivia\u2019s father took much delight in. He is about the house. DUKE. Seek him out, and play the tune the while. [_Exit Curio. Music plays._] Come hither, boy. If ever thou shalt love, In the sweet pangs of it remember me: For such as I am, all true lovers are, Unstaid and skittish in all motions else, Save in the constant image of the creature That is belov\u2019d. How dost thou like this tune? VIOLA. It gives a very echo to the seat Where love is throned. DUKE. Thou dost speak masterly. My life upon\u2019t, young though thou art, thine eye Hath stayed upon some favour that it loves. Hath it not, boy? VIOLA. A little, by your favour. DUKE. What kind of woman is\u2019t? VIOLA. Of your complexion. DUKE. She is not worth thee, then. What years, i\u2019 faith? VIOLA. About your years, my lord. DUKE. Too old, by heaven! Let still the woman take An elder than herself; so wears she to him, So sways she level in her husband\u2019s heart. For, boy, however we do praise ourselves, Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm, More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn, Than women\u2019s are. VIOLA. I think it well, my lord. DUKE. Then let thy love be younger than thyself, Or thy affection cannot hold the bent: For women are as roses, whose fair flower Being once display\u2019d, doth fall that very hour.", " VIOLA. And so they are: alas, that they are so; To die, even when they to perfection grow! Enter Curio and Clown. DUKE. O, fellow, come, the song we had last night. Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain; The spinsters and the knitters in the sun, And the free maids, that weave their thread with bones Do use to chant it: it is silly sooth, And dallies with the innocence of love Like the old age. CLOWN. Are you ready, sir? DUKE. Ay; prithee, sing. [_Music._] The Clown\u2019s song. _ Come away, come away, death. And in sad cypress let me be laid. Fly away, fly away, breath; I am slain by a fair cruel maid. My shroud of white, stuck all with yew, O, prepare it! My part of death no one so true Did share it._ _ Not a flower, not a flower sweet, On my black coffin let there be strown: Not a friend, not a friend greet My poor corpse where my bones shall be thrown: A thousand thousand sighs to save, Lay me, O, where Sad true lover never find my grave, To weep there._ DUKE. There\u2019s for thy pains. CLOWN. No pains, sir; I take pleasure in singing, sir. DUKE. I\u2019ll pay thy pleasure, then. CLOWN. Truly sir, and pleasure will be paid one time or another. DUKE. Give me now leave to leave thee. CLOWN. Now the melancholy god protect thee, and the tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, for thy mind is a very opal. I would have men of such constancy put to sea, that their business might be everything, and their intent everywhere, for that\u2019s it that always makes a good voyage of nothing.", " VIOLA. Who governs here? CAPTAIN. A noble duke, in nature as in name. VIOLA. What is his name? CAPTAIN. Orsino. VIOLA. Orsino! I have heard my father name him. He was a bachelor then. CAPTAIN. And so is now, or was so very late; For but a month ago I went from hence, And then \u2019twas fresh in murmur, (as, you know, What great ones do, the less will prattle of) That he did seek the love of fair Olivia. VIOLA. What\u2019s she? CAPTAIN. A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count That died some twelvemonth since; then leaving her In the protection of his son, her brother, Who shortly also died; for whose dear love They say, she hath abjur\u2019d the company And sight of men. VIOLA. O that I served that lady, And might not be delivered to the world, Till I had made mine own occasion mellow, What my estate is. CAPTAIN. That were hard to compass, Because she will admit no kind of suit, No, not the Duke\u2019s. VIOLA. There is a fair behaviour in thee, Captain; And though that nature with a beauteous wall Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee I will believe thou hast a mind that suits With this thy fair and outward character. I pray thee, and I\u2019ll pay thee bounteously, Conceal me what I am, and be my aid For such disguise as haply shall become The form of my intent. I\u2019ll serve this duke; Thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him. It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing, And speak to him in many sorts of music, That will allow me very worth his service."], "Who spies on Malvolio and knows that he is approaching Olivia\u2019s house?": [" MARIA. He\u2019s coming, madam: But in very strange manner. He is sure possessed, madam. OLIVIA. Why, what\u2019s the matter? Does he rave? MARIA. No, madam, he does nothing but smile: your ladyship were best to have some guard about you if he come, for sure the man is tainted in \u2019s wits. OLIVIA. Go call him hither. I\u2019m as mad as he, If sad and merry madness equal be. Enter Malvolio. How now, Malvolio? MALVOLIO. Sweet lady, ho, ho! OLIVIA. Smil\u2019st thou? I sent for thee upon a sad occasion. MALVOLIO. Sad, lady? I could be sad: this does make some obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering. But what of that? If it please the eye of one, it is with me as the very true sonnet is: \u2018Please one and please all.\u2019 OLIVIA. Why, how dost thou, man? What is the matter with thee? MALVOLIO. Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It did come to his hands, and commands shall be executed. I think we do know the sweet Roman hand. OLIVIA. Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio? MALVOLIO. To bed? Ay, sweetheart, and I\u2019ll come to thee. OLIVIA. God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so, and kiss thy hand so oft? MARIA. How do you, Malvolio? MALVOLIO. At your request? Yes, nightingales answer daws! MARIA. Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady? MALVOLIO. \u2018Be not afraid of greatness.\u2019 \u2019Twas well writ. OLIVIA. What mean\u2019st thou by that, Malvolio? MALVOLIO. \u2018Some are born great\u2019\u2014 OLIVIA. Ha?", " He\u2019s fortified against any denial. OLIVIA. Tell him, he shall not speak with me. MALVOLIO. Has been told so; and he says he\u2019ll stand at your door like a sheriff\u2019s post, and be the supporter of a bench, but he\u2019ll speak with you. OLIVIA. What kind o\u2019 man is he? MALVOLIO. Why, of mankind. OLIVIA. What manner of man? MALVOLIO. Of very ill manner; he\u2019ll speak with you, will you or no. OLIVIA. Of what personage and years is he? MALVOLIO. Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy; as a squash is before \u2019tis a peascod, or a codling, when \u2019tis almost an apple. \u2019Tis with him in standing water, between boy and man. He is very well-favoured, and he speaks very shrewishly. One would think his mother\u2019s milk were scarce out of him. OLIVIA. Let him approach. Call in my gentlewoman. MALVOLIO. Gentlewoman, my lady calls. [_Exit._] Enter Maria. OLIVIA. Give me my veil; come, throw it o\u2019er my face. We\u2019ll once more hear Orsino\u2019s embassy. Enter Viola. VIOLA. The honourable lady of the house, which is she? OLIVIA. Speak to me; I shall answer for her. Your will? VIOLA. Most radiant, exquisite, and unmatchable beauty,\u2014I pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house, for I never saw her. I would be loath to cast away my speech; for besides that it is excellently well penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very comptible, even to the least sinister usage.", " MALVOLIO. \u2018Some achieve greatness\u2019\u2014 OLIVIA. What say\u2019st thou? MALVOLIO. \u2018And some have greatness thrust upon them.\u2019 OLIVIA. Heaven restore thee! MALVOLIO. \u2018Remember who commended thy yellow stockings\u2019\u2014 OLIVIA. Thy yellow stockings?

MALVOLIO. \u2018If not, let me see thee a servant still.\u2019 OLIVIA. Why, this is very midsummer madness. Enter Servant. SERVANT. Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino\u2019s is returned; I could hardly entreat him back. He attends your ladyship\u2019s pleasure. OLIVIA. I\u2019ll come to him. [_Exit Servant._] Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where\u2019s my cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a special care of him; I would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry. [_Exeunt Olivia and Maria._] MALVOLIO. O ho, do you come near me now? No worse man than Sir Toby to look to me. This concurs directly with the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may appear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that in the letter. \u2018Cast thy humble slough,\u2019 says she; \u2018be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants, let thy tongue tang with arguments of state, put thyself into the trick of singularity,\u2019 and consequently, sets down the manner how: as, a sad face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the habit of some sir of note, and so forth.", " By your leave, wax.

SCENE: A City in Illyria; and the Sea-coast near it."], "What are the initials of the unknown beloved to whom the letter is addressed?": [" SIR TOBY. Bolts and shackles! FABIAN. O, peace, peace, peace! Now, now. MALVOLIO. Seven of my people, with an obedient start, make out for him. I frown the while, and perchance wind up my watch, or play with some rich jewel. Toby approaches; curtsies there to me\u2014 SIR TOBY. Shall this fellow live? FABIAN. Though our silence be drawn from us with cars, yet peace! MALVOLIO. I extend my hand to him thus, quenching my familiar smile with an austere regard of control\u2014 SIR TOBY. And does not Toby take you a blow o\u2019 the lips then? MALVOLIO. Saying \u2018Cousin Toby, my fortunes having cast me on your niece, give me this prerogative of speech\u2014\u2019 SIR TOBY. What, what? MALVOLIO. \u2018You must amend your drunkenness.\u2019 SIR TOBY. Out, scab! FABIAN. Nay, patience, or we break the sinews of our plot. MALVOLIO. \u2018Besides, you waste the treasure of your time with a foolish knight\u2014\u2019 SIR ANDREW. That\u2019s me, I warrant you. MALVOLIO. \u2018One Sir Andrew.\u2019 SIR ANDREW. I knew \u2019twas I, for many do call me fool. MALVOLIO. [_Taking up the letter._] What employment have we here? FABIAN. Now is the woodcock near the gin. SIR TOBY. O, peace! And the spirit of humours intimate reading aloud to him! MALVOLIO. By my life, this is my lady\u2019s hand: these be her very C\u2019s, her U\u2019s, and her T\u2019s, and thus makes she her great P\u2019s. It is in contempt of question, her hand. SIR ANDREW. Her C\u2019s, her U\u2019s, and her T\u2019s. Why that? MALVOLIO. [_Reads._] _To the unknown beloved, this, and my good wishes._ Her very phrases!", " All the occurrence of my fortune since Hath been between this lady and this lord. SEBASTIAN. [_To Olivia._] So comes it, lady, you have been mistook. But nature to her bias drew in that. You would have been contracted to a maid; Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived: You are betroth\u2019d both to a maid and man. DUKE. Be not amazed; right noble is his blood. If this be so, as yet the glass seems true, I shall have share in this most happy wreck. [_To Viola._] Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times Thou never shouldst love woman like to me. VIOLA. And all those sayings will I over-swear, And all those swearings keep as true in soul As doth that orbed continent the fire That severs day from night. DUKE. Give me thy hand, And let me see thee in thy woman\u2019s weeds. VIOLA. The captain that did bring me first on shore Hath my maid\u2019s garments. He, upon some action, Is now in durance, at Malvolio\u2019s suit, A gentleman and follower of my lady\u2019s. OLIVIA. He shall enlarge him. Fetch Malvolio hither. And yet, alas, now I remember me, They say, poor gentleman, he\u2019s much distract. Enter Clown, with a letter and Fabian. A most extracting frenzy of mine own From my remembrance clearly banished his. How does he, sirrah? CLOWN. Truly, madam, he holds Belzebub at the stave\u2019s end as well as a man in his case may do. Has here writ a letter to you. I should have given it you today morning, but as a madman\u2019s epistles are no gospels, so it skills not much when they are delivered.", " OLIVIA. A sister? You are she. Enter Fabian and Malvolio. DUKE. Is this the madman? OLIVIA. Ay, my lord, this same. How now, Malvolio? MALVOLIO. Madam, you have done me wrong, Notorious wrong. OLIVIA. Have I, Malvolio? No. MALVOLIO. Lady, you have. Pray you peruse that letter. You must not now deny it is your hand, Write from it, if you can, in hand, or phrase, Or say \u2019tis not your seal, not your invention: You can say none of this. Well, grant it then, And tell me, in the modesty of honour, Why you have given me such clear lights of favour, Bade me come smiling and cross-garter\u2019d to you, To put on yellow stockings, and to frown Upon Sir Toby, and the lighter people; And acting this in an obedient hope, Why have you suffer\u2019d me to be imprison\u2019d, Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest, And made the most notorious geck and gull That e\u2019er invention played on? Tell me why? OLIVIA. Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing, Though I confess, much like the character: But out of question, \u2019tis Maria\u2019s hand. And now I do bethink me, it was she First told me thou wast mad; then cam\u2019st in smiling, And in such forms which here were presuppos\u2019d Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content. This practice hath most shrewdly pass\u2019d upon thee. But when we know the grounds and authors of it, Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge Of thine own cause. FABIAN. Good madam, hear me speak, And let no quarrel, nor no brawl to come, Taint the condition of this present hour, Which I have wonder\u2019d at.", " So soon as ever thou seest him, draw, and as thou draw\u2019st, swear horrible, for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath, with a swaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives manhood more approbation than ever proof itself would have earned him. Away. SIR ANDREW. Nay, let me alone for swearing. [_Exit._] SIR TOBY. Now will not I deliver his letter, for the behaviour of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good capacity and breeding; his employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less. Therefore this letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no terror in the youth. He will find it comes from a clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by word of mouth, set upon Aguecheek notable report of valour, and drive the gentleman (as I know his youth will aptly receive it) into a most hideous opinion of his rage, skill, fury, and impetuosity. This will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look, like cockatrices. Enter Olivia and Viola. FABIAN. Here he comes with your niece; give them way till he take leave, and presently after him. SIR TOBY. I will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge. [_Exeunt Sir Toby, Fabian and Maria._] OLIVIA. I have said too much unto a heart of stone, And laid mine honour too unchary on\u2019t: There\u2019s something in me that reproves my fault: But such a headstrong potent fault it is, That it but mocks reproof."], "What sort of stockings does the letter request that the reader wear to prove they return Olivia\u2019s love?": [" MALVOLIO. \u2018Some achieve greatness\u2019\u2014 OLIVIA. What say\u2019st thou? MALVOLIO. \u2018And some have greatness thrust upon them.\u2019 OLIVIA. Heaven restore thee! MALVOLIO. \u2018Remember who commended thy yellow stockings\u2019\u2014 OLIVIA. Thy yellow stockings? MALVOLIO. \u2018And wished to see thee cross-gartered.\u2019 OLIVIA. Cross-gartered? MALVOLIO. \u2018Go to: thou art made, if thou desir\u2019st to be so:\u2019\u2014 OLIVIA. Am I made? MALVOLIO. \u2018If not, let me see thee a servant still.\u2019 OLIVIA. Why, this is very midsummer madness. Enter Servant. SERVANT. Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino\u2019s is returned; I could hardly entreat him back. He attends your ladyship\u2019s pleasure. OLIVIA. I\u2019ll come to him. [_Exit Servant._] Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where\u2019s my cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a special care of him; I would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry. [_Exeunt Olivia and Maria._] MALVOLIO. O ho, do you come near me now? No worse man than Sir Toby to look to me. This concurs directly with the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may appear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that in the letter. \u2018Cast thy humble slough,\u2019 says she; \u2018be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants, let thy tongue tang with arguments of state, put thyself into the trick of singularity,\u2019 and consequently, sets down the manner how: as, a sad face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the habit of some sir of note, and so forth.", " Souls and bodies hath he divorced three, and his incensement at this moment is so implacable that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre. Hob, nob is his word; give\u2019t or take\u2019t. VIOLA. I will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others to taste their valour: belike this is a man of that quirk. SIR TOBY. Sir, no. His indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury; therefore, get you on and give him his desire. Back you shall not to the house, unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him. Therefore on, or strip your sword stark naked, for meddle you must, that\u2019s certain, or forswear to wear iron about you. VIOLA. This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me this courteous office, as to know of the knight what my offence to him is. It is something of my negligence, nothing of my purpose. SIR TOBY. I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this gentleman till my return. [_Exit Sir Toby._] VIOLA. Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter? FABIAN. I know the knight is incensed against you, even to a mortal arbitrement, but nothing of the circumstance more. VIOLA. I beseech you, what manner of man is he? FABIAN. Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by his form, as you are like to find him in the proof of his valour.", " She never told her love, But let concealment, like a worm i\u2019 th\u2019 bud, Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought, And with a green and yellow melancholy She sat like patience on a monument, Smiling at grief. Was not this love, indeed? We men may say more, swear more, but indeed, Our shows are more than will; for still we prove Much in our vows, but little in our love. DUKE. But died thy sister of her love, my boy? VIOLA. I am all the daughters of my father\u2019s house, And all the brothers too: and yet I know not. Sir, shall I to this lady? DUKE. Ay, that\u2019s the theme. To her in haste. Give her this jewel; say My love can give no place, bide no denay. [_Exeunt._] SCENE V. Olivia\u2019s garden. Enter Sir Toby, Sir Andrew and Fabian. SIR TOBY. Come thy ways, Signior Fabian. FABIAN. Nay, I\u2019ll come. If I lose a scruple of this sport, let me be boiled to death with melancholy. SIR TOBY. Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame? FABIAN. I would exult, man. You know he brought me out o\u2019 favour with my lady about a bear-baiting here. SIR TOBY. To anger him we\u2019ll have the bear again, and we will fool him black and blue, shall we not, Sir Andrew? SIR ANDREW. And we do not, it is pity of our lives. Enter Maria. SIR TOBY. Here comes the little villain. How now, my metal of India? MARIA. Get ye all three into the box-tree. Malvolio\u2019s coming down this walk; he has been yonder i\u2019 the sun practising behaviour to his own shadow this half hour: observe him, for the love of mockery; for I know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of him.", " If you mean well, Now go with me and with this holy man Into the chantry by: there, before him And underneath that consecrated roof, Plight me the full assurance of your faith, That my most jealous and too doubtful soul May live at peace. He shall conceal it Whiles you are willing it shall come to note, What time we will our celebration keep According to my birth. What do you say? SEBASTIAN. I\u2019ll follow this good man, and go with you, And having sworn truth, ever will be true. OLIVIA. Then lead the way, good father, and heavens so shine, That they may fairly note this act of mine! [_Exeunt._] ACT V. SCENE I. The Street before Olivia\u2019s House. Enter Clown and Fabian. FABIAN. Now, as thou lov\u2019st me, let me see his letter. CLOWN. Good Master Fabian, grant me another request. FABIAN. Anything. CLOWN. Do not desire to see this letter. FABIAN. This is to give a dog, and in recompense desire my dog again. Enter Duke, Viola, Curio and Lords. DUKE. Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends? CLOWN. Ay, sir, we are some of her trappings. DUKE. I know thee well. How dost thou, my good fellow? CLOWN. Truly, sir, the better for my foes, and the worse for my friends. DUKE. Just the contrary; the better for thy friends. CLOWN. No, sir, the worse. DUKE. How can that be? CLOWN. Marry, sir, they praise me, and make an ass of me. Now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass: so that by my foes, sir, I profit in the knowledge of myself, and by my friends I am abused."], "Who does Cesario meet and speak with first outside Olivia\u2019s house?": [" He\u2019s fortified against any denial. OLIVIA. Tell him, he shall not speak with me. MALVOLIO. Has been told so; and he says he\u2019ll stand at your door like a sheriff\u2019s post, and be the supporter of a bench, but he\u2019ll speak with you. OLIVIA. What kind o\u2019 man is he? MALVOLIO. Why, of mankind. OLIVIA. What manner of man? MALVOLIO. Of very ill manner; he\u2019ll speak with you, will you or no. OLIVIA. Of what personage and years is he? MALVOLIO. Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy; as a squash is before \u2019tis a peascod, or a codling, when \u2019tis almost an apple. \u2019Tis with him in standing water, between boy and man. He is very well-favoured, and he speaks very shrewishly. One would think his mother\u2019s milk were scarce out of him. OLIVIA. Let him approach. Call in my gentlewoman. MALVOLIO. Gentlewoman, my lady calls. [_Exit._] Enter Maria. OLIVIA. Give me my veil; come, throw it o\u2019er my face. We\u2019ll once more hear Orsino\u2019s embassy. Enter Viola. VIOLA. The honourable lady of the house, which is she? OLIVIA. Speak to me; I shall answer for her. Your will? VIOLA. Most radiant, exquisite, and unmatchable beauty,\u2014I pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house, for I never saw her. I would be loath to cast away my speech; for besides that it is excellently well penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very comptible, even to the least sinister usage.", " PRIEST. A contract of eternal bond of love, Confirmed by mutual joinder of your hands, Attested by the holy close of lips, Strengthen\u2019d by interchangement of your rings, And all the ceremony of this compact Sealed in my function, by my testimony; Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave, I have travelled but two hours. DUKE. O thou dissembling cub! What wilt thou be When time hath sowed a grizzle on thy case? Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow? Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet Where thou and I henceforth may never meet. VIOLA. My lord, I do protest\u2014 OLIVIA. O, do not swear. Hold little faith, though thou has too much fear. Enter Sir Andrew. SIR ANDREW. For the love of God, a surgeon! Send one presently to Sir Toby. OLIVIA. What\u2019s the matter? SIR ANDREW. \u2019Has broke my head across, and has given Sir Toby a bloody coxcomb too. For the love of God, your help! I had rather than forty pound I were at home. OLIVIA. Who has done this, Sir Andrew? SIR ANDREW. The Count\u2019s gentleman, one Cesario. We took him for a coward, but he\u2019s the very devil incardinate. DUKE. My gentleman, Cesario? SIR ANDREW. \u2019Od\u2019s lifelings, here he is!\u2014You broke my head for nothing; and that that I did, I was set on to do\u2019t by Sir Toby. VIOLA. Why do you speak to me?

Today, my lord; and for three months before, No int\u2019rim, not a minute\u2019s vacancy, Both day and night did we keep company. Enter Olivia and Attendants. DUKE. Here comes the Countess, now heaven walks on earth. But for thee, fellow, fellow, thy words are madness. Three months this youth hath tended upon me; But more of that anon. Take him aside. OLIVIA. What would my lord, but that he may not have, Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable? Cesario, you do not keep promise with me. VIOLA. Madam? DUKE. Gracious Olivia\u2014 OLIVIA. What do you say, Cesario? Good my lord\u2014 VIOLA. My lord would speak, my duty hushes me. OLIVIA. If it be aught to the old tune, my lord, It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear As howling after music. DUKE. Still so cruel? OLIVIA. Still so constant, lord. DUKE. What, to perverseness? You uncivil lady, To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars My soul the faithfull\u2019st off\u2019rings hath breathed out That e\u2019er devotion tender\u2019d! What shall I do? OLIVIA. Even what it please my lord that shall become him. DUKE. Why should I not, had I the heart to do it, Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death, Kill what I love?\u2014a savage jealousy That sometime savours nobly.

VIOLA. And I, most jocund, apt, and willingly, To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die. OLIVIA. Where goes Cesario? VIOLA. After him I love More than I love these eyes, more than my life, More, by all mores, than e\u2019er I shall love wife. If I do feign, you witnesses above Punish my life for tainting of my love. OLIVIA. Ah me, detested! how am I beguil\u2019d! VIOLA. Who does beguile you? Who does do you wrong? OLIVIA. Hast thou forgot thyself? Is it so long? Call forth the holy father.

No, my lord, not I. OLIVIA. Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear That makes thee strangle thy propriety. Fear not, Cesario, take thy fortunes up.

Tell her my love, more noble than the world, Prizes not quantity of dirty lands; The parts that fortune hath bestow\u2019d upon her, Tell her I hold as giddily as fortune; But \u2019tis that miracle and queen of gems That nature pranks her in attracts my soul. VIOLA. But if she cannot love you, sir? DUKE. I cannot be so answer\u2019d. VIOLA. Sooth, but you must. Say that some lady, as perhaps there is, Hath for your love as great a pang of heart As you have for Olivia: you cannot love her; You tell her so. Must she not then be answer\u2019d? DUKE. There is no woman\u2019s sides Can bide the beating of so strong a passion As love doth give my heart: no woman\u2019s heart So big, to hold so much; they lack retention. Alas, their love may be called appetite, No motion of the liver, but the palate, That suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt; But mine is all as hungry as the sea, And can digest as much. Make no compare Between that love a woman can bear me And that I owe Olivia. VIOLA. Ay, but I know\u2014 DUKE. What dost thou know? VIOLA. Too well what love women to men may owe. In faith, they are as true of heart as we. My father had a daughter loved a man, As it might be perhaps, were I a woman, I should your lordship. DUKE. And what\u2019s her history? VIOLA.

No, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangs of malice I swear, I am not that I play. Are you the lady of the house? OLIVIA. If I do not usurp myself, I am. VIOLA. Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself; for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve. But this is from my commission. I will on with my speech in your praise, and then show you the heart of my message. OLIVIA. Come to what is important in\u2019t: I forgive you the praise. VIOLA. Alas, I took great pains to study it, and \u2019tis poetical. OLIVIA. It is the more like to be feigned; I pray you keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates; and allowed your approach, rather to wonder at you than to hear you. If you be mad, be gone; if you have reason, be brief: \u2019tis not that time of moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue. MARIA. Will you hoist sail, sir? Here lies your way. VIOLA. No, good swabber, I am to hull here a little longer. Some mollification for your giant, sweet lady. Tell me your mind. I am a messenger. OLIVIA. Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office. VIOLA. It alone concerns your ear.", " VIOLA. How can this be? DUKE.

He hath indeed, almost natural: for, besides that he\u2019s a fool, he\u2019s a great quarreller; and, but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath in quarrelling, \u2019tis thought among the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave.

Good Mistress Mary Accost,\u2014 SIR TOBY. You mistake, knight: accost is front her, board her, woo her, assail her. SIR ANDREW. By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company.

What\u2019s your metaphor? MARIA. It\u2019s dry, sir. SIR ANDREW. Why, I think so; I am not such an ass but I can keep my hand dry. But what\u2019s your jest? MARIA. A dry jest, sir. SIR ANDREW. Are you full of them? MARIA. Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers\u2019 ends: marry, now I let go your hand, I am barren. [_Exit Maria._] SIR TOBY. O knight, thou lack\u2019st a cup of canary: When did I see thee so put down? SIR ANDREW. Never in your life, I think, unless you see canary put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit than a Christian or an ordinary man has; but I am a great eater of beef, and I believe that does harm to my wit. SIR TOBY. No question. SIR ANDREW. And I thought that, I\u2019d forswear it. I\u2019ll ride home tomorrow, Sir Toby. SIR TOBY. _Pourquoy_, my dear knight? SIR ANDREW. What is _pourquoy?_ Do, or not do? I would I had bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in fencing, dancing, and bear-baiting. O, had I but followed the arts! SIR TOBY. Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair. SIR ANDREW. Why, would that have mended my hair?", " But see, but see! Enter Sir Andrew. FABIAN. More matter for a May morning. SIR ANDREW. Here\u2019s the challenge, read it. I warrant there\u2019s vinegar and pepper in\u2019t. FABIAN. Is\u2019t so saucy? SIR ANDREW. Ay, is\u2019t, I warrant him. Do but read. SIR TOBY. Give me. [_Reads._] _Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but a scurvy fellow._ FABIAN. Good, and valiant. SIR TOBY. _Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind, why I do call thee so, for I will show thee no reason for\u2019t._ FABIAN. A good note, that keeps you from the blow of the law. SIR TOBY. _Thou comest to the Lady Olivia, and in my sight she uses thee kindly: but thou liest in thy throat; that is not the matter I challenge thee for._ FABIAN. Very brief, and to exceeding good sense\u2014less. SIR TOBY. _I will waylay thee going home; where if it be thy chance to kill me\u2014_ FABIAN. Good. SIR TOBY. _Thou kill\u2019st me like a rogue and a villain._ FABIAN. Still you keep o\u2019 th\u2019 windy side of the law. Good. SIR TOBY. _Fare thee well, and God have mercy upon one of our souls! He may have mercy upon mine, but my hope is better, and so look to thyself. Thy friend, as thou usest him, and thy sworn enemy, Andrew Aguecheek._ If this letter move him not, his legs cannot. I\u2019ll give\u2019t him. MARIA. You may have very fit occasion for\u2019t. He is now in some commerce with my lady, and will by and by depart. SIR TOBY. Go, Sir Andrew. Scout me for him at the corner of the orchard, like a bum-baily.", " SIR TOBY. Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature. SIR ANDREW. But it becomes me well enough, does\u2019t not? SIR TOBY. Excellent, it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I hope to see a houswife take thee between her legs, and spin it off. SIR ANDREW. Faith, I\u2019ll home tomorrow, Sir Toby; your niece will not be seen, or if she be, it\u2019s four to one she\u2019ll none of me; the Count himself here hard by woos her. SIR TOBY. She\u2019ll none o\u2019 the Count; she\u2019ll not match above her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I have heard her swear\u2019t. Tut, there\u2019s life in\u2019t, man. SIR ANDREW. I\u2019ll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o\u2019 the strangest mind i\u2019 the world; I delight in masques and revels sometimes altogether. SIR TOBY. Art thou good at these kick-shawses, knight? SIR ANDREW. As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the degree of my betters; and yet I will not compare with an old man. SIR TOBY. What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight? SIR ANDREW. Faith, I can cut a caper. SIR TOBY. And I can cut the mutton to\u2019t. SIR ANDREW. And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong as any man in Illyria. SIR TOBY. Wherefore are these things hid? Wherefore have these gifts a curtain before \u2019em? Are they like to take dust, like Mistress Mall\u2019s picture? Why dost thou not go to church in a galliard, and come home in a coranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would not so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace."], "What does Sir Toby encourage Sir Andrew Aguecheek to do with Cesario?": [" MARIA. He hath indeed, almost natural: for, besides that he\u2019s a fool, he\u2019s a great quarreller; and, but that he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he hath in quarrelling, \u2019tis thought among the prudent he would quickly have the gift of a grave. SIR TOBY. By this hand, they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him. Who are they? MARIA. They that add, moreover, he\u2019s drunk nightly in your company. SIR TOBY. With drinking healths to my niece; I\u2019ll drink to her as long as there is a passage in my throat, and drink in Illyria. He\u2019s a coward and a coystril that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn o\u2019 the toe like a parish top. What, wench! _Castiliano vulgo:_ for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface. Enter Sir Andrew. AGUECHEEK. Sir Toby Belch! How now, Sir Toby Belch? SIR TOBY. Sweet Sir Andrew! SIR ANDREW. Bless you, fair shrew. MARIA. And you too, sir. SIR TOBY. Accost, Sir Andrew, accost. SIR ANDREW. What\u2019s that? SIR TOBY. My niece\u2019s chamber-maid. SIR ANDREW. Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance. MARIA. My name is Mary, sir. SIR ANDREW. Good Mistress Mary Accost,\u2014 SIR TOBY. You mistake, knight: accost is front her, board her, woo her, assail her. SIR ANDREW. By my troth, I would not undertake her in this company. Is that the meaning of accost? MARIA. Fare you well, gentlemen. SIR TOBY. And thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst never draw sword again.", " SIR ANDREW. And you part so, mistress, I would I might never draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have fools in hand? MARIA. Sir, I have not you by the hand. SIR ANDREW.

And your horse now would make him an ass. MARIA. Ass, I doubt not. SIR ANDREW. O \u2019twill be admirable! MARIA. Sport royal, I warrant you. I know my physic will work with him. I will plant you two, and let the fool make a third, where he shall find the letter. Observe his construction of it. For this night, to bed, and dream on the event. Farewell. [_Exit._] SIR TOBY. Good night, Penthesilea. SIR ANDREW. Before me, she\u2019s a good wench. SIR TOBY. She\u2019s a beagle true bred, and one that adores me. What o\u2019 that? SIR ANDREW. I was adored once too. SIR TOBY. Let\u2019s to bed, knight. Thou hadst need send for more money. SIR ANDREW. If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out. SIR TOBY. Send for money, knight; if thou hast her not i\u2019 th\u2019 end, call me cut. SIR ANDREW. If I do not, never trust me, take it how you will. SIR TOBY. Come, come, I\u2019ll go burn some sack, \u2019tis too late to go to bed now. Come, knight, come, knight. [_Exeunt._] SCENE IV. A Room in the Duke\u2019s Palace. Enter Duke, Viola, Curio and others. DUKE. Give me some music. Now, good morrow, friends. Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song, That old and antique song we heard last night; Methought it did relieve my passion much, More than light airs and recollected terms Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times.", " SIR ANDREW. Now sir, have I met you again? There\u2019s for you. [_Striking Sebastian._] SEBASTIAN. Why, there\u2019s for thee, and there, and there. Are all the people mad? [_Beating Sir Andrew._] SIR TOBY. Hold, sir, or I\u2019ll throw your dagger o\u2019er the house. CLOWN. This will I tell my lady straight. I would not be in some of your coats for twopence. [_Exit Clown._] SIR TOBY. Come on, sir, hold! SIR ANDREW. Nay, let him alone, I\u2019ll go another way to work with him. I\u2019ll have an action of battery against him, if there be any law in Illyria. Though I struck him first, yet it\u2019s no matter for that. SEBASTIAN. Let go thy hand! SIR TOBY. Come, sir, I will not let you go. Come, my young soldier, put up your iron: you are well fleshed. Come on. SEBASTIAN. I will be free from thee. What wouldst thou now? If thou dar\u2019st tempt me further, draw thy sword. [_Draws._] SIR TOBY. What, what? Nay, then, I must have an ounce or two of this malapert blood from you. [_Draws._] Enter Olivia. OLIVIA. Hold, Toby! On thy life I charge thee hold! SIR TOBY. Madam. OLIVIA. Will it be ever thus? Ungracious wretch, Fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves, Where manners ne\u2019er were preach\u2019d! Out of my sight! Be not offended, dear Cesario. Rudesby, be gone!

FIRST OFFICER. This is the man; do thy office. SECOND OFFICER. Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit Of Count Orsino. ANTONIO. You do mistake me, sir. FIRST OFFICER. No, sir, no jot. I know your favour well, Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.\u2014 Take him away, he knows I know him well. ANTONIO. I must obey. This comes with seeking you; But there\u2019s no remedy, I shall answer it. What will you do? Now my necessity Makes me to ask you for my purse. It grieves me Much more for what I cannot do for you, Than what befalls myself. You stand amaz\u2019d, But be of comfort. SECOND OFFICER. Come, sir, away. ANTONIO. I must entreat of you some of that money. VIOLA. What money, sir? For the fair kindness you have show\u2019d me here, And part being prompted by your present trouble, Out of my lean and low ability I\u2019ll lend you something. My having is not much; I\u2019ll make division of my present with you. Hold, there\u2019s half my coffer. ANTONIO. Will you deny me now? Is\u2019t possible that my deserts to you Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery, Lest that it make me so unsound a man As to upbraid you with those kindnesses That I have done for you. VIOLA. I know of none, Nor know I you by voice or any feature. I hate ingratitude more in a man Than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness, Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption Inhabits our frail blood. ANTONIO.", " [_Exit._] OLIVIA. I do I know not what, and fear to find Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind. Fate, show thy force, ourselves we do not owe. What is decreed must be; and be this so! [_Exit._] ACT II. SCENE I. The sea-coast. Enter Antonio and Sebastian. ANTONIO. Will you stay no longer? Nor will you not that I go with you? SEBASTIAN. By your patience, no; my stars shine darkly over me; the malignancy of my fate might perhaps distemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you your leave that I may bear my evils alone. It were a bad recompense for your love, to lay any of them on you. ANTONIO. Let me know of you whither you are bound. SEBASTIAN. No, sooth, sir; my determinate voyage is mere extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty, that you will not extort from me what I am willing to keep in. Therefore it charges me in manners the rather to express myself. You must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian, which I called Roderigo; my father was that Sebastian of Messaline whom I know you have heard of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both born in an hour. If the heavens had been pleased, would we had so ended! But you, sir, altered that, for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned. ANTONIO. Alas the day! SEBASTIAN. A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled me, was yet of many accounted beautiful.", " ANTONIO. Would you\u2019d pardon me. I do not without danger walk these streets. Once in a sea-fight, \u2019gainst the Count his galleys, I did some service, of such note indeed, That were I ta\u2019en here, it would scarce be answer\u2019d. SEBASTIAN. Belike you slew great number of his people. ANTONIO. Th\u2019 offence is not of such a bloody nature, Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel Might well have given us bloody argument. It might have since been answered in repaying What we took from them, which for traffic\u2019s sake, Most of our city did. Only myself stood out, For which, if I be lapsed in this place, I shall pay dear. SEBASTIAN. Do not then walk too open. ANTONIO. It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here\u2019s my purse. In the south suburbs, at the Elephant, Is best to lodge. I will bespeak our diet Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge With viewing of the town. There shall you have me. SEBASTIAN. Why I your purse? ANTONIO. Haply your eye shall light upon some toy You have desire to purchase; and your store, I think, is not for idle markets, sir. SEBASTIAN. I\u2019ll be your purse-bearer, and leave you for an hour. ANTONIO. To th\u2019 Elephant. SEBASTIAN. I do remember. [_Exeunt._] SCENE IV. Olivia\u2019s garden. Enter Olivia and Maria. OLIVIA. I have sent after him. He says he\u2019ll come; How shall I feast him? What bestow of him? For youth is bought more oft than begg\u2019d or borrow\u2019d. I speak too loud.\u2014 Where\u2019s Malvolio?\u2014He is sad and civil, And suits well for a servant with my fortunes; Where is Malvolio?", " But though I could not with such estimable wonder overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly publish her, she bore a mind that envy could not but call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more. ANTONIO. Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment. SEBASTIAN. O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble. ANTONIO. If you will not murder me for my love, let me be your servant. SEBASTIAN. If you will not undo what you have done, that is, kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not. Fare ye well at once; my bosom is full of kindness, and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, that upon the least occasion more, mine eyes will tell tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino\u2019s court: farewell. [_Exit._] ANTONIO. The gentleness of all the gods go with thee! I have many enemies in Orsino\u2019s court, Else would I very shortly see thee there: But come what may, I do adore thee so, That danger shall seem sport, and I will go. [_Exit._] SCENE II. A street. Enter Viola; Malvolio at several doors. MALVOLIO. Were you not even now with the Countess Olivia? VIOLA. Even now, sir; on a moderate pace I have since arrived but hither. MALVOLIO. She returns this ring to you, sir; you might have saved me my pains, to have taken it away yourself. She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord into a desperate assurance she will none of him."], "What does Olivia think Malvolio can help her with?": [" MARIA. He\u2019s coming, madam: But in very strange manner. He is sure possessed, madam. OLIVIA. Why, what\u2019s the matter? Does he rave? MARIA. No, madam, he does nothing but smile: your ladyship were best to have some guard about you if he come, for sure the man is tainted in \u2019s wits. OLIVIA. Go call him hither. I\u2019m as mad as he, If sad and merry madness equal be. Enter Malvolio. How now, Malvolio? MALVOLIO. Sweet lady, ho, ho! OLIVIA. Smil\u2019st thou? I sent for thee upon a sad occasion. MALVOLIO. Sad, lady? I could be sad: this does make some obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering. But what of that? If it please the eye of one, it is with me as the very true sonnet is: \u2018Please one and please all.\u2019 OLIVIA. Why, how dost thou, man? What is the matter with thee? MALVOLIO. Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It did come to his hands, and commands shall be executed. I think we do know the sweet Roman hand. OLIVIA. Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio? MALVOLIO. To bed? Ay, sweetheart, and I\u2019ll come to thee. OLIVIA. God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so, and kiss thy hand so oft? MARIA. How do you, Malvolio? MALVOLIO. At your request? Yes, nightingales answer daws! MARIA. Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady? MALVOLIO. \u2018Be not afraid of greatness.\u2019 \u2019Twas well writ. OLIVIA. What mean\u2019st thou by that, Malvolio? MALVOLIO. \u2018Some are born great\u2019\u2014 OLIVIA. Ha?", " So did I abuse Myself, my servant, and, I fear me, you. Under your hard construction must I sit; To force that on you in a shameful cunning, Which you knew none of yours. What might you think? Have you not set mine honour at the stake, And baited it with all th\u2019 unmuzzled thoughts That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving Enough is shown. A cypress, not a bosom, Hides my heart: so let me hear you speak. VIOLA. I pity you. OLIVIA. That\u2019s a degree to love. VIOLA. No, not a grize; for \u2019tis a vulgar proof That very oft we pity enemies. OLIVIA. Why then methinks \u2019tis time to smile again. O world, how apt the poor are to be proud! If one should be a prey, how much the better To fall before the lion than the wolf! [_Clock strikes._] The clock upbraids me with the waste of time. Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you. And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest, Your wife is like to reap a proper man. There lies your way, due west. VIOLA. Then westward ho! Grace and good disposition attend your ladyship! You\u2019ll nothing, madam, to my lord by me? OLIVIA. Stay: I prithee tell me what thou think\u2019st of me. VIOLA. That you do think you are not what you are. OLIVIA. If I think so, I think the same of you. VIOLA. Then think you right; I am not what I am. OLIVIA. I would you were as I would have you be. VIOLA. Would it be better, madam, than I am?

Sad, lady? I could be sad: this does make some obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering. But what of that? If it please the eye of one, it is with me as the very true sonnet is: \u2018Please one and please all.\u2019 OLIVIA. Why, how dost thou, man? What is the matter with thee? MALVOLIO. Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It did come to his hands, and commands shall be executed. I think we do know the sweet Roman hand. OLIVIA. Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio? MALVOLIO. To bed? Ay, sweetheart, and I\u2019ll come to thee. OLIVIA. God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so, and kiss thy hand so oft? MARIA. How do you, Malvolio? MALVOLIO. At your request?

After him I love More than I love these eyes, more than my life, More, by all mores, than e\u2019er I shall love wife. If I do feign, you witnesses above Punish my life for tainting of my love.

Say that some lady, as perhaps there is, Hath for your love as great a pang of heart As you have for Olivia: you cannot love her; You tell her so. Must she not then be answer\u2019d? DUKE. There is no woman\u2019s sides Can bide the beating of so strong a passion As love doth give my heart: no woman\u2019s heart So big, to hold so much; they lack retention. Alas, their love may be called appetite, No motion of the liver, but the palate, That suffer surfeit, cloyment, and revolt; But mine is all as hungry as the sea, And can digest as much. Make no compare Between that love a woman can bear me And that I owe Olivia. VIOLA. Ay, but I know\u2014 DUKE. What dost thou know? VIOLA. Too well what love women to men may owe. In faith, they are as true of heart as we. My father had a daughter loved a man, As it might be perhaps, were I a woman, I should your lordship. DUKE. And what\u2019s her history? VIOLA.

Do not extort thy reasons from this clause, For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause; But rather reason thus with reason fetter: Love sought is good, but given unsought is better. VIOLA. By innocence I swear, and by my youth, I have one heart, one bosom, and one truth, And that no woman has; nor never none Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.

Even what it please my lord that shall become him. DUKE. Why should I not, had I the heart to do it, Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death, Kill what I love?\u2014a savage jealousy That sometime savours nobly.

Give ground if you see him furious. SIR TOBY. Come, Sir Andrew, there\u2019s no remedy, the gentleman will for his honour\u2019s sake have one bout with you.

What\u2019s your metaphor? MARIA. It\u2019s dry, sir. SIR ANDREW. Why, I think so; I am not such an ass but I can keep my hand dry. But what\u2019s your jest? MARIA. A dry jest, sir. SIR ANDREW.

O knight, thou lack\u2019st a cup of canary: When did I see thee so put down? SIR ANDREW. Never in your life, I think, unless you see canary put me down.

And I thought that, I\u2019d forswear it. I\u2019ll ride home tomorrow, Sir Toby. SIR TOBY. _Pourquoy_, my dear knight? SIR ANDREW. What is _pourquoy?_ Do, or not do?

I have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others to taste their valour: belike this is a man of that quirk. SIR TOBY. Sir, no.

Back you shall not to the house, unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him. Therefore on, or strip your sword stark naked, for meddle you must, that\u2019s certain, or forswear to wear iron about you. VIOLA. This is as uncivil as strange.

Belike you slew great number of his people. ANTONIO. Th\u2019 offence is not of such a bloody nature, Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel Might well have given us bloody argument. It might have since been answered in repaying What we took from them, which for traffic\u2019s sake, Most of our city did. Only myself stood out, For which, if I be lapsed in this place, I shall pay dear. SEBASTIAN. Do not then walk too open. ANTONIO. It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here\u2019s my purse. In the south suburbs, at the Elephant, Is best to lodge. I will bespeak our diet Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge With viewing of the town. There shall you have me. SEBASTIAN. Why I your purse? ANTONIO. Haply your eye shall light upon some toy You have desire to purchase; and your store, I think, is not for idle markets, sir. SEBASTIAN.

This comes with seeking you; But there\u2019s no remedy, I shall answer it. What will you do? Now my necessity Makes me to ask you for my purse. It grieves me Much more for what I cannot do for you, Than what befalls myself. You stand amaz\u2019d, But be of comfort. SECOND OFFICER. Come, sir, away. ANTONIO. I must entreat of you some of that money. VIOLA. What money, sir? For the fair kindness you have show\u2019d me here, And part being prompted by your present trouble, Out of my lean and low ability I\u2019ll lend you something. My having is not much; I\u2019ll make division of my present with you. Hold, there\u2019s half my coffer. ANTONIO. Will you deny me now? Is\u2019t possible that my deserts to you Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery, Lest that it make me so unsound a man As to upbraid you with those kindnesses That I have done for you. VIOLA. I know of none, Nor know I you by voice or any feature.

Today, my lord; and for three months before, No int\u2019rim, not a minute\u2019s vacancy, Both day and night did we keep company. Enter Olivia and Attendants. DUKE. Here comes the Countess, now heaven walks on earth. But for thee, fellow, fellow, thy words are madness. Three months this youth hath tended upon me; But more of that anon. Take him aside. OLIVIA. What would my lord, but that he may not have, Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable? Cesario, you do not keep promise with me. VIOLA. Madam? DUKE. Gracious Olivia\u2014 OLIVIA. What do you say, Cesario? Good my lord\u2014 VIOLA. My lord would speak, my duty hushes me. OLIVIA. If it be aught to the old tune, my lord, It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear As howling after music. DUKE. Still so cruel? OLIVIA. Still so constant, lord. DUKE. What, to perverseness? You uncivil lady, To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars My soul the faithfull\u2019st off\u2019rings hath breathed out That e\u2019er devotion tender\u2019d! What shall I do? OLIVIA. Even what it please my lord that shall become him. DUKE. Why should I not, had I the heart to do it, Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death, Kill what I love?\u2014a savage jealousy That sometime savours nobly.

If the duke continue these favours towards you, Cesario, you are like to be much advanced; he hath known you but three days, and already you are no stranger. VIOLA. You either fear his humour or my negligence, that you call in question the continuance of his love. Is he inconstant, sir, in his favours? VALENTINE. No, believe me. Enter Duke, Curio and Attendants. VIOLA. I thank you. Here comes the Count. DUKE. Who saw Cesario, ho? VIOLA. On your attendance, my lord, here. DUKE. Stand you awhile aloof.\u2014Cesario, Thou know\u2019st no less but all; I have unclasp\u2019d To thee the book even of my secret soul. Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her, Be not denied access, stand at her doors, And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow Till thou have audience. VIOLA.

If you will not undo what you have done, that is, kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not.

In his bosom? In what chapter of his bosom? VIOLA. To answer by the method, in the first of his heart. OLIVIA. O, I have read it; it is heresy. Have you no more to say? VIOLA.

I could not stay behind you: my desire, More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth; And not all love to see you, though so much, As might have drawn one to a longer voyage, But jealousy what might befall your travel, Being skilless in these parts; which to a stranger, Unguided and unfriended, often prove Rough and unhospitable. My willing love, The rather by these arguments of fear, Set forth in your pursuit. SEBASTIAN. My kind Antonio, I can no other answer make but thanks, And thanks, and ever thanks; and oft good turns Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay.

But I perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty, that you will not extort from me what I am willing to keep in. Therefore it charges me in manners the rather to express myself. You must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian, which I called Roderigo; my father was that Sebastian of Messaline whom I know you have heard of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both born in an hour. If the heavens had been pleased, would we had so ended!

Let still the woman take An elder than herself; so wears she to him, So sways she level in her husband\u2019s heart. For, boy, however we do praise ourselves, Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm, More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn, Than women\u2019s are. VIOLA. I think it well, my lord. DUKE.

Tell me why? OLIVIA. Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing, Though I confess, much like the character: But out of question, \u2019tis Maria\u2019s hand. And now I do bethink me, it was she First told me thou wast mad; then cam\u2019st in smiling, And in such forms which here were presuppos\u2019d Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content. This practice hath most shrewdly pass\u2019d upon thee. But when we know the grounds and authors of it, Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge Of thine own cause. FABIAN.
