{"Where does Ishmaelwant to go to find a berth on a whaling ship?": [" I have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel inclined for it?\u201d \u201cI do, sir.\u201d \u201cVery good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live whale\u2019s throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!\u201d \u201cI am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to be got rid of, that is; which I don\u2019t take to be the fact.\u201d \u201cGood again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to see the world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just step forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back to me and tell me what ye see there.\u201d For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But concentrating all his crow\u2019s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started me on the errand. Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean.", " The voyage was a skilful and lucky one; and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm, the Amelia\u2019s example was soon followed by other ships, English and American, and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific were thrown open. But not content with this good deed, the indefatigable house again bestirred itself: Samuel and all his Sons\u2014how many, their mother only knows\u2014and under their immediate auspices, and partly, I think, at their expense, the British government was induced to send the sloop-of-war Rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the South Sea. Commanded by a naval Post-Captain, the Rattler made a rattling voyage of it, and did some service; how much does not appear. But this is not all. In 1819, the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own, to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of Japan. That ship\u2014well called the \u201cSyren\u201d\u2014made a noble experimental cruise; and it was thus that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became generally known.", " \u201cBut what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of shipping ye.\u201d \u201cWell, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world.\u201d \u201cWant to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?\u201d \u201cWho is Captain Ahab, sir?\u201d \u201cAye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.\u201d \u201cI am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself.\u201d \u201cThou art speaking to Captain Peleg\u2014that\u2019s who ye are speaking to, young man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We are part owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one leg.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean, sir?", " The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance. But that contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him. The floor, the ceiling, and the side, are all awry. \u2018Oh! so my conscience hangs in me!\u2019 he groans, \u2018straight upwards, so it burns; but the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness!\u2019 \u201cLike one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still reeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the Roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him; as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed; and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as over the man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and there\u2019s naught to staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in his berth, Jonah\u2019s prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep."], "Which biblicalfigure is the focus of Father Mapple\u2019s sermon?": [" For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height, slowly turn round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving him impregnable in his little Quebec. I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this. Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage. No, thought I, there must be some sober reason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something unseen. Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward worldly ties and connexions? Yes, for replenished with the meat and wine of the word, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is a self-containing stronghold\u2014a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a perennial well of water within the walls.", " Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being. In fact take my body who will, take it I say, it is not me. And therefore three cheers for Nantucket; and come a stove boat and stove body when they will, for stave my soul, Jove himself cannot. CHAPTER 8. The Pulpit. I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable robustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation, sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain. Yes, it was the famous Father Mapple, so called by the whalemen, among whom he was a very great favourite. He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry. At the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age; that sort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth, for among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloom\u2014the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath February\u2019s snow.", " No one having previously heard his history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the utmost interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led. When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella, and certainly had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed. However, hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner; when, arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit. Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the floor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the architect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and finished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea.", " He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is.\u201d \u201cYoung man,\u201d said Bildad sternly, \u201cthou art skylarking with me\u2014explain thyself, thou young Hittite. What church dost thee mean? answer me.\u201d Finding myself thus hard pushed, I replied. \u201cI mean, sir, the same ancient Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there, and Queequeg here, and all of us, and every mother\u2019s son and soul of us belong; the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole worshipping world; we all belong to that; only some of us cherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief; in _that_ we all join hands.\u201d \u201cSplice, thou mean\u2019st _splice_ hands,\u201d cried Peleg, drawing nearer. \u201cYoung man, you\u2019d better ship for a missionary, instead of a fore-mast hand; I never heard a better sermon. Deacon Deuteronomy\u2014why Father Mapple himself couldn\u2019t beat it, and he\u2019s reckoned something. Come aboard, come aboard; never mind about the papers."], "Which body parthas Ahab lost to Moby Dick?": [" Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye have seen\u2014Moby Dick\u2014Moby Dick!\u201d \u201cCaptain Ahab,\u201d said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder. \u201cCaptain Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick\u2014but it was not Moby Dick that took off thy leg?\u201d \u201cWho told thee that?\u201d cried Ahab; then pausing, \u201cAye, Starbuck; aye, my hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now. Aye, aye,\u201d he shouted with a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose; \u201cAye, aye! it was that accursed white whale that razed me; made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day!\u201d Then tossing both arms, with measureless imprecations he shouted out: \u201cAye, aye! and I\u2019ll chase him round Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and round perdition\u2019s flames before I give him up.", " Starbuck\u2019s body and Starbuck\u2019s coerced will were Ahab\u2019s, so long as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbuck\u2019s brain; still he knew that for all this the chief mate, in his soul, abhorred his captain\u2019s quest, and could he, would joyfully disintegrate himself from it, or even frustrate it. It might be that a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale was seen. During that long interval Starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his captain\u2019s leadership, unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial influences were brought to bear upon him. Not only that, but the subtle insanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that, for the present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it; that the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure background (for few men\u2019s courage is proof against protracted meditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their long night watches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of than Moby Dick.", " It was hardly to be doubted, that several vessels reported to have encountered, at such or such a time, or on such or such a meridian, a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity, which whale, after doing great mischief to his assailants, had completely escaped them; to some minds it was not an unfair presumption, I say, that the whale in question must have been no other than Moby Dick. Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster attacked; therefore it was, that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps, for the most part, were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred, more, as it were, to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large, than to the individual cause. In that way, mostly, the disastrous encounter between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded.", " So that Monsoons, Pampas, Nor\u2019-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter and Simoon, might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the Pequod\u2019s circumnavigating wake. But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it not but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one solitary whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople? Yes. For the peculiar snow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could not but be unmistakable. And have I not tallied the whale, Ahab would mutter to himself, as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he would throw himself back in reveries\u2014tallied him, and shall he escape? His broad fins are bored, and scalloped out like a lost sheep\u2019s ear! And here, his mad mind would run on in a breathless race; till a weariness and faintness of pondering came over him; and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover his strength."], "What is the nameof Ahab\u2019s ship?": [" However, it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands. Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found. \u201cAnd what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It\u2019s all right enough; thou art shipped.\u201d \u201cYes, but I should like to see him.\u201d \u201cBut I don\u2019t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the house; a sort of sick, and yet he don\u2019t look so. In fact, he ain\u2019t sick; but no, he isn\u2019t well either. Any how, young man, he won\u2019t always see me, so I don\u2019t suppose he will thee. He\u2019s a queer man, Captain Ahab\u2014so some think\u2014but a good one. Oh, thou\u2019lt like him well enough; no fear, no fear. He\u2019s a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab; doesn\u2019t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen. Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab\u2019s above the common; Ahab\u2019s been in colleges, as well as \u2019mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than whales.", " At times, for longest hours, without a single hail, they stood far parted in the starlight; Ahab in his scuttle, the Parsee by the mainmast; but still fixedly gazing upon each other; as if in the Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in Ahab the Parsee his abandoned substance. And yet, somehow, did Ahab\u2014in his own proper self, as daily, hourly, and every instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,\u2014Ahab seemed an independent lord; the Parsee but his slave. Still again both seemed yoked together, and an unseen tyrant driving them; the lean shade siding the solid rib. For be this Parsee what he may, all rib and keel was solid Ahab. At the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was heard from aft,\u2014\u201cMan the mast-heads!\u201d\u2014and all through the day, till after sunset and after twilight, the same voice every hour, at the striking of the helmsman\u2019s bell, was heard\u2014\u201cWhat d\u2019ye see?\u2014sharp!", " But, mastering his emotion, he half calmly rose, and as he quitted the cabin, paused for an instant and said: \u201cThou hast outraged, not insulted me, sir; but for that I ask thee not to beware of Starbuck; thou wouldst but laugh; but let Ahab beware of Ahab; beware of thyself, old man.\u201d \u201cHe waxes brave, but nevertheless obeys; most careful bravery that!\u201d murmured Ahab, as Starbuck disappeared. \u201cWhat\u2019s that he said\u2014Ahab beware of Ahab\u2014there\u2019s something there!\u201d Then unconsciously using the musket for a staff, with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little cabin; but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed, and returning the gun to the rack, he went to the deck. \u201cThou art but too good a fellow, Starbuck,\u201d he said lowly to the mate; then raising his voice to the crew: \u201cFurl the t\u2019gallant-sails, and close-reef the top-sails, fore and aft; back the main-yard; up Burton, and break out in the main-hold.\u201d It were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was, that as respecting Starbuck, Ahab thus acted.", " \u201cWhat breaks in me? Some sinew cracks!\u2014\u2019tis whole again; oars! oars! Burst in upon him!\u201d Hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale wheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay; but in that evolution, catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship; seemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecutions; bethinking it\u2014it may be\u2014a larger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down upon its advancing prow, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam. Ahab staggered; his hand smote his forehead. \u201cI grow blind; hands! stretch out before me that I may yet grope my way. Is\u2019t night?\u201d \u201cThe whale! The ship!\u201d cried the cringing oarsmen. \u201cOars! oars! Slope downwards to thy depths, O sea, that ere it be for ever too late, Ahab may slide this last, last time upon his mark! I see: the ship! the ship! Dash on, my men! Will ye not save my ship?\u201d But as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the sledge-hammering seas, the before whale-smitten bow-ends of two planks burst through, and in an instant almost, the temporarily disabled boat lay nearly level with the waves; its half-wading, splashing crew, trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water."], "After what isAhab\u2019s ship named?": [" Though their blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you upwards of thirty gallons of oil. BOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER III. (_Narwhale_), that is, _Nostril whale_.\u2014Another instance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. The creature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five feet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly speaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal. But it is only found on the sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. What precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it would be hard to say. It does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword-fish and bill-fish; though some sailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food.", " \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? He was heading east, I think.\u2014Is your Captain crazy?\u201d whispering Fedallah. But Fedallah, putting a finger on his lip, slid over the bulwarks to take the boat\u2019s steering oar, and Ahab, swinging the cutting-tackle towards him, commanded the ship\u2019s sailors to stand by to lower. In a moment he was standing in the boat\u2019s stern, and the Manilla men were springing to their oars. In vain the English Captain hailed him. With back to the stranger ship, and face set like a flint to his own, Ahab stood upright till alongside of the Pequod. CHAPTER 101. The Decanter. Ere the English ship fades from sight, be it set down here, that she hailed from London, and was named after the late Samuel Enderby, merchant of that city, the original of the famous whaling house of Enderby & Sons; a house which in my poor whaleman\u2019s opinion, comes not far behind the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons, in point of real historical interest.", " The Syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a Captain Coffin, a Nantucketer. All honor to the Enderbies, therefore, whose house, I think, exists to the present day; though doubtless the original Samuel must long ago have slipped his cable for the great South Sea of the other world. The ship named after him was worthy of the honor, being a very fast sailer and a noble craft every way. I boarded her once at midnight somewhere off the Patagonian coast, and drank good flip down in the forecastle. It was a fine gam we had, and they were all trumps\u2014every soul on board. A short life to them, and a jolly death. And that fine gam I had\u2014long, very long after old Ahab touched her planks with his ivory heel\u2014it minds me of the noble, solid, Saxon hospitality of that ship; and may my parson forget me, and the devil remember me, if I ever lose sight of it. Flip? Did I say we had flip? Yes, and we flipped it at the rate of ten gallons the hour; and when the squall came (for it\u2019s squally off there by Patagonia), and all hands\u2014visitors and all\u2014were called to reef topsails, we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each other aloft in bowlines; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our jackets into the sails, so that we hung there, reefed fast in the howling gale, a warning example to all drunken tars.", " And like circles on the water, which, as they grow fainter, expand; so his eyes seemed rounding and rounding, like the rings of Eternity. An awe that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this waning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as any beheld who were bystanders when Zoroaster died. For whatever is truly wondrous and fearful in man, never yet was put into words or books. And the drawing near of Death, which alike levels all, alike impresses all with a last revelation, which only an author from the dead could adequately tell. So that\u2014let us say it again\u2014no dying Chaldee or Greek had higher and holier thoughts than those, whose mysterious shades you saw creeping over the face of poor Queequeg, as he quietly lay in his swaying hammock, and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his final rest, and the ocean\u2019s invisible flood-tide lifted him higher and higher towards his destined heaven."], "For what werewhales primarily hunted?": [" No more White Whales for me; I\u2019ve lowered for him once, and that has satisfied me. There would be great glory in killing him, I know that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm in him, but, hark ye, he\u2019s best let alone; don\u2019t you think so, Captain?\u201d\u2014glancing at the ivory leg. \u201cHe is. But he will still be hunted, for all that. What is best let alone, that accursed thing is not always what least allures. He\u2019s all a magnet! How long since thou saw\u2019st him last? Which way heading?\u201d \u201cBless my soul, and curse the foul fiend\u2019s,\u201d cried Bunger, stoopingly walking round Ahab, and like a dog, strangely snuffing; \u201cthis man\u2019s blood\u2014bring the thermometer!\u2014it\u2019s at the boiling point!\u2014his pulse makes these planks beat!\u2014sir!\u201d\u2014taking a lancet from his pocket, and drawing near to Ahab\u2019s arm. \u201cAvast!\u201d roared Ahab, dashing him against the bulwarks\u2014\u201cMan the boat! Which way heading?\u201d \u201cGood God!\u201d cried the English Captain, to whom the question was put.", " But nothing like this, in the present case, had been done. The carcases of both whales had dropped astern; and the head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of overburdening panniers. Meantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale\u2019s head, and ever and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own hand. And Ahab chanced so to stand, that the Parsee occupied his shadow; while, if the Parsee\u2019s shadow was there at all it seemed only to blend with, and lengthen Ahab\u2019s. As the crew toiled on, Laplandish speculations were bandied among them, concerning all these passing things. CHAPTER 74. The Sperm Whale\u2019s Head\u2014Contrasted View. Here, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us join them, and lay together our own. Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale are by far the most noteworthy. They are the only whales regularly hunted by man.", " Not the raw recruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever heat of his first battle; not the dead man\u2019s ghost encountering the first unknown phantom in the other world;\u2014neither of these can feel stranger and stronger emotions than that man does, who for the first time finds himself pulling into the charmed, churned circle of the hunted sperm whale. The dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more visible, owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud-shadows flung upon the sea. The jets of vapor no longer blended, but tilted everywhere to right and left; the whales seemed separating their wakes. The boats were pulled more apart; Starbuck giving chase to three whales running dead to leeward. Our sail was now set, and, with the still rising wind, we rushed along; the boat going with such madness through the water, that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from the row-locks.", " How long, prior to the year of our Lord 1775, this great whaling house was in existence, my numerous fish-documents do not make plain; but in that year (1775) it fitted out the first English ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale; though for some score of years previous (ever since 1726) our valiant Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in large fleets pursued that Leviathan, but only in the North and South Atlantic: not elsewhere. Be it distinctly recorded here, that the Nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great Sperm Whale; and that for half a century they were the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him. In 1778, a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose, and at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded Cape Horn, and was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of any sort in the great South Sea."], "Which of the followingcharacters falls overboard and goes insane as a result?": [" A soul\u2019s a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon.\u201d \u201cWhat are you jabbering about, shipmate?\u201d said I. \u201c_He\u2019s_ got enough, though, to make up for all deficiencies of that sort in other chaps,\u201d abruptly said the stranger, placing a nervous emphasis upon the word _he_. \u201cQueequeg,\u201d said I, \u201clet\u2019s go; this fellow has broken loose from somewhere; he\u2019s talking about something and somebody we don\u2019t know.\u201d \u201cStop!\u201d cried the stranger. \u201cYe said true\u2014ye hav\u2019n\u2019t seen Old Thunder yet, have ye?\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s Old Thunder?\u201d said I, again riveted with the insane earnestness of his manner. \u201cCaptain Ahab.\u201d \u201cWhat! the captain of our ship, the Pequod?\u201d \u201cAye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by that name. Ye hav\u2019n\u2019t seen him yet, have ye?\u201d \u201cNo, we hav\u2019n\u2019t. He\u2019s sick they say, but is getting better, and will be all right again before long.\u201d \u201cAll right again before long!\u201d laughed the stranger, with a solemnly derisive sort of laugh.", " A hot old man! I guess he\u2019s got what some folks ashore call a conscience; it\u2019s a kind of Tic-Dolly-row they say\u2014worse nor a toothache. Well, well; I don\u2019t know what it is, but the Lord keep me from catching it. He\u2019s full of riddles; I wonder what he goes into the after hold for, every night, as Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what\u2019s that for, I should like to know? Who\u2019s made appointments with him in the hold? Ain\u2019t that queer, now? But there\u2019s no telling, it\u2019s the old game\u2014Here goes for a snooze. Damn me, it\u2019s worth a fellow\u2019s while to be born into the world, if only to fall right asleep. And now that I think of it, that\u2019s about the first thing babies do, and that\u2019s a sort of queer, too. Damn me, but all things are queer, come to think of \u2019em. But that\u2019s against my principles. Think not, is my eleventh commandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfth\u2014So here goes again. But how\u2019s that?", " Besides, if you regard him very closely, and time him with your watch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration. But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out! You have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not tell water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the knottiest of all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely. The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it, when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading all around him.", " But no; there he was just where I had left him; he had not stirred an inch. I began to grow vexed with him; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room, holding a piece of wood on his head. \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and have some supper. You\u2019ll starve; you\u2019ll kill yourself, Queequeg.\u201d But not a word did he reply. Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep; and no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me. But previous to turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as it promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on. For some time, do all I would, I could not get into the faintest doze. I had blown out the candle; and the mere thought of Queequeg\u2014not four feet off\u2014sitting there in that uneasy position, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really wretched."], "Who rescues Tashtegowhen he falls overboard inside the whale\u2019s head?": [" \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you so?\u201d said Flask; \u201cyes, you\u2019ll soon see this right whale\u2019s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti\u2019s.\u201d In good time, Flask\u2019s saying proved true. As before, the Pequod steeply leaned over towards the sperm whale\u2019s head, now, by the counterpoise of both heads, she regained her even keel; though sorely strained, you may well believe. So, when on one side you hoist in Locke\u2019s head, you go over that way; but now, on the other side, hoist in Kant\u2019s and you come back again; but in very poor plight. Thus, some minds for ever keep trimming boat. Oh, ye foolish! throw all these thunder-heads overboard, and then you will float light and right. In disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the ship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the case of a sperm whale; only, in the latter instance, the head is cut off whole, but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck, with all the well known black bone attached to what is called the crown-piece.", " It is not necessary, hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the whale\u2019s belly, but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. And this seems reasonable enough in the good Bishop. For truly, the Right Whale\u2019s mouth would accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and comfortably seat all the players. Possibly, too, Jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right Whale is toothless. Another reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his want of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely in reference to his incarcerated body and the whale\u2019s gastric juices. But this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German exegetist supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a _dead_ whale\u2014even as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them.", " Besides, if you regard him very closely, and time him with your watch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration. But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out! You have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not tell water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the knottiest of all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely. The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it, when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading all around him.", " But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with that malicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted himself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat. Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled for an instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner of a biting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his mouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock. The bluish pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab\u2019s head, and reached higher than that. In this attitude the White Whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse. With unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms; but the tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other\u2019s heads to gain the uttermost stern."], "What does Ahabnail to the ship\u2019s mast to motivate his crew in his quest for MobyDick?": [" The Mast-Head. It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with the other seamen my first mast-head came round. In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost simultaneously with the vessel\u2019s leaving her port; even though she may have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground. And if, after a three, four, or five years\u2019 voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her\u2014say, an empty vial even\u2014then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last; and not till her skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port, does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more. Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a very ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate here. I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old Egyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to them.", " Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or pulpits, called _crow\u2019s-nests_, in which the look-outs of a Greenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas. In the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled \u201cA Voyage among the Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland;\u201d in this admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented _crow\u2019s-nest_ of the Glacier, which was the name of Captain Sleet\u2019s good craft. He called it the _Sleet\u2019s crow\u2019s-nest_, in honor of himself; he being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all ridiculous false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children after our own names (we fathers being the original inventors and patentees), so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget.", " For however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less capricious and unreliable\u2014they live in the varying outer weather, and they inhale its fickleness\u2014and when retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit, however promissory of life and passion in the end, it is above all things requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene and hold them healthily suspended for the final dash. Nor was Ahab unmindful of another thing. In times of strong emotion mankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are evanescent. The permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man, thought Ahab, is sordidness. Granting that the White Whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew, and playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generous knight-errantism in them, still, while for the love of it they give chase to Moby Dick, they must also have food for their more common, daily appetites.", " All down her sides, this spectral appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust, while all her spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred over with hoar-frost. Only her lower sails were set. A wild sight it was to see her long-bearded look-outs at those three mast-heads. They seemed clad in the skins of beasts, so torn and bepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four years of cruising. Standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast, they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea; and though, when the ship slowly glided close under our stern, we six men in the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped from the mast-heads of one ship to those of the other; yet, those forlorn-looking fishermen, mildly eyeing us as they passed, said not one word to our own look-outs, while the quarter-deck hail was being heard from below. \u201cShip ahoy! Have ye seen the White Whale?\u201d But as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid bulwarks, was in the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow fell from his hand into the sea; and the wind now rising amain, he in vain strove to make himself heard without it."], "Which of thefollowing characters survives the Pequod\u2019s sinking?": [" Aye, aye,\u201d cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter\u2019s heavy hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began slashing at the largest fluke-chains. But a few strokes, full of sparks, were given, when the exceeding strain effected the rest. With a terrific snap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted, the carcase sank. Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm Whale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted for it. Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great buoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the surface. If the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and broken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so sinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him.", " A line-of-battle ship could hardly keep him under then. In the Shore Whaling, on soundings, among the Bays of New Zealand, when a Right Whale gives token of sinking, they fasten buoys to him, with plenty of rope; so that when the body has gone down, they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again. It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from the Pequod\u2019s mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again lowering her boats; though the only spout in sight was that of a Fin-Back, belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because of its incredible power of swimming. Nevertheless, the Fin-Back\u2019s spout is so similar to the Sperm Whale\u2019s, that by unskilful fishermen it is often mistaken for it. And consequently Derick and all his host were now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute. The Virgin crowding all sail, made after her four young keels, and thus they all disappeared far to leeward, still in bold, hopeful chase.", " The sea-vultures all in pious mourning, the air-sharks all punctiliously in black or speckled. In life but few of them would have helped the whale, I ween, if peradventure he had needed it; but upon the banquet of his funeral they most piously do pounce. Oh, horrible vultureism of earth! from which not the mightiest whale is free. Nor is this the end. Desecrated as the body is, a vengeful ghost survives and hovers over it to scare. Espied by some timid man-of-war or blundering discovery-vessel from afar, when the distance obscuring the swarming fowls, nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in the sun, and the white spray heaving high against it; straightway the whale\u2019s unharming corpse, with trembling fingers is set down in the log\u2014_shoals, rocks, and breakers hereabouts: beware!_ And for years afterwards, perhaps, ships shun the place; leaping over it as silly sheep leap over a vacuum, because their leader originally leaped there when a stick was held.", " Nor is this all. In some instances, to the quick, observant eye, those linear marks, as in a veritable engraving, but afford the ground for far other delineations. These are hieroglyphical; that is, if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics, then that is the proper word to use in the present connexion. By my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular, I was much struck with a plate representing the old Indian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the Upper Mississippi. Like those mystic rocks, too, the mystic-marked whale remains undecipherable. This allusion to the Indian rocks reminds me of another thing. Besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the Sperm Whale presents, he not seldom displays the back, and more especially his flanks, effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance, by reason of numerous rude scratches, altogether of an irregular, random aspect."], "What keeps Ishmaelafloat after the Pequod sinks?": [" Midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and boxing, riding and rowing. I know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header\u2019s will be sure to seem incredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may have either seen or heard of some one\u2019s falling into a cistern ashore; an accident which not seldom happens, and with much less reason too than the Indian\u2019s, considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the Sperm Whale\u2019s well. But, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this? We thought the tissued, infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale, was the lightest and most corky part about him; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of a far greater specific gravity than itself. We have thee there. Not at all, but I have ye; for at the time poor Tash fell in, the case had been nearly emptied of its lighter contents, leaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the well\u2014a double welded, hammered substance, as I have before said, much heavier than the sea water, and a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost.", " The Pequod\u2019s signal was at last responded to by the stranger\u2019s setting her own; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket. Squaring her yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under the Pequod\u2019s lee, and lowered a boat; it soon drew nigh; but, as the side-ladder was being rigged by Starbuck\u2019s order to accommodate the visiting captain, the stranger in question waved his hand from his boat\u2019s stern in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary. It turned out that the Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board, and that Mayhew, her captain, was fearful of infecting the Pequod\u2019s company. For, though himself and boat\u2019s crew remained untainted, and though his ship was half a rifle-shot off, and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between; yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the land, he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the Pequod.", " That certain sultanism of his brain, which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested; through those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship. For be a man\u2019s intellectual superiority what it will, it can never assume the practical, available supremacy over other men, without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments, always, in themselves, more or less paltry and base. This it is, that for ever keeps God\u2019s true princes of the Empire from the world\u2019s hustings; and leaves the highest honors that this air can give, to those men who become famous more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the Divine Inert, than through their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass. Such large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political superstitions invest them, that in some royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency.", " However, it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands. Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found. \u201cAnd what dost thou want of Captain Ahab?

Of what precise species this sea-monster was, is not mentioned. But as he destroyed ships, as well as for other reasons, he must have been a whale; and I am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale. And I will tell you why. For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it. Even now I am certain that those seas are not, and perhaps never can be, in the present constitution of things, a place for his habitual gregarious resort. But further investigations have recently proved to me, that in modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am told, on good authority, that on the Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale.", " Good again; but then all confess that somehow whaling is not respectable. _Whaling not respectable?_ Whaling is imperial! By old English statutory law, the whale is declared \u201ca royal fish.\u201d * Oh, that\u2019s only nominal! The whale himself has never figured in any grand imposing way. _The whale never figured in any grand imposing way?_ In one of the mighty triumphs given to a Roman general upon his entering the world\u2019s capital, the bones of a whale, brought all the way from the Syrian coast, were the most conspicuous object in the cymballed procession. * *See subsequent chapters for something more on this head.

Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster attacked; therefore it was, that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps, for the most part, were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred, more, as it were, to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large, than to the individual cause. In that way, mostly, the disastrous encounter between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded.", " That instant, as he fell on the whale\u2019s slippery back, the boat righted, and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was tossed over into the sea, on the other flank of the whale. He struck out through the spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that veil, wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick. But the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer between his jaws; and rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again, and went down. \u201cMeantime, at the first tap of the boat\u2019s bottom, the Lakeman had slackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly looking on, he thought his own thoughts. But a sudden, terrific, downward jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line. He cut it; and the whale was free.

Whereas, among spouting fish the tail, though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal position. By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien. * Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish must be included in this ground-plan of Cetology. Now, then, come the grand divisions of the entire whale host. *I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins and Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are included by many naturalists among the whales. But as these pig-fish are a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers, and feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout, I deny their credentials as whales; and have presented them with their passports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology.", " To the Nantucketer, they present the two extremes of all the known varieties of the whale. As the external difference between them is mainly observable in their heads; and as a head of each is this moment hanging from the Pequod\u2019s side; and as we may freely go from one to the other, by merely stepping across the deck:\u2014where, I should like to know, will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology than here? In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between these heads. Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a certain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale\u2019s which the Right Whale\u2019s sadly lacks. There is more character in the Sperm Whale\u2019s head. As you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him, in point of pervading dignity. In the present instance, too, this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit, giving token of advanced age and large experience.", " I snored; rolled over; and there I was in my hammock!

But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that trifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom\u2014for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; _how_ it was I never could find out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles\u2014leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping.", " He was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms. The profoundest slumber slept upon him. \u201cThose sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?\u201d said I, looking dubiously at the sleeper. But it seemed that, when on the wharf, Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter, were it not for Elijah\u2019s otherwise inexplicable question. But I beat the thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted to Queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body; telling him to establish himself accordingly. He put his hand upon the sleeper\u2019s rear, as though feeling if it was soft enough; and then, without more ado, sat quietly down there. \u201cGracious! Queequeg, don\u2019t sit there,\u201d said I. \u201cOh! perry dood seat,\u201d said Queequeg, \u201cmy country way; won\u2019t hurt him face.\u201d \u201cFace!\u201d said I, \u201ccall that his face?", " I hold it to be the wondrously thin, ruptured membranes of the case, coalescing. Gurry, so called, is a term properly belonging to right whalemen, but sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen. It designates the dark, glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the Greenland or right whale, and much of which covers the decks of those inferior souls who hunt that ignoble Leviathan. Nippers. Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale\u2019s vocabulary. But as applied by whalemen, it becomes so. A whaleman\u2019s nipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of Leviathan\u2019s tail: it averages an inch in thickness, and for the rest, is about the size of the iron part of a hoe. Edgewise moved along the oily deck, it operates like a leathern squilgee; and by nameless blandishments, as of magic, allures along with it all impurities. But to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way is at once to descend into the blubber-room, and have a long talk with its inmates.", " The first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with Portuguese vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow. That same ocean rolls now; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships of last year. Yea, foolish mortals, Noah\u2019s flood is not yet subsided; two thirds of the fair world it yet covers. Wherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a miracle upon the other? Preternatural terrors rested upon the Hebrews, when under the feet of Korah and his company the live ground opened and swallowed them up for ever; yet not a modern sun ever sets, but in precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews. But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but it is also a fiend to its own off-spring; worse than the Persian host who murdered his own guests; sparing not the creatures which itself hath spawned. Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs, so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks, and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships."], "What does Ishmaelhave tattooed on his forearm?": [" But at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks. They were stains of some sort or other. At first I knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. I remembered a story of a white man\u2014a whaleman too\u2014who, falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And what is it, thought I, after all! It\u2019s only his outside; a man can be honest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely independent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot sun\u2019s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one.", " We had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs over mine, and then drawing them back; so entirely sociable and free and easy were we; when, at last, by reason of our confabulations, what little nappishness remained in us altogether departed, and we felt like getting up again, though day-break was yet some way down the future. Yes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position began to grow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up; the clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the head-board with our four knees drawn up close together, and our two noses bending over them, as if our kneepans were warming-pans. We felt very nice and snug, the more so since it was so chilly out of doors; indeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing that there was no fire in the room.", " You had almost thought I had been his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure, no two parts of which were of one precise shade\u2014owing I suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times\u2014this same arm of his, I say, looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt. Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I could hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues together; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that Queequeg was hugging me. My sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me; whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle.", " CHAPTER 18. His Mark. As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal, and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft, unless they previously produced their papers. \u201cWhat do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?\u201d said I, now jumping on the bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf. \u201cI mean,\u201d he replied, \u201che must show his papers.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head from behind Peleg\u2019s, out of the wigwam. \u201cHe must show that he\u2019s converted. Son of darkness,\u201d he added, turning to Queequeg, \u201cart thou at present in communion with any Christian church?\u201d \u201cWhy,\u201d said I, \u201che\u2019s a member of the first Congregational Church.\u201d Here be it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at last come to be converted into the churches."], "With what isthe Pequod adorned?": [" But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place, borrowed from the chaplain\u2019s former sea-farings. Between the marble cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers. But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds, there floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel\u2019s face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ship\u2019s tossed deck, something like that silver plate now inserted into the Victory\u2019s plank where Nelson fell. \u201cAh, noble ship,\u201d the angel seemed to say, \u201cbeat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy helm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the clouds are rolling off\u2014serenest azure is at hand.\u201d Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that had achieved the ladder and the picture.", " The Pequod\u2019s signal was at last responded to by the stranger\u2019s setting her own; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket. Squaring her yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under the Pequod\u2019s lee, and lowered a boat; it soon drew nigh; but, as the side-ladder was being rigged by Starbuck\u2019s order to accommodate the visiting captain, the stranger in question waved his hand from his boat\u2019s stern in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary. It turned out that the Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board, and that Mayhew, her captain, was fearful of infecting the Pequod\u2019s company. For, though himself and boat\u2019s crew remained untainted, and though his ship was half a rifle-shot off, and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between; yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the land, he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the Pequod.", " Upon the passage homewards, they drop them there again. How it is, there is no telling, but Islanders seem to make the best whalemen. They were nearly all Islanders in the Pequod, _Isolatoes_ too, I call such, not acknowledging the common continent of men, but each _Isolato_ living on a separate continent of his own. Yet now, federated along one keel, what a set these Isolatoes were! An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea, and all the ends of the earth, accompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod to lay the world\u2019s grievances before that bar from which not very many of them ever come back. Black Little Pip\u2014he never did\u2014oh, no! he went before. Poor Alabama boy! On the grim Pequod\u2019s forecastle, ye shall ere long see him, beating his tambourine; prelusive of the eternal time, when sent for, to the great quarter-deck on high, he was bid strike in with angels, and beat his tambourine in glory; called a coward here, hailed a hero there!", " Next day, a large ship, the Rachel, was descried, bearing directly down upon the Pequod, all her spars thickly clustering with men. At the time the Pequod was making good speed through the water; but as the broad-winged windward stranger shot nigh to her, the boastful sails all fell together as blank bladders that are burst, and all life fled from the smitten hull. \u201cBad news; she brings bad news,\u201d muttered the old Manxman. But ere her commander, who, with trumpet to mouth, stood up in his boat; ere he could hopefully hail, Ahab\u2019s voice was heard. \u201cHast seen the White Whale?\u201d \u201cAye, yesterday. Have ye seen a whale-boat adrift?\u201d Throttling his joy, Ahab negatively answered this unexpected question; and would then have fain boarded the stranger, when the stranger captain himself, having stopped his vessel\u2019s way, was seen descending her side. A few keen pulls, and his boat-hook soon clinched the Pequod\u2019s main-chains, and he sprang to the deck."], "From what isAhab\u2019s false leg made?": [" I\u2019ll smoke no more\u2014\u201d He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea. The fire hissed in the waves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made. With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the planks. CHAPTER 31. Queen Mab. Next morning Stubb accosted Flask. \u201cSuch a queer dream, King-Post, I never had. You know the old man\u2019s ivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to kick back, upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And then, presto! Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept kicking at it. But what was still more curious, Flask\u2014you know how curious all dreams are\u2014through all this rage that I was in, I somehow seemed to be thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an insult, that kick from Ahab. \u2018Why,\u2019 thinks I, \u2018what\u2019s the row? It\u2019s not a real leg, only a false leg.\u2019 And there\u2019s a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump.", " And here\u2019s his leg! Yes, now that I think of it, here\u2019s his bedfellow! has a stick of whale\u2019s jaw-bone for a wife! And this is his leg; he\u2019ll stand on this. What was that now about one leg standing in three places, and all three places standing in one hell\u2014how was that? Oh! I don\u2019t wonder he looked so scornful at me! I\u2019m a sort of strange-thoughted sometimes, they say; but that\u2019s only haphazard-like. Then, a short, little old body like me, should never undertake to wade out into deep waters with tall, heron-built captains; the water chucks you under the chin pretty quick, and there\u2019s a great cry for life-boats. And here\u2019s the heron\u2019s leg! long and slim, sure enough! Now, for most folks one pair of legs lasts a lifetime, and that must be because they use them mercifully, as a tender-hearted old lady uses her roly-poly old coach-horses. But Ahab; oh he\u2019s a hard driver. Look, driven one leg to death, and spavined the other for life, and now wears out bone legs by the cord.", " Halloa, there, you Smut! bear a hand there with those screws, and let\u2019s finish it before the resurrection fellow comes a-calling with his horn for all legs, true or false, as brewery-men go round collecting old beer barrels, to fill \u2019em up again. What a leg this is! It looks like a real live leg, filed down to nothing but the core; he\u2019ll be standing on this to-morrow; he\u2019ll be taking altitudes on it. Halloa! I almost forgot the little oval slate, smoothed ivory, where he figures up the latitude. So, so; chisel, file, and sand-paper, now! CHAPTER 109. Ahab and Starbuck in the Cabin. According to usage they were pumping the ship next morning; and lo! no inconsiderable oil came up with the water; the casks below must have sprung a bad leak. Much concern was shown; and Starbuck went down into the cabin to report this unfavourable affair. * *In Sperm-whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board, it is a regular semi-weekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold, and drench the casks with sea-water; which afterwards, at varying intervals, is removed by the ship\u2019s pumps.", " Soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan head. With his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome, the other captain advanced, and Ahab, putting out his ivory leg, and crossing the ivory arm (like two sword-fish blades) cried out in his walrus way, \u201cAye, aye, hearty! let us shake bones together!\u2014an arm and a leg!\u2014an arm that never can shrink, d\u2019ye see; and a leg that never can run. Where did\u2019st thou see the White Whale?\u2014how long ago?\u201d \u201cThe White Whale,\u201d said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm towards the East, and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had been a telescope; \u201cthere I saw him, on the Line, last season.\u201d \u201cAnd he took that arm off, did he?\u201d asked Ahab, now sliding down from the capstan, and resting on the Englishman\u2019s shoulder, as he did so. \u201cAye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?\u201d \u201cSpin me the yarn,\u201d said Ahab; \u201chow was it?\u201d \u201cIt was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line,\u201d began the Englishman."], "With which ofthe following characters does Ishmael share a bed at the Spouter-Inn?": [" Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra than here? Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in order to keep out this frost? Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be moored to one of the Moluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a president of a temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans. But no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there is plenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our frosted feet, and see what sort of a place this \u201cSpouter\u201d may be. CHAPTER 3. The Spouter-Inn. Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide, low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft.", " It was a negro church; and the preacher\u2019s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing out, Wretched entertainment at the sign of \u2018The Trap!\u2019 Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words underneath\u2014\u201cThe Spouter Inn:\u2014Peter Coffin.\u201d Coffin?\u2014Spouter?\u2014Rather ominous in that particular connexion, thought I. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose this Peter here is an emigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.", " And where but from Nantucket, too, did that first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported cobblestones\u2014so goes the story\u2014to throw at the whales, in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit? Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold and cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,\u2014So, wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the south\u2014wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire the price, and don\u2019t be too particular.", " I have striven to be Thine, more than to be this world\u2019s, or mine own. Yet this is nothing: I leave eternity to Thee; for what is man that he should live out the lifetime of his God?\u201d He said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face with his hands, and so remained kneeling, till all the people had departed, and he was left alone in the place. CHAPTER 10. A Bosom Friend. Returning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there quite alone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some time. He was sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on the stove hearth, and in one hand was holding close up to his face that little negro idol of his; peering hard into its face, and with a jack-knife gently whittling away at its nose, meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way. But being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon, going to the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his lap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every fiftieth page\u2014as I fancied\u2014stopping a moment, looking vacantly around him, and giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment."], "Out of what isFedallah\u2019s turban made?": [" And yet, though herds of whales were seen by night, not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them. You may think with what emotions, then, the seamen beheld this old Oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours; his turban and the moon, companions in one sky. But when, after spending his uniform interval there for several successive nights without uttering a single sound; when, after all this silence, his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery, moon-lit jet, every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit had lighted in the rigging, and hailed the mortal crew. \u201cThere she blows!\u201d Had the trump of judgment blown, they could not have quivered more; yet still they felt no terror; rather pleasure. For though it was a most unwonted hour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so deliriously exciting, that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a lowering.", " This boat had always been deemed one of the spare boats, though technically called the captain\u2019s, on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter. The figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart, with one white tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips. A rumpled Chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him, with wide black trowsers of the same dark stuff. But strangely crowning this ebonness was a glistening white plaited turban, the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his head. Less swart in aspect, the companions of this figure were of that vivid, tiger-yellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the Manillas;\u2014a race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty, and by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents on the water of the devil, their lord, whose counting-room they suppose to be elsewhere.", " Meantime, of the broken keel of Ahab\u2019s wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg; while still as on the night before, slouched Ahab stood fixed within his scuttle; his hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial; sat due eastward for the earliest sun. CHAPTER 135. The Chase.\u2014Third Day. The morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once more the solitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowds of the daylight look-outs, who dotted every mast and almost every spar. \u201cD\u2019ye see him?\u201d cried Ahab; but the whale was not yet in sight. \u201cIn his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, that\u2019s all. Helm there; steady, as thou goest, and hast been going. What a lovely day again! were it a new-made world, and made for a summer-house to the angels, and this morning the first of its throwing open to them, a fairer day could not dawn upon that world.", " Being returned home at last, Captain Pollard once more sailed for the Pacific in command of another ship, but the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers; for the second time his ship was utterly lost, and forthwith forswearing the sea, he has never tempted it since. At this day Captain Pollard is a resident of Nantucket. I have seen Owen Chace, who was chief mate of the Essex at the time of the tragedy; I have read his plain and faithful narrative; I have conversed with his son; and all this within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe. * *The following are extracts from Chace\u2019s narrative: \u201cEvery fact seemed to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which directed his operations; he made two several attacks upon the ship, at a short interval between them, both of which, according to their direction, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being made ahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the shock; to effect which, the exact man\u0153uvres which he made were necessary."], "How does the Pequod sink?": [" \u201c\u2018Come out of that, ye pirates!\u2019 roared the captain, now menacing them with a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward. \u2018Come out of that, ye cut-throats!\u2019 \u201cSteelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there, defied the worst the pistols could do; but gave the captain to understand distinctly, that his (Steelkilt\u2019s) death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands. Fearing in his heart lest this might prove but too true, the captain a little desisted, but still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty. \u201c\u2018Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?\u2019 demanded their ringleader. \u201c\u2018Turn to! turn to!\u2014I make no promise;\u2014to your duty! Do you want to sink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this? Turn to!\u2019 and he once more raised a pistol. \u201c\u2018Sink the ship?\u2019 cried Steelkilt. \u2018Aye, let her sink. Not a man of us turns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us.", " The Pequod\u2019s signal was at last responded to by the stranger\u2019s setting her own; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket. Squaring her yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under the Pequod\u2019s lee, and lowered a boat; it soon drew nigh; but, as the side-ladder was being rigged by Starbuck\u2019s order to accommodate the visiting captain, the stranger in question waved his hand from his boat\u2019s stern in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary.

To cross to the other side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house. The ship groaned and gasped. Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started from their places, by the unnatural dislocation. In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timberheads; and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all approached, while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on the point of going over. \u201cHold on, hold on, won\u2019t ye?\u201d cried Stubb to the body, \u201cdon\u2019t be in such a devil of a hurry to sink! By thunder, men, we must do something or go for it. No use prying there; avast, I say with your handspikes, and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and cut the big chains.\u201d \u201cKnife?", " Think of that! When every moment we thought the ship would sink! Death and the Judgment then? What? With all three masts making such an everlasting thundering against the side; and every sea breaking over us, fore and aft. Think of Death and the Judgment then? No! no time to think about Death then. Life was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking of; and how to save all hands\u2014how to rig jury-masts\u2014how to get into the nearest port; that was what I was thinking of.\u201d Bildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck, where we followed him. There he stood, very quietly overlooking some sailmakers who were mending a top-sail in the waist. Now and then he stooped to pick up a patch, or save an end of tarred twine, which otherwise might have been wasted. CHAPTER 19. The Prophet. \u201cShipmates, have ye shipped in that ship?\u201d Queequeg and I had just left the Pequod, and were sauntering away from the water, for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts, when the above words were put to us by a stranger, who, pausing before us, levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question."], "Who owns the Pequod?": [" That Himmalehan, salt-sea Mastodon, clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power, that his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults! And thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing from their ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery world like so many Alexanders; parcelling out among them the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, as the three pirate powers did Poland. Let America add Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada; let the English overswarm all India, and hang out their blazing banner from the sun; two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer\u2019s. For the sea is his; he owns it, as Emperors own empires; other seamen having but a right of way through it. Merchant ships are but extension bridges; armed ones but floating forts; even pirates and privateers, though following the sea as highwaymen the road, they but plunder other ships, other fragments of the land like themselves, without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless deep itself.", " The Pequod\u2019s signal was at last responded to by the stranger\u2019s setting her own; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket.

It turned out that the Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board, and that Mayhew, her captain, was fearful of infecting the Pequod\u2019s company. For, though himself and boat\u2019s crew remained untainted, and though his ship was half a rifle-shot off, and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between; yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the land, he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the Pequod.", " Upon the passage homewards, they drop them there again. How it is, there is no telling, but Islanders seem to make the best whalemen. They were nearly all Islanders in the Pequod, _Isolatoes_ too, I call such, not acknowledging the common continent of men, but each _Isolato_ living on a separate continent of his own. Yet now, federated along one keel, what a set these Isolatoes were! An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea, and all the ends of the earth, accompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod to lay the world\u2019s grievances before that bar from which not very many of them ever come back. Black Little Pip\u2014he never did\u2014oh, no! he went before. Poor Alabama boy! On the grim Pequod\u2019s forecastle, ye shall ere long see him, beating his tambourine; prelusive of the eternal time, when sent for, to the great quarter-deck on high, he was bid strike in with angels, and beat his tambourine in glory; called a coward here, hailed a hero there!", " Next day, a large ship, the Rachel, was descried, bearing directly down upon the Pequod, all her spars thickly clustering with men. At the time the Pequod was making good speed through the water; but as the broad-winged windward stranger shot nigh to her, the boastful sails all fell together as blank bladders that are burst, and all life fled from the smitten hull. \u201cBad news; she brings bad news,\u201d muttered the old Manxman. But ere her commander, who, with trumpet to mouth, stood up in his boat; ere he could hopefully hail, Ahab\u2019s voice was heard. \u201cHast seen the White Whale?\u201d \u201cAye, yesterday. Have ye seen a whale-boat adrift?\u201d Throttling his joy, Ahab negatively answered this unexpected question; and would then have fain boarded the stranger, when the stranger captain himself, having stopped his vessel\u2019s way, was seen descending her side. A few keen pulls, and his boat-hook soon clinched the Pequod\u2019s main-chains, and he sprang to the deck."], "With what doesQueequeg sleep?": [" And when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely multiply. Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they all sleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, and cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin. The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the thought of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of the tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all over. Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at midnight\u2014how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?", " His voice at once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine stature, I thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height, this man slipped away unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea. In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a huge favourite with them, they raised a cry of \u201cBulkington! Bulkington! where\u2019s Bulkington?\u201d and darted out of the house in pursuit of him. It was now about nine o\u2019clock, and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen. No man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother. I don\u2019t know how it is, but people like to be private when they are sleeping.", " Sleeping? Aye, toil we how we may, we all sleep at last on the field. Sleep? Aye, and rust amid greenness; as last year\u2019s scythes flung down, and left in the half-cut swaths\u2014Starbuck!\u201d But blanched to a corpse\u2019s hue with despair, the Mate had stolen away. Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side; but started at two reflected, fixed eyes in the water there. Fedallah was motionlessly leaning over the same rail. CHAPTER 133. The Chase\u2014First Day. That night, in the mid-watch, when the old man\u2014as his wont at intervals\u2014stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned, and went to his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely, snuffing up the sea air as a sagacious ship\u2019s dog will, in drawing nigh to some barbarous isle. He declared that a whale must be near. Soon that peculiar odor, sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living sperm whale, was palpable to all the watch; nor was any mariner surprised when, after inspecting the compass, and then the dog-vane, and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as possible, Ahab rapidly ordered the ship\u2019s course to be slightly altered, and the sail to be shortened.", " If, then, he were this instant\u2014put aside, that crime would not be his. Ha! is he muttering in his sleep? Yes, just there,\u2014in there, he\u2019s sleeping. Sleeping? aye, but still alive, and soon awake again. I can\u2019t withstand thee, then, old man. Not reasoning; not remonstrance; not entreaty wilt thou hearken to; all this thou scornest. Flat obedience to thy own flat commands, this is all thou breathest. Aye, and say\u2019st the men have vow\u2019d thy vow; say\u2019st all of us are Ahabs. Great God forbid!\u2014But is there no other way? no lawful way?\u2014Make him a prisoner to be taken home? What! hope to wrest this old man\u2019s living power from his own living hands? Only a fool would try it. Say he were pinioned even; knotted all over with ropes and hawsers; chained down to ring-bolts on this cabin floor; he would be more hideous than a caged tiger, then. I could not endure the sight; could not possibly fly his howlings; all comfort, sleep itself, inestimable reason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage."], "Ahab\u2019s matesinclude": [" However, it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands. Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found. \u201cAnd what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It\u2019s all right enough; thou art shipped.\u201d \u201cYes, but I should like to see him.\u201d \u201cBut I don\u2019t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the house; a sort of sick, and yet he don\u2019t look so. In fact, he ain\u2019t sick; but no, he isn\u2019t well either. Any how, young man, he won\u2019t always see me, so I don\u2019t suppose he will thee. He\u2019s a queer man, Captain Ahab\u2014so some think\u2014but a good one. Oh, thou\u2019lt like him well enough; no fear, no fear. He\u2019s a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab; doesn\u2019t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen. Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab\u2019s above the common; Ahab\u2019s been in colleges, as well as \u2019mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than whales.", " At times, for longest hours, without a single hail, they stood far parted in the starlight; Ahab in his scuttle, the Parsee by the mainmast; but still fixedly gazing upon each other; as if in the Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in Ahab the Parsee his abandoned substance. And yet, somehow, did Ahab\u2014in his own proper self, as daily, hourly, and every instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,\u2014Ahab seemed an independent lord; the Parsee but his slave. Still again both seemed yoked together, and an unseen tyrant driving them; the lean shade siding the solid rib. For be this Parsee what he may, all rib and keel was solid Ahab. At the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was heard from aft,\u2014\u201cMan the mast-heads!\u201d\u2014and all through the day, till after sunset and after twilight, the same voice every hour, at the striking of the helmsman\u2019s bell, was heard\u2014\u201cWhat d\u2019ye see?\u2014sharp!", " But, mastering his emotion, he half calmly rose, and as he quitted the cabin, paused for an instant and said: \u201cThou hast outraged, not insulted me, sir; but for that I ask thee not to beware of Starbuck; thou wouldst but laugh; but let Ahab beware of Ahab; beware of thyself, old man.\u201d \u201cHe waxes brave, but nevertheless obeys; most careful bravery that!\u201d murmured Ahab, as Starbuck disappeared. \u201cWhat\u2019s that he said\u2014Ahab beware of Ahab\u2014there\u2019s something there!\u201d Then unconsciously using the musket for a staff, with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little cabin; but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed, and returning the gun to the rack, he went to the deck. \u201cThou art but too good a fellow, Starbuck,\u201d he said lowly to the mate; then raising his voice to the crew: \u201cFurl the t\u2019gallant-sails, and close-reef the top-sails, fore and aft; back the main-yard; up Burton, and break out in the main-hold.\u201d It were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was, that as respecting Starbuck, Ahab thus acted.", " Before this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, was now pausing. \u201cThere\u2019s something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers, and all other grand and lofty things; look here,\u2014three peaks as proud as Lucifer. The firm tower, that is Ahab; the volcano, that is Ahab; the courageous, the undaunted, and victorious fowl, that, too, is Ahab; all are Ahab; and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe, which, like a magician\u2019s glass, to each and every man in turn but mirrors back his own mysterious self. Great pains, small gains for those who ask the world to solve them; it cannot solve itself. Methinks now this coined sun wears a ruddy face; but see! aye, he enters the sign of storms, the equinox! and but six months before he wheeled out of a former equinox at Aries! From storm to storm! So be it, then. Born in throes, \u2019tis fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs!"], "What does Ahabsee when he studies the gold doubloon nailed to the mast?": [" Now this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of the heart of gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over golden sands, the head-waters of many a Pactolus flows. And though now nailed amidst all the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes, yet, untouchable and immaculate to any foulness, it still preserved its Quito glow. Nor, though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands, and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach, nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last. For it was set apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end; and however wanton in their sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as the white whale\u2019s talisman. Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night, wondering whose it was to be at last, and whether he would ever live to spend it.", " So, so; he\u2019s beginning.\u201d \u201cI see nothing here, but a round thing made of gold, and whoever raises a certain whale, this round thing belongs to him. So, what\u2019s all this staring been about? It is worth sixteen dollars, that\u2019s true; and at two cents the cigar, that\u2019s nine hundred and sixty cigars. I won\u2019t smoke dirty pipes like Stubb, but I like cigars, and here\u2019s nine hundred and sixty of them; so here goes Flask aloft to spy \u2019em out.\u201d \u201cShall I call that wise or foolish, now; if it be really wise it has a foolish look to it; yet, if it be really foolish, then has it a sort of wiseish look to it. But, avast; here comes our old Manxman\u2014the old hearse-driver, he must have been, that is, before he took to the sea. He luffs up before the doubloon; halloa, and goes round on the other side of the mast; why, there\u2019s a horse-shoe nailed on that side; and now he\u2019s back again; what does that mean? Hark!", " Then again, if it stays here, that is ugly, too, for when aught\u2019s nailed to the mast it\u2019s a sign that things grow desperate. Ha, ha! old Ahab! the White Whale; he\u2019ll nail ye! This is a pine tree. My father, in old Tolland county, cut down a pine tree once, and found a silver ring grown over in it; some old darkey\u2019s wedding ring. How did it get there? And so they\u2019ll say in the resurrection, when they come to fish up this old mast, and find a doubloon lodged in it, with bedded oysters for the shaggy bark. Oh, the gold! the precious, precious, gold! the green miser\u2019ll hoard ye soon! Hish! hish! God goes \u2019mong the worlds blackberrying. Cook! ho, cook! and cook us! Jenny! hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Jenny, Jenny! and get your hoe-cake done!\u201d CHAPTER 100. Leg and Arm. The Pequod, of Nantucket, Meets the Samuel Enderby, of London. \u201cShip, ahoy! Hast seen the White Whale?\u201d So cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colours, bearing down under the stern.", " D\u2019ye see it? Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul.\u201d While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if to heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him. Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the main-mast with the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold with the other, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: \u201cWhosoever of ye raises me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw; whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with three holes punctured in his starboard fluke\u2014look ye, whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my boys!\u201d \u201cHuzza! huzza!\u201d cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast."], "Who is telling the story in the novel?": [" Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this historical story of Jonah and the whale. But then there were some sceptical Greeks and Romans, who, standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times, equally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale, and Arion and the dolphin; and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts, for all that. One old Sag-Harbor whaleman\u2019s chief reason for questioning the Hebrew story was this:\u2014He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles, embellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which represented Jonah\u2019s whale with two spouts in his head\u2014a peculiarity only true with respect to a species of the Leviathan (the Right Whale, and the varieties of that order), concerning which the fishermen have this saying, \u201cA penny roll would choke him\u201d; his swallow is so very small. But, to this, Bishop Jebb\u2019s anticipative answer is ready.", " It nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish, unless, indeed, from the inside. Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of involuntary whaleman; at any rate the whale caught him, if he did not the whale. I claim him for one of our clan. But, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story of Hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale; and vice vers\u00e2; certainly they are very similar. If I claim the demi-god then, why not the prophet? Nor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the whole roll of our order. Our grand master is still to be named; for like royal kings of old times, we find the head waters of our fraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves. That wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the Shaster, which gives us the dread Vishnoo, one of the three persons in the godhead of the Hindoos; gives us this divine Vishnoo himself for our Lord;\u2014Vishnoo, who, by the first of his ten earthly incarnations, has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale.", " Every one knows the fine story of Perseus and Andromeda; how the lovely Andromeda, the daughter of a king, was tied to a rock on the sea-coast, and as Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off, Perseus, the prince of whalemen, intrepidly advancing, harpooned the monster, and delivered and married the maid. It was an admirable artistic exploit, rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day; inasmuch as this Leviathan was slain at the very first dart. And let no man doubt this Arkite story; for in the ancient Joppa, now Jaffa, on the Syrian coast, in one of the Pagan temples, there stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale, which the city\u2019s legends and all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that Perseus slew. When the Romans took Joppa, the same skeleton was carried to Italy in triumph. What seems most singular and suggestively important in this story, is this: it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail.", " Stubb, you are skylarking; how can Fedallah do that?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked one, I tell ye. Why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the old flag-ship once, switching his tail about devilish easy and gentlemanlike, and inquiring if the old governor was at home. Well, he was at home, and asked the devil what he wanted. The devil, switching his hoofs, up and says, \u2018I want John.\u2019 \u2018What for?\u2019 says the old governor. \u2018What business is that of yours,\u2019 says the devil, getting mad,\u2014\u2018I want to use him.\u2019 \u2018Take him,\u2019 says the governor\u2014and by the Lord, Flask, if the devil didn\u2019t give John the Asiatic cholera before he got through with him, I\u2019ll eat this whale in one mouthful. But look sharp\u2014ain\u2019t you all ready there? Well, then, pull ahead, and let\u2019s get the whale alongside.\u201d \u201cI think I remember some such story as you were telling,\u201d said Flask, when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden towards the ship, \u201cbut I can\u2019t remember where.\u201d \u201cThree Spaniards?"], "When does the Pequod set sail?": [" \u201c\u2018Who\u2019s there?\u2019 cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making out his papers for the Customs\u2014\u2018Who\u2019s there?\u2019 Oh! how that harmless question mangles Jonah! For the instant he almost turns to flee again. But he rallies. \u2018I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon sail ye, sir?\u2019 Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah, though the man now stands before him; but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance. \u2018We sail with the next coming tide,\u2019 at last he slowly answered, still intently eyeing him. \u2018No sooner, sir?\u2019\u2014\u2018Soon enough for any honest man that goes a passenger.\u2019 Ha! Jonah, that\u2019s another stab. But he swiftly calls away the Captain from that scent. \u2018I\u2019ll sail with ye,\u2019\u2014he says,\u2014\u2018the passage money how much is that?\u2014I\u2019ll pay now.\u2019 For it is particularly written, shipmates, as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history, \u2018that he paid the fare thereof\u2019 ere the craft did sail.", " Crowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers handling their weapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet suspended boats. If the wind only held, little doubt had they, that chased through these Straits of Sunda, the vast host would only deploy into the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their number. And who could tell whether, in that congregated caravan, Moby Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming, like the worshipped white-elephant in the coronation procession of the Siamese! So with stun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed along, driving these leviathans before us; when, of a sudden, the voice of Tashtego was heard, loudly directing attention to something in our wake. Corresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our rear. It seemed formed of detached white vapors, rising and falling something like the spouts of the whales; only they did not so completely come and go; for they constantly hovered, without finally disappearing.", " The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated at daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and lengthwise ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the pleated watery wrinkles bordering it, the polished metallic-like marks of some swift tide-rip, at the mouth of a deep, rapid stream. \u201cMan the mast-heads! Call all hands!\u201d Thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle deck, Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they seemed to exhale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did they appear with their clothes in their hands. \u201cWhat d\u2019ye see?\u201d cried Ahab, flattening his face to the sky. \u201cNothing, nothing sir!\u201d was the sound hailing down in reply. \u201cT\u2019gallant sails!\u2014stunsails! alow and aloft, and on both sides!\u201d All sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for swaying him to the main royal-mast head; and in a few moments they were hoisting him thither, when, while but two thirds of the way aloft, and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the main-top-sail and top-gallant-sail, he raised a gull-like cry in the air.", " \u201cHast seen the White Whale?\u201d gritted Ahab in reply. \u201cNo; only heard of him; but don\u2019t believe in him at all,\u201d said the other good-humoredly. \u201cCome aboard!\u201d \u201cThou art too damned jolly. Sail on. Hast lost any men?\u201d \u201cNot enough to speak of\u2014two islanders, that\u2019s all;\u2014but come aboard, old hearty, come along. I\u2019ll soon take that black from your brow. Come along, will ye (merry\u2019s the play); a full ship and homeward-bound.\u201d \u201cHow wondrous familiar is a fool!\u201d muttered Ahab; then aloud, \u201cThou art a full ship and homeward bound, thou sayst; well, then, call me an empty ship, and outward-bound. So go thy ways, and I will mine. Forward there! Set all sail, and keep her to the wind!\u201d And thus, while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze, the other stubbornly fought against it; and so the two vessels parted; the crew of the Pequod looking with grave, lingering glances towards the receding Bachelor; but the Bachelor\u2019s men never heeding their gaze for the lively revelry they were in."], "What does Ahab promise to the first man who spots Moby Dick?": [" Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye have seen\u2014Moby Dick\u2014Moby Dick!\u201d \u201cCaptain Ahab,\u201d said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder. \u201cCaptain Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick\u2014but it was not Moby Dick that took off thy leg?\u201d \u201cWho told thee that?\u201d cried Ahab; then pausing, \u201cAye, Starbuck; aye, my hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now. Aye, aye,\u201d he shouted with a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose; \u201cAye, aye! it was that accursed white whale that razed me; made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day!\u201d Then tossing both arms, with measureless imprecations he shouted out: \u201cAye, aye! and I\u2019ll chase him round Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and round perdition\u2019s flames before I give him up.", " The harpoon dropped from his hand. \u201cBefooled, befooled!\u201d\u2014drawing in a long lean breath\u2014\u201cAye, Parsee! I see thee again.\u2014Aye, and thou goest before; and this, _this_ then is the hearse that thou didst promise. But I hold thee to the last letter of thy word. Where is the second hearse? Away, mates, to the ship! those boats are useless now; repair them if ye can in time, and return to me; if not, Ahab is enough to die\u2014Down, men! the first thing that but offers to jump from this boat I stand in, that thing I harpoon. Ye are not other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey me.\u2014Where\u2019s the whale? gone down again?\u201d But he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping with the corpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last encounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was now again steadily swimming forward; and had almost passed the ship,\u2014which thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction to him, though for the present her headway had been stopped.", " There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his delirious but still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality, perhaps. Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude that the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year, say, will turn out to be identically the same with those that were found there the preceding season; though there are peculiar and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true. In general, the same remark, only within a less wide limit, applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm whales. So that though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for example, on what is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow, that were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season, she would infallibly encounter him there.", " \u201c\u2018Come out of that, ye pirates!\u2019 roared the captain, now menacing them with a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward. \u2018Come out of that, ye cut-throats!\u2019 \u201cSteelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there, defied the worst the pistols could do; but gave the captain to understand distinctly, that his (Steelkilt\u2019s) death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands. Fearing in his heart lest this might prove but too true, the captain a little desisted, but still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty. \u201c\u2018Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?\u2019 demanded their ringleader. \u201c\u2018Turn to! turn to!\u2014I make no promise;\u2014to your duty!

The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted the weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck. The poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept overboard; all hands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it, seemed madness. It flew from right to left, and back again, almost in one ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable of being done; those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale.", " \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?

In a moment he was standing in the boat\u2019s stern, and the Manilla men were springing to their oars. In vain the English Captain hailed him. With back to the stranger ship, and face set like a flint to his own, Ahab stood upright till alongside of the Pequod. CHAPTER 101. The Decanter. Ere the English ship fades from sight, be it set down here, that she hailed from London, and was named after the late Samuel Enderby, merchant of that city, the original of the famous whaling house of Enderby & Sons; a house which in my poor whaleman\u2019s opinion, comes not far behind the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons, in point of real historical interest.", " \u201cBut what takes thee a-whaling?

Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster attacked; therefore it was, that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps, for the most part, were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred, more, as it were, to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large, than to the individual cause. In that way, mostly, the disastrous encounter between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded.", " Well, then, did I believe all ye say, oh my pilot! I have here two pledges that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive it.\u201d \u201cTake another pledge, old man,\u201d said the Parsee, as his eyes lighted up like fire-flies in the gloom\u2014\u201cHemp only can kill thee.\u201d \u201cThe gallows, ye mean.\u2014I am immortal then, on land and on sea,\u201d cried Ahab, with a laugh of derision;\u2014\u201cImmortal on land and on sea!\u201d Both were silent again, as one man. The grey dawn came on, and the slumbering crew arose from the boat\u2019s bottom, and ere noon the dead whale was brought to the ship. CHAPTER 118. The Quadrant. The season for the Line at length drew near; and every day when Ahab, coming from his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the vigilant helmsman would ostentatiously handle his spokes, and the eager mariners quickly run to the braces, and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed on the nailed doubloon; impatient for the order to point the ship\u2019s prow for the equator.", " For some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied, secluded White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly frequented by the Sperm Whale fishermen. But not all of them knew of his existence; only a few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen him; while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given battle to him, was small indeed. For, owing to the large number of whale-cruisers; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire watery circumference, many of them adventurously pushing their quest along solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or more on a stretch, to encounter a single news-telling sail of any sort; the inordinate length of each separate voyage; the irregularity of the times of sailing from home; all these, with other circumstances, direct and indirect, long obstructed the spread through the whole world-wide whaling-fleet of the special individualizing tidings concerning Moby Dick."], "What was Queequeg on his home island?": [" Grace being said,\u2014for those people have their grace as well as we\u2014though Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at such times look downwards to our platters, they, on the contrary, copying the ducks, glance upwards to the great Giver of all feasts\u2014Grace, I say, being said, the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island; that is, dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates. Seeing himself placed next the Priest, and noting the ceremony, and thinking himself\u2014being Captain of a ship\u2014as having plain precedence over a mere island King, especially in the King\u2019s own house\u2014the Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowl;\u2014taking it I suppose for a huge finger-glass. \u201cNow,\u201d said Queequeg, \u201cwhat you tink now?\u2014Didn\u2019t our people laugh?\u201d At last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the schooner.", " I no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord\u2019s policy of insurance. I was only alive to the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend. With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed the Tomahawk from one to the other, till slowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of smoke, illuminated by the flame of the new-lit lamp. Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far distant scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native island; and, eager to hear his history, I begged him to go on and tell it. He gladly complied. Though at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of his words, yet subsequent disclosures, when I had become more familiar with his broken phraseology, now enable me to present the whole story such as it may prove in the mere skeleton I give. CHAPTER 12. Biographical. Queequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away to the West and South.", " I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of Yojo\u2019s judgment and surprising forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs. Now, this plan of Queequeg\u2019s, or rather Yojo\u2019s, touching the selection of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little relied upon Queequeg\u2019s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that trifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom\u2014for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; _how_ it was I never could find out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles\u2014leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping.", " He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation. Upon this, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed him of my intention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from. He at once resolved to accompany me to that island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the same watch, the same boat, the same mess with me, in short to share my every hap; with both my hands in his, boldly dip into the Potluck of both worlds. To all this I joyously assented; for besides the affection I now felt for Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such, could not fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted with the sea, as known to merchant seamen. His story being ended with his pipe\u2019s last dying puff, Queequeg embraced me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the light, we rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very soon were sleeping."], "Who goes insane after being left alone adrift at sea?": [" But no; there he was just where I had left him; he had not stirred an inch. I began to grow vexed with him; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room, holding a piece of wood on his head. \u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and have some supper. You\u2019ll starve; you\u2019ll kill yourself, Queequeg.\u201d But not a word did he reply. Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep; and no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me. But previous to turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as it promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on. For some time, do all I would, I could not get into the faintest doze. I had blown out the candle; and the mere thought of Queequeg\u2014not four feet off\u2014sitting there in that uneasy position, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really wretched.", " I have striven to be Thine, more than to be this world\u2019s, or mine own. Yet this is nothing: I leave eternity to Thee; for what is man that he should live out the lifetime of his God?\u201d He said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face with his hands, and so remained kneeling, till all the people had departed, and he was left alone in the place. CHAPTER 10. A Bosom Friend. Returning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there quite alone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some time. He was sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on the stove hearth, and in one hand was holding close up to his face that little negro idol of his; peering hard into its face, and with a jack-knife gently whittling away at its nose, meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way. But being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon, going to the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his lap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every fiftieth page\u2014as I fancied\u2014stopping a moment, looking vacantly around him, and giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment.", " Hoveringly halting, and dipping on the wing, the white sea-fowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left. With oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift, the three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick\u2019s reappearance. \u201cAn hour,\u201d said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat\u2019s stern; and he gazed beyond the whale\u2019s place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing vacancies to leeward. It was only an instant; for again his eyes seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle. The breeze now freshened; the sea began to swell. \u201cThe birds!\u2014the birds!\u201d cried Tashtego. In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were now all flying towards Ahab\u2019s boat; and when within a few yards began fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with joyous, expectant cries. Their vision was keener than man\u2019s; Ahab could discover no sign in the sea.", " Though in the course of his continual voyagings Ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight, yet, to any monomaniac man, the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings. \u201cSwim away from me, do ye?\u201d murmured Ahab, gazing over into the water. There seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced. But turning to the steersman, who thus far had been holding the ship in the wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old lion voice,\u2014\u201cUp helm! Keep her off round the world!\u201d Round the world! There is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings; but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct? Only through numberless perils to the very point whence we started, where those that we left behind secure, were all the time before us. Were this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could for ever reach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and strange than any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon, then there were promise in the voyage."], "What is Fedallah\u2019s turban made of?": [" Adventures of those three bloody-minded soldadoes?

You may think with what emotions, then, the seamen beheld this old Oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours; his turban and the moon, companions in one sky. But when, after spending his uniform interval there for several successive nights without uttering a single sound; when, after all this silence, his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery, moon-lit jet, every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit had lighted in the rigging, and hailed the mortal crew. \u201cThere she blows!\u201d Had the trump of judgment blown, they could not have quivered more; yet still they felt no terror; rather pleasure.

Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so, and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume. \u201cBildad,\u201d cried Captain Peleg, \u201cat it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my certain knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?\u201d As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate, Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up, and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.", " \u201cHe says he\u2019s our man, Bildad,\u201d said Peleg, \u201che wants to ship.\u201d \u201cDost thee?\u201d said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me. \u201cI _dost_,\u201d said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker. \u201cWhat do ye think of him, Bildad?\u201d said Peleg. \u201cHe\u2019ll do,\u201d said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at his book in a mumbling tone quite audible. I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg, his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said nothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest, and drawing forth the ship\u2019s articles, placed pen and ink before him, and seated himself at a little table.

But sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow, formerly a patient of mine in Ceylon, that making believe swallow jack-knives, once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest, and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more; when I gave him an emetic, and he heaved it up in small tacks, d\u2019ye see. No possible way for him to digest that jack-knife, and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system. Yes, Captain Boomer, if you are quick enough about it, and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial to the other, why in that case the arm is yours; only let the whale have another chance at you shortly, that\u2019s all.\u201d \u201cNo, thank ye, Bunger,\u201d said the English Captain, \u201che\u2019s welcome to the arm he has, since I can\u2019t help it, and didn\u2019t know him then; but not to another one.", " Oh, you solemn rogue, you\u2014you Bunger! was there ever such another Bunger in the watery world? Bunger, when you die, you ought to die in pickle, you dog; you should be preserved to future ages, you rascal.\u201d \u201cWhat became of the White Whale?\u201d now cried Ahab, who thus far had been impatiently listening to this by-play between the two Englishmen. \u201cOh!\u201d cried the one-armed captain, \u201coh, yes! Well; after he sounded, we didn\u2019t see him again for some time; in fact, as I before hinted, I didn\u2019t then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick, till some time afterwards, when coming back to the Line, we heard about Moby Dick\u2014as some call him\u2014and then I knew it was he.\u201d \u201cDid\u2019st thou cross his wake again?\u201d \u201cTwice.\u201d \u201cBut could not fasten?\u201d \u201cDidn\u2019t want to try to: ain\u2019t one limb enough?

What does the whaler do when she meets another whaler in any sort of decent weather? She has a \u201c_Gam_,\u201d a thing so utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name even; and if by chance they should hear of it, they only grin at it, and repeat gamesome stuff about \u201cspouters\u201d and \u201cblubber-boilers,\u201d and such like pretty exclamations. Why it is that all Merchant-seamen, and also all Pirates and Man-of-War\u2019s men, and Slave-ship sailors, cherish such a scornful feeling towards Whale-ships; this is a question it would be hard to answer. Because, in the case of pirates, say, I should like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it. It sometimes ends in uncommon elevation, indeed; but only at the gallows. And besides, when a man is elevated in that odd fashion, he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude.", " I said nothing, and tried to think nothing. At last it was given out that some time next day the ship would certainly sail. So next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early start. CHAPTER 21. Going Aboard.

You would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed Bastille, such wild cries they raised, as the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the sea. Lord and master over all this scene, the captain stood erect on the ship\u2019s elevated quarter-deck, so that the whole rejoicing drama was full before him, and seemed merely contrived for his own individual diversion. And Ahab, he too was standing on his quarter-deck, shaggy and black, with a stubborn gloom; and as the two ships crossed each other\u2019s wakes\u2014one all jubilations for things passed, the other all forebodings as to things to come\u2014their two captains in themselves impersonated the whole striking contrast of the scene. \u201cCome aboard, come aboard!\u201d cried the gay Bachelor\u2019s commander, lifting a glass and a bottle in the air.", " But thou sayest, methinks that white-lead chapter about whiteness is but a white flag hung out from a craven soul; thou surrenderest to a hypo, Ishmael.

I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. In more than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks. The English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for his strength, let me say, that there have been examples where the lines attached to a running sperm whale have, in a calm, been transferred to the ship, and secured there; the whale towing her great hull through the water, as a horse walks off with a cart. Again, it is very often observed that, if the sperm whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of destruction to his pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his character, that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes.", " But God is everywhere; Tarshish he never reached. As we have seen, God came upon him in the whale, and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom, and with swift slantings tore him along \u2018into the midst of the seas,\u2019 where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down, and \u2018the weeds were wrapped about his head,\u2019 and all the watery world of woe bowled over him. Yet even then beyond the reach of any plummet\u2014\u2018out of the belly of hell\u2019\u2014when the whale grounded upon the ocean\u2019s utmost bones, even then, God heard the engulphed, repenting prophet when he cried. Then God spake unto the fish; and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea, the whale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun, and all the delights of air and earth; and \u2018vomited out Jonah upon the dry land;\u2019 when the word of the Lord came a second time; and Jonah, bruised and beaten\u2014his ears, like two sea-shells, still multitudinously murmuring of the ocean\u2014Jonah did the Almighty\u2019s bidding.", " During these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the craft, and as often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and when he was going to come on board his ship. To these questions they would answer, that he was getting better and better, and was expected aboard every day; meantime, the two captains, Peleg and Bildad, could attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage. If I had been downright honest with myself, I would have seen very plainly in my heart that I did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage, without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute dictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea. But when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the matter, he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself.

I was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible Presbyterian Church. How then could I unite with this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood? But what is worship? thought I.

In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian magistrate of Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor and Belisarius general.

The Fin-Back is not gregarious. He seems a whale-hater, as some men are man-haters. Very shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man; this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing for his mark that style upon his back. From having the baleen in his mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes included with the right whale, among a theoretic species denominated _Whalebone whales_, that is, whales with baleen. Of these so called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be several varieties, most of which, however, are little known.

But how now, Ishmael? How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the fishery, pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the whale?

This done, with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked round upon his crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his glance long upon Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah; and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate, said,\u2014\u201cTake the rope, sir\u2014I give it into thy hands, Starbuck.\u201d Then arranging his person in the basket, he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch, Starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last; and afterwards stood near it.", " And as for the other whale, why, I\u2019ll agree to get more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours, than he\u2019ll get from that bundle of bones; though, now that I think of it, it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil; yes, ambergris. I wonder now if our old man has thought of that. It\u2019s worth trying. Yes, I\u2019m for it;\u201d and so saying he started for the quarter-deck. By this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that whether or no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with no hope of escaping except by its breezing up again. Issuing from the cabin, Stubb now called his boat\u2019s crew, and pulled off for the stranger. Drawing across her bow, he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful French taste, the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk, was painted green, and for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there; the whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour.", " And where but from Nantucket, too, did that first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported cobblestones\u2014so goes the story\u2014to throw at the whales, in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit?

Meantime, the hoisted sperm whale\u2019s head jogged about very violently, and Gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to warrant. When this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story concerning Moby Dick; not, however, without frequent interruptions from Gabriel, whenever his name was mentioned, and the crazy sea that seemed leagued with him. It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon speaking a whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the existence of Moby Dick, and the havoc he had made.", " And where but from Nantucket, too, did that first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported cobblestones\u2014so goes the story\u2014to throw at the whales, in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit?

In a pirate, man-of-war, or slave ship, when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat there, and often steers himself with a pretty little milliner\u2019s tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons. But the whale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa of that sort whatever, and no tiller at all. High times indeed, if whaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs. And as for a tiller, the whale-boat never admits of any such effeminacy; and therefore as in gamming a complete boat\u2019s crew must leave the ship, and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number, that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion, and the captain, having no place to sit in, is pulled off to his visit all standing like a pine tree.", " The Pequod\u2019s signal was at last responded to by the stranger\u2019s setting her own; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket. Squaring her yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under the Pequod\u2019s lee, and lowered a boat; it soon drew nigh; but, as the side-ladder was being rigged by Starbuck\u2019s order to accommodate the visiting captain, the stranger in question waved his hand from his boat\u2019s stern in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary. It turned out that the Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board, and that Mayhew, her captain, was fearful of infecting the Pequod\u2019s company. For, though himself and boat\u2019s crew remained untainted, and though his ship was half a rifle-shot off, and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between; yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the land, he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the Pequod.", " Upon the passage homewards, they drop them there again. How it is, there is no telling, but Islanders seem to make the best whalemen. They were nearly all Islanders in the Pequod, _Isolatoes_ too, I call such, not acknowledging the common continent of men, but each _Isolato_ living on a separate continent of his own. Yet now, federated along one keel, what a set these Isolatoes were! An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea, and all the ends of the earth, accompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod to lay the world\u2019s grievances before that bar from which not very many of them ever come back. Black Little Pip\u2014he never did\u2014oh, no! he went before. Poor Alabama boy! On the grim Pequod\u2019s forecastle, ye shall ere long see him, beating his tambourine; prelusive of the eternal time, when sent for, to the great quarter-deck on high, he was bid strike in with angels, and beat his tambourine in glory; called a coward here, hailed a hero there!", " Next day, a large ship, the Rachel, was descried, bearing directly down upon the Pequod, all her spars thickly clustering with men. At the time the Pequod was making good speed through the water; but as the broad-winged windward stranger shot nigh to her, the boastful sails all fell together as blank bladders that are burst, and all life fled from the smitten hull. \u201cBad news; she brings bad news,\u201d muttered the old Manxman. But ere her commander, who, with trumpet to mouth, stood up in his boat; ere he could hopefully hail, Ahab\u2019s voice was heard. \u201cHast seen the White Whale?\u201d \u201cAye, yesterday. Have ye seen a whale-boat adrift?\u201d Throttling his joy, Ahab negatively answered this unexpected question; and would then have fain boarded the stranger, when the stranger captain himself, having stopped his vessel\u2019s way, was seen descending her side. A few keen pulls, and his boat-hook soon clinched the Pequod\u2019s main-chains, and he sprang to the deck."], "When Queequeg falls ill, what does he do?": [" \u2019tis an ill voyage! ill begun, ill continued; let me square the yards, while we may, old man, and make a fair wind of it homewards, to go on a better voyage than this.\u201d Overhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the braces\u2014though not a sail was left aloft. For the moment all the aghast mate\u2019s thoughts seemed theirs; they raised a half mutinous cry. But dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck, and snatching the burning harpoon, Ahab waved it like a torch among them; swearing to transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope\u2019s end. Petrified by his aspect, and still more shrinking from the fiery dart that he held, the men fell back in dismay, and Ahab again spoke:\u2014 \u201cAll your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine; and heart, soul, and body, lungs and life, old Ahab is bound. And that ye may know to what tune this heart beats; look ye here; thus I blow out the last fear!\u201d And with one blast of his breath he extinguished the flame.", " Besides, if you regard him very closely, and time him with your watch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration. But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out! You have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not tell water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the knottiest of all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely. The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it, when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading all around him.", " I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of Yojo\u2019s judgment and surprising forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.

And this seems reasonable enough in the good Bishop. For truly, the Right Whale\u2019s mouth would accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and comfortably seat all the players. Possibly, too, Jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right Whale is toothless. Another reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his want of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely in reference to his incarcerated body and the whale\u2019s gastric juices. But this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German exegetist supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a _dead_ whale\u2014even as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them."], "In what state does Ishmael meet Queequeg?": [" \u201cI say, Queequeg! why don\u2019t you speak?

The streets do not run with milk; nor in the spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs. Yet, in spite of this, nowhere in all America will you find more patrician-like houses; parks and gardens more opulent, than in New Bedford. Whence came they? how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country? Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty mansion, and your question will be answered. Yes; all these brave houses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. One and all, they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea. Can Herr Alexander perform a feat like that? In New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their daughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece. You must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they say, they have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candles.", " CHAPTER 6. The Street. If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford. In thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts. Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean mariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies. Regent Street is not unknown to Lascars and Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo Green, live Yankees have often scared the natives. But New Bedford beats all Water Street and Wapping. In these last-mentioned haunts you see only sailors; but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh.", " And where but from Nantucket, too, did that first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported cobblestones\u2014so goes the story\u2014to throw at the whales, in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit?

Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching that place would offer, till the following Monday. As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a fine, boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling, and though in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket was her great original\u2014the Tyre of this Carthage;\u2014the place where the first dead American whale was stranded. Where else but from Nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes to give chase to the Leviathan?"], "According to Peter Coffin, what is Queequeg out doing when Ishmael learns that Queequeg will be his roommate?": [" He added, that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock, according to the usual sea-custom, tossed like something vile to the death-devouring sharks. No: he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket, all the more congenial to him, being a whaleman, that like a whale-boat these coffin-canoes were without a keel; though that involved but uncertain steering, and much lee-way adown the dim ages. Now, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter was at once commanded to do Queequeg\u2019s bidding, whatever it might include. There was some heathenish, coffin-coloured old lumber aboard, which, upon a long previous voyage, had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the Lackaday islands, and from these dark planks the coffin was recommended to be made. No sooner was the carpenter apprised of the order, than taking his rule, he forthwith with all the indifferent promptitude of his character, proceeded into the forecastle and took Queequeg\u2019s measure with great accuracy, regularly chalking Queequeg\u2019s person as he shifted the rule.", " Leaning over in his hammock, Queequeg long regarded the coffin with an attentive eye. He then called for his harpoon, had the wooden stock drawn from it, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of the paddles of his boat. All by his own request, also, biscuits were then ranged round the sides within: a flask of fresh water was placed at the head, and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot; and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled up for a pillow, Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed, that he might make trial of its comforts, if any it had. He lay without moving a few minutes, then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little god, Yojo. Then crossing his arms on his breast with Yojo between, he called for the coffin lid (hatch he called it) to be placed over him. The head part turned over with a leather hinge, and there lay Queequeg in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in view.", " CHAPTER 13. Wheelbarrow. Next morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber, for a block, I settled my own and comrade\u2019s bill; using, however, my comrade\u2019s money. The grinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between me and Queequeg\u2014especially as Peter Coffin\u2019s cock and bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person whom I now companied with. We borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own poor carpet-bag, and Queequeg\u2019s canvas sack and hammock, away we went down to \u201cthe Moss,\u201d the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf. As we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg so much\u2014for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streets,\u2014but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms. But we heeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs.", " It was a negro church; and the preacher\u2019s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping and wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing out, Wretched entertainment at the sign of \u2018The Trap!\u2019 Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words underneath\u2014\u201cThe Spouter Inn:\u2014Peter Coffin.\u201d Coffin?\u2014Spouter?\u2014Rather ominous in that particular connexion, thought I. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose this Peter here is an emigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee."], "Who is the subject of Father Mapple\u2019s sermon?": [" For I was not prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height, slowly turn round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving him impregnable in his little Quebec. I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this. Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage. No, thought I, there must be some sober reason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something unseen. Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward worldly ties and connexions? Yes, for replenished with the meat and wine of the word, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is a self-containing stronghold\u2014a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a perennial well of water within the walls.", " Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being. In fact take my body who will, take it I say, it is not me. And therefore three cheers for Nantucket; and come a stove boat and stove body when they will, for stave my soul, Jove himself cannot. CHAPTER 8. The Pulpit. I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable robustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation, sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain. Yes, it was the famous Father Mapple, so called by the whalemen, among whom he was a very great favourite. He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth, but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry. At the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age; that sort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth, for among all the fissures of his wrinkles, there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloom\u2014the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath February\u2019s snow.", " No one having previously heard his history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the utmost interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led. When he entered I observed that he carried no umbrella, and certainly had not come in his carriage, for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed. However, hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner; when, arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit. Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the floor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the architect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and finished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea.", " He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is.\u201d \u201cYoung man,\u201d said Bildad sternly, \u201cthou art skylarking with me\u2014explain thyself, thou young Hittite. What church dost thee mean? answer me.\u201d Finding myself thus hard pushed, I replied. \u201cI mean, sir, the same ancient Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there, and Queequeg here, and all of us, and every mother\u2019s son and soul of us belong; the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole worshipping world; we all belong to that; only some of us cherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief; in _that_ we all join hands.\u201d \u201cSplice, thou mean\u2019st _splice_ hands,\u201d cried Peleg, drawing nearer. \u201cYoung man, you\u2019d better ship for a missionary, instead of a fore-mast hand; I never heard a better sermon.

It\u2019s I\u2014Ishmael.\u201d But all remained still as before. I began to grow alarmed. I had allowed him such abundant time; I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit. I looked through the key-hole; but the door opening into an odd corner of the room, the key-hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one. I could only see part of the foot-board of the bed and a line of the wall, but nothing more. I was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of Queequeg\u2019s harpoon, which the landlady the evening previous had taken from him, before our mounting to the chamber. That\u2019s strange, thought I; but at any rate, since the harpoon stands yonder, and he seldom or never goes abroad without it, therefore he must be inside here, and no possible mistake. \u201cQueequeg!\u2014Queequeg!\u201d\u2014all still. Something must have happened. Apoplexy! I tried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly resisted.", " I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of Yojo\u2019s judgment and surprising forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs. Now, this plan of Queequeg\u2019s, or rather Yojo\u2019s, touching the selection of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little relied upon Queequeg\u2019s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that trifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our little bedroom\u2014for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that day; _how_ it was I never could find out, for, though I applied myself to it several times, I never could master his liturgies and XXXIX Articles\u2014leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among the shipping.", " He was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms. The profoundest slumber slept upon him. \u201cThose sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?\u201d said I, looking dubiously at the sleeper. But it seemed that, when on the wharf, Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter, were it not for Elijah\u2019s otherwise inexplicable question. But I beat the thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted to Queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body; telling him to establish himself accordingly. He put his hand upon the sleeper\u2019s rear, as though feeling if it was soft enough; and then, without more ado, sat quietly down there. \u201cGracious! Queequeg, don\u2019t sit there,\u201d said I. \u201cOh! perry dood seat,\u201d said Queequeg, \u201cmy country way; won\u2019t hurt him face.\u201d \u201cFace!\u201d said I, \u201ccall that his face?", " I said nothing, and tried to think nothing. At last it was given out that some time next day the ship would certainly sail. So next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early start. CHAPTER 21. Going Aboard. It was nearly six o\u2019clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when we drew nigh the wharf. \u201cThere are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right,\u201d said I to Queequeg, \u201cit can\u2019t be shadows; she\u2019s off by sunrise, I guess; come on!\u201d \u201cAvast!\u201d cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close behind us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating himself between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain twilight, strangely peering from Queequeg to me. It was Elijah. \u201cGoing aboard?\u201d \u201cHands off, will you,\u201d said I. \u201cLookee here,\u201d said Queequeg, shaking himself, \u201cgo \u2019way!\u201d \u201cAin\u2019t going aboard, then?\u201d \u201cYes, we are,\u201d said I, \u201cbut what business is that of yours?"], "Why does Ishmael claim that Nantucket has the largest empire in the world?": [" It nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish, unless, indeed, from the inside. Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of involuntary whaleman; at any rate the whale caught him, if he did not the whale. I claim him for one of our clan. But, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story of Hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale; and vice vers\u00e2; certainly they are very similar. If I claim the demi-god then, why not the prophet? Nor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the whole roll of our order. Our grand master is still to be named; for like royal kings of old times, we find the head waters of our fraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves. That wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the Shaster, which gives us the dread Vishnoo, one of the three persons in the godhead of the Hindoos; gives us this divine Vishnoo himself for our Lord;\u2014Vishnoo, who, by the first of his ten earthly incarnations, has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale.", " It was a Saturday night in December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching that place would offer, till the following Monday. As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a fine, boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though New Bedford has of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling, and though in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket was her great original\u2014the Tyre of this Carthage;\u2014the place where the first dead American whale was stranded. Where else but from Nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes to give chase to the Leviathan?", " And where but from Nantucket, too, did that first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported cobblestones\u2014so goes the story\u2014to throw at the whales, in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit? Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold and cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,\u2014So, wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the south\u2014wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire the price, and don\u2019t be too particular.", " CHAPTER 102. A Bower in the Arsacides. Hitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I have chiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and in detail upon some few interior structural features. But to a large and thorough sweeping comprehension of him, it behooves me now to unbutton him still further, and untagging the points of his hose, unbuckling his garters, and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost bones, set him before you in his ultimatum; that is to say, in his unconditional skeleton. But how now, Ishmael? How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the fishery, pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the whale? Did erudite Stubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver lectures on the anatomy of the Cetacea; and by help of the windlass, hold up a specimen rib for exhibition? Explain thyself, Ishmael. Can you land a full-grown whale on your deck for examination, as a cook dishes a roast-pig?"], "What does Queequeg do when the bumpkin that was mocking him falls into the ocean?": [" I thought the bumpkin\u2019s hour of doom was come. Dropping his harpoon, the brawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily into the air; then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset, the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet, while Queequeg, turning his back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff. \u201cCapting! Capting!\u201d yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer; \u201cCapting, Capting, here\u2019s the devil.\u201d \u201cHallo, _you_ sir,\u201d cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking up to Queequeg, \u201cwhat in thunder do you mean by that? Don\u2019t you know you might have killed that chap?\u201d \u201cWhat him say?\u201d said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me. \u201cHe say,\u201d said I, \u201cthat you came near kill-e that man there,\u201d pointing to the still shivering greenhorn. \u201cKill-e,\u201d cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly expression of disdain, \u201cah!", " A few minutes more, and he rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the other dragging a lifeless form. The boat soon picked them up. The poor bumpkin was restored. All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump; the captain begged his pardon. From that hour I clove to Queequeg like a barnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took his last long dive. Was there ever such unconsciousness? He did not seem to think that he at all deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies. He only asked for water\u2014fresh water\u2014something to wipe the brine off; that done, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against the bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to be saying to himself\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s a mutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians.

But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out! You have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not tell water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the knottiest of all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely. The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it, when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading all around him.", " I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of Yojo\u2019s judgment and surprising forecast of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.

Have I not said, old man, that neither hearse nor coffin can be thine?\u201d \u201cAnd who are hearsed that die on the sea?\u201d \u201cBut I said, old man, that ere thou couldst die on this voyage, two hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea; the first not made by mortal hands; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in America.\u201d \u201cAye, aye! a strange sight that, Parsee:\u2014a hearse and its plumes floating over the ocean with the waves for the pall-bearers.

And thinks I to myself all the while, mind, while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramid\u2014so confoundedly contradictory was it all, all the while, I say, I was thinking to myself, \u2018what\u2019s his leg now, but a cane\u2014a whalebone cane. Yes,\u2019 thinks I, \u2018it was only a playful cudgelling\u2014in fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me\u2014not a base kick. Besides,\u2019 thinks I, \u2018look at it once; why, the end of it\u2014the foot part\u2014what a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed farmer kicked me, _there\u2019s_ a devilish broad insult. But this insult is whittled down to a point only.\u2019 But now comes the greatest joke of the dream, Flask. While I was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of badger-haired old merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by the shoulders, and slews me round.", " Shame! shame!\u201d During all this, Queequeg lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream. Pip was led away, and the sick man was replaced in his hammock. But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now that his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied; soon there seemed no need of the carpenter\u2019s box: and thereupon, when some expressed their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said, that the cause of his sudden convalescence was this;\u2014at a critical moment, he had just recalled a little duty ashore, which he was leaving undone; and therefore had changed his mind about dying: he could not die yet, he averred. They asked him, then, whether to live or die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure. He answered, certainly. In a word, it was Queequeg\u2019s conceit, that if a man made up his mind to live, mere sickness could not kill him: nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some violent, ungovernable, unintelligent destroyer of that sort.", " He thinks he breathes it first; but not so. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it. But wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in some unaccountable way\u2014he can better answer than any one else. And, doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances. I take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this: \u201c_Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States._ \u201cWHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL."], "According to Ishmael, which whale produces the best, purest, and sweetest of oils?": [" Certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor macassar oil, nor castor oil, nor bear\u2019s oil, nor train oil, nor cod-liver oil. What then can it possibly be, but sperm oil in its unmanufactured, unpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils? Think of that, ye loyal Britons! we whalemen supply your kings and queens with coronation stuff! CHAPTER 26. Knights and Squires. The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and a Quaker by descent. He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an icy coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being hard as twice-baked biscuit. Transported to the Indies, his live blood would not spoil like bottled ale. He must have been born in some time of general drought and famine, or upon one of those fast days for which his state is famous. Only some thirty arid summers had he seen; those summers had dried up all his physical superfluousness.", " CHAPTER 102. A Bower in the Arsacides. Hitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I have chiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and in detail upon some few interior structural features. But to a large and thorough sweeping comprehension of him, it behooves me now to unbutton him still further, and untagging the points of his hose, unbuckling his garters, and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost bones, set him before you in his ultimatum; that is to say, in his unconditional skeleton. But how now, Ishmael? How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the fishery, pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the whale? Did erudite Stubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver lectures on the anatomy of the Cetacea; and by help of the windlass, hold up a specimen rib for exhibition? Explain thyself, Ishmael. Can you land a full-grown whale on your deck for examination, as a cook dishes a roast-pig?", " I shall enumerate them by their fore-castle appellations; for possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigators, who may complete what I have here but begun. If any of the following whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked, then he can readily be incorporated into this System, according to his Folio, Octavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:\u2014The Bottle-Nose Whale; the Junk Whale; the Pudding-Headed Whale; the Cape Whale; the Leading Whale; the Cannon Whale; the Scragg Whale; the Coppered Whale; the Elephant Whale; the Iceberg Whale; the Quog Whale; the Blue Whale; etc. From Icelandic, Dutch, and old English authorities, there might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales, blessed with all manner of uncouth names. But I omit them as altogether obsolete; and can hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying nothing. Finally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would not be here, and at once, perfected.", " And where but from Nantucket, too, did that first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported cobblestones\u2014so goes the story\u2014to throw at the whales, in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit? Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold and cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,\u2014So, wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the south\u2014wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire the price, and don\u2019t be too particular."], "What is Flask\u2019s nickname?": [" Another thing. Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and Flask is the first man up. Consider! For hereby Flask\u2019s dinner was badly jammed in point of time. Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him; and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear. If Stubb even, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have but a small appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast, then Flask must bestir himself, he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the deck. Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in private, that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer, from that moment he had never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry, more or less. For what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal in him. Peace and satisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed from my stomach.", " I snored; rolled over; and there I was in my hammock! Now, what do you think of that dream, Flask?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho.\u2019\u201d \u201cMay be; may be. But it\u2019s made a wise man of me, Flask. D\u2019ye see Ahab standing there, sideways looking over the stern? Well, the best thing you can do, Flask, is to let the old man alone; never speak to him, whatever he says. Halloa! What\u2019s that he shouts? Hark!\u201d \u201cMast-head, there! Look sharp, all of ye! There are whales hereabouts! \u201cIf ye see a white one, split your lungs for him! \u201cWhat do you think of that now, Flask? ain\u2019t there a small drop of something queer about that, eh? A white whale\u2014did ye mark that, man? Look ye\u2014there\u2019s something special in the wind. Stand by for it, Flask. Ahab has that that\u2019s bloody on his mind. But, mum; he comes this way.\u201d CHAPTER 32. Cetology. Already we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be lost in its unshored, harbourless immensities.", " And poor little Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy of this weary family party. His were the shinbones of the saline beef; his would have been the drumsticks. For Flask to have presumed to help himself, this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree. Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world; nevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask helped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it. Least of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter. Whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him, on account of its clotting his clear, sunny complexion; or whether he deemed that, on so long a voyage in such marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and therefore was not for him, a subaltern; however it was, Flask, alas! was a butterless man!", " And here was Flask now standing, Daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady himself by. At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture in his boat, even when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and cross-running seas. Still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself, under such circumstances. But the sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more curious; for sustaining himself with a cool, indifferent, easy, unthought of, barbaric majesty, the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form. On his broad back, flaxen-haired Flask seemed a snow-flake. The bearer looked nobler than the rider. Though truly vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious little Flask would now and then stamp with impatience; but not one added heave did he thereby give to the negro\u2019s lordly chest."], "What does the scar on Ahab\u2019s cheek resemble?": [" You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore. This young fellow\u2019s healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and would seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three days landed from his Indian voyage. That man next him looks a few shades lighter; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him. In the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly bleached withal; _he_ doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore. But who could show a cheek like Queequeg? which, barred with various tints, seemed like the Andes\u2019 western slope, to show forth in one array, contrasting climates, zone by zone. \u201cGrub, ho!\u201d now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we went to breakfast. They say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at ease in manner, quite self-possessed in company. Not always, though: Ledyard, the great New England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch one; of all men, they possessed the least assurance in the parlor.", " \u201cGive way!\u201d cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward to the attack; but maddened by yesterday\u2019s fresh irons that corroded in him, Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell from heaven. The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad white forehead, beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted together; as head on, he came churning his tail among the boats; and once more flailed them apart; spilling out the irons and lances from the two mates\u2019 boats, and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows, but leaving Ahab\u2019s almost without a scar. While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks; and as the whale swimming out from them, turned, and showed one entire flank as he shot by them again; at that moment a quick cry went up. Lashed round and round to the fish\u2019s back; pinioned in the turns upon turns in which, during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines around him, the half torn body of the Parsee was seen; his sable raiment frayed to shreds; his distended eyes turned full upon old Ahab.", " Whether that mark was born with him, or whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound, no one could certainly say. By some tacit consent, throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it, especially by the mates. But once Tashtego\u2019s senior, an old Gay-Head Indian among the crew, superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did Ahab become that way branded, and then it came upon him, not in the fury of any mortal fray, but in an elemental strife at sea. Yet, this wild hint seemed inferentially negatived, by what a grey Manxman insinuated, an old sepulchral man, who, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless, the old sea-traditions, the immemorial credulities, popularly invested this old Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment. So that no white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab should be tranquilly laid out\u2014which might hardly come to pass, so he muttered\u2014then, whoever should do that last office for the dead, would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole.", " I should say that those New England rocks on the sea-coast, which Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergs\u2014I should say, that those rocks must not a little resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular. It also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact with other whales; for I have most remarked them in the large, full-grown bulls of the species. A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the whale. It has already been said, that it is stript from him in long pieces, called blanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, this one is very happy and significant. For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an Indian poncho slipt over his head, and skirting his extremity. It is by reason of this cosy blanketing of his body, that the whale is enabled to keep himself comfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and tides."], "When Ahab realizes that smoking no longer soothes him, what does he do?": [" In old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were fabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale. How could one look at Ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones, without bethinking him of the royalty it symbolized? For a Khan of the plank, and a king of the sea, and a great lord of Leviathans was Ahab. Some moments passed, during which the thick vapor came from his mouth in quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into his face. \u201cHow now,\u201d he soliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube, \u201cthis smoking no longer soothes. Oh, my pipe! hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone! Here have I been unconsciously toiling, not pleasuring\u2014aye, and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while; to windward, and with such nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale, my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble. What business have I with this pipe? This thing that is meant for sereneness, to send up mild white vapors among mild white hairs, not among torn iron-grey locks like mine.", " What\u2019s all this fuss I have been making about, thought I to myself\u2014the man\u2019s a human being just as I am: he has just as much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian. \u201cLandlord,\u201d said I, \u201ctell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will turn in with him. But I don\u2019t fancy having a man smoking in bed with me. It\u2019s dangerous. Besides, I ain\u2019t insured.\u201d This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely motioned me to get into bed\u2014rolling over to one side as much as to say\u2014\u201cI won\u2019t touch a leg of ye.\u201d \u201cGood night, landlord,\u201d said I, \u201cyou may go.\u201d I turned in, and never slept better in my life. CHAPTER 4. The Counterpane. Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg\u2019s arm thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner.", " Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright except his eyes be closed; as if darkness were indeed the proper element of our essences, though light be more congenial to our clayey part. Upon opening my eyes then, and coming out of my own pleasant and self-created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated twelve-o\u2019clock-at-night, I experienced a disagreeable revulsion. Nor did I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a light, seeing that we were so wide awake; and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his Tomahawk. Be it said, that though I had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before, yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them. For now I liked nothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me, even in bed, because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then.", " Because, as has been elsewhere noticed, those whales, influenced by some views to safety, now swim the seas in immense caravans, so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries, yokes, and pods, and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but widely separated, unfrequent armies. That is all. And equally fallacious seems the conceit, that because the so-called whale-bone whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years abounding with them, hence that species also is declining. For they are only being driven from promontory to cape; and if one coast is no longer enlivened with their jets, then, be sure, some other and remoter strand has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle. Furthermore: concerning these last mentioned Leviathans, they have two firm fortresses, which, in all human probability, will for ever remain impregnable. And as upon the invasion of their valleys, the frosty Swiss have retreated to their mountains; so, hunted from the savannas and glades of the middle seas, the whale-bone whales can at last resort to their Polar citadels, and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and walls there, come up among icy fields and floes; and in a charmed circle of everlasting December, bid defiance to all pursuit from man."], "What is the study of whales called?": [" On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes back. The Fin-Back is not gregarious. He seems a whale-hater, as some men are man-haters. Very shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man; this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing for his mark that style upon his back. From having the baleen in his mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes included with the right whale, among a theoretic species denominated _Whalebone whales_, that is, whales with baleen. Of these so called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be several varieties, most of which, however, are little known. Broad-nosed whales and beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed whales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen\u2019s names for a few sorts.", " Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the Killer. Both are outlaws, even in the lawless seas. Thus ends BOOK II. (_Octavo_), and begins BOOK III. (_Duodecimo_). DUODECIMOES.\u2014These include the smaller whales. I. The Huzza Porpoise. II. The Algerine Porpoise. III. The Mealy-mouthed Porpoise. To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may possibly seem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five feet should be marshalled among WHALES\u2014a word, which, in the popular sense, always conveys an idea of hugeness. But the creatures set down above as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales, by the terms of my definition of what a whale is\u2014_i.e._ a spouting fish, with a horizontal tail. BOOK III. (_Duodecimo_), CHAPTER 1. (_Huzza Porpoise_).\u2014This is the common porpoise found almost all over the globe. The name is of my own bestowal; for there are more than one sort of porpoises, and something must be done to distinguish them.", " \u201cThe Indian Sea breedeth the most and the biggest fishes that are: among which the Whales and Whirlpooles called Balaene, take up as much in length as four acres or arpens of land.\u201d \u2014_Holland\u2019s Pliny_. \u201cScarcely had we proceeded two days on the sea, when about sunrise a great many Whales and other monsters of the sea, appeared. Among the former, one was of a most monstrous size.... This came towards us, open-mouthed, raising the waves on all sides, and beating the sea before him into a foam.\u201d \u2014_Tooke\u2019s Lucian_. \u201c_The True History_.\u201d \u201cHe visited this country also with a view of catching horse-whales, which had bones of very great value for their teeth, of which he brought some to the king.... The best whales were catched in his own country, of which some were forty-eight, some fifty yards long. He said that he was one of six who had killed sixty in two days.\u201d \u2014_Other or Other\u2019s verbal narrative taken down from his mouth by King Alfred, A.D._ 890.", " But upon investigation we find, that not only are the whales of the present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are found in the Tertiary system (embracing a distinct geological period prior to man), but of the whales found in that Tertiary system, those belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier ones. Of all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed, by far the largest is the Alabama one mentioned in the last chapter, and that was less than seventy feet in length in the skeleton. Whereas, we have already seen, that the tape-measure gives seventy-two feet for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale. And I have heard, on whalemen\u2019s authority, that Sperm Whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture. But may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods; may it not be, that since Adam\u2019s time they have degenerated?"], "There once was a time that the \u201cspecksynder\u201d or ___ served as the captain of a whaling vessel.": [" \u201cBut what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of shipping ye.\u201d \u201cWell, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world.\u201d \u201cWant to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?\u201d \u201cWho is Captain Ahab, sir?\u201d \u201cAye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.\u201d \u201cI am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself.\u201d \u201cThou art speaking to Captain Peleg\u2014that\u2019s who ye are speaking to, young man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We are part owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one leg.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean, sir?", " All four boats gave chase again; but the whale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared. \u201cIn good time, the Town-Ho reached her port\u2014a savage, solitary place\u2014where no civilized creature resided. There, headed by the Lakeman, all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palms; eventually, as it turned out, seizing a large double war-canoe of the savages, and setting sail for some other harbor. \u201cThe ship\u2019s company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down the ship to stop the leak. But to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated, both by night and by day, and so extreme was the hard work they underwent, that upon the vessel being ready again for sea, they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel.", " Literally this word means Fat-Cutter; usage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer. In those days, the captain\u2019s authority was restricted to the navigation and general management of the vessel; while over the whale-hunting department and all its concerns, the Specksnyder or Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme. In the British Greenland Fishery, under the corrupted title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is still retained, but his former dignity is sadly abridged. At present he ranks simply as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the captain\u2019s more inferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since in the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat, but under certain circumstances (night watches on a whaling ground) the command of the ship\u2019s deck is also his; therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live apart from the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as their professional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded as their social equal.", " Captain D\u2019Wolf applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel had received any damage from the shock, but we found that very happily it had escaped entirely uninjured.\u201d Now, the Captain D\u2019Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual adventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of Dorchester near Boston. I have the honor of being a nephew of his. I have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in Langsdorff. He substantiates every word. The ship, however, was by no means a large one: a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast, and purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home. In that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full, too, of honest wonders\u2014the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient Dampier\u2019s old chums\u2014I found a little matter set down so like that just quoted from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here for a corroborative example, if such be needed."], "Why does Ishmael think that he doesn\u2019t keep a very good watch?": [" He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated. \u201cWhew!\u201d he whistled at last\u2014\u201cthe squall\u2019s gone off to leeward, I think.

But to what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written, the above cited extracts will show. Of the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen ever saw living whales; and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer and whaleman. I mean Captain Scoresby. On the separate subject of the Greenland or right-whale, he is the best existing authority. But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale, compared with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning. And here be it said, that the Greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas. He is not even by any means the largest of the whales. Yet, owing to the long priority of his claims, and the profound ignorance which, till some seventy years back, invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm-whale, and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whale-ports; this usurpation has been every way complete.", " Whether that mark was born with him, or whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound, no one could certainly say. By some tacit consent, throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it, especially by the mates. But once Tashtego\u2019s senior, an old Gay-Head Indian among the crew, superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did Ahab become that way branded, and then it came upon him, not in the fury of any mortal fray, but in an elemental strife at sea. Yet, this wild hint seemed inferentially negatived, by what a grey Manxman insinuated, an old sepulchral man, who, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless, the old sea-traditions, the immemorial credulities, popularly invested this old Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment. So that no white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab should be tranquilly laid out\u2014which might hardly come to pass, so he muttered\u2014then, whoever should do that last office for the dead, would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole.", " Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is for the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along, horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little to one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down in a city on one side of a street. But the question returns whether this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and discharged through the spiracle. It is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle. Because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be, when in feeding he accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm Whale\u2019s food is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout even if he would."], "When Daggoo and a Spanish sailor start to fight, what stops them?": [" Our captain has his birthmark; look yonder, boys, there\u2019s another in the sky\u2014lurid-like, ye see, all else pitch black.

Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds, helped to sway me to my wish.", " He thinks he breathes it first; but not so. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it.

And, doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances. I take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this: \u201c_Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States._ \u201cWHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL.", " So Ahab. Mark this, too, in the whaler. While other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff, to be transferred to foreign wharves; the world-wandering whale-ship carries no cargo but herself and crew, their weapons and their wants. She has a whole lake\u2019s contents bottled in her ample hold. She is ballasted with utilities; not altogether with unusable pig-lead and kentledge. She carries years\u2019 water in her. Clear old prime Nantucket water; which, when three years afloat, the Nantucketer, in the Pacific, prefers to drink before the brackish fluid, but yesterday rafted off in casks, from the Peruvian or Indian streams. Hence it is, that, while other ships may have gone to China from New York, and back again, touching at a score of ports, the whale-ship, in all that interval, may not have sighted one grain of soil; her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like themselves. So that did you carry them the news that another flood had come; they would only answer\u2014\u201cWell, boys, here\u2019s the ark!\u201d Now, as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of Java, in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most of the ground, roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen as an excellent spot for cruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained more and more upon Java Head, the look-outs were repeatedly hailed, and admonished to keep wide awake."], "The fact that Ahab is using the Pequod for a different purpose than its owners intended means he could be charged with ______.": [" What cares Ahab? Owners, owners? Thou art always prating to me, Starbuck, about those miserly owners, as if the owners were my conscience. But look ye, the only real owner of anything is its commander; and hark ye, my conscience is in this ship\u2019s keel.\u2014On deck!\u201d \u201cCaptain Ahab,\u201d said the reddening mate, moving further into the cabin, with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestation of itself, but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself; \u201cA better man than I might well pass over in thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man; aye, and in a happier, Captain Ahab.\u201d \u201cDevils!

Considering that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger; considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and extraordinary difficulties; that every individual moment, indeed, then comprises a peril; under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed man to enter a whale-boat in the hunt? As a general thing, the joint-owners of the Pequod must have plainly thought not. Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of the chase, for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving his orders in person, yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt\u2014above all for Captain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men, as that same boat\u2019s crew, he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads of the owners of the Pequod.", " \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d \u201cOld Thunder!\u201d said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his pivot-hole; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed lances of fire. Now, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off the perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea some ships carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the water. But as this conductor must descend to considerable depth, that its end may avoid all contact with the hull; and as moreover, if kept constantly towing there, it would be liable to many mishaps, besides interfering not a little with some of the rigging, and more or less impeding the vessel\u2019s way in the water; because of all this, the lower parts of a ship\u2019s lightning-rods are not always overboard; but are generally made in long slender links, so as to be the more readily hauled up into the chains outside, or thrown down into the sea, as occasion may require.", " Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper parading his quarter-deck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any military navy; nay, extorting almost as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple, and not the shabbiest of pilot-cloth. And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least given to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only homage he ever exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though he required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarter-deck; and though there were times when, owing to peculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed, he addressed them in unusual terms, whether of condescension or _in terrorem_, or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab was by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea. Nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind those forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself; incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than they were legitimately intended to subserve."], "When Ahab bursts into fits of near-mad shrieking, what does Ishmael think is the cause?": [" Fits? yes, give him fits\u2014that\u2019s the very word\u2014pitch fits into \u2019em.

Only the infidel sharks in the audacious seas may give ear to such words, when, with tornado brow, and eyes of red murder, and foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped after his prey.

The sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down; the line tubs were fixed in their places; the cranes were thrust out; the mainyard was backed, and the three boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high cliffs. Outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand clung to the rail, while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale. So look the long line of man-of-war\u2019s men about to throw themselves on board an enemy\u2019s ship. But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took every eye from the whale. With a start all glared at dark Ahab, who was surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air. CHAPTER 48. The First Lowering. The phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other side of the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose the tackles and bands of the boat which swung there.", " But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect. Considering that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger; considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and extraordinary difficulties; that every individual moment, indeed, then comprises a peril; under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed man to enter a whale-boat in the hunt? As a general thing, the joint-owners of the Pequod must have plainly thought not. Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of the chase, for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving his orders in person, yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt\u2014above all for Captain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men, as that same boat\u2019s crew, he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads of the owners of the Pequod.", " But be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate phantoms soon found their place among the crew, though still as it were somehow distinct from them, yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah remained a muffled mystery to the last. Whence he came in a mannerly world like this, by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be linked with Ahab\u2019s peculiar fortunes; nay, so far as to have some sort of a half-hinted influence; Heaven knows, but it might have been even authority over him; all this none knew. But one cannot sustain an indifferent air concerning Fedallah. He was such a creature as civilized, domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their dreams, and that but dimly; but the like of whom now and then glide among the unchanging Asiatic communities, especially the Oriental isles to the east of the continent\u2014those insulated, immemorial, unalterable countries, which even in these modern days still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earth\u2019s primal generations, when the memory of the first man was a distinct recollection, and all men his descendants, unknowing whence he came, eyed each other as real phantoms, and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and to what end; when though, according to Genesis, the angels indeed consorted with the daughters of men, the devils also, add the uncanonical Rabbins, indulged in mundane amours.", " But almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of Moby Dick; for he had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person. But such a supposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boat\u2019s crew being assigned to that boat. Now, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned away; for in a whaler wonders soon wane. Besides, now and then such unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown nooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of whalers; and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks, bits of wreck, oars, whaleboats, canoes, blown-off Japanese junks, and what not; that Beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin to chat with the captain, and it would not create any unsubduable excitement in the forecastle."], "When the crew first hunt a whale, what nearly crushes Queequeg\u2019s boat?": [" But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect.

A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat; it was the darted iron of Queequeg. Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from astern, while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge; the sail collapsed and exploded; a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by; something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us. The whole crew were half suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter into the white curdling cream of the squall. Squall, whale, and harpoon had all blended together; and the whale, merely grazed by the iron, escaped. Though completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed. Swimming round it we picked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the gunwale, tumbled back to our places. There we sat up to our knees in the sea, the water covering every rib and plank, so that to our downward gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom of the ocean.", " I said nothing, and tried to think nothing. At last it was given out that some time next day the ship would certainly sail. So next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early start. CHAPTER 21. Going Aboard. It was nearly six o\u2019clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when we drew nigh the wharf. \u201cThere are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right,\u201d said I to Queequeg, \u201cit can\u2019t be shadows; she\u2019s off by sunrise, I guess; come on!\u201d \u201cAvast!\u201d cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close behind us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating himself between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain twilight, strangely peering from Queequeg to me. It was Elijah. \u201cGoing aboard?\u201d \u201cHands off, will you,\u201d said I. \u201cLookee here,\u201d said Queequeg, shaking himself, \u201cgo \u2019way!\u201d \u201cAin\u2019t going aboard, then?\u201d \u201cYes, we are,\u201d said I, \u201cbut what business is that of yours?", " Now, Queequeg is my fellow man. And what do I wish that this Queequeg would do to me? Why, unite with me in my particular Presbyterian form of worship. Consequently, I must then unite with him in his; ergo, I must turn idolator. So I kindled the shavings; helped prop up the innocent little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with Queequeg; salamed before him twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that done, we undressed and went to bed, at peace with our own consciences and all the world. But we did not go to sleep without some little chat. How it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for confidential disclosures between friends. Man and wife, they say, there open the very bottom of their souls to each other; and some old couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning. Thus, then, in our hearts\u2019 honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg\u2014a cosy, loving pair. CHAPTER 11.

But how now, Ishmael? How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the fishery, pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the whale? Did erudite Stubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver lectures on the anatomy of the Cetacea; and by help of the windlass, hold up a specimen rib for exhibition? Explain thyself, Ishmael.

But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out! You have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not tell water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the knottiest of all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely. The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it, when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading all around him.", " And I know one, who coming into still closer contact with the spout, whether with some scientific object in view, or otherwise, I cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm. Wherefore, among whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to evade it. Another thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much doubt it, that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind you. The wisest thing the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is to let this deadly spout alone. Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish. My hypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides other reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale; I account him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is never found on soundings, or near shores; all other whales sometimes are.", " Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is for the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along, horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little to one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down in a city on one side of a street. But the question returns whether this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and discharged through the spiracle. It is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle. Because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be, when in feeding he accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm Whale\u2019s food is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout even if he would.", " And if at such times you should think that you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are not merely condensed from its vapor; or how do you know that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the whale\u2019s head? For even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary\u2019s in the desert; even then, the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head, as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain. Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the precise nature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be peering into it, and putting his face in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to this fountain and fill it, and bring it away. For even when coming into slight contact with the outer, vapory shreds of the jet, which will often happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness of the thing so touching it."], "Ishmael reflects that traveling around the world to hunt whales really amounts to ___.": [" (Sperm Whale Fishery) to his visiting card, such a procedure would be deemed pre-eminently presuming and ridiculous. Doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring us whalemen, is this: they think that, at best, our vocation amounts to a butchering sort of business; and that when actively engaged therein, we are surrounded by all manner of defilements. Butchers we are, that is true. But butchers, also, and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been all Martial Commanders whom the world invariably delights to honor. And as for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business, ye shall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown, and which, upon the whole, will triumphantly plant the sperm whale-ship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth. But even granting the charge in question to be true; what disordered slippery decks of a whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those battle-fields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies\u2019 plaudits?", " And where but from Nantucket, too, did that first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported cobblestones\u2014so goes the story\u2014to throw at the whales, in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit? Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold and cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,\u2014So, wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the south\u2014wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire the price, and don\u2019t be too particular.", " But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect.

That protection could only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand, backed by a heedful, closely calculating attention to every minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be subjected to. For all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the Pequod\u2019s voyage; observe all customary usages; and not only that, but force himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general pursuit of his profession. Be all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the three mast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out, and not omit reporting even a porpoise.", " \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? He was heading east, I think.\u2014Is your Captain crazy?\u201d whispering Fedallah. But Fedallah, putting a finger on his lip, slid over the bulwarks to take the boat\u2019s steering oar, and Ahab, swinging the cutting-tackle towards him, commanded the ship\u2019s sailors to stand by to lower. In a moment he was standing in the boat\u2019s stern, and the Manilla men were springing to their oars. In vain the English Captain hailed him. With back to the stranger ship, and face set like a flint to his own, Ahab stood upright till alongside of the Pequod. CHAPTER 101. The Decanter. Ere the English ship fades from sight, be it set down here, that she hailed from London, and was named after the late Samuel Enderby, merchant of that city, the original of the famous whaling house of Enderby & Sons; a house which in my poor whaleman\u2019s opinion, comes not far behind the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons, in point of real historical interest.", " CHAPTER 131. The Pequod Meets The Delight. The intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most miserably misnamed the Delight, was descried. As she drew nigh, all eyes were fixed upon her broad beams, called shears, which, in some whaling-ships, cross the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine feet; serving to carry the spare, unrigged, or disabled boats. Upon the stranger\u2019s shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and some few splintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat; but you now saw through this wreck, as plainly as you see through the peeled, half-unhinged, and bleaching skeleton of a horse. \u201cHast seen the White Whale?\u201d \u201cLook!\u201d replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail; and with his trumpet he pointed to the wreck. \u201cHast killed him?\u201d \u201cThe harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that,\u201d answered the other, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck, whose gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together."], "Why does Ishmael find it odd that the French have been most successful in representing whales in art?": [" On Tower-hill, as you go down to the London docks, you may have seen a crippled beggar (or _kedger_, as the sailors say) holding a painted board before him, representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg. There are three whales and three boats; and one of the boats (presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity) is being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale. Any time these ten years, they tell me, has that man held up that picture, and exhibited that stump to an incredulous world. But the time of his justification has now come. His three whales are as good whales as were ever published in Wapping, at any rate; and his stump as unquestionable a stump as any you will find in the western clearings. But, though for ever mounted on that stump, never a stump-speech does the poor whaleman make; but, with downcast eyes, stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation.", " Assuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of such gentlemen as Pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally. For Pliny tells us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and Aldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in length\u2014Rope Walks and Thames Tunnels of Whales! And even in the days of Banks and Solander, Cooke\u2019s naturalists, we find a Danish member of the Academy of Sciences setting down certain Iceland Whales (reydan-siskur, or Wrinkled Bellies) at one hundred and twenty yards; that is, three hundred and sixty feet. And Lac\u00e9p\u00e8de, the French naturalist, in his elaborate history of whales, in the very beginning of his work (page 3), sets down the Right Whale at one hundred metres, three hundred and twenty-eight feet. And this work was published so late as A.D. 1825. But will any whaleman believe these stories? No. The whale of to-day is as big as his ancestors in Pliny\u2019s time.", " \u201cI say, Queequeg! why don\u2019t you speak? It\u2019s I\u2014Ishmael.\u201d But all remained still as before. I began to grow alarmed. I had allowed him such abundant time; I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit. I looked through the key-hole; but the door opening into an odd corner of the room, the key-hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one. I could only see part of the foot-board of the bed and a line of the wall, but nothing more. I was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of Queequeg\u2019s harpoon, which the landlady the evening previous had taken from him, before our mounting to the chamber. That\u2019s strange, thought I; but at any rate, since the harpoon stands yonder, and he seldom or never goes abroad without it, therefore he must be inside here, and no possible mistake. \u201cQueequeg!\u2014Queequeg!\u201d\u2014all still. Something must have happened. Apoplexy! I tried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly resisted.", " And where but from Nantucket, too, did that first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported cobblestones\u2014so goes the story\u2014to throw at the whales, in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit? Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile.

As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated. \u201cWhew!\u201d he whistled at last\u2014\u201cthe squall\u2019s gone off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs the grindstone. That\u2019s he; thank ye, Bildad.

A Bower in the Arsacides. Hitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I have chiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and in detail upon some few interior structural features. But to a large and thorough sweeping comprehension of him, it behooves me now to unbutton him still further, and untagging the points of his hose, unbuckling his garters, and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost bones, set him before you in his ultimatum; that is to say, in his unconditional skeleton. But how now, Ishmael? How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the fishery, pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the whale? Did erudite Stubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver lectures on the anatomy of the Cetacea; and by help of the windlass, hold up a specimen rib for exhibition? Explain thyself, Ishmael. Can you land a full-grown whale on your deck for examination, as a cook dishes a roast-pig?", " If two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State, or the equally desolate Salisbury Plain in England; if casually encountering each other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of them, cannot well avoid a mutual salutation; and stopping for a moment to interchange the news; and, perhaps, sitting down for a while and resting in concert: then, how much more natural that upon the illimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea, two whaling vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth\u2014off lone Fanning\u2019s Island, or the far away King\u2019s Mills; how much more natural, I say, that under such circumstances these ships should not only interchange hails, but come into still closer, more friendly and sociable contact. And especially would this seem to be a matter of course, in the case of vessels owned in one seaport, and whose captains, officers, and not a few of the men are personally known to each other; and consequently, have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk about."], "Which was the first team to kill a whale?": [" him bevy small-e fish-e; Queequeg no kill-e so small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!\u201d \u201cLook you,\u201d roared the Captain, \u201cI\u2019ll kill-e _you_, you cannibal, if you try any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye.\u201d But it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain to mind his own eye. The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted the weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck. The poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept overboard; all hands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it, seemed madness. It flew from right to left, and back again, almost in one ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable of being done; those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale.", " Two thick squares of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they cross each other\u2019s grain at right angles; a line of considerable length is then attached to the middle of this block, and the other end of the line being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon. It is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used. For then, more whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time. But sperm whales are not every day encountered; while you may, then, you must kill all you can. And if you cannot kill them all at once, you must wing them, so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure. Hence it is, that at times like these the drugg, comes into requisition. Our boat was furnished with three of them. The first and second were successfully darted, and we saw the whales staggeringly running off, fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg.", " Has the poor lad a sister? Where\u2019s that girl?\u2014there, Betty, go to Snarles the Painter, and tell him to paint me a sign, with\u2014\u201cno suicides permitted here, and no smoking in the parlor;\u201d\u2014might as well kill both birds at once. Kill? The Lord be merciful to his ghost! What\u2019s that noise there? You, young man, avast there!\u201d And running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to force open the door. \u201cI don\u2019t allow it; I won\u2019t have my premises spoiled. Go for the locksmith, there\u2019s one about a mile from here. But avast!\u201d putting her hand in her side-pocket, \u201chere\u2019s a key that\u2019ll fit, I guess; let\u2019s see.\u201d And with that, she turned it in the lock; but, alas! Queequeg\u2019s supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within. \u201cHave to burst it open,\u201d said I, and was running down the entry a little, for a good start, when the landlady caught at me, again vowing I should not break down her premises; but I tore from her, and with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark.", " The next moment the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between his teeth, sprang into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me. Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again. But his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning. \u201cWho-e debel you?\u201d\u2014he at last said\u2014\u201cyou no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e.\u201d And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the dark. \u201cLandlord, for God\u2019s sake, Peter Coffin!\u201d shouted I. \u201cLandlord! Watch! Coffin! Angels! save me!\u201d \u201cSpeak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!\u201d again growled the cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire."], "Why is the whale-line so dangerous once it is attached to a whale?": [" Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an eye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub, and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything. This arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts. First: In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon. In these instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale, as it were, from the one boat to the other; though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort. Second: This arrangement is indispensable for common safety\u2019s sake; for were the lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat, and were the whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single, smoking minute as he sometimes does, he would not stop there, for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of the sea; and in that case no town-crier would ever find her again.", " I shall enumerate them by their fore-castle appellations; for possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigators, who may complete what I have here but begun. If any of the following whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked, then he can readily be incorporated into this System, according to his Folio, Octavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:\u2014The Bottle-Nose Whale; the Junk Whale; the Pudding-Headed Whale; the Cape Whale; the Leading Whale; the Cannon Whale; the Scragg Whale; the Coppered Whale; the Elephant Whale; the Iceberg Whale; the Quog Whale; the Blue Whale; etc. From Icelandic, Dutch, and old English authorities, there might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales, blessed with all manner of uncouth names. But I omit them as altogether obsolete; and can hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying nothing. Finally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would not be here, and at once, perfected.", " It is a matter of great astonishment that the consideration of the habits of so interesting, and, in a commercial point of view, so important an animal (as the Sperm Whale) should have been so entirely neglected, or should have excited so little curiosity among the numerous, and many of them competent observers, that of late years, must have possessed the most abundant and the most convenient opportunities of witnessing their habitudes.\u201d \u2014_Thomas Beale\u2019s History of the Sperm Whale_, 1839. \u201cThe Cachalot\u201d (Sperm Whale) \u201cis not only better armed than the True Whale\u201d (Greenland or Right Whale) \u201cin possessing a formidable weapon at either extremity of its body, but also more frequently displays a disposition to employ these weapons offensively and in manner at once so artful, bold, and mischievous, as to lead to its being regarded as the most dangerous to attack of all the known species of the whale tribe.\u201d \u2014_Frederick Debell Bennett\u2019s Whaling Voyage Round the Globe_, 1840.", " Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as the fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which happened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip\u2019s seat. The involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in hand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack whale line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the water. That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the line swiftly straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line, which had taken several turns around his chest and neck. Tashtego stood in the bows. He was full of the fire of the hunt. He hated Pip for a poltroon. Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath, he suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb, exclaimed interrogatively, \u201cCut?\u201d Meantime Pip\u2019s blue, choked face plainly looked, Do, for God\u2019s sake!"], "According to Ishmael, who are the only people besides Stubb that still eat whale meat?": [" Hold the steak in one hand, and show a live coal to it with the other; that done, dish it; d\u2019ye hear? And now to-morrow, cook, when we are cutting in the fish, be sure you stand by to get the tips of his fins; have them put in pickle. As for the ends of the flukes, have them soused, cook. There, now ye may go.\u201d But Fleece had hardly got three paces off, when he was recalled. \u201cCook, give me cutlets for supper to-morrow night in the mid-watch. D\u2019ye hear? away you sail, then.\u2014Halloa! stop! make a bow before you go.\u2014Avast heaving again!

I\u2019m bressed if he ain\u2019t more of shark dan Massa Shark hisself,\u201d muttered the old man, limping away; with which sage ejaculation he went to his hammock. CHAPTER 65. The Whale as a Dish. That mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp, and, like Stubb, eat him by his own light, as you may say; this seems so outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and philosophy of it.", " And that is the reason why a young buck with an intelligent looking calf\u2019s head before him, is somehow one of the saddest sights you can see. The head looks a sort of reproachfully at him, with an \u201cEt tu Brute!\u201d expression. It is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence; that appears to result, in some way, from the consideration before mentioned: _i.e._ that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea, and eat it too by its own light. But no doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer; perhaps he was hung; and if he had been put on his trial by oxen, he certainly would have been; and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does. Go to the meat-market of a Saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds staring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds. Does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibal\u2019s jaw?", " And where but from Nantucket, too, did that first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported cobblestones\u2014so goes the story\u2014to throw at the whales, in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit? Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile.

Though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight, sharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship\u2019s decks, like hungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved, ready to bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them; and though, while the valiant butchers over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving each other\u2019s live meat with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled, the sharks, also, with their jewel-hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely carving away under the table at the dead meat; and though, were you to turn the whole affair upside down, it would still be pretty much the same thing, that is to say, a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties; and though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships crossing the Atlantic, systematically trotting alongside, to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere, or a dead slave to be decently buried; and though one or two other like instances might be set down, touching the set terms, places, and occasions, when sharks do most socially congregate, and most hilariously feast; yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless numbers, and in gayer or more jovial spirits, than around a dead sperm whale, moored by night to a whaleship at sea."], "When preparing to process the first dead whale, how does Queequeg almost loose his hand?": [" What was America in 1492 but a Loose-Fish, in which Columbus struck the Spanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and mistress? What was Poland to the Czar? What Greece to the Turk? What India to England? What at last will Mexico be to the United States? All Loose-Fish. What are the Rights of Man and the Liberties of the World but Loose-Fish? What all men\u2019s minds and opinions but Loose-Fish? What is the principle of religious belief in them but a Loose-Fish?

Very soon you would have thought from the sound on the Pequod\u2019s decks, that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in the deep; for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck, and thrust rattling out of the port-holes. But by those clanking links, the vast corpse itself, not the ship, is to be moored. Tied by the head to the stern, and by the tail to the bows, the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel\u2019s and seen through the darkness of the night, which obscured the spars and rigging aloft, the two\u2014ship and whale, seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks, whereof one reclines while the other remains standing.", " It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens, even modern ones, a certain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is gone through. There is a saltcellar of state, so called, and there may be a castor of state. How they use the salt, precisely\u2014who knows? Certain I am, however, that a king\u2019s head is solemnly oiled at his coronation, even as a head of salad. Can it be, though, that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run well, as they anoint machinery? Much might be ruminated here, concerning the essential dignity of this regal process, because in common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair, and palpably smells of that anointing. In truth, a mature man who uses hair-oil, unless medicinally, that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere. As a general rule, he can\u2019t amount to much in his totality. But the only thing to be considered here, is this\u2014what kind of oil is used at coronations?", " In thoughts of the visions of the night, I saw long rows of angels in paradise, each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti. Now, while discoursing of sperm, it behooves to speak of other things akin to it, in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the try-works. First comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the tapering part of the fish, and also from the thicker portions of his flukes. It is tough with congealed tendons\u2014a wad of muscle\u2014but still contains some oil. After being severed from the whale, the white-horse is first cut into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer. They look much like blocks of Berkshire marble. Plum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the whale\u2019s flesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber, and often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness. It is a most refreshing, convivial, beautiful object to behold."], "After the whale carcass is cut loose from the ship, who are the \u201cmourners\u201d at its \u201cfuneral?\u201d": [" What was America in 1492 but a Loose-Fish, in which Columbus struck the Spanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and mistress?

In fact, tell him from me he\u2019s a baboon.\u201d \u201cHe vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one, is far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he conjures us, as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish.\u201d Instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his crew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.", " This improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than Stubb, in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkey-rope holder. I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the whale and the ship\u2014where he would occasionally fall, from the incessant rolling and swaying of both. But this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was exposed to. Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the night, the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent blood which began to flow from the carcass\u2014the rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive. And right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them aside with his floundering feet. A thing altogether incredible were it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man.", " So close did the monster come to the hull, that at first it seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going down in a maelstrom, within three rods of the planks, he wholly disappeared from view, as if diving under the keel. \u201cCut, cut!\u201d was the cry from the ship to the boats, which, for one instant, seemed on the point of being brought with a deadly dash against the vessel\u2019s side. But having plenty of line yet in the tubs, and the whale not sounding very rapidly, they paid out abundance of rope, and at the same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship. For a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical; for while they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction, and still plied their oars in another, the contending strain threatened to take them under. But it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain. And they stuck to it till they did gain it; when instantly, a swift tremor was felt running like lightning along the keel, as the strained line, scraping beneath the ship, suddenly rose to view under her bows, snapping and quivering; and so flinging off its drippings, that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water, while the whale beyond also rose to sight, and once more the boats were free to fly."], "When the crew takes a break from whale-processing, who does Ahab go on deck to talk to?": [" But, mastering his emotion, he half calmly rose, and as he quitted the cabin, paused for an instant and said: \u201cThou hast outraged, not insulted me, sir; but for that I ask thee not to beware of Starbuck; thou wouldst but laugh; but let Ahab beware of Ahab; beware of thyself, old man.\u201d \u201cHe waxes brave, but nevertheless obeys; most careful bravery that!\u201d murmured Ahab, as Starbuck disappeared. \u201cWhat\u2019s that he said\u2014Ahab beware of Ahab\u2014there\u2019s something there!\u201d Then unconsciously using the musket for a staff, with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little cabin; but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed, and returning the gun to the rack, he went to the deck. \u201cThou art but too good a fellow, Starbuck,\u201d he said lowly to the mate; then raising his voice to the crew: \u201cFurl the t\u2019gallant-sails, and close-reef the top-sails, fore and aft; back the main-yard; up Burton, and break out in the main-hold.\u201d It were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was, that as respecting Starbuck, Ahab thus acted.", " What\u2019s that he said? he should still go before me, my pilot; and yet to be seen again? But where? Will I have eyes at the bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endless stairs? and all night I\u2019ve been sailing from him, wherever he did sink to. Aye, aye, like many more thou told\u2019st direful truth as touching thyself, O Parsee; but, Ahab, there thy shot fell short. Good-bye, mast-head\u2014keep a good eye upon the whale, the while I\u2019m gone. We\u2019ll talk to-morrow, nay, to-night, when the white whale lies down there, tied by head and tail.\u201d He gave the word; and still gazing round him, was steadily lowered through the cloven blue air to the deck. In due time the boats were lowered; but as standing in his shallop\u2019s stern, Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent, he waved to the mate,\u2014who held one of the tackle-ropes on deck\u2014and bade him pause. \u201cStarbuck!\u201d \u201cSir?\u201d \u201cFor the third time my soul\u2019s ship starts upon this voyage, Starbuck.\u201d \u201cAye, sir, thou wilt have it so.\u201d \u201cSome ships sail from their ports, and ever afterwards are missing, Starbuck!\u201d \u201cTruth, sir: saddest truth.\u201d \u201cSome men die at ebb tide; some at low water; some at the full of the flood;\u2014and I feel now like a billow that\u2019s all one crested comb, Starbuck.", " But with all their eyes again riveted upon the swart Fedallah and his crew, the inmates of the other boats obeyed not the command. \u201cCaptain Ahab?\u2014\u201d said Starbuck. \u201cSpread yourselves,\u201d cried Ahab; \u201cgive way, all four boats. Thou, Flask, pull out more to leeward!\u201d \u201cAye, aye, sir,\u201d cheerily cried little King-Post, sweeping round his great steering oar. \u201cLay back!\u201d addressing his crew. \u201cThere!\u2014there!\u2014there again! There she blows right ahead, boys!\u2014lay back!\u201d \u201cNever heed yonder yellow boys, Archy.\u201d \u201cOh, I don\u2019t mind \u2019em, sir,\u201d said Archy; \u201cI knew it all before now. Didn\u2019t I hear \u2019em in the hold? And didn\u2019t I tell Cabaco here of it? What say ye, Cabaco? They are stowaways, Mr. Flask.\u201d \u201cPull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my children; pull, my little ones,\u201d drawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to his crew, some of whom still showed signs of uneasiness. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you break your backbones, my boys?", " From his complete inattention to the tidings, you would think that moody Ahab had not heard his menial. But presently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds, he swings himself to the deck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice, saying, \u201cDinner, Mr. Starbuck,\u201d disappears into the cabin. When the last echo of his sultan\u2019s step has died away, and Starbuck, the first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then Starbuck rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the planks, and, after a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some touch of pleasantness, \u201cDinner, Mr. Stubb,\u201d and descends the scuttle. The second Emir lounges about the rigging awhile, and then slightly shaking the main brace, to see whether it will be all right with that important rope, he likewise takes up the old burden, and with a rapid \u201cDinner, Mr. Flask,\u201d follows after his predecessors. But the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck, seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the Grand Turk\u2019s head; and then, by a dexterous sleight, pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck, reversing all other processions, by bringing up the rear with music."], "When the crew encounter the crazed prophet Gabriel, what does Gabriel prophesize as Ahab\u2019s fate?": [" \u201cThink, think of thy whale-boat, stoven and sunk! Beware of the horrible tail!\u201d \u201cI tell thee again, Gabriel, that\u2014\u201d But again the boat tore ahead as if dragged by fiends. Nothing was said for some moments, while a succession of riotous waves rolled by, which by one of those occasional caprices of the seas were tumbling, not heaving it. Meantime, the hoisted sperm whale\u2019s head jogged about very violently, and Gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to warrant. When this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story concerning Moby Dick; not, however, without frequent interruptions from Gabriel, whenever his name was mentioned, and the crazy sea that seemed leagued with him. It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon speaking a whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the existence of Moby Dick, and the havoc he had made.", " The sailors, mostly poor devils, cringed, and some of them fawned before him; in obedience to his instructions, sometimes rendering him personal homage, as to a god. Such things may seem incredible; but, however wondrous, they are true. Nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to the measureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as his measureless power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others. But it is time to return to the Pequod. \u201cI fear not thy epidemic, man,\u201d said Ahab from the bulwarks, to Captain Mayhew, who stood in the boat\u2019s stern; \u201ccome on board.\u201d But now Gabriel started to his feet. \u201cThink, think of the fevers, yellow and bilious! Beware of the horrible plague!\u201d \u201cGabriel! Gabriel!\u201d cried Captain Mayhew; \u201cthou must either\u2014\u201d But that instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead, and its seethings drowned all speech. \u201cHast thou seen the White Whale?\u201d demanded Ahab, when the boat drifted back.", " As such a man, however, was not of much practical use in the ship, especially as he refused to work except when he pleased, the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him; but apprised that that individual\u2019s intention was to land him in the first convenient port, the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and vials\u2014devoting the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition, in case this intention was carried out. So strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew, that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if Gabriel was sent from the ship, not a man of them would remain. He was therefore forced to relinquish his plan. Nor would they permit Gabriel to be any way maltreated, say or do what he would; so that it came to pass that Gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship. The consequence of all this was, that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and mates; and since the epidemic had broken out, he carried a higher hand than ever; declaring that the plague, as he called it, was at his sole command; nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure.", " But as he did so, the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing; the boat drifted a little towards the ship\u2019s stern; so that, as if by magic, the letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriel\u2019s eager hand. He clutched it in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and impaling the letter on it, sent it thus loaded back into the ship. It fell at Ahab\u2019s feet. Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars, and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the Pequod. As, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket of the whale, many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild affair. CHAPTER 72. The Monkey-Rope. In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale, there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands are wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no staying in any one place; for at one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere."], "According to Fedallah, why should you hang a sperm whale\u2019s head on one side of a ship and a right whale\u2019s on the other?": [" \u201cWants with it?\u201d said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boat\u2019s bow, \u201cdid you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whale\u2019s head hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a Right Whale\u2019s on the larboard; did you never hear, Stubb, that that ship can never afterwards capsize?\u201d \u201cWhy not? \u201cI don\u2019t know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying so, and he seems to know all about ships\u2019 charms. But I sometimes think he\u2019ll charm the ship to no good at last. I don\u2019t half like that chap, Stubb. Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved into a snake\u2019s head, Stubb?\u201d \u201cSink him! I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of a dark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by; look down there, Flask\u201d\u2014pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both hands\u2014\u201cAye, will I! Flask, I take that Fedallah to be the devil in disguise.", " \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you so?\u201d said Flask; \u201cyes, you\u2019ll soon see this right whale\u2019s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti\u2019s.\u201d In good time, Flask\u2019s saying proved true. As before, the Pequod steeply leaned over towards the sperm whale\u2019s head, now, by the counterpoise of both heads, she regained her even keel; though sorely strained, you may well believe. So, when on one side you hoist in Locke\u2019s head, you go over that way; but now, on the other side, hoist in Kant\u2019s and you come back again; but in very poor plight. Thus, some minds for ever keep trimming boat. Oh, ye foolish! throw all these thunder-heads overboard, and then you will float light and right. In disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the ship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the case of a sperm whale; only, in the latter instance, the head is cut off whole, but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck, with all the well known black bone attached to what is called the crown-piece.", " For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest Turkey\u2014the tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the floor of the mouth. It is very fat and tender, and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting it on deck. This particular tongue now before us; at a passing glance I should say it was a six-barreler; that is, it will yield you about that amount of oil. Ere this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started with\u2014that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely different heads. To sum up, then: in the Right Whale\u2019s there is no great well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible of a lower jaw, like the Sperm Whale\u2019s. Nor in the Sperm Whale are there any of those blinds of bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely anything of a tongue. Again, the Right Whale has two external spout-holes, the Sperm Whale only one. Look your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet lie together; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea; the other will not be very long in following.", " But nothing like this, in the present case, had been done. The carcases of both whales had dropped astern; and the head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of overburdening panniers. Meantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale\u2019s head, and ever and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own hand. And Ahab chanced so to stand, that the Parsee occupied his shadow; while, if the Parsee\u2019s shadow was there at all it seemed only to blend with, and lengthen Ahab\u2019s. As the crew toiled on, Laplandish speculations were bandied among them, concerning all these passing things. CHAPTER 74. The Sperm Whale\u2019s Head\u2014Contrasted View. Here, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us join them, and lay together our own. Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale are by far the most noteworthy. They are the only whales regularly hunted by man."], "Ishmael likens the right whale to a stoic philosopher and the sperm whale to a ___ one.": [" For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest Turkey\u2014the tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the floor of the mouth.

It is the same he died with, only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now faded away. I think his broad brow to be full of a prairie-like placidity, born of a speculative indifference as to death. But mark the other head\u2019s expression. See that amazing lower lip, pressed by accident against the vessel\u2019s side, so as firmly to embrace the jaw. Does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death? This Right Whale I take to have been a Stoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who might have taken up Spinoza in his latter years. CHAPTER 76. The Battering-Ram. Ere quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whale\u2019s head, I would have you, as a sensible physiologist, simply\u2014particularly remark its front aspect, in all its compacted collectedness. I would have you investigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated, intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram power may be lodged there.", " Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days, will satisfy you that the Greenland whale, without one rival, was to them the monarch of the seas. But the time has at last come for a new proclamation. This is Charing Cross; hear ye! good people all,\u2014the Greenland whale is deposed,\u2014the great sperm whale now reigneth! There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt. Those books are Beale\u2019s and Bennett\u2019s; both in their time surgeons to English South-Sea whale-ships, and both exact and reliable men. The original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily small; but so far as it goes, it is of excellent quality, though mostly confined to scientific description. As yet, however, the sperm whale, scientific or poetic, lives not complete in any literature.", " It is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic seas; it is the whale which the American fishermen have long pursued in the Indian ocean, on the Brazil Banks, on the Nor\u2019 West Coast, and various other parts of the world, designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds. Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the English and the right whale of the Americans. But they precisely agree in all their grand features; nor has there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction. It is by endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences, that some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate. The right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length, with reference to elucidating the sperm whale. BOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER III. (_Fin-Back_).\u2014Under this head I reckon a monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and Long-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks."], "What does Ishmael compare to the huge case of high-quality oil in a sperm whale\u2019s head?": [" For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest Turkey\u2014the tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the floor of the mouth.

What then can it possibly be, but sperm oil in its unmanufactured, unpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils? Think of that, ye loyal Britons! we whalemen supply your kings and queens with coronation stuff! CHAPTER 26. Knights and Squires. The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and a Quaker by descent. He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an icy coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being hard as twice-baked biscuit. Transported to the Indies, his live blood would not spoil like bottled ale. He must have been born in some time of general drought and famine, or upon one of those fast days for which his state is famous. Only some thirty arid summers had he seen; those summers had dried up all his physical superfluousness.", " Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days, will satisfy you that the Greenland whale, without one rival, was to them the monarch of the seas.

As he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without at all heeding what he had in his hand; but in his broken lingo, the German soon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale; immediately turning the conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can, with some remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in profound darkness\u2014his last drop of Bremen oil being gone, and not a single flying-fish yet captured to supply the deficiency; concluding by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is technically called a _clean_ one (that is, an empty one), well deserving the name of Jungfrau or the Virgin."], "When Tashtego nearly drowns, what is he trapped in?": [" Whether it was that Tashtego, that wild Indian, was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his one-handed hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head; or whether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy; or whether the Evil One himself would have it to fall out so, without stating his particular reasons; how it was exactly, there is no telling now; but, on a sudden, as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly up\u2014my God! poor Tashtego\u2014like the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well, dropped head-foremost down into this great Tun of Heidelburgh, and with a horrible oily gurgling, went clean out of sight! \u201cMan overboard!\u201d cried Daggoo, who amid the general consternation first came to his senses. \u201cSwing the bucket this way!\u201d and putting one foot into it, so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold on the whip itself, the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head, almost before Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom.", " how we suddenly jump, as Scorpio, or the Scorpion, stings us in the rear; we are curing the wound, when whang come the arrows all round; Sagittarius, or the Archer, is amusing himself. As we pluck out the shafts, stand aside! here\u2019s the battering-ram, Capricornus, or the Goat; full tilt, he comes rushing, and headlong we are tossed; when Aquarius, or the Water-bearer, pours out his whole deluge and drowns us; and to wind up with Pisces, or the Fishes, we sleep. There\u2019s a sermon now, writ in high heaven, and the sun goes through it every year, and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty.

The Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks, with the same undeviating and reliable uniformity. And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from other tribes of his genus. \u201cThere go flukes!\u201d was now the cry from Tashtego; and the whales disappeared. \u201cQuick, steward!\u201d cried Ahab. \u201cTime! time!\u201d Dough-Boy hurried below, glanced at the watch, and reported the exact minute to Ahab. The ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling before it. Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to leeward, we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of our bows. For that singular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale when, sounding with his head in one direction, he nevertheless, while concealed beneath the surface, mills round, and swiftly swims off in the opposite quarter\u2014this deceitfulness of his could not now be in action; for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by Tashtego had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew at all of our vicinity.", " In the midst of this consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling under the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to the bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it round the boom as it swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar was that way trapped, and all was safe. The schooner was run into the wind, and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped to the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap. For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog, throwing his long arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam. I looked at the grand and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved. The greenhorn had gone down. Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water, Queequeg, now took an instant\u2019s glance around him, and seeming to see just how matters were, dived down and disappeared."], "What does Ishmael think men and animals should be judged on, rather than their brains?": [" Look at his hump, which would be as fine eating as the buffalo\u2019s (which is esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a solid pyramid of fat. But the spermaceti itself, how bland and creamy that is; like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a cocoanut in the third month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply a substitute for butter. Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into some other substance, and then partaking of it. In the long try watches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their ship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them fry there awhile. Many a good supper have I thus made. In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine dish. The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the two plump, whitish lobes being withdrawn (precisely resembling two large puddings), they are then mixed with flour, and cooked into a most delectable mess, in flavor somewhat resembling calves\u2019 head, which is quite a dish among some epicures; and every one knows that some young bucks among the epicures, by continually dining upon calves\u2019 brains, by and by get to have a little brains of their own, so as to be able to tell a calf\u2019s head from their own heads; which, indeed, requires uncommon discrimination.", " And if ever I go where Pliny is, I, a whaleman (more than he was), will make bold to tell him so. Because I cannot understand how it is, that while the Egyptian mummies that were buried thousands of years before even Pliny was born, do not measure so much in their coffins as a modern Kentuckian in his socks; and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest Egyptian and Nineveh tablets, by the relative proportions in which they are drawn, just as plainly prove that the high-bred, stall-fed, prize cattle of Smithfield, not only equal, but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of Pharaoh\u2019s fat kine; in the face of all this, I will not admit that of all animals the whale alone should have degenerated. But still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the more recondite Nantucketers. Whether owing to the almost omniscient look-outs at the mast-heads of the whale-ships, now penetrating even through Behring\u2019s straits, and into the remotest secret drawers and lockers of the world; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all continental coasts; the moot point is, whether Leviathan can long endure so wide a chase, and so remorseless a havoc; whether he must not at last be exterminated from the waters, and the last whale, like the last man, smoke his last pipe, and then himself evaporate in the final puff.", " He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated. \u201cWhew!\u201d he whistled at last\u2014\u201cthe squall\u2019s gone off to leeward, I think.

The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted the weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck. The poor fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept overboard; all hands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it, seemed madness. It flew from right to left, and back again, almost in one ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable of being done; those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale.", " From this last vent no blood yet came, because no vital part of him had thus far been struck. His life, as they significantly call it, was untouched. As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of his form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly revealed. His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been, were beheld. As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the noblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points which the whale\u2019s eyes had once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable to see. But pity there was none. For all his old age, and his one arm, and his blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in order to light the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all. Still rolling in his blood, at last he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance, the size of a bushel, low down on the flank.", " the winds are just crossing swords, pell-mell they\u2019ll go lunging presently.

If I claim the demi-god then, why not the prophet? Nor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the whole roll of our order. Our grand master is still to be named; for like royal kings of old times, we find the head waters of our fraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves. That wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the Shaster, which gives us the dread Vishnoo, one of the three persons in the godhead of the Hindoos; gives us this divine Vishnoo himself for our Lord;\u2014Vishnoo, who, by the first of his ten earthly incarnations, has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale.", " The whale has no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler, you will say. _The whale no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler?_ Who wrote the first account of our Leviathan?

Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile.

The Grand Armada. The long and narrow peninsula of Malacca, extending south-eastward from the territories of Birmah, forms the most southerly point of all Asia. In a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of Sumatra, Java, Bally, and Timor; which, with many others, form a vast mole, or rampart, lengthwise connecting Asia with Australia, and dividing the long unbroken Indian ocean from the thickly studded oriental archipelagoes. This rampart is pierced by several sally-ports for the convenience of ships and whales; conspicuous among which are the straits of Sunda and Malacca. By the straits of Sunda, chiefly, vessels bound to China from the west, emerge into the China seas. Those narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java; and standing midway in that vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that bold green promontory, known to seamen as Java Head; they not a little correspond to the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire: and considering the inexhaustible wealth of spices, and silks, and jewels, and gold, and ivory, with which the thousand islands of that oriental sea are enriched, it seems a significant provision of nature, that such treasures, by the very formation of the land, should at least bear the appearance, however ineffectual, of being guarded from the all-grasping western world.", " And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and screaming, and yelling, and fighting around them. Stubb was beginning to look disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay increased, when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague, there stole a faint stream of perfume, which flowed through the tide of bad smells without being absorbed by it, as one river will flow into and then along with another, without at all blending with it for a time. \u201cI have it, I have it,\u201d cried Stubb, with delight, striking something in the subterranean regions, \u201ca purse! a purse!\u201d Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of something that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old cheese; very unctuous and savory withal. You might easily dent it with your thumb; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour. And this, good friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist.", " Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all. Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it.", " There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his delirious but still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality, perhaps. Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude that the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year, say, will turn out to be identically the same with those that were found there the preceding season; though there are peculiar and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true. In general, the same remark, only within a less wide limit, applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm whales. So that though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for example, on what is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow, that were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season, she would infallibly encounter him there."], "What does Ishmael claim is the major difference between male and female whales?": [" They soon relinquish this turbulence though, and when about three-fourths grown, break up, and separately go about in quest of settlements, that is, harems. Another point of difference between the male and female schools is still more characteristic of the sexes. Say you strike a Forty-barrel-bull\u2014poor devil! all his comrades quit him. But strike a member of the harem school, and her companions swim around her with every token of concern, sometimes lingering so near her and so long, as themselves to fall a prey. CHAPTER 89. Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish. The allusion to the waif and waif-poles in the last chapter but one, necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale fishery, of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge. It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company, a whale may be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be finally killed and captured by another vessel; and herein are indirectly comprised many minor contingencies, all partaking of this one grand feature.", " \u201cIt is generally well known that out of the crews of Whaling vessels (American) few ever return in the ships on board of which they departed.\u201d \u2014_Cruise in a Whale Boat_. \u201cSuddenly a mighty mass emerged from the water, and shot up perpendicularly into the air.

In truth, this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman, swimming about over the watery world, surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and endearments of the harem. The contrast between this Ottoman and his concubines is striking; because, while he is always of the largest leviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at full growth, are not more than one-third of the bulk of an average-sized male. They are comparatively delicate, indeed; I dare say, not to exceed half a dozen yards round the waist. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied, that upon the whole they are hereditarily entitled to _en bon point_. It is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent ramblings.", " It nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish, unless, indeed, from the inside.

Wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale, line, harpoons, and boat. Mr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was the judge. In the course of the defence, the witty Erskine went on to illustrate his position, by alluding to a recent crim. con. case, wherein a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife\u2019s viciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in the course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an action to recover possession of her. Erskine was on the other side; and he then supported it by saying, that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of the great stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned her; yet abandon her he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and therefore when a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her, the lady then became that subsequent gentleman\u2019s property, along with whatever harpoon might have been found sticking in her.", " After its first blunder-born discovery by a Dutchman, all other ships long shunned those shores as pestiferously barbarous; but the whale-ship touched there. The whale-ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony. Moreover, in the infancy of the first Australian settlement, the emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the whale-ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters. The uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess the same truth, and do commercial homage to the whale-ship, that cleared the way for the missionary and the merchant, and in many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their first destinations. If that double-bolted land, Japan, is ever to become hospitable, it is the whale-ship alone to whom the credit will be due; for already she is on the threshold. But if, in the face of all this, you still declare that whaling has no \u00e6sthetically noble associations connected with it, then am I ready to shiver fifty lances with you there, and unhorse you with a split helmet every time.", " I shall enumerate them by their fore-castle appellations; for possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigators, who may complete what I have here but begun. If any of the following whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked, then he can readily be incorporated into this System, according to his Folio, Octavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:\u2014The Bottle-Nose Whale; the Junk Whale; the Pudding-Headed Whale; the Cape Whale; the Leading Whale; the Cannon Whale; the Scragg Whale; the Coppered Whale; the Elephant Whale; the Iceberg Whale; the Quog Whale; the Blue Whale; etc. From Icelandic, Dutch, and old English authorities, there might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales, blessed with all manner of uncouth names. But I omit them as altogether obsolete; and can hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying nothing. Finally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would not be here, and at once, perfected.", " No: because the mails are very irregular between here and New Guinea. In fact, did you ever hear what might be called regular news direct or indirect from New Guinea? Yet I tell you that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific, among many others we spoke thirty different ships, every one of which had had a death by a whale, some of them more than one, and three that had each lost a boat\u2019s crew. For God\u2019s sake, be economical with your lamps and candles! not a gallon you burn, but at least one drop of man\u2019s blood was spilled for it. Secondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is an enormous creature of enormous power; but I have ever found that when narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold enormousness, they have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness; when, I declare upon my soul, I had no more idea of being facetious than Moses, when he wrote the history of the plagues of Egypt."], "How do live whales smell, according to Ishmael?": [" And where but from Nantucket, too, did that first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with imported cobblestones\u2014so goes the story\u2014to throw at the whales, in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit?

The Fin-Back is not gregarious. He seems a whale-hater, as some men are man-haters. Very shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man; this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing for his mark that style upon his back. From having the baleen in his mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes included with the right whale, among a theoretic species denominated _Whalebone whales_, that is, whales with baleen. Of these so called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be several varieties, most of which, however, are little known.

The involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in hand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack whale line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the water. That instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the line swiftly straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line, which had taken several turns around his chest and neck. Tashtego stood in the bows. He was full of the fire of the hunt. He hated Pip for a poltroon. Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath, he suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb, exclaimed interrogatively, \u201cCut?\u201d Meantime Pip\u2019s blue, choked face plainly looked, Do, for God\u2019s sake!", " Sir, I must go with ye.\u201d \u201cIf thou speakest thus to me much more, Ahab\u2019s purpose keels up in him. I tell thee no; it cannot be.\u201d \u201cOh good master, master, master! \u201cWeep so, and I will murder thee! have a care, for Ahab too is mad. Listen, and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck, and still know that I am there. And now I quit thee. Thy hand!\u2014Met! True art thou, lad, as the circumference to its centre.

What? neither lock, nor bolt, nor bar; and yet there\u2019s no opening it. It must be the spell; he told me to stay here: Aye, and told me this screwed chair was mine.", " All passed in a flash. In less than half a minute, this entire thing happened. \u201cDamn him, cut!\u201d roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was saved. So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed by yells and execrations from the crew. Tranquilly permitting these irregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain, business-like, but still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially; and that done, unofficially gave him much wholesome advice. The substance was, Never jump from a boat, Pip, except\u2014but all the rest was indefinite, as the soundest advice ever is. Now, in general, _Stick to the boat_, is your true motto in whaling; but cases will sometimes happen when _Leap from the boat_, is still better. Moreover, as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted conscientious advice to Pip, he would be leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped all advice, and concluded with a peremptory command, \u201cStick to the boat, Pip, or by the Lord, I won\u2019t pick you up if you jump; mind that."], "Because the blubber-room is dark and full of blubber and men with spades, what injury often occurs there?": [" And thus the work proceeds; the two tackles hoisting and lowering simultaneously; both whale and windlass heaving, the heavers singing, the blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the mates scarfing, the ship straining, and all hands swearing occasionally, by way of assuaging the general friction. CHAPTER 68. The Blanket. I have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject, the skin of the whale. I have had controversies about it with experienced whalemen afloat, and learned naturalists ashore. My original opinion remains unchanged; but it is only an opinion. The question is, what and where is the skin of the whale? Already you know what his blubber is. That blubber is something of the consistence of firm, close-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic and compact, and ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness. Now, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creature\u2019s skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness, yet in point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption; because you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whale\u2019s body but that same blubber; and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal, if reasonably dense, what can that be but the skin?", " Now as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange, so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it. For the strain constantly kept up by the windlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the water, and as the blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the line called the \u201cscarf,\u201d simultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck and Stubb, the mates; and just as fast as it is thus peeled off, and indeed by that very act itself, it is all the time being hoisted higher and higher aloft till its upper end grazes the main-top; the men at the windlass then cease heaving, and for a moment or two the prodigious blood-dripping mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky, and every one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings, else it may box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard. One of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen weapon called a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he dexterously slices out a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass.", " The end of the hawser-like rope winding through these intricacies, was then conducted to the windlass, and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over the whale; to this block the great blubber hook, weighing some one hundred pounds, was attached. And now suspended in stages over the side, Starbuck and Stubb, the mates, armed with their long spades, began cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just above the nearest of the two side-fins. This done, a broad, semicircular line is cut round the hole, the hook is inserted, and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus, now commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass. When instantly, the entire ship careens over on her side; every bolt in her starts like the nail-heads of an old house in frosty weather; she trembles, quivers, and nods her frighted mast-heads to the sky. More and more she leans over to the whale, while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows; till at last, a swift, startling snap is heard; with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from the whale, and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber.", " I should say that those New England rocks on the sea-coast, which Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergs\u2014I should say, that those rocks must not a little resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular. It also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact with other whales; for I have most remarked them in the large, full-grown bulls of the species. A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the whale. It has already been said, that it is stript from him in long pieces, called blanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, this one is very happy and significant. For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an Indian poncho slipt over his head, and skirting his extremity. It is by reason of this cosy blanketing of his body, that the whale is enabled to keep himself comfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and tides."], "What does the mincer wear when slicing pieces of blubber for the pots?": [" The mincer now stands before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling. Immemorial to all his order, this investiture alone will adequately protect him, while employed in the peculiar functions of his office. That office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber for the pots; an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse, planted endwise against the bulwarks, and with a capacious tub beneath it, into which the minced pieces drop, fast as the sheets from a rapt orator\u2019s desk. Arrayed in decent black; occupying a conspicuous pulpit; intent on bible leaves; what a candidate for an archbishopric, what a lad for a Pope were this mincer! * *Bible leaves! Bible leaves! This is the invariable cry from the mates to the mincer. It enjoins him to be careful, and cut his work into as thin slices as possible, inasmuch as by so doing the business of boiling out the oil is much accelerated, and its quantity considerably increased, besides perhaps improving it in quality.", " I should say that those New England rocks on the sea-coast, which Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergs\u2014I should say, that those rocks must not a little resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular. It also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact with other whales; for I have most remarked them in the large, full-grown bulls of the species.

CHAPTER 68. The Blanket. I have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject, the skin of the whale. I have had controversies about it with experienced whalemen afloat, and learned naturalists ashore. My original opinion remains unchanged; but it is only an opinion. The question is, what and where is the skin of the whale? Already you know what his blubber is. That blubber is something of the consistence of firm, close-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic and compact, and ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness. Now, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creature\u2019s skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness, yet in point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption; because you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whale\u2019s body but that same blubber; and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal, if reasonably dense, what can that be but the skin?", " This place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for the blanket-pieces, when stript and hoisted from the whale. When the proper time arrives for cutting up its contents, this apartment is a scene of terror to all tyros, especially by night. On one side, lit by a dull lantern, a space has been left clear for the workmen. They generally go in pairs,\u2014a pike-and-gaffman and a spade-man. The whaling-pike is similar to a frigate\u2019s boarding-weapon of the same name. The gaff is something like a boat-hook. With his gaff, the gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber, and strives to hold it from slipping, as the ship pitches and lurches about. Meanwhile, the spade-man stands on the sheet itself, perpendicularly chopping it into the portable horse-pieces. This spade is sharp as hone can make it; the spademan\u2019s feet are shoeless; the thing he stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from him, like a sledge."], "Why are whaling ships always well-lit?": [" But there is another thing to rebut. They hint that all whales always smell bad. Now how did this odious stigma originate? I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the Greenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago. Because those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their oil at sea as the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the fresh blubber in small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of large casks, and carry it home in that manner; the shortness of the season in those Icy Seas, and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed, forbidding any other course. The consequence is, that upon breaking into the hold, and unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in the Greenland dock, a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an old city grave-yard, for the foundations of a Lying-in Hospital.", " However, it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands. Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found. \u201cAnd what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It\u2019s all right enough; thou art shipped.\u201d \u201cYes, but I should like to see him.\u201d \u201cBut I don\u2019t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the house; a sort of sick, and yet he don\u2019t look so. In fact, he ain\u2019t sick; but no, he isn\u2019t well either. Any how, young man, he won\u2019t always see me, so I don\u2019t suppose he will thee. He\u2019s a queer man, Captain Ahab\u2014so some think\u2014but a good one. Oh, thou\u2019lt like him well enough; no fear, no fear. He\u2019s a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab; doesn\u2019t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen. Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab\u2019s above the common; Ahab\u2019s been in colleges, as well as \u2019mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than whales.", " So Queequeg and I got down our traps, resolving, however, to sleep ashore till the last. But it seems they always give very long notice in these cases, and the ship did not sail for several days. But no wonder; there was a good deal to be done, and there is no telling how many things to be thought of, before the Pequod was fully equipped. Every one knows what a multitude of things\u2014beds, sauce-pans, knives and forks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what not, are indispensable to the business of housekeeping. Just so with whaling, which necessitates a three-years\u2019 housekeeping upon the wide ocean, far from all grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, and bankers. And though this also holds true of merchant vessels, yet not by any means to the same extent as with whalemen. For besides the great length of the whaling voyage, the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution of the fishery, and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors usually frequented, it must be remembered, that of all ships, whaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds, and especially to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which the success of the voyage most depends.", " \u201cBut what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of shipping ye.\u201d \u201cWell, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world.\u201d \u201cWant to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?\u201d \u201cWho is Captain Ahab, sir?\u201d \u201cAye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.\u201d \u201cI am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself.\u201d \u201cThou art speaking to Captain Peleg\u2014that\u2019s who ye are speaking to, young man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We are part owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one leg.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean, sir?"], "Pip describes the doubloon on the mast as the ship\u2019s ___.": [" Haul in, haul in, Tahitian!

Ho! there\u2019s his arm just breaking water. A hatchet! a hatchet! cut it off\u2014we haul in no cowards here. Captain Ahab! sir, sir! here\u2019s Pip, trying to get on board again.\u201d \u201cPeace, thou crazy loon,\u201d cried the Manxman, seizing him by the arm. \u201cAway from the quarter-deck!\u201d \u201cThe greater idiot ever scolds the lesser,\u201d muttered Ahab, advancing. \u201cHands off from that holiness! Where sayest thou Pip was, boy? \u201cAstern there, sir, astern! Lo! lo!\u201d \u201cAnd who art thou, boy? I see not my reflection in the vacant pupils of thy eyes.

Ye did beget this luckless child, and have abandoned him, ye creative libertines. Here, boy; Ahab\u2019s cabin shall be Pip\u2019s home henceforth, while Ahab lives. Thou touchest my inmost centre, boy; thou art tied to me by cords woven of my heart-strings. Come, let\u2019s down.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s this? here\u2019s velvet shark-skin,\u201d intently gazing at Ahab\u2019s hand, and feeling it. \u201cAh, now, had poor Pip but felt so kind a thing as this, perhaps he had ne\u2019er been lost! This seems to me, sir, as a man-rope; something that weak souls may hold by. Oh, sir, let old Perth now come and rivet these two hands together; the black one with the white, for I will not let this go.\u201d \u201cOh, boy, nor will I thee, unless I should thereby drag thee to worse horrors than are here.", " Sir, I must go with ye.\u201d \u201cIf thou speakest thus to me much more, Ahab\u2019s purpose keels up in him. I tell thee no; it cannot be.\u201d \u201cOh good master, master, master! \u201cWeep so, and I will murder thee! have a care, for Ahab too is mad. Listen, and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck, and still know that I am there. And now I quit thee. Thy hand!\u2014Met! True art thou, lad, as the circumference to its centre. So: God for ever bless thee; and if it come to that,\u2014God for ever save thee, let what will befall.\u201d (_Ahab goes; Pip steps one step forward._) \u201cHere he this instant stood; I stand in his air,\u2014but I\u2019m alone. Now were even poor Pip here I could endure it, but he\u2019s missing. Pip! Pip! Ding, dong, ding! Who\u2019s seen Pip? He must be up here; let\u2019s try the door. What? neither lock, nor bolt, nor bar; and yet there\u2019s no opening it. It must be the spell; he told me to stay here: Aye, and told me this screwed chair was mine.", " Now, in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the boats. Some few hands are reserved called ship-keepers, whose province it is to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale. As a general thing, these ship-keepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats\u2019 crews. But if there happen to be an unduly slender, clumsy, or timorous wight in the ship, that wight is certain to be made a ship-keeper. It was so in the Pequod with the little negro Pippin by nick-name, Pip by abbreviation. Poor Pip! ye have heard of him before; ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight, so gloomy-jolly. In outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black pony and a white one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar colour, driven in one eccentric span. But while hapless Dough-Boy was by nature dull and torpid in his intellects, Pip, though over tender-hearted, was at bottom very bright, with that pleasant, genial, jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe; a tribe, which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer, freer relish than any other race."], "Where does Ishmael keep a record of whale dimensions that he measured from a skeleton in Tranque?": [" Think you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to this leviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman\u2019s imagination? Having already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole, jaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his unobstructed bones. But as the colossal skull embraces so very large a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton; as it is by far the most complicated part; and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in this chapter, you must not fail to carry it in your mind, or under your arm, as we proceed, otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the general structure we are about to view. In length, the Sperm Whale\u2019s skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two feet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have been ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one fifth in length compared with the living body.", " In general thickness, they all bore a seemly correspondence to their length. The middle ribs were the most arched. In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay footpath bridges over small streams. In considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the circumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton of the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form. The largest of the Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that part of the fish which, in life, is greatest in depth. Now, the greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen feet; whereas, the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight feet. So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the living magnitude of that part. Besides, for some way, where I now saw but a naked spine, all that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels.", " But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true form. Not at all. For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan, that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape. Though Jeremy Bentham\u2019s skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed utilitarian old gentleman, with all Jeremy\u2019s other leading personal characteristics; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan\u2019s articulated bones. In fact, as the great Hunter says, the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it. This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head, as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown. It is also very curiously displayed in the side fin, the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand, minus only the thumb.", " CHAPTER 102. A Bower in the Arsacides. Hitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I have chiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and in detail upon some few interior structural features. But to a large and thorough sweeping comprehension of him, it behooves me now to unbutton him still further, and untagging the points of his hose, unbuckling his garters, and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost bones, set him before you in his ultimatum; that is to say, in his unconditional skeleton. But how now, Ishmael? How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the fishery, pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the whale? Did erudite Stubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver lectures on the anatomy of the Cetacea; and by help of the windlass, hold up a specimen rib for exhibition? Explain thyself, Ishmael. Can you land a full-grown whale on your deck for examination, as a cook dishes a roast-pig?"], "Before the Pequod had even left Nantucket, Ahab\u2019s fake leg had twisted around and very nearly ___.": [" Who knows it? Not all Nantucket, I guess. But hows\u2019ever, mayhap, ye\u2019ve heard tell about the leg, and how he lost it; aye, ye have heard of that, I dare say. Oh yes, _that_ every one knows a\u2019most\u2014I mean they know he\u2019s only one leg; and that a parmacetti took the other off.\u201d \u201cMy friend,\u201d said I, \u201cwhat all this gibberish of yours is about, I don\u2019t know, and I don\u2019t much care; for it seems to me that you must be a little damaged in the head. But if you are speaking of Captain Ahab, of that ship there, the Pequod, then let me tell you, that I know all about the loss of his leg.\u201d \u201c_All_ about it, eh\u2014sure you do?\u2014all?\u201d \u201cPretty sure.\u201d With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar-like stranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a little, turned and said:\u2014\u201cYe\u2019ve shipped, have ye? Names down on the papers? Well, well, what\u2019s signed, is signed; and what\u2019s to be, will be; and then again, perhaps it won\u2019t be, after all.", " I\u2019ll smoke no more\u2014\u201d He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea. The fire hissed in the waves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made. With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the planks. CHAPTER 31. Queen Mab. Next morning Stubb accosted Flask. \u201cSuch a queer dream, King-Post, I never had. You know the old man\u2019s ivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to kick back, upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And then, presto! Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept kicking at it. But what was still more curious, Flask\u2014you know how curious all dreams are\u2014through all this rage that I was in, I somehow seemed to be thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an insult, that kick from Ahab. \u2018Why,\u2019 thinks I, \u2018what\u2019s the row? It\u2019s not a real leg, only a false leg.\u2019 And there\u2019s a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump.", " And here\u2019s his leg! Yes, now that I think of it, here\u2019s his bedfellow! has a stick of whale\u2019s jaw-bone for a wife! And this is his leg; he\u2019ll stand on this. What was that now about one leg standing in three places, and all three places standing in one hell\u2014how was that? Oh! I don\u2019t wonder he looked so scornful at me! I\u2019m a sort of strange-thoughted sometimes, they say; but that\u2019s only haphazard-like. Then, a short, little old body like me, should never undertake to wade out into deep waters with tall, heron-built captains; the water chucks you under the chin pretty quick, and there\u2019s a great cry for life-boats. And here\u2019s the heron\u2019s leg! long and slim, sure enough! Now, for most folks one pair of legs lasts a lifetime, and that must be because they use them mercifully, as a tender-hearted old lady uses her roly-poly old coach-horses. But Ahab; oh he\u2019s a hard driver. Look, driven one leg to death, and spavined the other for life, and now wears out bone legs by the cord.", " \u201cIt\u2019s a white whale, I say,\u201d resumed Ahab, as he threw down the topmaul: \u201ca white whale. Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for white water; if ye see but a bubble, sing out.\u201d All this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even more intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately touched by some specific recollection. \u201cCaptain Ahab,\u201d said Tashtego, \u201cthat white whale must be the same that some call Moby Dick.\u201d \u201cMoby Dick?\u201d shouted Ahab. \u201cDo ye know the white whale then, Tash?\u201d \u201cDoes he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?\u201d said the Gay-Header deliberately. \u201cAnd has he a curious spout, too,\u201d said Daggoo, \u201cvery bushy, even for a parmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?\u201d \u201cAnd he have one, two, three\u2014oh! good many iron in him hide, too, Captain,\u201d cried Queequeg disjointedly, \u201call twiske-tee be-twisk, like him\u2014him\u2014\u201d faltering hard for a word, and screwing his hand round and round as though uncorking a bottle\u2014\u201clike him\u2014him\u2014\u201d \u201cCorkscrew!\u201d cried Ahab, \u201caye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted and wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a whole shock of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the great annual sheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails like a split jib in a squall."], "When Starbuck confronts Ahab about leaking oil barrels that are costing the crew profit, how does Ahab respond?": [" But, mastering his emotion, he half calmly rose, and as he quitted the cabin, paused for an instant and said: \u201cThou hast outraged, not insulted me, sir; but for that I ask thee not to beware of Starbuck; thou wouldst but laugh; but let Ahab beware of Ahab; beware of thyself, old man.\u201d \u201cHe waxes brave, but nevertheless obeys; most careful bravery that!\u201d murmured Ahab, as Starbuck disappeared. \u201cWhat\u2019s that he said\u2014Ahab beware of Ahab\u2014there\u2019s something there!\u201d Then unconsciously using the musket for a staff, with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little cabin; but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed, and returning the gun to the rack, he went to the deck. \u201cThou art but too good a fellow, Starbuck,\u201d he said lowly to the mate; then raising his voice to the crew: \u201cFurl the t\u2019gallant-sails, and close-reef the top-sails, fore and aft; back the main-yard; up Burton, and break out in the main-hold.\u201d It were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was, that as respecting Starbuck, Ahab thus acted.", " Certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor macassar oil, nor castor oil, nor bear\u2019s oil, nor train oil, nor cod-liver oil. What then can it possibly be, but sperm oil in its unmanufactured, unpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils? Think of that, ye loyal Britons! we whalemen supply your kings and queens with coronation stuff! CHAPTER 26. Knights and Squires. The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and a Quaker by descent. He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an icy coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being hard as twice-baked biscuit. Transported to the Indies, his live blood would not spoil like bottled ale. He must have been born in some time of general drought and famine, or upon one of those fast days for which his state is famous. Only some thirty arid summers had he seen; those summers had dried up all his physical superfluousness.", " Begone!\u201d \u201cCaptain Ahab mistakes; it is I. The oil in the hold is leaking, sir. We must up Burtons and break out.\u201d \u201cUp Burtons and break out? Now that we are nearing Japan; heave-to here for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops?\u201d \u201cEither do that, sir, or waste in one day more oil than we may make good in a year. What we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth saving, sir.\u201d \u201cSo it is, so it is; if we get it.\u201d \u201cI was speaking of the oil in the hold, sir.\u201d \u201cAnd I was not speaking or thinking of that at all. Begone! Let it leak! I\u2019m all aleak myself. Aye! leaks in leaks! not only full of leaky casks, but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship; and that\u2019s a far worse plight than the Pequod\u2019s, man. Yet I don\u2019t stop to plug my leak; for who can find it in the deep-loaded hull; or how hope to plug it, even if found, in this life\u2019s howling gale? Starbuck! I\u2019ll not have the Burtons hoisted.\u201d \u201cWhat will the owners say, sir?\u201d \u201cLet the owners stand on Nantucket beach and outyell the Typhoons.", " But no more of this. Assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this skin, as in the case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk of one hundred barrels of oil; and, when it is considered that, in quantity, or rather weight, that oil, in its expressed state, is only three fourths, and not the entire substance of the coat; some idea may hence be had of the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere part of whose mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that. Reckoning ten barrels to the ton, you have ten tons for the net weight of only three quarters of the stuff of the whale\u2019s skin. In life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among the many marvels he presents. Almost invariably it is all over obliquely crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in thick array, something like those in the finest Italian line engravings. But these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above mentioned, but seem to be seen through it, as if they were engraved upon the body itself."], "When Queequeg decorates the coffin that he\u2019d had made, what does he use for the decoration?": [" Leaning over in his hammock, Queequeg long regarded the coffin with an attentive eye. He then called for his harpoon, had the wooden stock drawn from it, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of the paddles of his boat. All by his own request, also, biscuits were then ranged round the sides within: a flask of fresh water was placed at the head, and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot; and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled up for a pillow, Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed, that he might make trial of its comforts, if any it had. He lay without moving a few minutes, then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little god, Yojo. Then crossing his arms on his breast with Yojo between, he called for the coffin lid (hatch he called it) to be placed over him. The head part turned over with a leather hinge, and there lay Queequeg in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in view.", " He added, that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock, according to the usual sea-custom, tossed like something vile to the death-devouring sharks. No: he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket, all the more congenial to him, being a whaleman, that like a whale-boat these coffin-canoes were without a keel; though that involved but uncertain steering, and much lee-way adown the dim ages. Now, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter was at once commanded to do Queequeg\u2019s bidding, whatever it might include. There was some heathenish, coffin-coloured old lumber aboard, which, upon a long previous voyage, had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the Lackaday islands, and from these dark planks the coffin was recommended to be made. No sooner was the carpenter apprised of the order, than taking his rule, he forthwith with all the indifferent promptitude of his character, proceeded into the forecastle and took Queequeg\u2019s measure with great accuracy, regularly chalking Queequeg\u2019s person as he shifted the rule.", " Were ever such things done before with a coffin? Some superstitious old carpenters, now, would be tied up in the rigging, ere they would do the job. But I\u2019m made of knotty Aroostook hemlock; I don\u2019t budge. Cruppered with a coffin! Sailing about with a grave-yard tray! But never mind. We workers in woods make bridal-bedsteads and card-tables, as well as coffins and hearses. We work by the month, or by the job, or by the profit; not for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work, unless it be too confounded cobbling, and then we stash it if we can. Hem! I\u2019ll do the job, now, tenderly. I\u2019ll have me\u2014let\u2019s see\u2014how many in the ship\u2019s company, all told? But I\u2019ve forgotten. Any way, I\u2019ll have me thirty separate, Turk\u2019s-headed life-lines, each three feet long hanging all round to the coffin. Then, if the hull go down, there\u2019ll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin, a sight not seen very often beneath the sun!", " \u201cAh! poor fellow! he\u2019ll have to die now,\u201d ejaculated the Long Island sailor. Going to his vice-bench, the carpenter for convenience sake and general reference, now transferringly measured on it the exact length the coffin was to be, and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches at its extremities. This done, he marshalled the planks and his tools, and to work. When the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and fitted, he lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it, inquiring whether they were ready for it yet in that direction. Overhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the people on deck began to drive the coffin away, Queequeg, to every one\u2019s consternation, commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to him, nor was there any denying him; seeing that, of all mortals, some dying men are the most tyrannical; and certainly, since they will shortly trouble us so little for evermore, the poor fellows ought to be indulged."], "When Ahab has the blacksmith make a special harpoon for Moby Dick, what does Ahab give him for the metal?": [" Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye have seen\u2014Moby Dick\u2014Moby Dick!\u201d \u201cCaptain Ahab,\u201d said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder. \u201cCaptain Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick\u2014but it was not Moby Dick that took off thy leg?\u201d \u201cWho told thee that?\u201d cried Ahab; then pausing, \u201cAye, Starbuck; aye, my hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now. Aye, aye,\u201d he shouted with a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose; \u201cAye, aye! it was that accursed white whale that razed me; made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day!\u201d Then tossing both arms, with measureless imprecations he shouted out: \u201cAye, aye! and I\u2019ll chase him round Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and round perdition\u2019s flames before I give him up.", " \u201cAre these thy Mother Carey\u2019s chickens, Perth? they are always flying in thy wake; birds of good omen, too, but not to all;\u2014look here, they burn; but thou\u2014thou liv\u2019st among them without a scorch.\u201d \u201cBecause I am scorched all over, Captain Ahab,\u201d answered Perth, resting for a moment on his hammer; \u201cI am past scorching; not easily can\u2019st thou scorch a scar.\u201d \u201cWell, well; no more. Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly, sanely woeful to me. In no Paradise myself, I am impatient of all misery in others that is not mad.

Here are my razors\u2014the best of steel; here, and make the barbs sharp as the needle-sleet of the Icy Sea.\u201d For a moment, the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would fain not use them. \u201cTake them, man, I have no need for them; for I now neither shave, sup, nor pray till\u2014but here\u2014to work!\u201d Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape, and welded by Perth to the shank, the steel soon pointed the end of the iron; and as the blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat, prior to tempering them, he cried to Ahab to place the water-cask near.", " \u201cIt\u2019s a white whale, I say,\u201d resumed Ahab, as he threw down the topmaul: \u201ca white whale. Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for white water; if ye see but a bubble, sing out.\u201d All this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even more intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately touched by some specific recollection. \u201cCaptain Ahab,\u201d said Tashtego, \u201cthat white whale must be the same that some call Moby Dick.\u201d \u201cMoby Dick?\u201d shouted Ahab. \u201cDo ye know the white whale then, Tash?\u201d \u201cDoes he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?\u201d said the Gay-Header deliberately. \u201cAnd has he a curious spout, too,\u201d said Daggoo, \u201cvery bushy, even for a parmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?\u201d \u201cAnd he have one, two, three\u2014oh! good many iron in him hide, too, Captain,\u201d cried Queequeg disjointedly, \u201call twiske-tee be-twisk, like him\u2014him\u2014\u201d faltering hard for a word, and screwing his hand round and round as though uncorking a bottle\u2014\u201clike him\u2014him\u2014\u201d \u201cCorkscrew!\u201d cried Ahab, \u201caye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted and wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a whole shock of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the great annual sheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails like a split jib in a squall."], "What does Ahab carry in his pocket?": [" \u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d \u201cOld Thunder!\u201d said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his pivot-hole; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed lances of fire. Now, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off the perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea some ships carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the water. But as this conductor must descend to considerable depth, that its end may avoid all contact with the hull; and as moreover, if kept constantly towing there, it would be liable to many mishaps, besides interfering not a little with some of the rigging, and more or less impeding the vessel\u2019s way in the water; because of all this, the lower parts of a ship\u2019s lightning-rods are not always overboard; but are generally made in long slender links, so as to be the more readily hauled up into the chains outside, or thrown down into the sea, as occasion may require.", " No more White Whales for me; I\u2019ve lowered for him once, and that has satisfied me. There would be great glory in killing him, I know that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm in him, but, hark ye, he\u2019s best let alone; don\u2019t you think so, Captain?\u201d\u2014glancing at the ivory leg. \u201cHe is. But he will still be hunted, for all that. What is best let alone, that accursed thing is not always what least allures. He\u2019s all a magnet! How long since thou saw\u2019st him last? Which way heading?\u201d \u201cBless my soul, and curse the foul fiend\u2019s,\u201d cried Bunger, stoopingly walking round Ahab, and like a dog, strangely snuffing; \u201cthis man\u2019s blood\u2014bring the thermometer!\u2014it\u2019s at the boiling point!\u2014his pulse makes these planks beat!\u2014sir!\u201d\u2014taking a lancet from his pocket, and drawing near to Ahab\u2019s arm. \u201cAvast!\u201d roared Ahab, dashing him against the bulwarks\u2014\u201cMan the boat! Which way heading?\u201d \u201cGood God!\u201d cried the English Captain, to whom the question was put.", " And as Ahab, leaning over the taffrail, eyed the homeward-bound craft, he took from his pocket a small vial of sand, and then looking from the ship to the vial, seemed thereby bringing two remote associations together, for that vial was filled with Nantucket soundings. CHAPTER 116. The Dying Whale. Not seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune\u2019s favourites sail close by us, we, though all adroop before, catch somewhat of the rushing breeze, and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out. So seemed it with the Pequod. For next day after encountering the gay Bachelor, whales were seen and four were slain; and one of them by Ahab. It was far down the afternoon; and when all the spearings of the crimson fight were done: and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky, sun and whale both stilly died together; then, such a sweetness and such plaintiveness, such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy air, that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent valleys of the Manilla isles, the Spanish land-breeze, wantonly turned sailor, had gone to sea, freighted with these vesper hymns.", " There\u2019s a governor!\u201d \u201cDo you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab?\u201d \u201cDo I suppose it? You\u2019ll know it before long, Flask. But I am going now to keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything very suspicious going on, I\u2019ll just take him by the nape of his neck, and say\u2014Look here, Beelzebub, you don\u2019t do it; and if he makes any fuss, by the Lord I\u2019ll make a grab into his pocket for his tail, take it to the capstan, and give him such a wrenching and heaving, that his tail will come short off at the stump\u2014do you see; and then, I rather guess when he finds himself docked in that queer fashion, he\u2019ll sneak off without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs.\u201d \u201cAnd what will you do with the tail, Stubb?\u201d \u201cDo with it? Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;\u2014what else?\u201d \u201cNow, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all along, Stubb?\u201d \u201cMean or not mean, here we are at the ship.\u201d The boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side, where fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for securing him."], "Over the course of the voyage, Ahab destroys all of ___.": [" From even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation, and the possible consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground, Ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect himself. That protection could only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand, backed by a heedful, closely calculating attention to every minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be subjected to. For all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the Pequod\u2019s voyage; observe all customary usages; and not only that, but force himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general pursuit of his profession. Be all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the three mast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out, and not omit reporting even a porpoise.", " Though in the course of his continual voyagings Ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight, yet, to any monomaniac man, the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings. \u201cSwim away from me, do ye?\u201d murmured Ahab, gazing over into the water. There seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced. But turning to the steersman, who thus far had been holding the ship in the wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old lion voice,\u2014\u201cUp helm! Keep her off round the world!\u201d Round the world! There is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings; but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct? Only through numberless perils to the very point whence we started, where those that we left behind secure, were all the time before us. Were this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could for ever reach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and strange than any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon, then there were promise in the voyage.", " look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own.\u201d \u201cWhat! how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else, never mind how foolish?\u201d \u201cHere!\u201d cried Starbuck, seizing Stubb by the shoulder, and pointing his hand towards the weather bow, \u201cmarkest thou not that the gale comes from the eastward, the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick? the very course he swung to this day noon? now mark his boat there; where is that stove? In the stern-sheets, man; where he is wont to stand\u2014his stand-point is stove, man! Now jump overboard, and sing away, if thou must! \u201cI don\u2019t half understand ye: what\u2019s in the wind?\u201d \u201cYes, yes, round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to Nantucket,\u201d soliloquized Starbuck suddenly, heedless of Stubb\u2019s question. \u201cThe gale that now hammers at us to stave us, we can turn it into a fair wind that will drive us towards home. Yonder, to windward, all is blackness of doom; but to leeward, homeward\u2014I see it lightens up there; but not with the lightning.\u201d At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness, following the flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost at the same instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead.", " Is not the main-truck higher than the kelson is low?

Through thee, thy flaming self, my scorched eyes do dimly see it. Oh, thou foundling fire, thou hermit immemorial, thou too hast thy incommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated grief.

As the silent harpoon burned there like a serpent\u2019s tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab by the arm\u2014\u201cGod, God is against thee, old man; forbear!", " Quick! forge me the harpoon. And forge me first, twelve rods for its shank; then wind, and twist, and hammer these twelve together like the yarns and strands of a tow-line. Quick! I\u2019ll blow the fire.\u201d When at last the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by one, by spiralling them, with his own hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt. \u201cA flaw!\u201d rejecting the last one. \u201cWork that over again, Perth.\u201d This done, Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one, when Ahab stayed his hand, and said he would weld his own iron. As, then, with regular, gasping hems, he hammered on the anvil, Perth passing to him the glowing rods, one after the other, and the hard pressed forge shooting up its intense straight flame, the Parsee passed silently, and bowing over his head towards the fire, seemed invoking some curse or some blessing on the toil. But, as Ahab looked up, he slid aside. \u201cWhat\u2019s that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?\u201d muttered Stubb, looking on from the forecastle.", " But seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board, sets up this little hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the andirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty, so that I thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his Congo idol. I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but ill at ease meantime\u2014to see what was next to follow. First he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite offer of it to the little negro.", " He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed. There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen, and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style; only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to windward;\u2014for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together. Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl. \u201cIs this the Captain of the Pequod?\u201d said I, advancing to the door of the tent. \u201cSupposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of him?\u201d he demanded."], "When Starbuck sees a row of muskets, what does he consider doing?": [" No mercy, no power but its own controls it.

Consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures glide under water, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure. Consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes, as the dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks. Consider, once more, the universal cannibalism of the sea; all whose creatures prey upon each other, carrying on eternal war since the world began. Consider all this; and then turn to this green, gentle, and most docile earth; consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you not find a strange analogy to something in yourself?

Aye, aye,\u201d he shouted with a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose; \u201cAye, aye! it was that accursed white whale that razed me; made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day!\u201d Then tossing both arms, with measureless imprecations he shouted out: \u201cAye, aye! and I\u2019ll chase him round Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and round perdition\u2019s flames before I give him up.", " But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed not to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else have marked it much, it being no uncommon circumstance; only now almost the least heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight. \u201cYour hat, your hat, sir!\u201d suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman, who being posted at the mizen-mast-head, stood directly behind Ahab, though somewhat lower than his level, and with a deep gulf of air dividing them. But already the sable wing was before the old man\u2019s eyes; the long hooked bill at his head: with a scream, the black hawk darted away with his prize. An eagle flew thrice round Tarquin\u2019s head, removing his cap to replace it, and thereupon Tanaquil, his wife, declared that Tarquin would be king of Rome. But only by the replacing of the cap was that omen accounted good. Ahab\u2019s hat was never restored; the wild hawk flew on and on with it; far in advance of the prow: and at last disappeared; while from the point of that disappearance, a minute black spot was dimly discerned, falling from that vast height into the sea.", " Immediately he was recognised by Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew. But no formal salutation was exchanged. \u201cWhere was he?\u2014not killed!\u2014not killed!\u201d cried Ahab, closely advancing. \u201cHow was it?\u201d It seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous, while three of the stranger\u2019s boats were engaged with a shoal of whales, which had led them some four or five miles from the ship; and while they were yet in swift chase to windward, the white hump and head of Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water, not very far to leeward; whereupon, the fourth rigged boat\u2014a reserved one\u2014had been instantly lowered in chase. After a keen sail before the wind, this fourth boat\u2014the swiftest keeled of all\u2014seemed to have succeeded in fastening\u2014at least, as well as the man at the mast-head could tell anything about it. In the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat; and then a swift gleam of bubbling white water; and after that nothing more; whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his pursuers, as often happens.", " Ah! how they still strove through that infinite blueness to seek out the thing that might destroy them! \u201cWhy sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?\u201d cried Ahab, when, after the lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been heard. \u201cSway me up, men; ye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts one odd jet that way, and then disappears.\u201d It was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken some other thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon proved; for hardly had Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope belayed to its pin on deck, when he struck the key-note to an orchestra, that made the air vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles. The triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard, as\u2014much nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet, less than a mile ahead\u2014Moby Dick bodily burst into view! For not by any calm and indolent spoutings; not by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head, did the White Whale now reveal his vicinity; but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching."], "When Ahab and Starbuck talk about their families, how does Ahab see himself on his relentless quest?": [" Starbuck\u2019s body and Starbuck\u2019s coerced will were Ahab\u2019s, so long as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbuck\u2019s brain; still he knew that for all this the chief mate, in his soul, abhorred his captain\u2019s quest, and could he, would joyfully disintegrate himself from it, or even frustrate it. It might be that a long interval would elapse ere the White Whale was seen. During that long interval Starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his captain\u2019s leadership, unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial influences were brought to bear upon him. Not only that, but the subtle insanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that, for the present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it; that the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure background (for few men\u2019s courage is proof against protracted meditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their long night watches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of than Moby Dick.", " But, mastering his emotion, he half calmly rose, and as he quitted the cabin, paused for an instant and said: \u201cThou hast outraged, not insulted me, sir; but for that I ask thee not to beware of Starbuck; thou wouldst but laugh; but let Ahab beware of Ahab; beware of thyself, old man.\u201d \u201cHe waxes brave, but nevertheless obeys; most careful bravery that!\u201d murmured Ahab, as Starbuck disappeared. \u201cWhat\u2019s that he said\u2014Ahab beware of Ahab\u2014there\u2019s something there!\u201d Then unconsciously using the musket for a staff, with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little cabin; but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed, and returning the gun to the rack, he went to the deck. \u201cThou art but too good a fellow, Starbuck,\u201d he said lowly to the mate; then raising his voice to the crew: \u201cFurl the t\u2019gallant-sails, and close-reef the top-sails, fore and aft; back the main-yard; up Burton, and break out in the main-hold.\u201d It were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was, that as respecting Starbuck, Ahab thus acted.", " What\u2019s that he said? he should still go before me, my pilot; and yet to be seen again? But where? Will I have eyes at the bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endless stairs? and all night I\u2019ve been sailing from him, wherever he did sink to. Aye, aye, like many more thou told\u2019st direful truth as touching thyself, O Parsee; but, Ahab, there thy shot fell short. Good-bye, mast-head\u2014keep a good eye upon the whale, the while I\u2019m gone. We\u2019ll talk to-morrow, nay, to-night, when the white whale lies down there, tied by head and tail.\u201d He gave the word; and still gazing round him, was steadily lowered through the cloven blue air to the deck. In due time the boats were lowered; but as standing in his shallop\u2019s stern, Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent, he waved to the mate,\u2014who held one of the tackle-ropes on deck\u2014and bade him pause. \u201cStarbuck!\u201d \u201cSir?\u201d \u201cFor the third time my soul\u2019s ship starts upon this voyage, Starbuck.\u201d \u201cAye, sir, thou wilt have it so.\u201d \u201cSome ships sail from their ports, and ever afterwards are missing, Starbuck!\u201d \u201cTruth, sir: saddest truth.\u201d \u201cSome men die at ebb tide; some at low water; some at the full of the flood;\u2014and I feel now like a billow that\u2019s all one crested comb, Starbuck.", " However, it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands. Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found. \u201cAnd what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It\u2019s all right enough; thou art shipped.\u201d \u201cYes, but I should like to see him.\u201d \u201cBut I don\u2019t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the house; a sort of sick, and yet he don\u2019t look so. In fact, he ain\u2019t sick; but no, he isn\u2019t well either. Any how, young man, he won\u2019t always see me, so I don\u2019t suppose he will thee. He\u2019s a queer man, Captain Ahab\u2014so some think\u2014but a good one. Oh, thou\u2019lt like him well enough; no fear, no fear. He\u2019s a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab; doesn\u2019t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen. Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab\u2019s above the common; Ahab\u2019s been in colleges, as well as \u2019mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than whales."], "What does the Delight drop into the water as the Pequod passes by?": [" Is not the main-truck higher than the kelson is low? Delight is to him\u2014a far, far upward, and inward delight\u2014who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth, ever stands forth his own inexorable self. Delight is to him whose strong arms yet support him, when the ship of this base treacherous world has gone down beneath him. Delight is to him, who gives no quarter in the truth, and kills, burns, and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robes of Senators and Judges. Delight,\u2014top-gallant delight is to him, who acknowledges no law or lord, but the Lord his God, and is only a patriot to heaven. Delight is to him, whom all the waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure Keel of the Ages. And eternal delight and deliciousness will be his, who coming to lay him down, can say with his final breath\u2014O Father!\u2014chiefly known to me by Thy rod\u2014mortal or immortal, here I die.", " CHAPTER 131. The Pequod Meets The Delight. The intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most miserably misnamed the Delight, was descried. As she drew nigh, all eyes were fixed upon her broad beams, called shears, which, in some whaling-ships, cross the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine feet; serving to carry the spare, unrigged, or disabled boats. Upon the stranger\u2019s shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and some few splintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat; but you now saw through this wreck, as plainly as you see through the peeled, half-unhinged, and bleaching skeleton of a horse. \u201cHast seen the White Whale?\u201d \u201cLook!\u201d replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail; and with his trumpet he pointed to the wreck. \u201cHast killed him?\u201d \u201cThe harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that,\u201d answered the other, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck, whose gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together.", " Upon the passage homewards, they drop them there again. How it is, there is no telling, but Islanders seem to make the best whalemen. They were nearly all Islanders in the Pequod, _Isolatoes_ too, I call such, not acknowledging the common continent of men, but each _Isolato_ living on a separate continent of his own. Yet now, federated along one keel, what a set these Isolatoes were! An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea, and all the ends of the earth, accompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod to lay the world\u2019s grievances before that bar from which not very many of them ever come back. Black Little Pip\u2014he never did\u2014oh, no! he went before. Poor Alabama boy! On the grim Pequod\u2019s forecastle, ye shall ere long see him, beating his tambourine; prelusive of the eternal time, when sent for, to the great quarter-deck on high, he was bid strike in with angels, and beat his tambourine in glory; called a coward here, hailed a hero there!", " And what was that, shipmates? To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood! That was it! \u201cThis, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of the living God who slights it. Woe to him whom this world charms from Gospel duty! Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God has brewed them into a gale! Woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appal! Woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness! Woe to him who, in this world, courts not dishonor! Woe to him who would not be true, even though to be false were salvation! Yea, woe to him who, as the great Pilot Paul has it, while preaching to others is himself a castaway!\u201d He dropped and fell away from himself for a moment; then lifting his face to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out with a heavenly enthusiasm,\u2014\u201cBut oh! shipmates! on the starboard hand of every woe, there is a sure delight; and higher the top of that delight, than the bottom of the woe is deep."], "Who wins the doubloon from the mast?": [" The Mast-Head. It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with the other seamen my first mast-head came round. In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost simultaneously with the vessel\u2019s leaving her port; even though she may have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground. And if, after a three, four, or five years\u2019 voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her\u2014say, an empty vial even\u2014then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last; and not till her skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port, does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more. Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a very ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate here. I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old Egyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to them.", " \u201cNot the same instant; not the same\u2014no, the doubloon is mine, Fate reserved the doubloon for me. _I_ only; none of ye could have raised the White Whale first. There she blows!\u2014there she blows!\u2014there she blows! There again!\u2014there again!\u201d he cried, in long-drawn, lingering, methodic tones, attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whale\u2019s visible jets. \u201cHe\u2019s going to sound! In stunsails! Down top-gallant-sails! Stand by three boats. Mr. Starbuck, remember, stay on board, and keep the ship. Helm there! Luff, luff a point! So; steady, man, steady! There go flukes! No, no; only black water! All ready the boats there? Stand by, stand by! Lower me, Mr. Starbuck; lower, lower,\u2014quick, quicker!\u201d and he slid through the air to the deck. \u201cHe is heading straight to leeward, sir,\u201d cried Stubb, \u201cright away from us; cannot have seen the ship yet.\u201d \u201cBe dumb, man! Stand by the braces! Hard down the helm!\u2014brace up!", " Now this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of the heart of gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over golden sands, the head-waters of many a Pactolus flows. And though now nailed amidst all the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes, yet, untouchable and immaculate to any foulness, it still preserved its Quito glow. Nor, though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands, and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach, nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last. For it was set apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end; and however wanton in their sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as the white whale\u2019s talisman. Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night, wondering whose it was to be at last, and whether he would ever live to spend it.", " Ye two are the opposite poles of one thing; Starbuck is Stubb reversed, and Stubb is Starbuck; and ye two are all mankind; and Ahab stands alone among the millions of the peopled earth, nor gods nor men his neighbors! Cold, cold\u2014I shiver!\u2014How now? Aloft there! D\u2019ye see him? Sing out for every spout, though he spout ten times a second!\u201d The day was nearly done; only the hem of his golden robe was rustling. Soon, it was almost dark, but the look-out men still remained unset. \u201cCan\u2019t see the spout now, sir;\u2014too dark\u201d\u2014cried a voice from the air. \u201cHow heading when last seen?\u201d \u201cAs before, sir,\u2014straight to leeward.\u201d \u201cGood! he will travel slower now \u2019tis night. Down royals and top-gallant stun-sails, Mr. Starbuck. We must not run over him before morning; he\u2019s making a passage now, and may heave-to a while. Helm there! keep her full before the wind!\u2014Aloft! come down!\u2014Mr. Stubb, send a fresh hand to the fore-mast head, and see it manned till morning.\u201d\u2014Then advancing towards the doubloon in the main-mast\u2014\u201cMen, this gold is mine, for I earned it; but I shall let it abide here till the White Whale is dead; and then, whosoever of ye first raises him, upon the day he shall be killed, this gold is that man\u2019s; and if on that day I shall again raise him, then, ten times its sum shall be divided among all of ye!"], "What happens to Ahab\u2019s fake leg during his fight with Moby Dick?": [" Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye have seen\u2014Moby Dick\u2014Moby Dick!\u201d \u201cCaptain Ahab,\u201d said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder. \u201cCaptain Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick\u2014but it was not Moby Dick that took off thy leg?\u201d \u201cWho told thee that?\u201d cried Ahab; then pausing, \u201cAye, Starbuck; aye, my hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now. Aye, aye,\u201d he shouted with a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose; \u201cAye, aye! it was that accursed white whale that razed me; made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day!\u201d Then tossing both arms, with measureless imprecations he shouted out: \u201cAye, aye! and I\u2019ll chase him round Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and round perdition\u2019s flames before I give him up.", " I\u2019ll smoke no more\u2014\u201d He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea. The fire hissed in the waves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe made. With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the planks. CHAPTER 31. Queen Mab. Next morning Stubb accosted Flask. \u201cSuch a queer dream, King-Post, I never had. You know the old man\u2019s ivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to kick back, upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And then, presto! Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept kicking at it. But what was still more curious, Flask\u2014you know how curious all dreams are\u2014through all this rage that I was in, I somehow seemed to be thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an insult, that kick from Ahab. \u2018Why,\u2019 thinks I, \u2018what\u2019s the row? It\u2019s not a real leg, only a false leg.\u2019 And there\u2019s a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump.", " And here\u2019s his leg! Yes, now that I think of it, here\u2019s his bedfellow! has a stick of whale\u2019s jaw-bone for a wife! And this is his leg; he\u2019ll stand on this. What was that now about one leg standing in three places, and all three places standing in one hell\u2014how was that? Oh! I don\u2019t wonder he looked so scornful at me! I\u2019m a sort of strange-thoughted sometimes, they say; but that\u2019s only haphazard-like. Then, a short, little old body like me, should never undertake to wade out into deep waters with tall, heron-built captains; the water chucks you under the chin pretty quick, and there\u2019s a great cry for life-boats. And here\u2019s the heron\u2019s leg! long and slim, sure enough! Now, for most folks one pair of legs lasts a lifetime, and that must be because they use them mercifully, as a tender-hearted old lady uses her roly-poly old coach-horses. But Ahab; oh he\u2019s a hard driver. Look, driven one leg to death, and spavined the other for life, and now wears out bone legs by the cord.", " Immediately he was recognised by Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew. But no formal salutation was exchanged. \u201cWhere was he?\u2014not killed!\u2014not killed!\u201d cried Ahab, closely advancing. \u201cHow was it?\u201d It seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous, while three of the stranger\u2019s boats were engaged with a shoal of whales, which had led them some four or five miles from the ship; and while they were yet in swift chase to windward, the white hump and head of Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water, not very far to leeward; whereupon, the fourth rigged boat\u2014a reserved one\u2014had been instantly lowered in chase. After a keen sail before the wind, this fourth boat\u2014the swiftest keeled of all\u2014seemed to have succeeded in fastening\u2014at least, as well as the man at the mast-head could tell anything about it. In the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat; and then a swift gleam of bubbling white water; and after that nothing more; whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his pursuers, as often happens."], "When Ahab realizes that Moby Dick is now chasing him, what does he say?": [" Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye have seen\u2014Moby Dick\u2014Moby Dick!\u201d \u201cCaptain Ahab,\u201d said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder. \u201cCaptain Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick\u2014but it was not Moby Dick that took off thy leg?\u201d \u201cWho told thee that?\u201d cried Ahab; then pausing, \u201cAye, Starbuck; aye, my hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick that brought me to this dead stump I stand on now.

Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity, cunning, and malice in the monster attacked; therefore it was, that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps, for the most part, were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred, more, as it were, to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large, than to the individual cause. In that way, mostly, the disastrous encounter between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded.", " And this is what ye have shipped for, men! to chase that white whale on both sides of land, and over all sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out. What say ye, men, will ye splice hands on it, now? I think ye do look brave.\u201d \u201cAye, aye!\u201d shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the excited old man: \u201cA sharp eye for the white whale; a sharp lance for Moby Dick!\u201d \u201cGod bless ye,\u201d he seemed to half sob and half shout. \u201cGod bless ye, men. Steward! go draw the great measure of grog. But what\u2019s this long face about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale? art not game for Moby Dick?\u201d \u201cI am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too, Captain Ahab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow; but I came here to hunt whales, not my commander\u2019s vengeance. How many barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, Captain Ahab?", " \u201cIt\u2019s a white whale, I say,\u201d resumed Ahab, as he threw down the topmaul: \u201ca white whale. Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for white water; if ye see but a bubble, sing out.\u201d All this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even more intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately touched by some specific recollection. \u201cCaptain Ahab,\u201d said Tashtego, \u201cthat white whale must be the same that some call Moby Dick.\u201d \u201cMoby Dick?\u201d shouted Ahab. \u201cDo ye know the white whale then, Tash?\u201d \u201cDoes he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?\u201d said the Gay-Header deliberately. \u201cAnd has he a curious spout, too,\u201d said Daggoo, \u201cvery bushy, even for a parmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?\u201d \u201cAnd he have one, two, three\u2014oh! good many iron in him hide, too, Captain,\u201d cried Queequeg disjointedly, \u201call twiske-tee be-twisk, like him\u2014him\u2014\u201d faltering hard for a word, and screwing his hand round and round as though uncorking a bottle\u2014\u201clike him\u2014him\u2014\u201d \u201cCorkscrew!\u201d cried Ahab, \u201caye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted and wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a whole shock of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the great annual sheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails like a split jib in a squall."], "What does Ahab recognize as the \u201cfirst hearse\u201d of Fedallah\u2019s prophecy?": [" The harpoon dropped from his hand. \u201cBefooled, befooled!\u201d\u2014drawing in a long lean breath\u2014\u201cAye, Parsee! I see thee again.\u2014Aye, and thou goest before; and this, _this_ then is the hearse that thou didst promise. But I hold thee to the last letter of thy word. Where is the second hearse? Away, mates, to the ship! those boats are useless now; repair them if ye can in time, and return to me; if not, Ahab is enough to die\u2014Down, men! the first thing that but offers to jump from this boat I stand in, that thing I harpoon. Ye are not other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey me.\u2014Where\u2019s the whale? gone down again?\u201d But he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping with the corpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last encounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was now again steadily swimming forward; and had almost passed the ship,\u2014which thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction to him, though for the present her headway had been stopped.", " Retribution, swift vengeance, eternal malice were in his whole aspect, and spite of all that mortal man could do, the solid white buttress of his forehead smote the ship\u2019s starboard bow, till men and timbers reeled. Some fell flat upon their faces. Like dislodged trucks, the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook on their bull-like necks. Through the breach, they heard the waters pour, as mountain torrents down a flume. \u201cThe ship! The hearse!\u2014the second hearse!\u201d cried Ahab from the boat; \u201cits wood could only be American!\u201d Diving beneath the settling ship, the whale ran quivering along its keel; but turning under water, swiftly shot to the surface again, far off the other bow, but within a few yards of Ahab\u2019s boat, where, for a time, he lay quiescent. \u201cI turn my body from the sun. What ho, Tashtego! let me hear thy hammer. Oh! ye three unsurrendered spires of mine; thou uncracked keel; and only god-bullied hull; thou firm deck, and haughty helm, and Pole-pointed prow,\u2014death-glorious ship!", " A sound like the moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven ghosts of Gomorrah, ran shuddering through the air. Started from his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw the Parsee; and hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a flooded world. \u201cI have dreamed it again,\u201d said he. \u201cOf the hearses? Have I not said, old man, that neither hearse nor coffin can be thine?\u201d \u201cAnd who are hearsed that die on the sea?\u201d \u201cBut I said, old man, that ere thou couldst die on this voyage, two hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea; the first not made by mortal hands; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in America.\u201d \u201cAye, aye! a strange sight that, Parsee:\u2014a hearse and its plumes floating over the ocean with the waves for the pall-bearers. Ha! Such a sight we shall not soon see.\u201d \u201cBelieve it or not, thou canst not die till it be seen, old man.\u201d \u201cAnd what was that saying about thyself?\u201d \u201cThough it come to the last, I shall still go before thee thy pilot.\u201d \u201cAnd when thou art so gone before\u2014if that ever befall\u2014then ere I can follow, thou must still appear to me, to pilot me still?\u2014Was it not so?", " Adventures of those three bloody-minded soldadoes? Did ye read it there, Flask? I guess ye did?\u201d \u201cNo: never saw such a book; heard of it, though. But now, tell me, Stubb, do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now, was the same you say is now on board the Pequod?\u201d \u201cAm I the same man that helped kill this whale? Doesn\u2019t the devil live for ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead? Did you ever see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil? And if the devil has a latch-key to get into the admiral\u2019s cabin, don\u2019t you suppose he can crawl into a porthole? Tell me that, Mr. Flask?\u201d \u201cHow old do you suppose Fedallah is, Stubb?\u201d \u201cDo you see that mainmast there?\u201d pointing to the ship; \u201cwell, that\u2019s the figure one; now take all the hoops in the Pequod\u2019s hold, and string along in a row with that mast, for oughts, do you see; well, that wouldn\u2019t begin to be Fedallah\u2019s age. Nor all the coopers in creation couldn\u2019t show hoops enough to make oughts enough.\u201d \u201cBut see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just now, that you meant to give Fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a good chance."], "What does Ishmael use as a life buoy?": [" But again the old Manxman said nay. The lost life-buoy was now to be replaced; Starbuck was directed to see to it; but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found, and as in the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the voyage, all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly connected with its final end, whatever that might prove to be; therefore, they were going to leave the ship\u2019s stern unprovided with a buoy, when by certain strange signs and inuendoes Queequeg hinted a hint concerning his coffin. \u201cA life-buoy of a coffin!\u201d cried Starbuck, starting. \u201cRather queer, that, I should say,\u201d said Stubb. \u201cIt will make a good enough one,\u201d said Flask, \u201cthe carpenter here can arrange it easily.\u201d \u201cBring it up; there\u2019s nothing else for it,\u201d said Starbuck, after a melancholy pause. \u201cRig it, carpenter; do not look at me so\u2014the coffin, I mean.

Make a life-buoy of the coffin, and no more.\u2014Mr. Stubb, Mr. Flask, come forward with me.\u201d \u201cHe goes off in a huff. The whole he can endure; at the parts he baulks. Now I don\u2019t like this. I make a leg for Captain Ahab, and he wears it like a gentleman; but I make a bandbox for Queequeg, and he won\u2019t put his head into it. Are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin? And now I\u2019m ordered to make a life-buoy of it. It\u2019s like turning an old coat; going to bring the flesh on the other side now. I don\u2019t like this cobbling sort of business\u2014I don\u2019t like it at all; it\u2019s undignified; it\u2019s not my place.", " A most malicious wag, that fellow. Rat-tat! So man\u2019s seconds tick! Oh! how immaterial are all materials! What things real are there, but imponderable thoughts? Here now\u2019s the very dreaded symbol of grim death, by a mere hap, made the expressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered life. A life-buoy of a coffin! Does it go further? Can it be that in some spiritual sense the coffin is, after all, but an immortality-preserver! I\u2019ll think of that. But no. So far gone am I in the dark side of earth, that its other side, the theoretic bright one, seems but uncertain twilight to me. Will ye never have done, Carpenter, with that accursed sound? I go below; let me not see that thing here when I return again. Now, then, Pip, we\u2019ll talk this over; I do suck most wondrous philosophies from thee!

Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold and cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,\u2014So, wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the south\u2014wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to inquire the price, and don\u2019t be too particular."]}
