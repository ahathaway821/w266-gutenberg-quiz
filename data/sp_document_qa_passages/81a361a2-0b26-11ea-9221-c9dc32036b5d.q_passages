{"Who promotes D\u2019Artagnan to the position of lieutenant at the end of the novel?": [" \u201cFriend,\u201d said he, \u201cfor Athos this is too much; for the Comte de la Fere it is too little. Keep the commission; it is yours. Alas! you have purchased it dearly enough.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan left Athos\u2019s chamber and went to that of Porthos. He found him clothed in a magnificent dress covered with splendid embroidery, admiring himself before a glass. \u201cAh, ah! is that you, dear friend?\u201d exclaimed Porthos. \u201cHow do you think these garments fit me?\u201d \u201cWonderfully,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cbut I come to offer you a dress which will become you still better.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d asked Porthos. \u201cThat of a lieutenant of Musketeers.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan related to Porthos the substance of his interview with the cardinal, and said, taking the commission from his pocket, \u201cHere, my friend, write your name upon it and become my chief.\u201d Porthos cast his eyes over the commission and returned it to d\u2019Artagnan, to the great astonishment of the young man.", " The guards were under arms, and d\u2019Artagnan took his place in the midst of his comrades. Monsieur passed along the front of the line; then all the superior officers approached him to pay their compliments, M. Dessessart, captain of the Guards, as well as the others. At the expiration of a minute or two, it appeared to d\u2019Artagnan that M. Dessessart made him a sign to approach. He waited for a fresh gesture on the part of his superior, for fear he might be mistaken; but this gesture being repeated, he left the ranks, and advanced to receive orders. \u201cMonsieur is about to ask for some men of good will for a dangerous mission, but one which will do honor to those who shall accomplish it; and I made you a sign in order that you might hold yourself in readiness.\u201d \u201cThanks, my captain!\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan, who wished for nothing better than an opportunity to distinguish himself under the eye of the lieutenant general.", " In the meanwhile the promises of M. de Treville went on prosperously. One fine morning the king commanded M. de Chevalier Dessessart to admit d\u2019Artagnan as a cadet in his company of Guards. D\u2019Artagnan, with a sigh, donned his uniform, which he would have exchanged for that of a Musketeer at the expense of ten years of his existence. But M. de Treville promised this favor after a novitiate of two years--a novitiate which might besides be abridged if an opportunity should present itself for d\u2019Artagnan to render the king any signal service, or to distinguish himself by some brilliant action. Upon this promise d\u2019Artagnan withdrew, and the next day he began service. Then it became the turn of Athos, Porthos, and Aramis to mount guard with d\u2019Artagnan when he was on duty. The company of M. le Chevalier Dessessart thus received four instead of one when it admitted d\u2019Artagnan. 8 CONCERNING A COURT INTRIGUE In the meantime, the forty pistoles of King Louis XIII, like all other things of this world, after having had a beginning had an end, and after this end our four companions began to be somewhat embarrassed.", " On the other side, the crimes, the power, and the infernal genius of Milady had more than once terrified him. He felt something like a secret joy at being forever relieved of this dangerous accomplice. Richelieu slowly tore the paper which d\u2019Artagnan had generously relinquished. \u201cI am lost!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan to himself. And he bowed profoundly before the cardinal, like a man who says, \u201cLord, Thy will be done!\u201d The cardinal approached the table, and without sitting down, wrote a few lines upon a parchment of which two-thirds were already filled, and affixed his seal. \u201cThat is my condemnation,\u201d thought d\u2019Artagnan; \u201che will spare me the ENNUI of the Bastille, or the tediousness of a trial. That\u2019s very kind of him.\u201d \u201cHere, monsieur,\u201d said the cardinal to the young man. \u201cI have taken from you one CARTE BLANCHE to give you another. The name is wanting in this commission; you can write it yourself.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan took the paper hesitatingly and cast his eyes over it; it was a lieutenant\u2019s commission in the Musketeers."], "What phrase best describes the tone that dominates at the beginning of The Three Musketeers?": [" M Dessessart, who esteemed d\u2019Artagnan, made him offers of help, as this change would entail expenses for equipment. D\u2019Artagnan refused; but thinking the opportunity a good one, he begged him to have the diamond he put into his hand valued, as he wished to turn it into money. The next day, M. Dessessart\u2019s valet came to d\u2019Artagnan\u2019s lodging, and gave him a bag containing seven thousand livres. This was the price of the queen\u2019s diamond. 48 A FAMILY AFFAIR Athos had invented the phrase, family affair. A family affair was not subject to the investigation of the cardinal; a family affair concerned nobody. People might employ themselves in a family affair before all the world. Therefore Athos had invented the phrase, family affair. Aramis had discovered the idea, the lackeys. Porthos had discovered the means, the diamond. D\u2019Artagnan alone had discovered nothing--he, ordinarily the most inventive of the four; but it must be also said that the very name of Milady paralyzed him.", " \u201cYou have told me the truth, my gentlemen,\u201d said he, addressing the Musketeers, \u201cand it will not be my fault if our encounter this evening be not advantageous to you. In the meantime, follow me.\u201d The cardinal alighted; the three Musketeers did likewise. The cardinal threw the bridle of his horse to his esquire; the three Musketeers fastened the horses to the shutters. The host stood at the door. For him, the cardinal was only an officer coming to visit a lady. \u201cHave you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can wait near a good fire?\u201d said the cardinal. The host opened the door of a large room, in which an old stove had just been replaced by a large and excellent chimney. \u201cI have this,\u201d said he. \u201cThat will do,\u201d replied the cardinal. \u201cEnter, gentlemen, and be kind enough to wait for me; I shall not be more than half an hour.\u201d And while the three Musketeers entered the ground floor room, the cardinal, without asking further information, ascended the staircase like a man who has no need of having his road pointed out to him.", " Justice before everything.\u201d Then turning toward M. de Treville and walking with him toward the embrasure of a window, \u201cWell, monsieur,\u201d continued he, \u201cyou say it is his Eminence\u2019s Guards who have sought a quarrel with your Musketeers?\u201d \u201cYes, sire, as they always do.\u201d \u201cAnd how did the thing happen? Let us see, for you know, my dear Captain, a judge must hear both sides.\u201d \u201cGood Lord! In the most simple and natural manner possible. Three of my best soldiers, whom your Majesty knows by name, and whose devotedness you have more than once appreciated, and who have, I dare affirm to the king, his service much at heart--three of my best soldiers, I say, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, had made a party of pleasure with a young fellow from Gascony, whom I had introduced to them the same morning. The party was to take place at St. Germain, I believe, and they had appointed to meet at the Carmes-Deschaux, when they were disturbed by de Jussac, Cahusac, Bicarat, and two other Guardsmen, who certainly did not go there in such a numerous company without some ill intention against the edicts.\u201d \u201cAh, ah!", " \u201cAthos! Porthos! Aramis!\u201d The two Musketeers with whom we have already made acquaintance, and who answered to the last of these three names, immediately quitted the group of which they had formed a part, and advanced toward the cabinet, the door of which closed after them as soon as they had entered. Their appearance, although it was not quite at ease, excited by its carelessness, at once full of dignity and submission, the admiration of d\u2019Artagnan, who beheld in these two men demigods, and in their leader an Olympian Jupiter, armed with all his thunders. When the two Musketeers had entered; when the door was closed behind them; when the buzzing murmur of the antechamber, to which the summons which had been made had doubtless furnished fresh food, had recommenced; when M. de Treville had three or four times paced in silence, and with a frowning brow, the whole length of his cabinet, passing each time before Porthos and Aramis, who were as upright and silent as if on parade--he stopped all at once full in front of them, and covering them from head to foot with an angry look, \u201cDo you know what the king said to me,\u201d cried he, \u201cand that no longer ago than yesterday evening--do you know, gentlemen?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d replied the two Musketeers, after a moment\u2019s silence, \u201cno, sir, we do not.\u201d \u201cBut I hope that you will do us the honor to tell us,\u201d added Aramis, in his politest tone and with his most graceful bow."], "What literary genre is associated with the return to normalcy that ends The Three Musketeers?": [" \u201cYou have told me the truth, my gentlemen,\u201d said he, addressing the Musketeers, \u201cand it will not be my fault if our encounter this evening be not advantageous to you. In the meantime, follow me.\u201d The cardinal alighted; the three Musketeers did likewise. The cardinal threw the bridle of his horse to his esquire; the three Musketeers fastened the horses to the shutters. The host stood at the door. For him, the cardinal was only an officer coming to visit a lady. \u201cHave you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can wait near a good fire?\u201d said the cardinal. The host opened the door of a large room, in which an old stove had just been replaced by a large and excellent chimney. \u201cI have this,\u201d said he. \u201cThat will do,\u201d replied the cardinal. \u201cEnter, gentlemen, and be kind enough to wait for me; I shall not be more than half an hour.\u201d And while the three Musketeers entered the ground floor room, the cardinal, without asking further information, ascended the staircase like a man who has no need of having his road pointed out to him.", " An instant afterward the three young men separated, agreeing to meet again at four o\u2019clock with Athos, and leaving Planchet to guard the house. Aramis returned home, and Athos and d\u2019Artagnan busied themselves about pledging the sapphire. As the Gascon had foreseen, they easily obtained three hundred pistoles on the ring. Still further, the Jew told them that if they would sell it to him, as it would make a magnificent pendant for earrings, he would give five hundred pistoles for it. Athos and d\u2019Artagnan, with the activity of two soldiers and the knowledge of two connoisseurs, hardly required three hours to purchase the entire equipment of the Musketeer. Besides, Athos was very easy, and a noble to his fingers\u2019 ends. When a thing suited him he paid the price demanded, without thinking to ask for any abatement. D\u2019Artagnan would have remonstrated at this; but Athos put his hand upon his shoulder, with a smile, and d\u2019Artagnan understood that it was all very well for such a little Gascon gentleman as himself to drive a bargain, but not for a man who had the bearing of a prince.", " \u201cA thousand pardons, gentlemen; but no doubt this man brings me the news I expected.\u201d And rising also, he went off at a quick pace. There remained Athos and d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cI believe these fellows have managed their business. What do you think, d\u2019Artagnan?\u201d said Athos. \u201cI know that Porthos was in a fair way,\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cand as to Aramis to tell you the truth, I have never been seriously uneasy on his account. But you, my dear Athos--you, who so generously distributed the Englishman\u2019s pistoles, which were our legitimate property--what do you mean to do?\u201d \u201cI am satisfied with having killed that fellow, my boy, seeing that it is blessed bread to kill an Englishman; but if I had pocketed his pistoles, they would have weighed me down like a remorse.\u201d \u201cGo to, my dear Athos; you have truly inconceivable ideas.\u201d \u201cLet it pass. What do you think of Monsieur de Treville telling me, when he did me the honor to call upon me yesterday, that you associated with the suspected English, whom the cardinal protects?\u201d \u201cThat is to say, I visit an Englishwoman--the one I named.\u201d \u201cOh, ay!", " \u201cMonseigneur,\u201d replied Porthos, \u201che has gone as a scout, on account of some words of our host, which made him believe the road was not safe.\u201d \u201cAnd you, what have you done, Monsieur Porthos?\u201d \u201cI have won five pistoles of Aramis.\u201d \u201cWell; now will you return with me?\u201d \u201cWe are at your Eminence\u2019s orders.\u201d \u201cTo horse, then, gentlemen; for it is getting late.\u201d The attendant was at the door, holding the cardinal\u2019s horse by the bridle. At a short distance a group of two men and three horses appeared in the shade. These were the two men who were to conduct Milady to Fort La Pointe, and superintend her embarkation. The attendant confirmed to the cardinal what the two Musketeers had already said with respect to Athos. The cardinal made an approving gesture, and retraced his route with the same precautions he had used incoming. Let us leave him to follow the road to the camp protected by his esquire and the two Musketeers, and return to Athos."], "To what underlying cause does Dumas often attribute large-scale historical events?": [" The officer leaned forward, looked at her in his turn, and appeared surprised to see that face, just before so beautiful, distorted with passion and almost hideous. The artful creature at once comprehended that she was injuring herself by allowing him thus to read her soul; she collected her features, and in a complaining voice said: \u201cIn the name of heaven, sir, tell me if it is to you, if it is to your government, if it is to an enemy I am to attribute the violence that is done me?\u201d \u201cNo violence will be offered to you, madame, and what happens to you is the result of a very simple measure which we are obliged to adopt with all who land in England.\u201d \u201cThen you don\u2019t know me, sir?\u201d \u201cIt is the first time I have had the honor of seeing you.\u201d \u201cAnd on your honor, you have no cause of hatred against me?\u201d \u201cNone, I swear to you.\u201d There was so much serenity, coolness, mildness even, in the voice of the young man, that Milady felt reassured.", " In short, it was you who have but now in this chamber, seated in this chair I now fill, made an engagement with Cardinal Richelieu to cause the Duke of Buckingham to be assassinated, in exchange for the promise he has made you to allow you to assassinate d\u2019Artagnan.\u201d Milady was livid. \u201cYou must be Satan!\u201d cried she. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d said Athos; \u201cBut at all events listen well to this. Assassinate the Duke of Buckingham, or cause him to be assassinated--I care very little about that! I don\u2019t know him. Besides, he is an Englishman. But do not touch with the tip of your finger a single hair of d\u2019Artagnan, who is a faithful friend whom I love and defend, or I swear to you by the head of my father the crime which you shall have endeavored to commit, or shall have committed, shall be the last.\u201d \u201cMonsieur d\u2019Artagnan has cruelly insulted me,\u201d said Milady, in a hollow tone; \u201cMonsieur d\u2019Artagnan shall die!\u201d \u201cIndeed!", " \u201cI saw her.\u201d \u201cAnd you know who she is?\u201d \u201cI believe I can guess, at least.\u201d \u201cListen!\u201d said Aramis. \u201cSince you appear to know so many things, can you tell me what is become of that woman?\u201d \u201cI presume that she has returned to Tours.\u201d \u201cTo Tours? Yes, that may be. You evidently know her. But why did she return to Tours without telling me anything?\u201d \u201cBecause she was in fear of being arrested.\u201d \u201cWhy has she not written to me, then?\u201d \u201cBecause she was afraid of compromising you.\u201d \u201cd\u2019Artagnan, you restore me to life!\u201d cried Aramis. \u201cI fancied myself despised, betrayed. I was so delighted to see her again! I could not have believed she would risk her liberty for me, and yet for what other cause could she have returned to Paris?\u201d \u201cFor the cause which today takes us to England.\u201d \u201cAnd what is this cause?\u201d demanded Aramis. \u201cOh, you\u2019ll know it someday, Aramis; but at present I must imitate the discretion of \u2018the doctor\u2019s niece.\u2019\u201d Aramis smiled, as he remembered the tale he had told his friends on a certain evening.", " \u201cThat is not probable.\u201d \u201cIt is possible,\u201d said Milady. \u201cIf he persists--\u201d His Eminence made a pause, and resumed: \u201cIf he persists--well, then I shall hope for one of those events which change the destinies of states.\u201d \u201cIf your Eminence would quote to me some one of these events in history,\u201d said Milady, \u201cperhaps I should partake of your confidence as to the future.\u201d \u201cWell, here, for example,\u201d said Richelieu: \u201cwhen, in 1610, for a cause similar to that which moves the duke, King Henry IV, of glorious memory, was about, at the same time, to invade Flanders and Italy, in order to attack Austria on both sides. Well, did there not happen an event which saved Austria? Why should not the king of France have the same chance as the emperor?\u201d \u201cYour Eminence means, I presume, the knife stab in the Rue de la Feronnerie?\u201d \u201cPrecisely,\u201d said the cardinal. \u201cDoes not your Eminence fear that the punishment inflicted upon Ravaillac may deter anyone who might entertain the idea of imitating him?\u201d \u201cThere will be, in all times and in all countries, particularly if religious divisions exist in those countries, fanatics who ask nothing better than to become martyrs."], "How many Three Musketeers sequels did Dumas write?": [" *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE THREE MUSKETEERS, BY ALEXANDRE DUMAS, PERE *** Produced by John P.

I will write to him, then, nearly in these terms.\u201d \u201cLet us see,\u201d said Athos, assuming in advance a critical look. \u201cMonsieur and dear friend--\u201d \u201cAh, yes!

Yes, Athos, I know what you mean: we shall do very well at the Parpaillot.\u201d \u201cLet us go to the Parpaillot, then, for here the walls are like sheets of paper.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan, who was accustomed to his friend\u2019s manner of acting, and who perceived immediately, by a word, a gesture, or a sign from him, that the circumstances were serious, took Athos\u2019s arm, and went out without saying anything. Porthos followed, chatting with Aramis. On their way they met Grimaud. Athos made him a sign to come with them.", " \u201cOh, the women, the women!\u201d cried the old soldier. \u201cI know them by their romantic imagination. Everything that savors of mystery charms them. So you have seen the arm, that was all.

However much of a Jew he may be, he will give you at least eight hundred pistoles. Pistoles have no name, young man, and that ring has a terrible one, which may betray him who wears it.\u201d \u201cSell this ring, a ring which comes from my sovereign? Never!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cThen, at least turn the gem inside, you silly fellow; for everybody must be aware that a cadet from Gascony does not find such stones in his mother\u2019s jewel case.\u201d \u201cYou think, then, I have something to dread?\u201d asked d\u2019Artagnan.", " As to the commencement of an intrigue between her and M. de Wardes, our presumptuous hero gave but little heed to that, although the marquis was young, handsome, rich, and high in the cardinal\u2019s favor. It is not for nothing we are but twenty years old, above all if we were born at Tarbes. D\u2019Artagnan began by making his most splendid toilet, then returned to Athos\u2019s, and according to custom, related everything to him. Athos listened to his projects, then shook his head, and recommended prudence to him with a shade of bitterness. \u201cWhat!\u201d said he, \u201cyou have just lost one woman, whom you call good, charming, perfect; and here you are, running headlong after another.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan felt the truth of this reproach. \u201cI loved Madame Bonacieux with my heart, while I only love Milady with my head,\u201d said he. \u201cIn getting introduced to her, my principal object is to ascertain what part she plays at court.\u201d \u201cThe part she plays, PARDIEU!", " This was all that M. de Treville wanted. He wished Bernajoux a speedy convalescence, took leave of M. de la Tremouille, returned to his hotel, and immediately sent word to the four friends that he awaited their company at dinner. M de Treville entertained good company, wholly anticardinalist, though. It may easily be understood, therefore, that the conversation during the whole of dinner turned upon the two checks that his Eminence\u2019s Guardsmen had received. Now, as d\u2019Artagnan had been the hero of these two fights, it was upon him that all the felicitations fell, which Athos, Porthos, and Aramis abandoned to him, not only as good comrades, but as men who had so often had their turn that they could very well afford him his. Toward six o\u2019clock M. de Treville announced that it was time to go to the Louvre; but as the hour of audience granted by his Majesty was past, instead of claiming the ENTREE by the back stairs, he placed himself with the four young men in the antechamber."], "Which of the Three Musketeers is distinguished in every way, yet tortured by a deep melancholy?": [" \u201cThree hundred pistoles.\u201d \u201cOh, plenty! That would carry you to the end of the world. Begone, then!\u201d D\u2019Artagnan saluted M. de Treville, who held out his hand to him; d\u2019Artagnan pressed it with a respect mixed with gratitude. Since his first arrival at Paris, he had had constant occasion to honor this excellent man, whom he had always found worthy, loyal, and great. His first visit was to Aramis, at whose residence he had not been since the famous evening on which he had followed Mme. Bonacieux. Still further, he had seldom seen the young Musketeer; but every time he had seen him, he had remarked a deep sadness imprinted on his countenance. This evening, especially, Aramis was melancholy and thoughtful. D\u2019Artagnan asked some questions about this prolonged melancholy. Aramis pleaded as his excuse a commentary upon the eighteenth chapter of St. Augustine, which he was forced to write in Latin for the following week, and which preoccupied him a good deal.", " 44 THE UTILITY OF STOVEPIPES It was evident that without suspecting it, and actuated solely by their chivalrous and adventurous character, our three friends had just rendered a service to someone the cardinal honored with his special protection. Now, who was that someone? That was the question the three Musketeers put to one another. Then, seeing that none of their replies could throw any light on the subject, Porthos called the host and asked for dice. Porthos and Aramis placed themselves at the table and began to play. Athos walked about in a contemplative mood. While thinking and walking, Athos passed and repassed before the pipe of the stove, broken in halves, the other extremity passing into the chamber above; and every time he passed and repassed he heard a murmur of words, which at length fixed his attention. Athos went close to it, and distinguished some words that appeared to merit so great an interest that he made a sign to his friends to be silent, remaining himself bent with his ear directed to the opening of the lower orifice.", " Athos bowed. \u201cAnd now, gentlemen, that\u2019s well,\u201d continued the cardinal. \u201cI know what I wish to know; follow me.\u201d The three Musketeers passed behind his Eminence, who again enveloped his face in his cloak, and put his horse in motion, keeping from eight to ten paces in advance of his four companions. They soon arrived at the silent, solitary inn. No doubt the host knew what illustrious visitor was expected, and had consequently sent intruders out of the way. Ten paces from the door the cardinal made a sign to his esquire and the three Musketeers to halt. A saddled horse was fastened to the window shutter. The cardinal knocked three times, and in a peculiar manner. A man, enveloped in a cloak, came out immediately, and exchanged some rapid words with the cardinal; after which he mounted his horse, and set off in the direction of Surgeres, which was likewise the way to Paris. \u201cAdvance, gentlemen,\u201d said the cardinal.", " \u201cYou have told me the truth, my gentlemen,\u201d said he, addressing the Musketeers, \u201cand it will not be my fault if our encounter this evening be not advantageous to you. In the meantime, follow me.\u201d The cardinal alighted; the three Musketeers did likewise. The cardinal threw the bridle of his horse to his esquire; the three Musketeers fastened the horses to the shutters. The host stood at the door. For him, the cardinal was only an officer coming to visit a lady. \u201cHave you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can wait near a good fire?\u201d said the cardinal. The host opened the door of a large room, in which an old stove had just been replaced by a large and excellent chimney. \u201cI have this,\u201d said he. \u201cThat will do,\u201d replied the cardinal. \u201cEnter, gentlemen, and be kind enough to wait for me; I shall not be more than half an hour.\u201d And while the three Musketeers entered the ground floor room, the cardinal, without asking further information, ascended the staircase like a man who has no need of having his road pointed out to him."], "What does Aramis claim is his true calling?": [" At length they reached the tent, lit a lamp, and while Planchet stood at the entrance that the four friends might not be surprised, d\u2019Artagnan, with a trembling hand, broke the seal and opened the so anxiously expected letter. It contained half a line, in a hand perfectly British, and with a conciseness as perfectly Spartan: Thank you; be easy. d\u2019Artagnan translated this for the others. Athos took the letter from the hands of d\u2019Artagnan, approached the lamp, set fire to the paper, and did not let go till it was reduced to a cinder. Then, calling Planchet, he said, \u201cNow, my lad, you may claim your seven hundred livres, but you did not run much risk with such a note as that.\u201d \u201cI am not to blame for having tried every means to compress it,\u201d said Planchet. \u201cWell!\u201d cried d\u2019Artagnan, \u201ctell us all about it.\u201d \u201cDame, that\u2019s a long job, monsieur.\u201d \u201cYou are right, Planchet,\u201d said Athos; \u201cbesides, the tattoo has been sounded, and we should be observed if we kept a light burning much longer than the others.\u201d \u201cSo be it,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan.", " Ah, cursed Gascon that I am, I get from one hobble into another. Friend d\u2019Artagnan,\u201d continued he, speaking to himself with all the amenity that he thought due himself, \u201cif you escape, of which there is not much chance, I would advise you to practice perfect politeness for the future. You must henceforth be admired and quoted as a model of it. To be obliging and polite does not necessarily make a man a coward. Look at Aramis, now; Aramis is mildness and grace personified. Well, did anybody ever dream of calling Aramis a coward? No, certainly not, and from this moment I will endeavor to model myself after him. Ah! That\u2019s strange! Here he is!\u201d D\u2019Artagnan, walking and soliloquizing, had arrived within a few steps of the hotel d\u2019Arguillon and in front of that hotel perceived Aramis, chatting gaily with three gentlemen; but as he had not forgotten that it was in presence of this young man that M. de Treville had been so angry in the morning, and as a witness of the rebuke the Musketeers had received was not likely to be at all agreeable, he pretended not to see him.", " \u201cNo,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cno, I confess it. It was chance that threw me in your way; I saw a woman knocking at the window of one of my friends.\u201d \u201cOne of your friends?\u201d interrupted Mme. Bonacieux. \u201cWithout doubt; Aramis is one of my best friends.\u201d \u201cAramis! Who is he?\u201d \u201cCome, come, you won\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t know Aramis?\u201d \u201cThis is the first time I ever heard his name pronounced.\u201d \u201cIt is the first time, then, that you ever went to that house?\u201d \u201cUndoubtedly.\u201d \u201cAnd you did not know that it was inhabited by a young man?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cBy a Musketeer?\u201d \u201cNo, indeed!\u201d \u201cIt was not he, then, you came to seek?\u201d \u201cNot the least in the world. Besides, you must have seen that the person to whom I spoke was a woman.\u201d \u201cThat is true; but this woman is a friend of Aramis--\u201d \u201cI know nothing of that.\u201d \u201c--since she lodges with him.\u201d \u201cThat does not concern me.\u201d \u201cBut who is she?\u201d \u201cOh, that is not my secret.\u201d \u201cMy dear Madame Bonacieux, you are charming; but at the same time you are one of the most mysterious women.\u201d \u201cDo I lose by that?\u201d \u201cNo; you are, on the contrary, adorable.\u201d \u201cGive me your arm, then.\u201d \u201cMost willingly.", " Thus Louis XIII had a real liking for Treville--a royal liking, a self-interested liking, it is true, but still a liking. At that unhappy period it was an important consideration to be surrounded by such men as Treville. Many might take for their device the epithet STRONG, which formed the second part of his motto, but very few gentlemen could lay claim to the FAITHFUL, which constituted the first. Treville was one of these latter. His was one of those rare organizations, endowed with an obedient intelligence like that of the dog; with a blind valor, a quick eye, and a prompt hand; to whom sight appeared only to be given to see if the king were dissatisfied with anyone, and the hand to strike this displeasing personage, whether a Besme, a Maurevers, a Poltiot de Mere, or a Vitry. In short, up to this period nothing had been wanting to Treville but opportunity; but he was ever on the watch for it, and he faithfully promised himself that he would not fail to seize it by its three hairs whenever it came within reach of his hand."], "Which of the following traits is not characteristic of Porthos?": [" What have I done, then? Let me know what crime I have committed. It is impossible that your Majesty can make all this ado about a letter written to my brother.\u201d The king, attacked in a manner so direct, did not know what to answer; and he thought that this was the moment for expressing the desire which he was not going to have made until the evening before the fete. \u201cMadame,\u201d said he, with dignity, \u201cthere will shortly be a ball at the Hotel de Ville. I wish, in order to honor our worthy aldermen, you should appear in ceremonial costume, and above all, ornamented with the diamond studs which I gave you on your birthday. That is my answer.\u201d The answer was terrible. Anne of Austria believed that Louis XIII knew all, and that the cardinal had persuaded him to employ this long dissimulation of seven or eight days, which, likewise, was characteristic. She became excessively pale, leaned her beautiful hand upon a CONSOLE, which hand appeared then like one of wax, and looking at the king with terror in her eyes, she was unable to reply by a single syllable.", " They wandered about the streets, looking at the pavement as if to see whether the passengers had not left a purse behind them. They might have been supposed to be following tracks, so observant were they wherever they went. When they met they looked desolately at one another, as much as to say, \u201cHave you found anything?\u201d However, as Porthos had first found an idea, and had thought of it earnestly afterward, he was the first to act. He was a man of execution, this worthy Porthos. D\u2019Artagnan perceived him one day walking toward the church of St. Leu, and followed him instinctively. He entered, after having twisted his mustache and elongated his imperial, which always announced on his part the most triumphant resolutions. As d\u2019Artagnan took some precautions to conceal himself, Porthos believed he had not been seen. D\u2019Artagnan entered behind him. Porthos went and leaned against the side of a pillar.", " When the lady of the red cushion came close to Porthos, Porthos drew his dripping hand from the font. The fair worshipper touched the great hand of Porthos with her delicate fingers, smiled, made the sign of the cross, and left the church. This was too much for the procurator\u2019s wife; she doubted not there was an intrigue between this lady and Porthos. If she had been a great lady she would have fainted; but as she was only a procurator\u2019s wife, she contented herself saying to the Musketeer with concentrated fury, \u201cEh, Monsieur Porthos, you don\u2019t offer me any holy water?\u201d Porthos, at the sound of that voice, started like a man awakened from a sleep of a hundred years. \u201cMa-madame!\u201d cried he; \u201cis that you? How is your husband, our dear Monsieur Coquenard? Is he still as stingy as ever? Where can my eyes have been not to have seen you during the two hours of the sermon?\u201d \u201cI was within two paces of you, monsieur,\u201d replied the procurator\u2019s wife; \u201cbut you did not perceive me because you had no eyes but for the pretty lady to whom you just now gave the holy water.\u201d Porthos pretended to be confused.", " \u201cYes, horse. Are we not eating a horse, Porthos? And perhaps his saddle, therewith.\u201d \u201cNo, gentlemen, I have kept the harness,\u201d said Porthos. \u201cMy faith,\u201d said Aramis, \u201cwe are all alike. One would think we had tipped the wink.\u201d \u201cWhat could I do?\u201d said Porthos. \u201cThis horse made my visitors ashamed of theirs, and I don\u2019t like to humiliate people.\u201d \u201cThen your duchess is still at the waters?\u201d asked d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cStill,\u201d replied Porthos. \u201cAnd, my faith, the governor of the province--one of the gentlemen I expected today--seemed to have such a wish for him, that I gave him to him.\u201d \u201cGave him?\u201d cried d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cMy God, yes, GAVE, that is the word,\u201d said Porthos; \u201cfor the animal was worth at least a hundred and fifty louis, and the stingy fellow would only give me eighty.\u201d \u201cWithout the saddle?\u201d said Aramis. \u201cYes, without the saddle.\u201d \u201cYou will observe, gentlemen,\u201d said Athos, \u201cthat Porthos has made the best bargain of any of us.\u201d And then commenced a roar of laughter in which they all joined, to the astonishment of poor Porthos; but when he was informed of the cause of their hilarity, he shared it vociferously according to his custom."], "Who is the most powerful and important person in France?": [" The chancellor himself would be puzzled how to write such a letter, and yet the chancellor draws up an official report very readily. Never mind! Be silent, I will write.\u201d Aramis accordingly took the quill, reflected for a few moments, wrote eight or ten lines in a charming little female hand, and then with a voice soft and slow, as if each word had been scrupulously weighed, he read the following: \u201cMy Lord, The person who writes these few lines had the honor of crossing swords with you in the little enclosure of the Rue d\u2019Enfer. As you have several times since declared yourself the friend of that person, he thinks it his duty to respond to that friendship by sending you important information. Twice you have nearly been the victim of a near relative, whom you believe to be your heir because you are ignorant that before she contracted a marriage in England she was already married in France.", " The king and the cardinal are the best of friends; their apparent bickerings are only feints to deceive fools. I am not willing that a compatriot, a handsome cavalier, a brave youth, quite fit to make his way, should become the dupe of all these artifices and fall into the snare after the example of so many others who have been ruined by it. Be assured that I am devoted to both these all-powerful masters, and that my earnest endeavors have no other aim than the service of the king, and also the cardinal--one of the most illustrious geniuses that France has ever produced. \u201cNow, young man, regulate your conduct accordingly; and if you entertain, whether from your family, your relations, or even from your instincts, any of these enmities which we see constantly breaking out against the cardinal, bid me adieu and let us separate. I will aid you in many ways, but without attaching you to my person.", " \u201cYes, and important. Take it quickly.\u201d Thereupon she ran toward the carriage, which had turned round toward the way it came, jumped upon the step, and the carriage drove off. Planchet turned and returned the billet. Then, accustomed to passive obedience, he jumped down from the terrace, ran toward the lane, and at the end of twenty paces met d\u2019Artagnan, who, having seen all, was coming to him. \u201cFor you, monsieur,\u201d said Planchet, presenting the billet to the young man. \u201cFor me?\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan; \u201care you sure of that?\u201d \u201cPARDIEU, monsieur, I can\u2019t be more sure. The SOUBRETTE said, \u2018For your master.\u2019 I have no other master but you; so--a pretty little lass, my faith, is that SOUBRETTE!\u201d D\u2019Artagnan opened the letter, and read these words: \u201cA person who takes more interest in you than she is willing to confess wishes to know on what day it will suit you to walk in the forest? Tomorrow, at the Hotel Field of the Cloth of Gold, a lackey in black and red will wait for your reply.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cthis is rather warm; it appears that Milady and I are anxious about the health of the same person.", " I received orders to go and take charge of you on the sea, and to conduct you to this castle. This order I believe I have accomplished with all the exactness of a soldier, but also with the courtesy of a gentleman. There terminates, at least to the present moment, the duty I had to fulfill toward you; the rest concerns another person.\u201d \u201cAnd who is that other person?\u201d asked Milady, warmly. \u201cCan you not tell me his name?\u201d At the moment a great jingling of spurs was heard on the stairs. Some voices passed and faded away, and the sound of a single footstep approached the door. \u201cThat person is here, madame,\u201d said the officer, leaving the entrance open, and drawing himself up in an attitude of respect. At the same time the door opened; a man appeared on the threshold. He was without a hat, carried a sword, and flourished a handkerchief in his hand. Milady thought she recognized this shadow in the gloom; she supported herself with one hand upon the arm of the chair, and advanced her head as if to meet a certainty."], "As the novel opens, where is the young D\u2019Artagnan about to go make his fortune?": [" Well, now, that would be a real fortune to us, my friend; let us go back to the Jew\u2019s again.\u201d \u201cWhat! will you--\u201d \u201cThis ring would certainly only recall very bitter remembrances; then we shall never be masters of three hundred pistoles to redeem it, so that we really should lose two hundred pistoles by the bargain.

Go, d\u2019Artagnan, go; Grimaud will accompany you with his musketoon.\u201d A half hour afterward, d\u2019Artagnan returned with the two thousand livres, and without having met with any accident. It was thus Athos found at home resources which he did not expect. 39 A VISION At four o\u2019clock the four friends were all assembled with Athos. Their anxiety about their outfits had all disappeared, and each countenance only preserved the expression of its own secret disquiet--for behind all present happiness is concealed a fear for the future.", " \u201cThat you will go and fetch me the letter your comrade has in his pocket.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d cried the bandit, \u201cthat is only another way of killing me.

In the name of that young lady you love, and whom you perhaps believe dead but who is not!\u201d cried the bandit, throwing himself upon his knees and leaning upon his hand--for he began to lose his strength with his blood. \u201cAnd how do you know there is a young woman whom I love, and that I believed that woman dead?\u201d asked d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cBy that letter which my comrade has in his pocket.\u201d \u201cYou see, then,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cthat I must have that letter.

The men of my crew, who are devoted to me for life and death, mount guard around this apartment, and watch all the passages that lead to the courtyard. Even if you gained the yard, there would still be three iron gates for you to pass. The order is positive. A step, a gesture, a word, on your part, denoting an effort to escape, and you are to be fired upon. If they kill you, English justice will be under an obligation to me for having saved it trouble. Ah! I see your features regain their calmness, your countenance recovers its assurance. You are saying to yourself: \u2018Fifteen days, twenty days? Bah! I have an inventive mind; before that is expired some idea will occur to me. I have an infernal spirit. I shall meet with a victim. Before fifteen days are gone by I shall be away from here.\u2019 Ah, try it!\u201d Milady, finding her thoughts betrayed, dug her nails into her flesh to subdue every emotion that might give to her face any expression except agony.", " So let us go and get killed where we are told to go. Is life worth the trouble of so many questions? D\u2019Artagnan, I am ready to follow you.\u201d \u201cAnd I also,\u201d said Porthos. \u201cAnd I also,\u201d said Aramis. \u201cAnd, indeed, I am not sorry to quit Paris; I had need of distraction.\u201d \u201cWell, you will have distractions enough, gentlemen, be assured,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cAnd, now, when are we to go?\u201d asked Athos. \u201cImmediately,\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cwe have not a minute to lose.\u201d \u201cHello, Grimaud!

Planchet, Grimaud, Mousqueton, and Bazin set off at full speed. \u201cNow let us lay down the plan of campaign,\u201d said Porthos. \u201cWhere do we go first?\u201d \u201cTo Calais,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cthat is the most direct line to London.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Porthos, \u201cthis is my advice--\u201d \u201cSpeak!\u201d \u201cFour men traveling together would be suspected."], "What does the gentleman in Meung steal from D\u2019Artagnan after having him beaten up?": [" \u201cPah! Where are you going?\u201d cried the two Musketeers in a breath. \u201cThe man of Meung!\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan, and disappeared. D\u2019Artagnan had more than once related to his friends his adventure with the stranger, as well as the apparition of the beautiful foreigner, to whom this man had confided some important missive. The opinion of Athos was that d\u2019Artagnan had lost his letter in the skirmish. A gentleman, in his opinion--and according to d\u2019Artagnan\u2019s portrait of him, the stranger must be a gentleman--would be incapable of the baseness of stealing a letter. Porthos saw nothing in all this but a love meeting, given by a lady to a cavalier, or by a cavalier to a lady, which had been disturbed by the presence of d\u2019Artagnan and his yellow horse. Aramis said that as these sorts of affairs were mysterious, it was better not to fathom them. They understood, then, from the few words which escaped from d\u2019Artagnan, what affair was in hand, and as they thought that overtaking his man, or losing sight of him, d\u2019Artagnan would return to his rooms, they kept on their way.", " D\u2019Artagnan, then, remained majestic and intact in his susceptibility, till he came to this unlucky city of Meung. But there, as he was alighting from his horse at the gate of the Jolly Miller, without anyone--host, waiter, or hostler--coming to hold his stirrup or take his horse, d\u2019Artagnan spied, though an open window on the ground floor, a gentleman, well-made and of good carriage, although of rather a stern countenance, talking with two persons who appeared to listen to him with respect. D\u2019Artagnan fancied quite naturally, according to his custom, that he must be the object of their conversation, and listened. This time d\u2019Artagnan was only in part mistaken; he himself was not in question, but his horse was. The gentleman appeared to be enumerating all his qualities to his auditors; and, as I have said, the auditors seeming to have great deference for the narrator, they every moment burst into fits of laughter.", " They made all speed to come up to this gentleman, who appeared to be in great haste. His boots were covered with dust, and he inquired if he could not instantly cross over to England. \u201cNothing would be more easy,\u201d said the captain of a vessel ready to set sail, \u201cbut this morning came an order to let no one leave without express permission from the cardinal.\u201d \u201cI have that permission,\u201d said the gentleman, drawing the paper from his pocket; \u201chere it is.\u201d \u201cHave it examined by the governor of the port,\u201d said the shipmaster, \u201cand give me the preference.\u201d \u201cWhere shall I find the governor?\u201d \u201cAt his country house.\u201d \u201cAnd that is situated?\u201d \u201cAt a quarter of a league from the city. Look, you may see it from here--at the foot of that little hill, that slated roof.\u201d \u201cVery well,\u201d said the gentleman. And, with his lackey, he took the road to the governor\u2019s country house. D\u2019Artagnan and Planchet followed the gentleman at a distance of five hundred paces.", " It was evident that the cardinal was weighing beforehand the terms in which he was about to speak, and that Milady was collecting all her intellectual faculties to comprehend the things he was about to say, and to engrave them in her memory when they should be spoken. Athos took advantage of this moment to tell his two companions to fasten the door inside, and to make them a sign to come and listen with him. The two Musketeers, who loved their ease, brought a chair for each of themselves and one for Athos. All three then sat down with their heads together and their ears on the alert. \u201cYou will go to London,\u201d continued the cardinal. \u201cArrived in London, you will seek Buckingham.\u201d \u201cI must beg your Eminence to observe,\u201d said Milady, \u201cthat since the affair of the diamond studs, about which the duke always suspected me, his Grace distrusts me.\u201d \u201cWell, this time,\u201d said the cardinal, \u201cit is not necessary to steal his confidence, but to present yourself frankly and loyally as a negotiator.\u201d \u201cFrankly and loyally,\u201d repeated Milady, with an unspeakable expression of duplicity."], "Who does D\u2019Artagnan first visit upon reaching Paris?": [" She found M. Bonacieux alone; the poor man was recovering with difficulty the order in his house, in which he had found most of the furniture broken and the closets nearly emptied--justice not being one of the three things which King Solomon names as leaving no traces of their passage. As to the servant, she had run away at the moment of her master\u2019s arrest. Terror had had such an effect upon the poor girl that she had never ceased walking from Paris till she reached Burgundy, her native place. The worthy mercer had, immediately upon re-entering his house, informed his wife of his happy return, and his wife had replied by congratulating him, and telling him that the first moment she could steal from her duties should be devoted to paying him a visit. This first moment had been delayed five days, which, under any other circumstances, might have appeared rather long to M. Bonacieux; but he had, in the visit he had made to the cardinal and in the visits Rochefort had made him, ample subjects for reflection, and as everybody knows, nothing makes time pass more quickly than reflection.", " \u201cThree hundred pistoles.\u201d \u201cOh, plenty! That would carry you to the end of the world. Begone, then!\u201d D\u2019Artagnan saluted M. de Treville, who held out his hand to him; d\u2019Artagnan pressed it with a respect mixed with gratitude. Since his first arrival at Paris, he had had constant occasion to honor this excellent man, whom he had always found worthy, loyal, and great. His first visit was to Aramis, at whose residence he had not been since the famous evening on which he had followed Mme. Bonacieux. Still further, he had seldom seen the young Musketeer; but every time he had seen him, he had remarked a deep sadness imprinted on his countenance. This evening, especially, Aramis was melancholy and thoughtful. D\u2019Artagnan asked some questions about this prolonged melancholy. Aramis pleaded as his excuse a commentary upon the eighteenth chapter of St. Augustine, which he was forced to write in Latin for the following week, and which preoccupied him a good deal.", " I know, because it is my office to know everything. On your return you were received by an august personage, and I perceive with pleasure that you preserve the souvenir she gave you.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan placed his hand upon the queen\u2019s diamond, which he wore, and quickly turned the stone inward; but it was too late. \u201cThe day after that, you received a visit from Cavois,\u201d resumed the cardinal. \u201cHe went to desire you to come to the palace. You have not returned that visit, and you were wrong.\u201d \u201cMonseigneur, I feared I had incurred disgrace with your Eminence.\u201d \u201cHow could that be, monsieur? Could you incur my displeasure by having followed the orders of your superiors with more intelligence and courage than another would have done? It is the people who do not obey that I punish, and not those who, like you, obey--but too well. As a proof, remember the date of the day on which I had you bidden to come to me, and seek in your memory for what happened to you that very night.\u201d That was the very evening when the abduction of Mme.", " \u201cStop, stop!\u201d cried he, regaining strength by force of terror. \u201cI will go--I will go!\u201d D\u2019Artagnan took the soldier\u2019s arquebus, made him go on before him, and urged him toward his companion by pricking him behind with his sword. It was a frightful thing to see this wretch, leaving a long track of blood on the ground he passed over, pale with approaching death, trying to drag himself along without being seen to the body of his accomplice, which lay twenty paces from him. Terror was so strongly painted on his face, covered with a cold sweat, that d\u2019Artagnan took pity on him, and casting upon him a look of contempt, \u201cStop,\u201d said he, \u201cI will show you the difference between a man of courage and such a coward as you. Stay where you are; I will go myself.\u201d And with a light step, an eye on the watch, observing the movements of the enemy and taking advantage of the accidents of the ground, d\u2019Artagnan succeeded in reaching the second soldier."], "How does de Treville initially treat Aramis and Porthos for their unsuccessful skirmish with the Cardinal\u2019s guards?": [" \u201cBah! you will get me out if they put me there,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cTo be sure we will,\u201d replied Aramis and Porthos, with admirable promptness and decision, as if that were the simplest thing in the world, \u201cto be sure we will get you out; but meantime, as we are to set off the day after tomorrow, you would do much better not to risk this Bastille.\u201d \u201cLet us do better than that,\u201d said Athos; \u201cdo not let us leave him during the whole evening. Let each of us wait at a gate of the palace with three Musketeers behind him; if we see a close carriage, at all suspicious in appearance, come out, let us fall upon it. It is a long time since we have had a skirmish with the Guards of Monsieur the Cardinal; Monsieur de Treville must think us dead.\u201d \u201cTo a certainty, Athos,\u201d said Aramis, \u201cyou were meant to be a general of the army! What do you think of the plan, gentlemen?\u201d \u201cAdmirable!\u201d replied the young men in chorus.", " Immediately M. de Treville opened and pointed the way to Porthos and Aramis, who bore their comrade in their arms. Behind this group walked the surgeon; and behind the surgeon the door closed. The cabinet of M. de Treville, generally held so sacred, became in an instant the annex of the antechamber. Everyone spoke, harangued, and vociferated, swearing, cursing, and consigning the cardinal and his Guards to all the devils. An instant after, Porthos and Aramis re-entered, the surgeon and M. de Treville alone remaining with the wounded. At length, M. de Treville himself returned. The injured man had recovered his senses. The surgeon declared that the situation of the Musketeer had nothing in it to render his friends uneasy, his weakness having been purely and simply caused by loss of blood. Then M. de Treville made a sign with his hand, and all retired except d\u2019Artagnan, who did not forget that he had an audience, and with the tenacity of a Gascon remained in his place.", " The heart of d\u2019Artagnan swam in delirium; he marched between Athos and Porthos, pressing them tenderly. \u201cIf I am not yet a Musketeer,\u201d said he to his new friends, as he passed through the gateway of M. de Treville\u2019s hotel, \u201cat least I have entered upon my apprenticeship, haven\u2019t I?\u201d 6 HIS MAJESTY KING LOUIS XIII This affair made a great noise. M. de Treville scolded his Musketeers in public, and congratulated them in private; but as no time was to be lost in gaining the king, M. de Treville hastened to report himself at the Louvre. It was already too late. The king was closeted with the cardinal, and M. de Treville was informed that the king was busy and could not receive him at that moment. In the evening M. de Treville attended the king\u2019s gaming table. The king was winning; and as he was very avaricious, he was in an excellent humor. Perceiving M. de Treville at a distance-- \u201cCome here, Monsieur Captain,\u201d said he, \u201ccome here, that I may growl at you.", " A PROPOS, monseigneur,\u201d continued Treville, addressing the cardinal, \u201cMonsieur de Cahusac is quite recovered, is he not?\u201d \u201cThank you,\u201d said the cardinal, biting his lips with anger. \u201cAthos, then, went to pay a visit to one of his friends absent at the time,\u201d continued Treville, \u201cto a young Bearnais, a cadet in his Majesty\u2019s Guards, the company of Monsieur Dessessart, but scarcely had he arrived at his friend\u2019s and taken up a book, while waiting his return, when a mixed crowd of bailiffs and soldiers came and laid siege to the house, broke open several doors--\u201d The cardinal made the king a sign, which signified, \u201cThat was on account of the affair about which I spoke to you.\u201d \u201cWe all know that,\u201d interrupted the king; \u201cfor all that was done for our service.\u201d \u201cThen,\u201d said Treville, \u201cit was also for your Majesty\u2019s service that one of my Musketeers, who was innocent, has been seized, that he has been placed between two guards like a malefactor, and that this gallant man, who has ten times shed his blood in your Majesty\u2019s service and is ready to shed it again, has been paraded through the midst of an insolent populace?\u201d \u201cBah!\u201d said the king, who began to be shaken, \u201cwas it so managed?\u201d \u201cMonsieur de Treville,\u201d said the cardinal, with the greatest phlegm, \u201cdoes not tell your Majesty that this innocent Musketeer, this gallant man, had only an hour before attacked, sword in hand, four commissaries of inquiry, who were delegated by myself to examine into an affair of the highest importance.\u201d \u201cI defy your Eminence to prove it,\u201d cried Treville, with his Gascon freedom and military frankness; \u201cfor one hour before, Monsieur Athos, who, I will confide it to your Majesty, is really a man of the highest quality, did me the honor after having dined with me to be conversing in the saloon of my hotel, with the Duc de la Tremouille and the Comte de Chalus, who happened to be there.\u201d The king looked at the cardinal."], "What does D\u2019Artagnan do when he spots the Man from Meung during his interview with de Treville?": [" In a court of justice that is called an alibi.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan found his advice prudent. He took to his heels, and was soon at M. de Treville\u2019s; but instead of going into the saloon with the rest of the crowd, he asked to be introduced to M. de Treville\u2019s office. As d\u2019Artagnan so constantly frequented the hotel, no difficulty was made in complying with his request, and a servant went to inform M. de Treville that his young compatriot, having something important to communicate, solicited a private audience. Five minutes after, M. de Treville was asking d\u2019Artagnan what he could do to serve him, and what caused his visit at so late an hour. \u201cPardon me, monsieur,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, who had profited by the moment he had been left alone to put back M. de Treville\u2019s clock three-quarters of an hour, \u201cbut I thought, as it was yet only twenty-five minutes past nine, it was not too late to wait upon you.\u201d \u201cTwenty-five minutes past nine!\u201d cried M. de Treville, looking at the clock; \u201cwhy, that\u2019s impossible!\u201d \u201cLook, rather, monsieur,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cthe clock shows it.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d said M. de Treville; \u201cI believed it later.", " M de Treville was in his saloon with his habitual court of gentlemen. D\u2019Artagnan, who was known as a familiar of the house, went straight to his office, and sent word that he wished to see him on something of importance. D\u2019Artagnan had been there scarcely five minutes when M. de Treville entered. At the first glance, and by the joy which was painted on his countenance, the worthy captain plainly perceived that something new was on foot. All the way along d\u2019Artagnan had been consulting with himself whether he should place confidence in M. de Treville, or whether he should only ask him to give him CARTE BLANCHE for some secret affair. But M. de Treville had always been so thoroughly his friend, had always been so devoted to the king and queen, and hated the cardinal so cordially, that the young man resolved to tell him everything. \u201cDid you ask for me, my good friend?\u201d said M. de Treville. \u201cYes, monsieur,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, lowering his voice, \u201cand you will pardon me, I hope, for having disturbed you when you know the importance of my business.\u201d \u201cSpeak, then, I am all attention.\u201d \u201cIt concerns nothing less,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cthan the honor, perhaps the life of the queen.\u201d \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d asked M. de Treville, glancing round to see if they were surely alone, and then fixing his questioning look upon d\u2019Artagnan.", " The heart of d\u2019Artagnan swam in delirium; he marched between Athos and Porthos, pressing them tenderly. \u201cIf I am not yet a Musketeer,\u201d said he to his new friends, as he passed through the gateway of M. de Treville\u2019s hotel, \u201cat least I have entered upon my apprenticeship, haven\u2019t I?\u201d 6 HIS MAJESTY KING LOUIS XIII This affair made a great noise.

A name like yours must be as a buckler to me on my way.

Ah, here is one of them, I believe.\u201d In fact, at the end of the Rue Vaugirard the gigantic Porthos appeared. \u201cWhat!\u201d cried d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cis your first witness Monsieur Porthos?\u201d \u201cYes, that disturbs you?\u201d \u201cBy no means.\u201d \u201cAnd here is the second.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan turned in the direction pointed to by Athos, and perceived Aramis."], "What outcome does D\u2019Artagnan anticipate after scheduling duels with all three Musketeers?": [" He began to reflect upon the events that had passed; they were numerous and inauspicious. It was scarcely eleven o\u2019clock in the morning, and yet this morning had already brought him into disgrace with M. de Treville, who could not fail to think the manner in which d\u2019Artagnan had left him a little cavalier. Besides this, he had drawn upon himself two good duels with two men, each capable of killing three d\u2019Artagnans--with two Musketeers, in short, with two of those beings whom he esteemed so greatly that he placed them in his mind and heart above all other men. The outlook was sad. Sure of being killed by Athos, it may easily be understood that the young man was not very uneasy about Porthos. As hope, however, is the last thing extinguished in the heart of man, he finished by hoping that he might survive, even though with terrible wounds, in both these duels; and in case of surviving, he made the following reprehensions upon his own conduct: \u201cWhat a madcap I was, and what a stupid fellow I am!", " \u201cYou have told me the truth, my gentlemen,\u201d said he, addressing the Musketeers, \u201cand it will not be my fault if our encounter this evening be not advantageous to you. In the meantime, follow me.\u201d The cardinal alighted; the three Musketeers did likewise. The cardinal threw the bridle of his horse to his esquire; the three Musketeers fastened the horses to the shutters. The host stood at the door. For him, the cardinal was only an officer coming to visit a lady. \u201cHave you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can wait near a good fire?\u201d said the cardinal. The host opened the door of a large room, in which an old stove had just been replaced by a large and excellent chimney. \u201cI have this,\u201d said he. \u201cThat will do,\u201d replied the cardinal. \u201cEnter, gentlemen, and be kind enough to wait for me; I shall not be more than half an hour.\u201d And while the three Musketeers entered the ground floor room, the cardinal, without asking further information, ascended the staircase like a man who has no need of having his road pointed out to him.", " She knew her brother-in-law to be a worthy gentleman, a bold hunter, an intrepid player, enterprising with women, but by no means remarkable for his skill in intrigues. How had he discovered her arrival, and caused her to be seized? Why did he detain her? Athos had dropped some words which proved that the conversation she had with the cardinal had fallen into outside ears; but she could not suppose that he had dug a countermine so promptly and so boldly. She rather feared that her preceding operations in England might have been discovered. Buckingham might have guessed that it was she who had cut off the two studs, and avenge himself for that little treachery; but Buckingham was incapable of going to any excess against a woman, particularly if that woman was supposed to have acted from a feeling of jealousy. This supposition appeared to her most reasonable. It seemed to her that they wanted to revenge the past, and not to anticipate the future.", " This was the last blow to the prisoner. Left alone, she arose. The bed, which she had kept from prudence and that they might believe her seriously wounded, burned her like a bed of fire. She cast a glance at the door; the baron had had a plank nailed over the grating. He no doubt feared that by this opening she might still by some diabolical means corrupt her guards. Milady smiled with joy. She was free now to give way to her transports without being observed. She traversed her chamber with the excitement of a furious maniac or of a tigress shut up in an iron cage. CERTES, if the knife had been left in her power, she would now have thought, not of killing herself, but of killing the baron. At six o\u2019clock Lord de Winter came in. He was armed at all points. This man, in whom Milady till that time had only seen a very simple gentleman, had become an admirable jailer. He appeared to foresee all, to divine all, to anticipate all."], "Who distinguishes himself with his heroism when the Cardinal\u2019s guards show up to arrest the three musketeers for dueling?": [" \u201cHe told me that he should henceforth recruit his Musketeers from among the Guards of Monsieur the Cardinal.\u201d \u201cThe Guards of the cardinal! And why so?\u201d asked Porthos, warmly. \u201cBecause he plainly perceives that his piquette* stands in need of being enlivened by a mixture of good wine.\u201d _*A watered liquor, made from the second pressing of the grape._ The two Musketeers reddened to the whites of their eyes. D\u2019Artagnan did not know where he was, and wished himself a hundred feet underground. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d continued M. de Treville, growing warmer as he spoke, \u201cand his majesty was right; for, upon my honor, it is true that the Musketeers make but a miserable figure at court. The cardinal related yesterday while playing with the king, with an air of condolence very displeasing to me, that the day before yesterday those DAMNED MUSKETEERS, those DAREDEVILS--he dwelt upon those words with an ironical tone still more displeasing to me--those BRAGGARTS, added he, glancing at me with his tiger-cat\u2019s eye, had made a riot in the Rue Ferou in a cabaret, and that a party of his Guards (I thought he was going to laugh in my face) had been forced to arrest the rioters!", " In an instant, from the door of the cabinet to the street gate, the whole hotel was boiling. \u201cAh! The king\u2019s Musketeers are arrested by the Guards of the cardinal, are they?\u201d continued M. de Treville, as furious at heart as his soldiers, but emphasizing his words and plunging them, one by one, so to say, like so many blows of a stiletto, into the bosoms of his auditors. \u201cWhat! Six of his Eminence\u2019s Guards arrest six of his Majesty\u2019s Musketeers! MORBLEU! My part is taken! I will go straight to the louvre; I will give in my resignation as captain of the king\u2019s Musketeers to take a lieutenancy in the cardinal\u2019s Guards, and if he refuses me, MORBLEU! I will turn abbe.\u201d At these words, the murmur without became an explosion; nothing was to be heard but oaths and blasphemies. The MORBLEUS, the SANG DIEUS, the MORTS TOUTS LES DIABLES, crossed one another in the air. D\u2019Artagnan looked for some tapestry behind which he might hide himself, and felt an immense inclination to crawl under the table.", " \u201cYou have told me the truth, my gentlemen,\u201d said he, addressing the Musketeers, \u201cand it will not be my fault if our encounter this evening be not advantageous to you. In the meantime, follow me.\u201d The cardinal alighted; the three Musketeers did likewise.

D\u2019Artagnan, although he was not a Musketeer, performed the duty of one with remarkable punctuality. He went on guard because he always kept company with whoever of his friends was on duty. He was well known at the Hotel of the Musketeers, where everyone considered him a good comrade. M. de Treville, who had appreciated him at the first glance and who bore him a real affection, never ceased recommending him to the king. On their side, the three Musketeers were much attached to their young comrade. The friendship which united these four men, and the need they felt of seeing another three or four times a day, whether for dueling, business, or pleasure, caused them to be continually running after one another like shadows; and the Inseparables were constantly to be met with seeking one another, from the Luxembourg to the Place St. Sulpice, or from the Rue du Vieux-Colombier to the Luxembourg."], "What does King Louis XIII give D\u2019Artagnan as a token of his gratitude after D\u2019Artagnan successfully fights the Cardinal\u2019s guards?": [" At last Louis XIII made Treville the captain of his Musketeers, who were to Louis XIII in devotedness, or rather in fanaticism, what his Ordinaries had been to Henry III, and his Scotch Guard to Louis XI. On his part, the cardinal was not behind the king in this respect. When he saw the formidable and chosen body with which Louis XIII had surrounded himself, this second, or rather this first king of France, became desirous that he, too, should have his guard. He had his Musketeers therefore, as Louis XIII had his, and these two powerful rivals vied with each other in procuring, not only from all the provinces of France, but even from all foreign states, the most celebrated swordsmen. It was not uncommon for Richelieu and Louis XIII to dispute over their evening game of chess upon the merits of their servants. Each boasted the bearing and the courage of his own people. While exclaiming loudly against duels and brawls, they excited them secretly to quarrel, deriving an immoderate satisfaction or genuine regret from the success or defeat of their own combatants.", " The cardinal there awaited Louis XIII. The minister and the king exchanged numerous caresses, felicitating each other upon the fortunate chance which had freed France from the inveterate enemy who set all Europe against her. After which, the cardinal, who had been informed that d\u2019Artagnan was arrested and who was anxious to see him, took leave of the king, inviting him to come the next day to view the work already done upon the dyke. On returning in the evening to his quarters at the bridge of La Pierre, the cardinal found, standing before the house he occupied, d\u2019Artagnan, without his sword, and the three Musketeers armed. This time, as he was well attended, he looked at them sternly, and made a sign with his eye and hand for d\u2019Artagnan to follow him. D\u2019Artagnan obeyed. \u201cWe shall wait for you, d\u2019Artagnan,\u201d said Athos, loud enough for the cardinal to hear him. His Eminence bent his brow, stopped for an instant, and then kept on his way without uttering a single word.", " In the meanwhile the promises of M. de Treville went on prosperously. One fine morning the king commanded M. de Chevalier Dessessart to admit d\u2019Artagnan as a cadet in his company of Guards. D\u2019Artagnan, with a sigh, donned his uniform, which he would have exchanged for that of a Musketeer at the expense of ten years of his existence. But M. de Treville promised this favor after a novitiate of two years--a novitiate which might besides be abridged if an opportunity should present itself for d\u2019Artagnan to render the king any signal service, or to distinguish himself by some brilliant action. Upon this promise d\u2019Artagnan withdrew, and the next day he began service. Then it became the turn of Athos, Porthos, and Aramis to mount guard with d\u2019Artagnan when he was on duty. The company of M. le Chevalier Dessessart thus received four instead of one when it admitted d\u2019Artagnan. 8 CONCERNING A COURT INTRIGUE In the meantime, the forty pistoles of King Louis XIII, like all other things of this world, after having had a beginning had an end, and after this end our four companions began to be somewhat embarrassed.", " The heart of d\u2019Artagnan swam in delirium; he marched between Athos and Porthos, pressing them tenderly. \u201cIf I am not yet a Musketeer,\u201d said he to his new friends, as he passed through the gateway of M. de Treville\u2019s hotel, \u201cat least I have entered upon my apprenticeship, haven\u2019t I?\u201d 6 HIS MAJESTY KING LOUIS XIII This affair made a great noise. M. de Treville scolded his Musketeers in public, and congratulated them in private; but as no time was to be lost in gaining the king, M. de Treville hastened to report himself at the Louvre. It was already too late. The king was closeted with the cardinal, and M. de Treville was informed that the king was busy and could not receive him at that moment. In the evening M. de Treville attended the king\u2019s gaming table. The king was winning; and as he was very avaricious, he was in an excellent humor. Perceiving M. de Treville at a distance-- \u201cCome here, Monsieur Captain,\u201d said he, \u201ccome here, that I may growl at you."], "How do the four friends decide to spend the money that the King has given D\u2019Artagnan?": [" She asked upon what day this fete would take place, but the king replied that he must consult the cardinal upon that head. Indeed, every day the king asked the cardinal when this fete should take place; and every day the cardinal, under some pretext, deferred fixing it. Ten days passed away thus. On the eighth day after the scene we have described, the cardinal received a letter with the London stamp which only contained these lines: \u201cI have them; but I am unable to leave London for want of money. Send me five hundred pistoles, and four or five days after I have received them I shall be in Paris.\u201d On the same day the cardinal received this letter the king put his customary question to him. Richelieu counted on his fingers, and said to himself, \u201cShe will arrive, she says, four or five days after having received the money. It will require four or five days for the transmission of the money, four or five days for her to return; that makes ten days.", " As to the second vessel, we will tell hereafter whom it carried, and how it set sail. During this time nothing new occurred in the camp at La Rochelle; only the king, who was bored, as always, but perhaps a little more so in camp than elsewhere, resolved to go incognito and spend the festival of St. Louis at St. Germain, and asked the cardinal to order him an escort of only twenty Musketeers. The cardinal, who sometimes became weary of the king, granted this leave of absence with great pleasure to his royal lieutenant, who promised to return about the fifteenth of September. M de Treville, being informed of this by his Eminence, packed his portmanteau; and as without knowing the cause he knew the great desire and even imperative need which his friends had of returning to Paris, it goes without saying that he fixed upon them to form part of the escort. The four young men heard the news a quarter of an hour after M. de Treville, for they were the first to whom he communicated it.", " The house may be suspected; but I deny that it is so in the part of it inhabited by Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan, for I can affirm, sire, if I can believe what he says, that there does not exist a more devoted servant of your Majesty, or a more profound admirer of Monsieur the Cardinal.\u201d \u201cWas it not this d\u2019Artagnan who wounded Jussac one day, in that unfortunate encounter which took place near the Convent of the Carmes-Dechausses?\u201d asked the king, looking at the cardinal, who colored with vexation. \u201cAnd the next day, Bernajoux. Yes, sire, yes, it is the same; and your Majesty has a good memory.\u201d \u201cCome, how shall we decide?\u201d said the king. \u201cThat concerns your Majesty more than me,\u201d said the cardinal. \u201cI should affirm the culpability.\u201d \u201cAnd I deny it,\u201d said Treville. \u201cBut his Majesty has judges, and these judges will decide.\u201d \u201cThat is best,\u201d said the king. \u201cSend the case before the judges; it is their business to judge, and they shall judge.\u201d \u201cOnly,\u201d replied Treville, \u201cit is a sad thing that in the unfortunate times in which we live, the purest life, the most incontestable virtue, cannot exempt a man from infamy and persecution.", " I agree to Athos\u2019s plan. And you, Porthos?\u201d \u201cI agree to it, too,\u201d said Porthos, \u201cif d\u2019Artagnan approves of it. D\u2019Artagnan, being the bearer of the letter, is naturally the head of the enterprise; let him decide, and we will execute.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cI decide that we should adopt Athos\u2019s plan, and that we set off in half an hour.\u201d \u201cAgreed!\u201d shouted the three Musketeers in chorus. Each one, stretching out his hand to the bag, took his seventy-five pistoles, and made his preparations to set out at the time appointed. 20 THE JOURNEY At two o\u2019clock in the morning, our four adventurers left Paris by the Barriere St. Denis. As long as it was dark they remained silent; in spite of themselves they submitted to the influence of the obscurity, and apprehended ambushes on every side. With the first rays of day their tongues were loosened; with the sun gaiety revived. It was like the eve of a battle; the heart beat, the eyes laughed, and they felt that the life they were perhaps going to lose, was, after all, a good thing."], "According to Monsieur Bonacieux, Madame Bonacieux\u2019s knowledge ___ may be related to her kidnapping.": [" \u201cYes, you! I know you now. You are Madame Bonacieux!\u201d The young woman drew back, filled with surprise and terror. \u201cOh, do not deny it! Answer!\u201d continued Milady. \u201cWell, yes, madame,\u201d said the novice, \u201cAre we rivals?\u201d The countenance of Milady was illumined by so savage a joy that under any other circumstances Mme. Bonacieux would have fled in terror; but she was absorbed by jealousy. \u201cSpeak, madame!\u201d resumed Mme. Bonacieux, with an energy of which she might not have been believed capable. \u201cHave you been, or are you, his mistress?\u201d \u201cOh, no!\u201d cried Milady, with an accent that admitted no doubt of her truth. \u201cNever, never!\u201d \u201cI believe you,\u201d said Mme. Bonacieux; \u201cbut why, then, did you cry out so?\u201d \u201cDo you not understand?\u201d said Milady, who had already overcome her agitation and recovered all her presence of mind. \u201cHow can I understand? I know nothing.\u201d \u201cCan you not understand that Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan, being my friend, might take me into his confidence?\u201d \u201cTruly?\u201d \u201cDo you not perceive that I know all--your abduction from the little house at St. Germain, his despair, that of his friends, and their useless inquiries up to this moment?", " But what could these men, whom I at first took for robbers, want with me, and why is Monsieur Bonacieux not here?\u201d \u201cMadame, those men were more dangerous than any robbers could have been, for they are the agents of the cardinal; and as to your husband, Monsieur Bonacieux, he is not here because he was yesterday evening conducted to the Bastille.\u201d \u201cMy husband in the Bastille!\u201d cried Mme. Bonacieux. \u201cOh, my God! What has he done? Poor dear man, he is innocence itself!\u201d And something like a faint smile lighted the still-terrified features of the young woman. \u201cWhat has he done, madame?\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cI believe that his only crime is to have at the same time the good fortune and the misfortune to be your husband.\u201d \u201cBut, monsieur, you know then--\u201d \u201cI know that you have been abducted, madame.\u201d \u201cAnd by whom?

Bonacieux, who saw she was regaining some little influence over her husband. \u201cYou meddle with politics, do you--and still more, with cardinalist politics?", " \u201cIt is he!\u201d cried Bonacieux. \u201cHe! What he?\u201d asked the cardinal. \u201cThe man who abducted my wife.\u201d The cardinal rang a second time. The officer reappeared. \u201cPlace this man in the care of his guards again, and let him wait till I send for him.\u201d \u201cNo, monseigneur, no, it is not he!\u201d cried Bonacieux; \u201cno, I was deceived. This is quite another man, and does not resemble him at all. Monsieur is, I am sure, an honest man.\u201d \u201cTake away that fool!\u201d said the cardinal. The officer took Bonacieux by the arm, and led him into the antechamber, where he found his two guards. The newly introduced personage followed Bonacieux impatiently with his eyes till he had gone out; and the moment the door closed, \u201cThey have seen each other;\u201d said he, approaching the cardinal eagerly. \u201cWho?\u201d asked his Eminence. \u201cHe and she.\u201d \u201cThe queen and the duke?\u201d cried Richelieu. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d \u201cAt the Louvre.\u201d \u201cAre you sure of it?\u201d \u201cPerfectly sure.\u201d \u201cWho told you of it?\u201d \u201cMadame de Lannoy, who is devoted to your Eminence, as you know.\u201d \u201cWhy did she not let me know sooner?\u201d \u201cWhether by chance or mistrust, the queen made Madame de Surgis sleep in her chamber, and detained her all day.\u201d \u201cWell, we are beaten!"], "Who does D\u2019Artagnan suspect kidnapped Madame Bonacieux?": [" D\u2019Artagnan dismissed Planchet, and requested his visitor to be seated. There was a moment of silence, during which the two men looked at each other, as if to make a preliminary acquaintance, after which d\u2019Artagnan bowed, as a sign that he listened. \u201cI have heard Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan spoken of as a very brave young man,\u201d said the citizen; \u201cand this reputation which he justly enjoys had decided me to confide a secret to him.\u201d \u201cSpeak, monsieur, speak,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, who instinctively scented something advantageous. The citizen made a fresh pause and continued, \u201cI have a wife who is seamstress to the queen, monsieur, and who is not deficient in either virtue or beauty. I was induced to marry her about three years ago, although she had but very little dowry, because Monsieur Laporte, the queen\u2019s cloak bearer, is her godfather, and befriends her.\u201d \u201cWell, monsieur?\u201d asked d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cWell!\u201d resumed the citizen, \u201cwell, monsieur, my wife was abducted yesterday morning, as she was coming out of her workroom.\u201d \u201cAnd by whom was your wife abducted?\u201d \u201cI know nothing surely, monsieur, but I suspect someone.\u201d \u201cAnd who is the person whom you suspect?\u201d \u201cA man who has pursued her a long time.\u201d \u201cThe devil!\u201d \u201cBut allow me to tell you, monsieur,\u201d continued the citizen, \u201cthat I am convinced that there is less love than politics in all this.\u201d \u201cLess love than politics,\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan, with a reflective air; \u201cand what do you suspect?\u201d \u201cI do not know whether I ought to tell you what I suspect.\u201d \u201cMonsieur, I beg you to observe that I ask you absolutely nothing.", " How is it possible for a poor mercer, who detests Huguenots and who abhors Spaniards, to be accused of high treason?

Bonacieux, with some embarrassment, \u201cthe cause of this event?\u201d \u201cHe attributed it, I believe, to a political cause.\u201d \u201cI doubted from the first; and now I think entirely as he does. Then my dear Monsieur Bonacieux has not suspected me a single instant?\u201d \u201cSo far from it, madame, he was too proud of your prudence, and above all, of your love.\u201d A second smile, almost imperceptible, stole over the rosy lips of the pretty young woman. \u201cBut,\u201d continued d\u2019Artagnan, \u201chow did you escape?\u201d \u201cI took advantage of a moment when they left me alone; and as I had known since morning the reason of my abduction, with the help of the sheets I let myself down from the window.

Overcome by example, grumbling to himself, nevertheless, Porthos stretched out his hand, and the four friends repeated with one voice the formula dictated by d\u2019Artagnan: \u201cAll for one, one for all.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s well! Now let us everyone retire to his own home,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, as if he had done nothing but command all his life; \u201cand attention! For from this moment we are at feud with the cardinal.\u201d 10 A MOUSETRAP IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY The invention of the mousetrap does not date from our days; as soon as societies, in forming, had invented any kind of police, that police invented mousetraps. As perhaps our readers are not familiar with the slang of the Rue de Jerusalem, and as it is fifteen years since we applied this word for the first time to this thing, allow us to explain to them what is a mousetrap.

Why, they want to know if the Duke of Buckingham is in Paris, and if he has had, or is likely to have, an interview with the queen.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan held onto this idea, which, from what he had heard, was not wanting in probability. In the meantime, the mousetrap continued in operation, and likewise d\u2019Artagnan\u2019s vigilance. On the evening of the day after the arrest of poor Bonacieux, as Athos had just left d\u2019Artagnan to report at M. de Treville\u2019s, as nine o\u2019clock had just struck, and as Planchet, who had not yet made the bed, was beginning his task, a knocking was heard at the street door. The door was instantly opened and shut; someone was taken in the mousetrap. D\u2019Artagnan flew to his hole, laid himself down on the floor at full length, and listened.", " The army, I will answer for it, will be but little pleased at being exposed to rigorous treatment on account of police affairs.\u201d The expression was imprudent; but M. de Treville launched it with knowledge of his cause. He was desirous of an explosion, because in that case the mine throws forth fire, and fire enlightens. \u201cPolice affairs!\u201d cried the king, taking up Treville\u2019s words, \u201cpolice affairs! And what do you know about them, Monsieur? Meddle with your Musketeers, and do not annoy me in this way. It appears, according to your account, that if by mischance a Musketeer is arrested, France is in danger. What a noise about a Musketeer! I would arrest ten of them, VENTREBLEU, a hundred, even, all the company, and I would not allow a whisper.\u201d \u201cFrom the moment they are suspected by your Majesty,\u201d said Treville, \u201cthe Musketeers are guilty; therefore, you see me prepared to surrender my sword--for after having accused my soldiers, there can be no doubt that Monsieur the Cardinal will end by accusing me.", " Four or five men are placed in ambuscade in the first room. The door is opened to all who knock. It is closed after them, and they are arrested; so that at the end of two or three days they have in their power almost all the HABITUES of the establishment. And that is a mousetrap. The apartment of M. Bonacieux, then, became a mousetrap; and whoever appeared there was taken and interrogated by the cardinal\u2019s people. It must be observed that as a separate passage led to the first floor, in which d\u2019Artagnan lodged, those who called on him were exempted from this detention. Besides, nobody came thither but the three Musketeers; they had all been engaged in earnest search and inquiries, but had discovered nothing. Athos had even gone so far as to question M. de Treville--a thing which, considering the habitual reticence of the worthy Musketeer, had very much astonished his captain. But M. de Treville knew nothing, except that the last time he had seen the cardinal, the king, and the queen, the cardinal looked very thoughtful, the king uneasy, and the redness of the queen\u2019s eyes donated that she had been sleepless or tearful."], "How does D'Artagnan try to ensure the success of the alibi that de Treville will give him?": [" In a court of justice that is called an alibi.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan found his advice prudent. He took to his heels, and was soon at M. de Treville\u2019s; but instead of going into the saloon with the rest of the crowd, he asked to be introduced to M. de Treville\u2019s office. As d\u2019Artagnan so constantly frequented the hotel, no difficulty was made in complying with his request, and a servant went to inform M. de Treville that his young compatriot, having something important to communicate, solicited a private audience. Five minutes after, M. de Treville was asking d\u2019Artagnan what he could do to serve him, and what caused his visit at so late an hour. \u201cPardon me, monsieur,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, who had profited by the moment he had been left alone to put back M. de Treville\u2019s clock three-quarters of an hour, \u201cbut I thought, as it was yet only twenty-five minutes past nine, it was not too late to wait upon you.\u201d \u201cTwenty-five minutes past nine!\u201d cried M. de Treville, looking at the clock; \u201cwhy, that\u2019s impossible!\u201d \u201cLook, rather, monsieur,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cthe clock shows it.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d said M. de Treville; \u201cI believed it later.", " But what can I do for you?\u201d Then d\u2019Artagnan told M. de Treville a long history about the queen. He expressed to him the fears he entertained with respect to her Majesty; he related to him what he had heard of the projects of the cardinal with regard to Buckingham, and all with a tranquillity and candor of which M. de Treville was the more the dupe, from having himself, as we have said, observed something fresh between the cardinal, the king, and the queen. As ten o\u2019clock was striking, d\u2019Artagnan left M. de Treville, who thanked him for his information, recommended him to have the service of the king and queen always at heart, and returned to the saloon; but at the foot of the stairs, d\u2019Artagnan remembered he had forgotten his cane. He consequently sprang up again, re-entered the office, with a turn of his finger set the clock right again, that it might not be perceived the next day that it had been put wrong, and certain from that time that he had a witness to prove his alibi, he ran downstairs and soon found himself in the street.", " M de Treville was in his saloon with his habitual court of gentlemen. D\u2019Artagnan, who was known as a familiar of the house, went straight to his office, and sent word that he wished to see him on something of importance. D\u2019Artagnan had been there scarcely five minutes when M. de Treville entered. At the first glance, and by the joy which was painted on his countenance, the worthy captain plainly perceived that something new was on foot. All the way along d\u2019Artagnan had been consulting with himself whether he should place confidence in M. de Treville, or whether he should only ask him to give him CARTE BLANCHE for some secret affair. But M. de Treville had always been so thoroughly his friend, had always been so devoted to the king and queen, and hated the cardinal so cordially, that the young man resolved to tell him everything. \u201cDid you ask for me, my good friend?\u201d said M. de Treville. \u201cYes, monsieur,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, lowering his voice, \u201cand you will pardon me, I hope, for having disturbed you when you know the importance of my business.\u201d \u201cSpeak, then, I am all attention.\u201d \u201cIt concerns nothing less,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cthan the honor, perhaps the life of the queen.\u201d \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d asked M. de Treville, glancing round to see if they were surely alone, and then fixing his questioning look upon d\u2019Artagnan.", " The heart of d\u2019Artagnan swam in delirium; he marched between Athos and Porthos, pressing them tenderly. \u201cIf I am not yet a Musketeer,\u201d said he to his new friends, as he passed through the gateway of M. de Treville\u2019s hotel, \u201cat least I have entered upon my apprenticeship, haven\u2019t I?\u201d 6 HIS MAJESTY KING LOUIS XIII This affair made a great noise. M. de Treville scolded his Musketeers in public, and congratulated them in private; but as no time was to be lost in gaining the king, M. de Treville hastened to report himself at the Louvre. It was already too late. The king was closeted with the cardinal, and M. de Treville was informed that the king was busy and could not receive him at that moment. In the evening M. de Treville attended the king\u2019s gaming table. The king was winning; and as he was very avaricious, he was in an excellent humor. Perceiving M. de Treville at a distance-- \u201cCome here, Monsieur Captain,\u201d said he, \u201ccome here, that I may growl at you."], "What mistaken belief causes the police to arrest Athos?": [" The army, I will answer for it, will be but little pleased at being exposed to rigorous treatment on account of police affairs.\u201d The expression was imprudent; but M. de Treville launched it with knowledge of his cause.

Today is the twentieth of September. The aldermen of the city give a fete on the third of October. That will fall in wonderfully well; you will not appear to have gone out of your way to please the queen.\u201d Then the cardinal added, \u201cA PROPOS, sire, do not forget to tell her Majesty the evening before the fete that you should like to see how her diamond studs become her.\u201d 17 BONACIEUX AT HOME It was the second time the cardinal had mentioned these diamond studs to the king. Louis XIII was struck with this insistence, and began to fancy that this recommendation concealed some mystery. More than once the king had been humiliated by the cardinal, whose police, without having yet attained the perfection of the modern police, were excellent, being better informed than himself, even upon what was going on in his own household."], "Why does the Duke of Buckingham visit Queen Anne in the company of Madame Bonacieux?": [" You have told me yourself, madame, that I have been drawn into a snare; I, perhaps, may leave my life in it--for, although it may be strange, I have for some time had a presentiment that I should shortly die.\u201d And the duke smiled, with a smile at once sad and charming. \u201cOh, my God!\u201d cried Anne of Austria, with an accent of terror which proved how much greater an interest she took in the duke than she ventured to tell. \u201cI do not tell you this, madame, to terrify you; no, it is even ridiculous for me to name it to you, and, believe me, I take no heed of such dreams. But the words you have just spoken, the hope you have almost given me, will have richly paid all--were it my life.\u201d \u201cOh, but I,\u201d said Anne, \u201cI also, duke, have had presentiments; I also have had dreams. I dreamed that I saw you lying bleeding, wounded.\u201d \u201cIn the left side, was it not, and with a knife?\u201d interrupted Buckingham. \u201cYes, it was so, my Lord, it was so--in the left side, and with a knife.", " 12 GEORGE VILLIERS, DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM Mme. Bonacieux and the duke entered the Louvre without difficulty. Mme. Bonacieux was known to belong to the queen; the duke wore the uniform of the Musketeers of M. de Treville, who, as we have said, were that evening on guard. Besides, Germain was in the interests of the queen; and if anything should happen, Mme. Bonacieux would be accused of having introduced her lover into the Louvre, that was all. She took the risk upon herself. Her reputation would be lost, it is true; but of what value in the world was the reputation of the little wife of a mercer? Once within the interior of the court, the duke and the young woman followed the wall for the space of about twenty-five steps. This space passed, Mme. Bonacieux pushed a little servants\u2019 door, open by day but generally closed at night. The door yielded. Both entered, and found themselves in darkness; but Mme.", " \u201cI am a faithful subject of the king, madame, and all that his Majesty commands I shall do.\u201d \u201cWell, it is true!\u201d said Anne of Austria; \u201cand the spies of the cardinal have served him faithfully. I have written a letter today; that letter is not yet gone. The letter is here.\u201d And the queen laid her beautiful hand on her bosom. \u201cThen give me that letter, madame,\u201d said the chancellor. \u201cI will give it to none but the king, monsieur,\u201d said Anne. \u201cIf the king had desired that the letter should be given to him, madame, he would have demanded it of you himself. But I repeat to you, I am charged with reclaiming it; and if you do not give it up--\u201d \u201cWell?\u201d \u201cHe has, then, charged me to take it from you.\u201d \u201cHow! What do you say?\u201d \u201cThat my orders go far, madame; and that I am authorized to seek for the suspected paper, even on the person of your Majesty.\u201d \u201cWhat horror!\u201d cried the queen. \u201cBe kind enough, then, madame, to act more compliantly.\u201d \u201cThe conduct is infamously violent!", " Those who have read the MEMOIRS of Mme. de Motteville will not be astonished at this reply. \u201cBut wait a minute.\u201d Anne of Austria ran to her jewel case. \u201cHere,\u201d said she, \u201chere is a ring of great value, as I have been assured. It came from my brother, the King of Spain. It is mine, and I am at liberty to dispose of it. Take this ring; raise money with it, and let your husband set out.\u201d \u201cIn an hour you shall be obeyed.\u201d \u201cYou see the address,\u201d said the queen, speaking so low that Mme. Bonacieux could hardly hear what she said, \u201cTo my Lord Duke of Buckingham, London.\u201d \u201cThe letter shall be given to himself.\u201d \u201cGenerous girl!\u201d cried Anne of Austria. Mme. Bonacieux kissed the hands of the queen, concealed the paper in the bosom of her dress, and disappeared with the lightness of a bird. Ten minutes afterward she was at home. As she told the queen, she had not seen her husband since his liberation; she was ignorant of the change that had taken place in him with respect to the cardinal--a change which had since been strengthened by two or three visits from the Comte de Rochefort, who had become the best friend of Bonacieux, and had persuaded him, without much trouble, that no culpable sentiments had prompted the abduction of his wife, but that it was only a political precaution."], "To what end does the Duke of Buckingham propose waging war on France?": [" Read me her letter.\u201d \u201cOh, my Lord!\u201d said Laporte. \u201cObey, Laporte, do you not see I have no time to lose?\u201d Laporte broke the seal, and placed the paper before the eyes of the duke; but Buckingham in vain tried to make out the writing. \u201cRead!\u201d said he, \u201cread! I cannot see. Read, then! For soon, perhaps, I shall not hear, and I shall die without knowing what she has written to me.\u201d Laporte made no further objection, and read: \u201cMy Lord, By that which, since I have known you, have suffered by you and for you, I conjure you, if you have any care for my repose, to countermand those great armaments which you are preparing against France, to put an end to a war of which it is publicly said religion is the ostensible cause, and of which, it is generally whispered, your love for me is the concealed cause. This war may not only bring great catastrophes upon England and France, but misfortune upon you, my Lord, for which I should never console myself.", " You recollect perfectly all I have told you, do you not?\u201d \u201cYour Eminence will judge: the ball of Madame the Constable; the night at the Louvre; the evening at Amiens; the arrest of Montague; the letter of Madame de Chevreuse.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d said the cardinal, \u201cthat\u2019s it. You have an excellent memory, Milady.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d resumed she to whom the cardinal addressed this flattering compliment, \u201cif, in spite of all these reasons, the duke does not give way and continues to menace France?\u201d \u201cThe duke is in love to madness, or rather to folly,\u201d replied Richelieu, with great bitterness. \u201cLike the ancient paladins, he has only undertaken this war to obtain a look from his lady love. If he becomes certain that this war will cost the honor, and perhaps the liberty, of the lady of his thoughts, as he says, I will answer for it he will look twice.\u201d \u201cAnd yet,\u201d said Milady, with a persistence that proved she wished to see clearly to the end of the mission with which she was about to be charged, \u201cif he persists?\u201d \u201cIf he persists?\u201d said the cardinal.", " \u201cBeware, my Lord, you are in the hands of God!\u201d \u201cIn the hands of the devil, you mean!\u201d cried Buckingham, raising his voice so as to attract the notice of his people, without absolutely shouting. \u201cSign, my Lord; sign the liberation of Milady de Winter,\u201d said Felton, holding out a paper to the duke. \u201cBy force? You are joking! Holloa, Patrick!\u201d \u201cSign, my Lord!\u201d \u201cNever.\u201d \u201cNever?\u201d \u201cHelp!\u201d shouted the duke; and at the same time he sprang toward his sword. But Felton did not give him time to draw it. He held the knife with which Milady had stabbed herself, open in his bosom; at one bound he was upon the duke. At that moment Patrick entered the room, crying, \u201cA letter from France, my Lord.\u201d \u201cFrom France!\u201d cried Buckingham, forgetting everything in thinking from whom that letter came. Felton took advantage of this moment, and plunged the knife into his side up to the handle. \u201cAh, traitor,\u201d cried Buckingham, \u201cyou have killed me!\u201d \u201cMurder!\u201d screamed Patrick.", " It was, then, Richelieu\u2019s object, not only to get rid of an enemy of France, but to avenge himself on a rival; but this vengeance must be grand and striking and worthy in every way of a man who held in his hand, as his weapon for combat, the forces of a kingdom. Richelieu knew that in combating England he combated Buckingham; that in triumphing over England he triumphed over Buckingham--in short, that in humiliating England in the eyes of Europe he humiliated Buckingham in the eyes of the queen. On his side Buckingham, in pretending to maintain the honor of England, was moved by interests exactly like those of the cardinal. Buckingham also was pursuing a private vengeance. Buckingham could not under any pretense be admitted into France as an ambassador; he wished to enter it as a conqueror. It resulted from this that the real stake in this game, which two most powerful kingdoms played for the good pleasure of two amorous men, was simply a kind look from Anne of Austria."], "What does the Queen give to the Duke of Buckingham as a token of her esteem?": [" \u201cI have the greatest veneration for the cardinal,\u201d continued he, \u201cand the most profound respect for his actions. So much the better for me, sir, if you speak to me, as you say, with frankness--for then you will do me the honor to esteem the resemblance of our opinions; but if you have entertained any doubt, as naturally you may, I feel that I am ruining myself by speaking the truth. But I still trust you will not esteem me the less for it, and that is my object beyond all others.\u201d M de Treville was surprised to the greatest degree. So much penetration, so much frankness, created admiration, but did not entirely remove his suspicions. The more this young man was superior to others, the more he was to be dreaded if he meant to deceive him. Nevertheless, he pressed d\u2019Artagnan\u2019s hand, and said to him: \u201cYou are an honest youth; but at the present moment I can only do for you that which I just now offered.", " Bonacieux was acquainted with all the turnings and windings of this part of the Louvre, appropriated for the people of the household. She closed the door after her, took the duke by the hand, and after a few experimental steps, grasped a balustrade, put her foot upon the bottom step, and began to ascend the staircase. The duke counted two stories. She then turned to the right, followed the course of a long corridor, descended a flight, went a few steps farther, introduced a key into a lock, opened a door, and pushed the duke into an apartment lighted only by a lamp, saying, \u201cRemain here, my Lord Duke; someone will come.\u201d She then went out by the same door, which she locked, so that the duke found himself literally a prisoner. Nevertheless, isolated as he was, we must say that the Duke of Buckingham did not experience an instant of fear. One of the salient points of his character was the search for adventures and a love of romance.", " If I made you that present it was that you might adorn yourself therewith. I tell you that you were wrong.\u201d The voice of the king was tremulous with anger. Everybody looked and listened with astonishment, comprehending nothing of what passed. \u201cSire,\u201d said the queen, \u201cI can send for them to the Louvre, where they are, and thus your Majesty\u2019s wishes will be complied with.\u201d \u201cDo so, madame, do so, and that at once; for within an hour the ballet will commence.\u201d The queen bent in token of submission, and followed the ladies who were to conduct her to her room. On his part the king returned to his apartment. There was a moment of trouble and confusion in the assembly. Everybody had remarked that something had passed between the king and queen; but both of them had spoken so low that everybody, out of respect, withdrew several steps, so that nobody had heard anything. The violins began to sound with all their might, but nobody listened to them.", " 12 GEORGE VILLIERS, DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM Mme. Bonacieux and the duke entered the Louvre without difficulty. Mme.

D\u2019Artagnan remained alone in front of the cardinal; this was his second interview with Richelieu, and he afterward confessed that he felt well assured it would be his last.

Richelieu knew that in combating England he combated Buckingham; that in triumphing over England he triumphed over Buckingham--in short, that in humiliating England in the eyes of Europe he humiliated Buckingham in the eyes of the queen. On his side Buckingham, in pretending to maintain the honor of England, was moved by interests exactly like those of the cardinal. Buckingham also was pursuing a private vengeance.

And why not?\u201d \u201cBecause you will look into yourself, and you will do justice to the lady.\u201d \u201cI should do her justice by sending her to Tyburn,\u201d said Buckingham. \u201cThis lady is infamous.\u201d \u201cMy Lord, Milady de Winter is an angel; you know that she is, and I demand her liberty of you.\u201d \u201cBah! Are you mad, to talk to me thus?\u201d said Buckingham. \u201cMy Lord, excuse me! I speak as I can; I restrain myself. But, my Lord, think of what you\u2019re about to do, and beware of going too far!\u201d \u201cWhat do you say? God pardon me!\u201d cried Buckingham, \u201cI really think he threatens me!\u201d \u201cNo, my Lord, I still plead. And I say to you: one drop of water suffices to make the full vase overflow; one slight fault may draw down punishment upon the head spared, despite many crimes.\u201d \u201cMr. Felton,\u201d said Buckingham, \u201cyou will withdraw, and place yourself at once under arrest.\u201d \u201cYou will hear me to the end, my Lord.", " \u201cHow?\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cyou care little if she kills Buckingham or causes him to be killed? But the duke is our friend.\u201d \u201cThe duke is English; the duke fights against us. Let her do what she likes with the duke; I care no more about him than an empty bottle.\u201d And Athos threw fifteen paces from him an empty bottle from which he had poured the last drop into his glass. \u201cA moment,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cI will not abandon Buckingham thus. He gave us some very fine horses.\u201d \u201cAnd moreover, very handsome saddles,\u201d said Porthos, who at the moment wore on his cloak the lace of his own. \u201cBesides,\u201d said Aramis, \u201cGod desires the conversion and not the death of a sinner.\u201d \u201cAmen!\u201d said Athos, \u201cand we will return to that subject later, if such be your pleasure; but what for the moment engaged my attention most earnestly, and I am sure you will understand me, d\u2019Artagnan, was the getting from this woman a kind of carte blanche which she had extorted from the cardinal, and by means of which she could with impunity get rid of you and perhaps of us.\u201d \u201cBut this creature must be a demon!\u201d said Porthos, holding out his plate to Aramis, who was cutting up a fowl.", " And still further, it is very probable I should not have done anything of this, if it had not been to make myself agreeable to someone who is my lady, as the queen is yours.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said the duke, smiling, \u201cand I even believe that I know that other person; it is--\u201d \u201cMy Lord, I have not named her!\u201d interrupted the young man, warmly. \u201cThat is true,\u201d said the duke; \u201cand it is to this person I am bound to discharge my debt of gratitude.\u201d \u201cYou have said, my Lord; for truly, at this moment when there is question of war, I confess to you that I see nothing in your Grace but an Englishman, and consequently an enemy whom I should have much greater pleasure in meeting on the field of battle than in the park at Windsor or the corridors of the Louvre--all which, however, will not prevent me from executing to the very point my commission or from laying down my life, if there be need of it, to accomplish it; but I repeat it to your Grace, without your having personally on that account more to thank me for in this second interview than for what I did for you in the first.\u201d \u201cWe say, \u2018Proud as a Scotsman,\u2019\u201d murmured the Duke of Buckingham.", " \u201cThat head has never conspired,\u201d murmured he, \u201cbut it matters not; we will see.\u201d \u201cYou are accused of high treason,\u201d said the cardinal, slowly. \u201cSo I have been told already, monseigneur,\u201d cried Bonacieux, giving his interrogator the title he had heard the officer give him, \u201cbut I swear to you that I know nothing about it.\u201d The cardinal repressed a smile. \u201cYou have conspired with your wife, with Madame de Chevreuse, and with my Lord Duke of Buckingham.\u201d \u201cIndeed, monseigneur,\u201d responded the mercer, \u201cI have heard her pronounce all those names.\u201d \u201cAnd on what occasion?\u201d \u201cShe said that the Cardinal de Richelieu had drawn the Duke of Buckingham to Paris to ruin him and to ruin the queen.\u201d \u201cShe said that?\u201d cried the cardinal, with violence. \u201cYes, monseigneur, but I told her she was wrong to talk about such things; and that his Eminence was incapable--\u201d \u201cHold your tongue! You are stupid,\u201d replied the cardinal."], "What does the Queen give D\u2019Artagnan as a token of her gratitude for retrieving her brooch?": [" If I made you that present it was that you might adorn yourself therewith. I tell you that you were wrong.\u201d The voice of the king was tremulous with anger. Everybody looked and listened with astonishment, comprehending nothing of what passed. \u201cSire,\u201d said the queen, \u201cI can send for them to the Louvre, where they are, and thus your Majesty\u2019s wishes will be complied with.\u201d \u201cDo so, madame, do so, and that at once; for within an hour the ballet will commence.\u201d The queen bent in token of submission, and followed the ladies who were to conduct her to her room. On his part the king returned to his apartment. There was a moment of trouble and confusion in the assembly. Everybody had remarked that something had passed between the king and queen; but both of them had spoken so low that everybody, out of respect, withdrew several steps, so that nobody had heard anything. The violins began to sound with all their might, but nobody listened to them.", " \u201cWell thought of, Porthos; this time you have an idea.\u201d \u201cUndoubtedly,\u201d said Porthos, drawing himself up at Athos\u2019s compliment; \u201cas there is a diamond, let us sell it.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cit is the queen\u2019s diamond.\u201d \u201cThe stronger reason why it should be sold,\u201d replied Athos. \u201cThe queen saving Monsieur de Buckingham, her lover; nothing more just. The queen saving us, her friends; nothing more moral. Let us sell the diamond. What says Monsieur the Abbe? I don\u2019t ask Porthos; his opinion has been given.\u201d \u201cWhy, I think,\u201d said Aramis, blushing as usual, \u201cthat his ring not coming from a mistress, and consequently not being a love token, d\u2019Artagnan may sell it.\u201d \u201cMy dear Aramis, you speak like theology personified. Your advice, then, is--\u201d \u201cTo sell the diamond,\u201d replied Aramis. \u201cWell, then,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, gaily, \u201clet us sell the diamond, and say no more about it.\u201d The fusillade continued; but the four friends were out of reach, and the Rochellais only fired to appease their consciences.", " His eyes were fixed upon those of the queen, and a smile of terrible joy passed over his lips; the queen did not wear her diamond studs. The queen remained for a short time to receive the compliments of the city dignitaries and to reply to the salutations of the ladies. All at once the king appeared with the cardinal at one of the doors of the hall. The cardinal was speaking to him in a low voice, and the king was very pale. The king made his way through the crowd without a mask, and the ribbons of his doublet scarcely tied. He went straight to the queen, and in an altered voice said, \u201cWhy, madame, have you not thought proper to wear your diamond studs, when you know it would give me so much gratification?\u201d The queen cast a glance around her, and saw the cardinal behind, with a diabolical smile on his countenance. \u201cSire,\u201d replied the queen, with a faltering voice, \u201cbecause, in the midst of such a crowd as this, I feared some accident might happen to them.\u201d \u201cAnd you were wrong, madame.", " Bonacieux had disappeared, without his being able to discover what had become of her. As to fortune, he had made--he, humble as he was--an enemy of the cardinal; that is to say, of a man before whom trembled the greatest men of the kingdom, beginning with the king. That man had the power to crush him, and yet he had not done so. For a mind so perspicuous as that of d\u2019Artagnan, this indulgence was a light by which he caught a glimpse of a better future. Then he had made himself another enemy, less to be feared, he thought; but nevertheless, he instinctively felt, not to be despised. This enemy was Milady. In exchange for all this, he had acquired the protection and good will of the queen; but the favor of the queen was at the present time an additional cause of persecution, and her protection, as it was known, protected badly--as witness Chalais and Mme. Bonacieux. What he had clearly gained in all this was the diamond, worth five or six thousand livres, which he wore on his finger; and even this diamond--supposing that d\u2019Artagnan, in his projects of ambition, wished to keep it, to make it someday a pledge for the gratitude of the queen--had not in the meanwhile, since he could not part with it, more value than the gravel he trod under his feet."], "Why is Madame Bonacieux not at the meeting spot when D\u2019Artagnan shows up for their tryst?": [" Besides, how is it possible to avoid a little condescension toward a husband whose pretty wife has appointed a meeting with you that same evening at St. Cloud, opposite D\u2019Estrees\u2019s pavilion? D\u2019Artagnan approached him with the most amiable air he could assume. The conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor man. M. Bonacieux, who was ignorant that d\u2019Artagnan had overheard his conversation with the stranger of Meung, related to his young tenant the persecutions of that monster, M. de Laffemas, whom he never ceased to designate, during his account, by the title of the \u201ccardinal\u2019s executioner,\u201d and expatiated at great length upon the Bastille, the bolts, the wickets, the dungeons, the gratings, the instruments of torture. D\u2019Artagnan listened to him with exemplary complaisance, and when he had finished said, \u201cAnd Madame Bonacieux, do you know who carried her off?--For I do not forget that I owe to that unpleasant circumstance the good fortune of having made your acquaintance.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d said Bonacieux, \u201cthey took good care not to tell me that; and my wife, on her part, has sworn to me by all that\u2019s sacred that she does not know.", " \u201cYes, you! I know you now. You are Madame Bonacieux!\u201d The young woman drew back, filled with surprise and terror. \u201cOh, do not deny it! Answer!\u201d continued Milady. \u201cWell, yes, madame,\u201d said the novice, \u201cAre we rivals?\u201d The countenance of Milady was illumined by so savage a joy that under any other circumstances Mme. Bonacieux would have fled in terror; but she was absorbed by jealousy. \u201cSpeak, madame!\u201d resumed Mme. Bonacieux, with an energy of which she might not have been believed capable. \u201cHave you been, or are you, his mistress?\u201d \u201cOh, no!\u201d cried Milady, with an accent that admitted no doubt of her truth. \u201cNever, never!\u201d \u201cI believe you,\u201d said Mme. Bonacieux; \u201cbut why, then, did you cry out so?\u201d \u201cDo you not understand?\u201d said Milady, who had already overcome her agitation and recovered all her presence of mind. \u201cHow can I understand? I know nothing.\u201d \u201cCan you not understand that Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan, being my friend, might take me into his confidence?\u201d \u201cTruly?\u201d \u201cDo you not perceive that I know all--your abduction from the little house at St. Germain, his despair, that of his friends, and their useless inquiries up to this moment?", " Between the forest and this accursed spot, a little behind the trampled ground, was the same track of small feet as in the garden; the carriage had stopped here. At this spot Milady had come out of the wood, and entered the carriage. Satisfied with this discovery which confirmed all his suspicions, Athos returned to the hotel, and found Planchet impatiently waiting for him. Everything was as Athos had foreseen. Planchet had followed the road; like Athos, he had discovered the stains of blood; like Athos, he had noted the spot where the horses had halted. But he had gone farther than Athos--for at the village of Festubert, while drinking at an inn, he had learned without needing to ask a question that the evening before, at half-past eight, a wounded man who accompanied a lady traveling in a post-chaise had been obliged to stop, unable to go further. The accident was set down to the account of robbers, who had stopped the chaise in the wood.", " Why, it was he who carried me off!\u201d \u201cThat may be, madame!\u201d \u201cAnd you receive silver from that man?\u201d \u201cHave you not said that that abduction was entirely political?\u201d \u201cYes; but that abduction had for its object the betrayal of my mistress, to draw from me by torture confessions that might compromise the honor, and perhaps the life, of my august mistress.\u201d \u201cMadame,\u201d replied Bonacieux, \u201cyour august mistress is a perfidious Spaniard, and what the cardinal does is well done.\u201d \u201cMonsieur,\u201d said the young woman, \u201cI know you to be cowardly, avaricious, and foolish, but I never till now believed you infamous!\u201d \u201cMadame,\u201d said Bonacieux, who had never seen his wife in a passion, and who recoiled before this conjugal anger, \u201cmadame, what do you say?\u201d \u201cI say you are a miserable creature!\u201d continued Mme. Bonacieux, who saw she was regaining some little influence over her husband. \u201cYou meddle with politics, do you--and still more, with cardinalist politics?"], "To what cause does de Treville attribute Madame Bonacieux\u2019s apparent disappearance?": [" 25 PORTHOS Instead of returning directly home, d\u2019Artagnan alighted at the door of M. de Treville, and ran quickly up the stairs. This time he had decided to relate all that had passed. M. de Treville would doubtless give him good advice as to the whole affair. Besides, as M. de Treville saw the queen almost daily, he might be able to draw from her Majesty some intelligence of the poor young woman, whom they were doubtless making pay very dearly for her devotedness to her mistress. M de Treville listened to the young man\u2019s account with a seriousness which proved that he saw something else in this adventure besides a love affair. When d\u2019Artagnan had finished, he said, \u201cHum! All this savors of his Eminence, a league off.\u201d \u201cBut what is to be done?\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cNothing, absolutely nothing, at present, but quitting Paris, as I told you, as soon as possible. I will see the queen; I will relate to her the details of the disappearance of this poor woman, of which she is no doubt ignorant.", " The officer leaned forward, looked at her in his turn, and appeared surprised to see that face, just before so beautiful, distorted with passion and almost hideous. The artful creature at once comprehended that she was injuring herself by allowing him thus to read her soul; she collected her features, and in a complaining voice said: \u201cIn the name of heaven, sir, tell me if it is to you, if it is to your government, if it is to an enemy I am to attribute the violence that is done me?\u201d \u201cNo violence will be offered to you, madame, and what happens to you is the result of a very simple measure which we are obliged to adopt with all who land in England.\u201d \u201cThen you don\u2019t know me, sir?\u201d \u201cIt is the first time I have had the honor of seeing you.\u201d \u201cAnd on your honor, you have no cause of hatred against me?\u201d \u201cNone, I swear to you.\u201d There was so much serenity, coolness, mildness even, in the voice of the young man, that Milady felt reassured.", " In a court of justice that is called an alibi.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan found his advice prudent. He took to his heels, and was soon at M. de Treville\u2019s; but instead of going into the saloon with the rest of the crowd, he asked to be introduced to M. de Treville\u2019s office. As d\u2019Artagnan so constantly frequented the hotel, no difficulty was made in complying with his request, and a servant went to inform M. de Treville that his young compatriot, having something important to communicate, solicited a private audience. Five minutes after, M. de Treville was asking d\u2019Artagnan what he could do to serve him, and what caused his visit at so late an hour. \u201cPardon me, monsieur,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, who had profited by the moment he had been left alone to put back M. de Treville\u2019s clock three-quarters of an hour, \u201cbut I thought, as it was yet only twenty-five minutes past nine, it was not too late to wait upon you.\u201d \u201cTwenty-five minutes past nine!\u201d cried M. de Treville, looking at the clock; \u201cwhy, that\u2019s impossible!\u201d \u201cLook, rather, monsieur,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cthe clock shows it.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d said M. de Treville; \u201cI believed it later.", " The heart of d\u2019Artagnan swam in delirium; he marched between Athos and Porthos, pressing them tenderly. \u201cIf I am not yet a Musketeer,\u201d said he to his new friends, as he passed through the gateway of M. de Treville\u2019s hotel, \u201cat least I have entered upon my apprenticeship, haven\u2019t I?\u201d 6 HIS MAJESTY KING LOUIS XIII This affair made a great noise. M. de Treville scolded his Musketeers in public, and congratulated them in private; but as no time was to be lost in gaining the king, M. de Treville hastened to report himself at the Louvre. It was already too late. The king was closeted with the cardinal, and M. de Treville was informed that the king was busy and could not receive him at that moment. In the evening M. de Treville attended the king\u2019s gaming table. The king was winning; and as he was very avaricious, he was in an excellent humor. Perceiving M. de Treville at a distance-- \u201cCome here, Monsieur Captain,\u201d said he, \u201ccome here, that I may growl at you."], "Who is Porthos\u2019 mistress, according to the innkeeper?": [" If anyone seeks a quarrel with you, shun it, were it with a child of ten years old. If you are attacked by day or by night, fight, but retreat, without shame; if you cross a bridge, feel every plank of it with your foot, lest one should give way beneath you; if you pass before a house which is being built, look up, for fear a stone should fall upon your head; if you stay out late, be always followed by your lackey, and let your lackey be armed--if, by the by, you can be sure of your lackey. Mistrust everybody, your friend, your brother, your mistress--your mistress above all.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan blushed. \u201cMy mistress above all,\u201d repeated he, mechanically; \u201cand why her rather than another?\u201d \u201cBecause a mistress is one of the cardinal\u2019s favorite means; he has not one that is more expeditious. A woman will sell you for ten pistoles, witness Delilah. You are acquainted with the Scriptures?\u201d D\u2019Artagnan thought of the appointment Mme.", " \u201cYes, horse. Are we not eating a horse, Porthos? And perhaps his saddle, therewith.\u201d \u201cNo, gentlemen, I have kept the harness,\u201d said Porthos. \u201cMy faith,\u201d said Aramis, \u201cwe are all alike. One would think we had tipped the wink.\u201d \u201cWhat could I do?\u201d said Porthos. \u201cThis horse made my visitors ashamed of theirs, and I don\u2019t like to humiliate people.\u201d \u201cThen your duchess is still at the waters?\u201d asked d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cStill,\u201d replied Porthos. \u201cAnd, my faith, the governor of the province--one of the gentlemen I expected today--seemed to have such a wish for him, that I gave him to him.\u201d \u201cGave him?\u201d cried d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cMy God, yes, GAVE, that is the word,\u201d said Porthos; \u201cfor the animal was worth at least a hundred and fifty louis, and the stingy fellow would only give me eighty.\u201d \u201cWithout the saddle?\u201d said Aramis. \u201cYes, without the saddle.\u201d \u201cYou will observe, gentlemen,\u201d said Athos, \u201cthat Porthos has made the best bargain of any of us.\u201d And then commenced a roar of laughter in which they all joined, to the astonishment of poor Porthos; but when he was informed of the cause of their hilarity, he shared it vociferously according to his custom.", " D\u2019Artagnan replied in such a manner that Kitty remained in her great delusion. Although she cried freely before deciding to transmit the letter to her mistress, she did at last so decide, which was all d\u2019Artagnan wished. Finally he promised that he would leave her mistress\u2019s presence at an early hour that evening, and that when he left the mistress he would ascend with the maid. This promise completed poor Kitty\u2019s consolation. 34 IN WHICH THE EQUIPMENT OF ARAMIS AND PORTHOS IS TREATED OF Since the four friends had been each in search of his equipments, there had been no fixed meeting between them. They dined apart from one another, wherever they might happen to be, or rather where they could. Duty likewise on its part took a portion of that precious time which was gliding away so rapidly--only they had agreed to meet once a week, about one o\u2019clock, at the residence of Athos, seeing that he, in agreement with the vow he had formed, did not pass over the threshold of his door.", " Now, as they had already traveled eleven leagues, d\u2019Artagnan thought it time to stop, whether Porthos were or were not in the inn. Perhaps it would not be prudent to ask at once what had become of the Musketeer. The result of these reflections was that d\u2019Artagnan, without asking information of any kind, alighted, commended the horses to the care of his lackey, entered a small room destined to receive those who wished to be alone, and desired the host to bring him a bottle of his best wine and as good a breakfast as possible--a desire which further corroborated the high opinion the innkeeper had formed of the traveler at first sight. D\u2019Artagnan was therefore served with miraculous celerity. The regiment of the Guards was recruited among the first gentlemen of the kingdom; and d\u2019Artagnan, followed by a lackey, and traveling with four magnificent horses, despite the simplicity of his uniform, could not fail to make a sensation."], "Believing that his mistress has abandoned him, what is Aramis about to do when D'Artagnan delivers his letter?": [" \u201cA letter which was sent to your abode in your absence, and which was given to me for you.\u201d \u201cBut from whom is that letter?\u201d \u201cOh, from some heartbroken waiting woman, some desponding GRISETTE; from Madame de Chevreuse\u2019s chambermaid, perhaps, who was obliged to return to Tours with her mistress, and who, in order to appear smart and attractive, stole some perfumed paper, and sealed her letter with a duchess\u2019s coronet.\u201d \u201cWhat do you say?\u201d \u201cHold! I must have lost it,\u201d said the young man maliciously, pretending to search for it. \u201cBut fortunately the world is a sepulcher; the men, and consequently the women, are but shadows, and love is a sentiment to which you cry, \u2018Fie! Fie!\u2019\u201d \u201cd\u2019Artagnan, d\u2019Artagnan,\u201d cried Aramis, \u201cyou are killing me!\u201d \u201cWell, here it is at last!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, as he drew the letter from his pocket. Aramis made a bound, seized the letter, read it, or rather devoured it, his countenance radiant.", " Aramis then reperused the letter, and perceived a postscript: PS. You may behave politely to the bearer, who is a count and a grandee of Spain! \u201cGolden dreams!\u201d cried Aramis. \u201cOh, beautiful life! Yes, we are young; yes, we shall yet have happy days! My love, my blood, my life! all, all, all, are thine, my adored mistress!\u201d And he kissed the letter with passion, without even vouchsafing a look at the gold which sparkled on the table. Bazin scratched at the door, and as Aramis had no longer any reason to exclude him, he bade him come in. Bazin was stupefied at the sight of the gold, and forgot that he came to announce d\u2019Artagnan, who, curious to know who the mendicant could be, came to Aramis on leaving Athos. Now, as d\u2019Artagnan used no ceremony with Aramis, seeing that Bazin forgot to announce him, he announced himself. \u201cThe devil! my dear Aramis,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cif these are the prunes that are sent to you from Tours, I beg you will make my compliments to the gardener who gathers them.\u201d \u201cYou are mistaken, friend d\u2019Artagnan,\u201d said Aramis, always on his guard; \u201cthis is from my publisher, who has just sent me the price of that poem in one-syllable verse which I began yonder.\u201d \u201cAh, indeed,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan.", " D\u2019Artagnan replied in such a manner that Kitty remained in her great delusion. Although she cried freely before deciding to transmit the letter to her mistress, she did at last so decide, which was all d\u2019Artagnan wished.

Duty likewise on its part took a portion of that precious time which was gliding away so rapidly--only they had agreed to meet once a week, about one o\u2019clock, at the residence of Athos, seeing that he, in agreement with the vow he had formed, did not pass over the threshold of his door.", " If anyone seeks a quarrel with you, shun it, were it with a child of ten years old. If you are attacked by day or by night, fight, but retreat, without shame; if you cross a bridge, feel every plank of it with your foot, lest one should give way beneath you; if you pass before a house which is being built, look up, for fear a stone should fall upon your head; if you stay out late, be always followed by your lackey, and let your lackey be armed--if, by the by, you can be sure of your lackey. Mistrust everybody, your friend, your brother, your mistress--your mistress above all.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan blushed. \u201cMy mistress above all,\u201d repeated he, mechanically; \u201cand why her rather than another?\u201d \u201cBecause a mistress is one of the cardinal\u2019s favorite means; he has not one that is more expeditious. A woman will sell you for ten pistoles, witness Delilah. You are acquainted with the Scriptures?\u201d D\u2019Artagnan thought of the appointment Mme."], "How do Athos and Grimaud attempt to punish the innkeeper who aided an attack against them?": [" \u201cAlone?\u201d asked Athos. Grimaud made the sign yes. \u201cGentlemen,\u201d said Athos, \u201cshe is alone within half a league of us, in the direction of the river.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s well,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cLead us, Grimaud.\u201d Grimaud took his course across the country, and acted as guide to the cavalcade. At the end of five hundred paces, more or less, they came to a rivulet, which they forded. By the aid of the lightning they perceived the village of Erquinheim. \u201cIs she there, Grimaud?\u201d asked Athos. Grimaud shook his head negatively. \u201cSilence, then!\u201d cried Athos. And the troop continued their route. Another flash illuminated all around them. Grimaud extended his arm, and by the bluish splendor of the fiery serpent they distinguished a little isolated house on the banks of the river, within a hundred paces of a ferry. One window was lighted. \u201cHere we are!\u201d said Athos. At this moment a man who had been crouching in a ditch jumped up and came towards them.", " D\u2019Artagnan took off his hat, and could not be persuaded to make use of his cloak. He found pleasure in feeling the water trickle over his burning brow and over his body, agitated by feverish shudders. The moment the little troop passed Goskal and were approaching the Post, a man sheltered beneath a tree detached himself from the trunk with which he had been confounded in the darkness, and advanced into the middle of the road, putting his finger on his lips. Athos recognized Grimaud. \u201cWhat\u2019s the manner?\u201d cried Athos. \u201cHas she left Armentieres?\u201d Grimaud made a sign in the affirmative. D\u2019Artagnan ground his teeth. \u201cSilence, d\u2019Artagnan!\u201d said Athos. \u201cI have charged myself with this affair. It is for me, then, to interrogate Grimaud.\u201d \u201cWhere is she?\u201d asked Athos. Grimaud extended his hands in the direction of the Lys. \u201cFar from here?\u201d asked Athos. Grimaud showed his master his forefinger bent.", " But what the devil are you about, Aramis?\u201d continued Athos. \u201cWhy, you are squeezing that letter into your pocket!\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cAthos is right, it must be burned. And yet if we burn it, who knows whether Monsieur Cardinal has not a secret to interrogate ashes?\u201d \u201cHe must have one,\u201d said Athos. \u201cWhat will you do with the letter, then?\u201d asked Porthos. \u201cCome here, Grimaud,\u201d said Athos. Grimaud rose and obeyed. \u201cAs a punishment for having spoken without permission, my friend, you will please to eat this piece of paper; then to recompense you for the service you will have rendered us, you shall afterward drink this glass of wine. First, here is the letter. Eat heartily.\u201d Grimaud smiled; and with his eyes fixed upon the glass which Athos held in his hand, he ground the paper well between his teeth and then swallowed it. \u201cBravo, Monsieur Grimaud!\u201d said Athos; \u201cand now take this. That\u2019s well.", " Grimaud put his basket on the ground and sat down with a shake of the head. Athos took a pistol from his belt, looked to see if it was properly primed, cocked it, and placed the muzzle close to Grimaud\u2019s ear. Grimaud was on his legs again as if by a spring. Athos then made him a sign to take up his basket and to walk on first. Grimaud obeyed. All that Grimaud gained by this momentary pantomime was to pass from the rear guard to the vanguard. Arrived at the bastion, the four friends turned round. More than three hundred soldiers of all kinds were assembled at the gate of the camp; and in a separate group might be distinguished M. de Busigny, the dragoon, the Swiss, and the fourth bettor. Athos took off his hat, placed it on the end of his sword, and waved it in the air. All the spectators returned him his salute, accompanying this courtesy with a loud hurrah which was audible to the four; after which all four disappeared in the bastion, whither Grimaud had preceded them."], "What does Athos drunkenly confess that he did when he discovered a Fleur-de-Lis on his wife\u2019s shoulder?": [" \u201cBah!\u201d cried Porthos. \u201cImpossible! What do you say--that she wanted to have her brother-in-law killed?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cShe was married?\u201d asked Aramis. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cAnd her husband found out that she had a fleur-de-lis on her shoulder?\u201d cried Porthos. \u201cYes.\u201d These three yeses had been pronounced by Athos, each with a sadder intonation. \u201cAnd who has seen this fleur-de-lis?\u201d inquired Aramis. \u201cd\u2019Artagnan and I. Or rather, to observe the chronological order, I and d\u2019Artagnan,\u201d replied Athos. \u201cAnd does the husband of this frightful creature still live?\u201d said Aramis. \u201cHe still lives.\u201d \u201cAre you quite sure of it?\u201d \u201cI am he.\u201d There was a moment of cold silence, during which everyone was affected according to his nature. \u201cThis time,\u201d said Athos, first breaking the silence, \u201cd\u2019Artagnan has given us an excellent program, and the letter must be written at once.\u201d \u201cThe devil! You are right, Athos,\u201d said Aramis; \u201cand it is a rather difficult matter.", " \u201cYes, yes,\u201d replied he, \u201cI perceive that plainly; but do you really believe it is she?\u201d \u201cI am sure of it.\u201d \u201cNevertheless, I confess I still doubt.\u201d \u201cBut the fleur-de-lis on her shoulder?\u201d \u201cShe is some Englishwoman who has committed a crime in France, and has been branded in consequence.\u201d \u201cAthos, she is your wife, I tell you,\u201d repeated d\u2019Artagnan; \u201conly reflect how much the two descriptions resemble each other.\u201d \u201cYes; but I should think the other must be dead, I hanged her so effectually.\u201d It was d\u2019Artagnan who now shook his head in his turn. \u201cBut in either case, what is to be done?\u201d said the young man. \u201cThe fact is, one cannot remain thus, with a sword hanging eternally over his head,\u201d said Athos. \u201cWe must extricate ourselves from this position.\u201d \u201cBut how?\u201d \u201cListen! You must try to see her, and have an explanation with her. Say to her: \u2018Peace or war! My word as a gentleman never to say anything of you, never to do anything against you; on your side, a solemn oath to remain neutral with respect to me.", " Come, come, tell me; I am dying with curiosity and uneasiness!\u201d \u201cAthos,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, getting rid of his female garments, and appearing in his shirt, \u201cprepare yourself to hear an incredible, an unheard-of story.\u201d \u201cWell, but put on this dressing gown first,\u201d said the Musketeer to his friend. D\u2019Artagnan donned the robe as quickly as he could, mistaking one sleeve for the other, so greatly was he still agitated. \u201cWell?\u201d said Athos. \u201cWell,\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan, bending his mouth to Athos\u2019s ear, and lowering his voice, \u201cMilady is marked with a FLEUR-DE-LIS upon her shoulder!\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d cried the Musketeer, as if he had received a ball in his heart. \u201cLet us see,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cAre you SURE that the OTHER is dead?\u201d \u201cTHE OTHER?\u201d said Athos, in so stifled a voice that d\u2019Artagnan scarcely heard him. \u201cYes, she of whom you told me one day at Amiens.\u201d Athos uttered a groan, and let his head sink on his hands.", " Milady let her head sink between her two hands, and tried to recall her ideas, whirling in a mortal vertigo. \u201cMy turn,\u201d said Athos, himself trembling as the lion trembles at the sight of the serpent--\u201cmy turn. I married that woman when she was a young girl; I married her in opposition to the wishes of all my family; I gave her my wealth, I gave her my name; and one day I discovered that this woman was branded--this woman was marked with a FLEUR-DE-LIS on her left shoulder.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said Milady, raising herself, \u201cI defy you to find any tribunal which pronounced that infamous sentence against me. I defy you to find him who executed it.\u201d \u201cSilence!\u201d said a hollow voice. \u201cIt is for me to reply to that!\u201d And the man in the red cloak came forward in his turn. \u201cWhat man is that? What man is that?\u201d cried Milady, suffocated by terror, her hair loosening itself, and rising above her livid countenance as if alive."], "Why does de Treville\u2019s letter about the campaign against Britain cause the four friends consternation?": [" The heart of d\u2019Artagnan swam in delirium; he marched between Athos and Porthos, pressing them tenderly. \u201cIf I am not yet a Musketeer,\u201d said he to his new friends, as he passed through the gateway of M. de Treville\u2019s hotel, \u201cat least I have entered upon my apprenticeship, haven\u2019t I?\u201d 6 HIS MAJESTY KING LOUIS XIII This affair made a great noise. M. de Treville scolded his Musketeers in public, and congratulated them in private; but as no time was to be lost in gaining the king, M. de Treville hastened to report himself at the Louvre. It was already too late. The king was closeted with the cardinal, and M. de Treville was informed that the king was busy and could not receive him at that moment. In the evening M. de Treville attended the king\u2019s gaming table. The king was winning; and as he was very avaricious, he was in an excellent humor. Perceiving M. de Treville at a distance-- \u201cCome here, Monsieur Captain,\u201d said he, \u201ccome here, that I may growl at you.", " Do you love me still?\u201d \u201cAh, madame,\u201d said Porthos, in the most melancholy tone he could assume, \u201cwhen we are about to enter upon a campaign--a campaign, in which my presentiments tell me I shall be killed--\u201d \u201cOh, don\u2019t talk of such things!\u201d cried the procurator\u2019s wife, bursting into tears. \u201cSomething whispers me so,\u201d continued Porthos, becoming more and more melancholy. \u201cRather say that you have a new love.\u201d \u201cNot so; I speak frankly to you. No object affects me; and I even feel here, at the bottom of my heart, something which speaks for you. But in fifteen days, as you know, or as you do not know, this fatal campaign is to open. I shall be fearfully preoccupied with my outfit. Then I must make a journey to see my family, in the lower part of Brittany, to obtain the sum necessary for my departure.\u201d Porthos observed a last struggle between love and avarice. \u201cAnd as,\u201d continued he, \u201cthe duchess whom you saw at the church has estates near to those of my family, we mean to make the journey together.", " In a court of justice that is called an alibi.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan found his advice prudent. He took to his heels, and was soon at M. de Treville\u2019s; but instead of going into the saloon with the rest of the crowd, he asked to be introduced to M. de Treville\u2019s office. As d\u2019Artagnan so constantly frequented the hotel, no difficulty was made in complying with his request, and a servant went to inform M. de Treville that his young compatriot, having something important to communicate, solicited a private audience. Five minutes after, M. de Treville was asking d\u2019Artagnan what he could do to serve him, and what caused his visit at so late an hour. \u201cPardon me, monsieur,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, who had profited by the moment he had been left alone to put back M. de Treville\u2019s clock three-quarters of an hour, \u201cbut I thought, as it was yet only twenty-five minutes past nine, it was not too late to wait upon you.\u201d \u201cTwenty-five minutes past nine!\u201d cried M. de Treville, looking at the clock; \u201cwhy, that\u2019s impossible!\u201d \u201cLook, rather, monsieur,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cthe clock shows it.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d said M. de Treville; \u201cI believed it later.", " D\u2019Artagnan profited by the circumstance to speak to M. de Treville of the letter with the great red seal and the cardinal\u2019s arms. It is well understood that he did not breathe a word about the other. M de Treville approved of the resolution he had adopted, and assured him that if on the morrow he did not appear, he himself would undertake to find him, let him be where he might. At this moment the clock of La Samaritaine struck six; the four friends pleaded an engagement, and took leave of M. de Treville. A short gallop brought them to the road of Chaillot; the day began to decline, carriages were passing and repassing. D\u2019Artagnan, keeping at some distance from his friends, darted a scrutinizing glance into every carriage that appeared, but saw no face with which he was acquainted. At length, after waiting a quarter of an hour and just as twilight was beginning to thicken, a carriage appeared, coming at a quick pace on the road of Sevres."], "On whose behalf does D'Artagnan intercede in an argument with Lord de Winter?": [" My affianced husband returned. \u201c\u2018Hear me,\u2019 said he; \u2018this man has gone, and for the moment has consequently escaped my vengeance; but let us be united, as we were to have been, and then leave it to Lord de Winter to maintain his own honor and that of his wife.\u2019\u201d \u201cLord de Winter!\u201d cried Felton. \u201cYes,\u201d said Milady, \u201cLord de Winter; and now you can understand it all, can you not?

Milady appeared to have entirely recovered. She told d\u2019Artagnan that Lord de Winter was her brother-in-law, and not her brother. She had married a younger brother of the family, who had left her a widow with one child. This child was the only heir to Lord de Winter, if Lord de Winter did not marry. All this showed d\u2019Artagnan that there was a veil which concealed something; but he could not yet see under this veil. In addition to this, after a half hour\u2019s conversation d\u2019Artagnan was convinced that Milady was his compatriot; she spoke French with an elegance and a purity that left no doubt on that head. D\u2019Artagnan was profuse in gallant speeches and protestations of devotion. To all the simple things which escaped our Gascon, Milady replied with a smile of kindness. The hour came for him to retire. D\u2019Artagnan took leave of Milady, and left the saloon the happiest of men.", " Cruel enough, if I am guilty; but what name can you give it, what name will the Lord give it, if I am innocent?\u201d \u201cI am a soldier, madame, and fulfill the orders I have received.\u201d \u201cDo you believe, then, that at the day of the Last Judgment God will separate blind executioners from iniquitous judges?

Porthos paid no attention. Nevertheless, he understood it all, but was deaf. The lady with the red cushion produced a great effect--for she was very handsome--upon the lady with the black hood, who saw in her a rival really to be dreaded; a great effect upon Porthos, who thought her much prettier than the lady with the black hood; a great effect upon d\u2019Artagnan, who recognized in her the lady of Meung, of Calais, and of Dover, whom his persecutor, the man with the scar, had saluted by the name of Milady. D\u2019Artagnan, without losing sight of the lady of the red cushion, continued to watch the proceedings of Porthos, which amused him greatly. He guessed that the lady of the black hood was the procurator\u2019s wife of the Rue aux Ours, which was the more probable from the church of St. Leu being not far from that locality.", " It was plain that this mode of proceeding piqued the lady in the black hood, for she bit her lips till they bled, scratched the end of her nose, and could not sit still in her seat. Porthos, seeing this, retwisted his mustache, elongated his imperial a second time, and began to make signals to a beautiful lady who was near the choir, and who not only was a beautiful lady, but still further, no doubt, a great lady--for she had behind her a Negro boy who had brought the cushion on which she knelt, and a female servant who held the emblazoned bag in which was placed the book from which she read the Mass. The lady with the black hood followed through all their wanderings the looks of Porthos, and perceived that they rested upon the lady with the velvet cushion, the little Negro, and the maid-servant. During this time Porthos played close. It was almost imperceptible motions of his eyes, fingers placed upon the lips, little assassinating smiles, which really did assassinate the disdained beauty.", " As to Lord de Winter, he contented himself with calling the woman who waited on Milady, and when she was come, he recommended the prisoner, who was still fainting, to her care, and left them alone. Meanwhile, all things considered and notwithstanding his suspicions, as the wound might be serious, he immediately sent off a mounted man to find a physician. 58 ESCAPE As Lord de Winter had thought, Milady\u2019s wound was not dangerous. So soon as she was left alone with the woman whom the baron had summoned to her assistance she opened her eyes. It was, however, necessary to affect weakness and pain--not a very difficult task for so finished an actress as Milady. Thus the poor woman was completely the dupe of the prisoner, whom, notwithstanding her hints, she persisted in watching all night. But the presence of this woman did not prevent Milady from thinking. There was no longer a doubt that Felton was convinced; Felton was hers."], "What did D\u2019Artagnan do to cause Milady to hate him?": [" In short, it was you who have but now in this chamber, seated in this chair I now fill, made an engagement with Cardinal Richelieu to cause the Duke of Buckingham to be assassinated, in exchange for the promise he has made you to allow you to assassinate d\u2019Artagnan.\u201d Milady was livid. \u201cYou must be Satan!\u201d cried she. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d said Athos; \u201cBut at all events listen well to this. Assassinate the Duke of Buckingham, or cause him to be assassinated--I care very little about that! I don\u2019t know him. Besides, he is an Englishman. But do not touch with the tip of your finger a single hair of d\u2019Artagnan, who is a faithful friend whom I love and defend, or I swear to you by the head of my father the crime which you shall have endeavored to commit, or shall have committed, shall be the last.\u201d \u201cMonsieur d\u2019Artagnan has cruelly insulted me,\u201d said Milady, in a hollow tone; \u201cMonsieur d\u2019Artagnan shall die!\u201d \u201cIndeed!", " \u201cI saw her.\u201d \u201cAnd you know who she is?\u201d \u201cI believe I can guess, at least.\u201d \u201cListen!\u201d said Aramis. \u201cSince you appear to know so many things, can you tell me what is become of that woman?\u201d \u201cI presume that she has returned to Tours.\u201d \u201cTo Tours? Yes, that may be. You evidently know her. But why did she return to Tours without telling me anything?\u201d \u201cBecause she was in fear of being arrested.\u201d \u201cWhy has she not written to me, then?\u201d \u201cBecause she was afraid of compromising you.\u201d \u201cd\u2019Artagnan, you restore me to life!\u201d cried Aramis. \u201cI fancied myself despised, betrayed. I was so delighted to see her again! I could not have believed she would risk her liberty for me, and yet for what other cause could she have returned to Paris?\u201d \u201cFor the cause which today takes us to England.\u201d \u201cAnd what is this cause?\u201d demanded Aramis. \u201cOh, you\u2019ll know it someday, Aramis; but at present I must imitate the discretion of \u2018the doctor\u2019s niece.\u2019\u201d Aramis smiled, as he remembered the tale he had told his friends on a certain evening.", " It must, however, be confessed in his justification that the first use he made of his influence over Kitty was to try and find out what had become of Mme. Bonacieux; but the poor girl swore upon the crucifix to d\u2019Artagnan that she was entirely ignorant on that head, her mistress never admitting her into half her secrets--only she believed she could say she was not dead. As to the cause which was near making Milady lose her credit with the cardinal, Kitty knew nothing about it; but this time d\u2019Artagnan was better informed than she was. As he had seen Milady on board a vessel at the moment he was leaving England, he suspected that it was, almost without a doubt, on account of the diamond studs. But what was clearest in all this was that the true hatred, the profound hatred, the inveterate hatred of Milady, was increased by his not having killed her brother-in-law. D\u2019Artagnan came the next day to Milady\u2019s, and finding her in a very ill-humor, had no doubt that it was lack of an answer from M. de Wardes that provoked her thus.", " I do not know that.\u201d \u201cAnd did my husband know I had been carried off?\u201d \u201cHe was informed of it by a letter, written to him by the abductor himself.\u201d \u201cAnd does he suspect,\u201d said Mme. Bonacieux, with some embarrassment, \u201cthe cause of this event?\u201d \u201cHe attributed it, I believe, to a political cause.\u201d \u201cI doubted from the first; and now I think entirely as he does. Then my dear Monsieur Bonacieux has not suspected me a single instant?\u201d \u201cSo far from it, madame, he was too proud of your prudence, and above all, of your love.\u201d A second smile, almost imperceptible, stole over the rosy lips of the pretty young woman. \u201cBut,\u201d continued d\u2019Artagnan, \u201chow did you escape?\u201d \u201cI took advantage of a moment when they left me alone; and as I had known since morning the reason of my abduction, with the help of the sheets I let myself down from the window. Then, as I believed my husband would be at home, I hastened hither.\u201d \u201cTo place yourself under his protection?\u201d \u201cOh, no, poor dear man!"], "Why does Kitty help D\u2019Artagnan intercept Milady\u2019s correspondence with the Comte de Wardes?": [" Finally, as the hour for her interview with the count approached, Milady had everything about her darkened, and ordered Kitty to return to her own chamber, and introduce de Wardes whenever he presented himself. Kitty\u2019s detention was not long. Hardly had d\u2019Artagnan seen, through a crevice in his closet, that the whole apartment was in obscurity, than he slipped out of his concealment, at the very moment when Kitty reclosed the door of communication. \u201cWhat is that noise?\u201d demanded Milady. \u201cIt is I,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan in a subdued voice, \u201cI, the Comte de Wardes.\u201d \u201cOh, my God, my God!\u201d murmured Kitty, \u201che has not even waited for the hour he himself named!\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Milady, in a trembling voice, \u201cwhy do you not enter? Count, Count,\u201d added she, \u201cyou know that I wait for you.\u201d At this appeal d\u2019Artagnan drew Kitty quietly away, and slipped into the chamber. If rage or sorrow ever torture the heart, it is when a lover receives under a name which is not his own protestations of love addressed to his happy rival.", " Kitty came in, but Milady was very cross with her. The poor girl ventured a glance at d\u2019Artagnan which said, \u201cSee how I suffer on your account!\u201d Toward the end of the evening, however, the beautiful lioness became milder; she smilingly listened to the soft speeches of d\u2019Artagnan, and even gave him her hand to kiss. D\u2019Artagnan departed, scarcely knowing what to think, but as he was a youth who did not easily lose his head, while continuing to pay his court to Milady, he had framed a little plan in his mind. He found Kitty at the gate, and, as on the preceding evening, went up to her chamber. Kitty had been accused of negligence and severely scolded. Milady could not at all comprehend the silence of the Comte de Wardes, and she ordered Kitty to come at nine o\u2019clock in the morning to take a third letter. D\u2019Artagnan made Kitty promise to bring him that letter on the following morning. The poor girl promised all her lover desired; she was mad.", " This letter was in Milady\u2019s handwriting; only this time it was addressed to M. d\u2019Artagnan, and not to M. de Wardes. He opened it and read as follows: Dear M. d\u2019Artagnan, It is wrong thus to neglect your friends, particularly at the moment you are about to leave them for so long a time. My brother-in-law and myself expected you yesterday and the day before, but in vain. Will it be the same this evening? Your very grateful, Milady Clarik \u201cThat\u2019s all very simple,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cI expected this letter. My credit rises by the fall of that of the Comte de Wardes.\u201d \u201cAnd will you go?\u201d asked Kitty. \u201cListen to me, my dear girl,\u201d said the Gascon, who sought for an excuse in his own eyes for breaking the promise he had made Athos; \u201cyou must understand it would be impolitic not to accept such a positive invitation. Milady, not seeing me come again, would not be able to understand what could cause the interruption of my visits, and might suspect something; who could say how far the vengeance of such a woman would go?\u201d \u201cOh, my God!\u201d said Kitty, \u201cyou know how to represent things in such a way that you are always in the right.", " But at the first word the young woman started, and exclaimed in a sharp, bantering tone, which sounded strangely in the darkness, \u201cAre you afraid, dear Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan?\u201d \u201cYou cannot think so, dear love!\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cbut now, suppose this poor Comte de Wardes were less guilty than you think him?\u201d \u201cAt all events,\u201d said Milady, seriously, \u201che has deceived me, and from the moment he deceived me, he merited death.\u201d \u201cHe shall die, then, since you condemn him!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, in so firm a tone that it appeared to Milady an undoubted proof of devotion. This reassured her. We cannot say how long the night seemed to Milady, but d\u2019Artagnan believed it to be hardly two hours before the daylight peeped through the window blinds, and invaded the chamber with its paleness. Seeing d\u2019Artagnan about to leave her, Milady recalled his promise to avenge her on the Comte de Wardes. \u201cI am quite ready,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cbut in the first place I should like to be certain of one thing.\u201d \u201cAnd what is that?\u201d asked Milady."], "Who does Milady make D\u2019Artagnan promise to kill?": [" I have known you four days; I have loved him four years. I therefore may hesitate between you. Be not alarmed at what I say; I want to be convinced. Tonight, after twelve, I will come and see you, and you shall convince me.\u201d \u201cNo, Felton, no, my brother,\u201d said she; \u201cthe sacrifice is too great, and I feel what it must cost you. No, I am lost; do not be lost with me. My death will be much more eloquent than my life, and the silence of the corpse will convince you much better than the words of the prisoner.\u201d \u201cBe silent, madame,\u201d cried Felton, \u201cand do not speak to me thus; I came to entreat you to promise me upon your honor, to swear to me by what you hold most sacred, that you will make no attempt upon your life.\u201d \u201cI will not promise,\u201d said Milady, \u201cfor no one has more respect for a promise or an oath than I have; and if I make a promise I must keep it.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Felton, \u201conly promise till you have seen me again.", " But at the first word the young woman started, and exclaimed in a sharp, bantering tone, which sounded strangely in the darkness, \u201cAre you afraid, dear Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan?\u201d \u201cYou cannot think so, dear love!\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cbut now, suppose this poor Comte de Wardes were less guilty than you think him?\u201d \u201cAt all events,\u201d said Milady, seriously, \u201che has deceived me, and from the moment he deceived me, he merited death.\u201d \u201cHe shall die, then, since you condemn him!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, in so firm a tone that it appeared to Milady an undoubted proof of devotion.

He even opened his mouth to tell Milady who he was, and with what a revengeful purpose he had come; but she added, \u201cPoor angel, whom that monster of a Gascon barely failed to kill.\u201d The monster was himself. \u201cOh,\u201d continued Milady, \u201cdo your wounds still make you suffer?\u201d \u201cYes, much,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, who did not well know how to answer. \u201cBe tranquil,\u201d murmured Milady; \u201cI will avenge you--and cruelly!\u201d \u201cPESTE!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan to himself, \u201cthe moment for confidences has not yet come.\u201d It took some time for d\u2019Artagnan to resume this little dialogue; but then all the ideas of vengeance which he had brought with him had completely vanished. This woman exercised over him an unaccountable power; he hated and adored her at the same time. He would not have believed that two sentiments so opposite could dwell in the same heart, and by their union constitute a passion so strange, and as it were, diabolical.", " To you--my preserver, perhaps! One minute that knife, one minute, a single minute, and I will restore it to you through the grating of the door. Only one minute, Mr. Felton, and you will have saved my honor!\u201d \u201cTo kill yourself?\u201d cried Felton, with terror, forgetting to withdraw his hands from the hands of the prisoner, \u201cto kill yourself?\u201d \u201cI have told, sir,\u201d murmured Milady, lowering her voice, and allowing herself to sink overpowered to the ground; \u201cI have told my secret! He knows all! My God, I am lost!\u201d Felton remained standing, motionless and undecided. \u201cHe still doubts,\u201d thought Milady; \u201cI have not been earnest enough.\u201d Someone was heard in the corridor; Milady recognized the step of Lord de Winter. Felton recognized it also, and made a step toward the door. Milady sprang toward him. \u201cOh, not a word,\u201d said she in a concentrated voice, \u201cnot a word of all that I have said to you to this man, or I am lost, and it would be you--you--\u201d Then as the steps drew near, she became silent for fear of being heard, applying, with a gesture of infinite terror, her beautiful hand to Felton\u2019s mouth."], "In the wake of D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s horrifying encounter with Milady, who do D\u2019Artagnan and Athos believe her to be?": [" Two hours thus glided away. When the transports of the two lovers were calmer, Milady, who had not the same motives for forgetfulness that d\u2019Artagnan had, was the first to return to reality, and asked the young man if the means which were on the morrow to bring on the encounter between him and de Wardes were already arranged in his mind. But d\u2019Artagnan, whose ideas had taken quite another course, forgot himself like a fool, and answered gallantly that it was too late to think about duels and sword thrusts. This coldness toward the only interests that occupied her mind terrified Milady, whose questions became more pressing. Then d\u2019Artagnan, who had never seriously thought of this impossible duel, endeavored to turn the conversation; but he could not succeed. Milady kept him within the limits she had traced beforehand with her irresistible spirit and her iron will. D\u2019Artagnan fancied himself very cunning when advising Milady to renounce, by pardoning de Wardes, the furious projects she had formed.", " He then returned to the captain, said a few words to him, and as if from that moment the vessel was under his command, he ordered a maneuver which the crew executed immediately. Then the vessel resumed its course, still escorted by the little cutter, which sailed side by side with it, menacing it with the mouths of its six cannon. The boat followed in the wake of the ship, a speck near the enormous mass. During the examination of Milady by the officer, as may well be imagined, Milady on her part was not less scrutinizing in her glances. But however great was the power of this woman with eyes of flame in reading the hearts of those whose secrets she wished to divine, she met this time with a countenance of such impassivity that no discovery followed her investigation. The officer who had stopped in front of her and studied her with so much care might have been twenty-five or twenty-six years of age.", " He was not deceived; it was she whom he sought. At this moment a horse neighed. Milady raised her head, saw close to the panes the pale face of Athos, and screamed. Athos, perceiving that she knew him, pushed the window with his knee and hand. The window yielded. The squares were broken to shivers; and Athos, like the spectre of vengeance, leaped into the room. Milady rushed to the door and opened it. More pale and menacing than Athos, d\u2019Artagnan stood on the threshold. Milady recoiled, uttering a cry. D\u2019Artagnan, believing she might have means of flight and fearing she should escape, drew a pistol from his belt; but Athos raised his hand. \u201cPut back that weapon, d\u2019Artagnan!\u201d said he; \u201cthis woman must be tried, not assassinated. Wait an instant, my friend, and you shall be satisfied. Come in, gentlemen.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan obeyed; for Athos had the solemn voice and the powerful gesture of a judge sent by the Lord himself.", " \u201cThe secret is,\u201d said Athos, \u201cthat I saw Milady last night.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan was lifting a glass to his lips; but at the name of Milady, his hand trembled so, that he was obliged to put the glass on the ground again for fear of spilling the contents.\u201d \u201cYou saw your wi--\u201d \u201cHush!\u201d interrupted Athos. \u201cYou forget, my dear, you forget that these gentlemen are not initiated into my family affairs like yourself. I have seen Milady.\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d demanded d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cWithin two leagues of this place, at the inn of the Red Dovecot.\u201d \u201cIn that case I am lost,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cNot so bad yet,\u201d replied Athos; \u201cfor by this time she must have quit the shores of France.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan breathed again. \u201cBut after all,\u201d asked Porthos, \u201cwho is Milady?\u201d \u201cA charming woman!\u201d said Athos, sipping a glass of sparkling wine. \u201cVillainous host!\u201d cried he, \u201che has given us Anjou wine instead of champagne, and fancies we know no better!"], "What do D\u2019Artagnan and Athos pawn to buy equipment?": [" I took the mule and the horse for what he owed us; he assured me that they were two noble steeds.\u201d \u201cWell, madame,\u201d said Porthos, \u201cif he owed you more than five crowns, your horsedealer is a thief.\u201d \u201cThere is no harm in trying to buy things cheap, Monsieur Porthos,\u201d said the procurator\u2019s wife, seeking to excuse herself. \u201cNo, madame; but they who so assiduously try to buy things cheap ought to permit others to seek more generous friends.\u201d And Porthos, turning on his heel, made a step to retire. \u201cMonsieur Porthos! Monsieur Porthos!\u201d cried the procurator\u2019s wife. \u201cI have been wrong; I see it. I ought not to have driven a bargain when it was to equip a cavalier like you.\u201d Porthos, without reply, retreated a second step. The procurator\u2019s wife fancied she saw him in a brilliant cloud, all surrounded by duchesses and marchionesses, who cast bags of money at his feet. \u201cStop, in the name of heaven, Monsieur Porthos!\u201d cried she.", " An instant afterward the three young men separated, agreeing to meet again at four o\u2019clock with Athos, and leaving Planchet to guard the house. Aramis returned home, and Athos and d\u2019Artagnan busied themselves about pledging the sapphire. As the Gascon had foreseen, they easily obtained three hundred pistoles on the ring. Still further, the Jew told them that if they would sell it to him, as it would make a magnificent pendant for earrings, he would give five hundred pistoles for it. Athos and d\u2019Artagnan, with the activity of two soldiers and the knowledge of two connoisseurs, hardly required three hours to purchase the entire equipment of the Musketeer. Besides, Athos was very easy, and a noble to his fingers\u2019 ends. When a thing suited him he paid the price demanded, without thinking to ask for any abatement. D\u2019Artagnan would have remonstrated at this; but Athos put his hand upon his shoulder, with a smile, and d\u2019Artagnan understood that it was all very well for such a little Gascon gentleman as himself to drive a bargain, but not for a man who had the bearing of a prince.", " \u201cWell,\u201d said Porthos, \u201cI will run to the hotel, and engage our comrades to hold themselves in readiness by eight o\u2019clock; the rendezvous, the Place du Palais-Cardinal. Meantime, you see that the lackeys saddle the horses.\u201d \u201cI have no horse,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cbut that is of no consequence, I can take one of Monsieur de Treville\u2019s.\u201d \u201cThat is not worth while,\u201d said Aramis, \u201cyou can have one of mine.\u201d \u201cOne of yours! how many have you, then?\u201d asked d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cThree,\u201d replied Aramis, smiling. \u201cCertes,\u201d cried Athos, \u201cyou are the best-mounted poet of France or Navarre.\u201d \u201cWell, my dear Aramis, you don\u2019t want three horses? I cannot comprehend what induced you to buy three!\u201d \u201cTherefore I only purchased two,\u201d said Aramis. \u201cThe third, then, fell from the clouds, I suppose?\u201d \u201cNo, the third was brought to me this very morning by a groom out of livery, who would not tell me in whose service he was, and who said he had received orders from his master.\u201d \u201cOr his mistress,\u201d interrupted d\u2019Artagnan.", " Ah! no, we were mistaken; he had discovered a purchaser for his diamond. The breakfast at M. de Treville\u2019s was as gay and cheerful as possible. D\u2019Artagnan already wore his uniform--for being nearly of the same size as Aramis, and as Aramis was so liberally paid by the publisher who purchased his poem as to allow him to buy everything double, he sold his friend a complete outfit. D\u2019Artagnan would have been at the height of his wishes if he had not constantly seen Milady like a dark cloud hovering in the horizon. After breakfast, it was agreed that they should meet again in the evening at Athos\u2019s lodging, and there finish their plans. D\u2019Artagnan passed the day in exhibiting his Musketeer\u2019s uniform in every street of the camp. In the evening, at the appointed hour, the four friends met. There only remained three things to decide--what they should write to Milady\u2019s brother; what they should write to the clever person at Tours; and which should be the lackeys to carry the letters."], "What remains ambiguous to D\u2019Artagnan after his brief meeting with Madame Bonacieux on the bridge?": [" That brave and unfortunate Athos was wounded on that very shoulder against which I must run head foremost, like a ram. The only thing that astonishes me is that he did not strike me dead at once. He had good cause to do so; the pain I gave him must have been atrocious. As to Porthos--oh, as to Porthos, faith, that\u2019s a droll affair!\u201d And in spite of himself, the young man began to laugh aloud, looking round carefully, however, to see that his solitary laugh, without a cause in the eyes of passers-by, offended no one. \u201cAs to Porthos, that is certainly droll; but I am not the less a giddy fool. Are people to be run against without warning? No! And have I any right to go and peep under their cloaks to see what is not there? He would have pardoned me, he would certainly have pardoned me, if I had not said anything to him about that cursed baldric--in ambiguous words, it is true, but rather drolly ambiguous.", " \u201cWell, then it appears that we are the Croesuses of the society. How much have you left of your hundred pistoles, d\u2019Artagnan?\u201d \u201cOf my hundred pistoles? Why, in the first place I gave you fifty.\u201d \u201cYou think so?\u201d \u201cPARDIEU!\u201d \u201cAh, that is true. I recollect.\u201d \u201cThen I paid the host six.\u201d \u201cWhat a brute of a host! Why did you give him six pistoles?\u201d \u201cYou told me to give them to him.\u201d \u201cIt is true; I am too good-natured. In brief, how much remains?\u201d \u201cTwenty-five pistoles,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cAnd I,\u201d said Athos, taking some small change from his pocket, \u201cI--\u201d \u201cYou? Nothing!\u201d \u201cMy faith! So little that it is not worth reckoning with the general stock.\u201d \u201cNow, then, let us calculate how much we posses in all.\u201d \u201cPorthos?\u201d \u201cThirty crowns.\u201d \u201cAramis?\u201d \u201cTen pistoles.\u201d \u201cAnd you, d\u2019Artagnan?\u201d \u201cTwenty-five.\u201d \u201cThat makes in all?\u201d said Athos. \u201cFour hundred and seventy-five livres,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, who reckoned like Archimedes.", " Besides, how is it possible to avoid a little condescension toward a husband whose pretty wife has appointed a meeting with you that same evening at St. Cloud, opposite D\u2019Estrees\u2019s pavilion? D\u2019Artagnan approached him with the most amiable air he could assume. The conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor man. M. Bonacieux, who was ignorant that d\u2019Artagnan had overheard his conversation with the stranger of Meung, related to his young tenant the persecutions of that monster, M. de Laffemas, whom he never ceased to designate, during his account, by the title of the \u201ccardinal\u2019s executioner,\u201d and expatiated at great length upon the Bastille, the bolts, the wickets, the dungeons, the gratings, the instruments of torture. D\u2019Artagnan listened to him with exemplary complaisance, and when he had finished said, \u201cAnd Madame Bonacieux, do you know who carried her off?--For I do not forget that I owe to that unpleasant circumstance the good fortune of having made your acquaintance.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d said Bonacieux, \u201cthey took good care not to tell me that; and my wife, on her part, has sworn to me by all that\u2019s sacred that she does not know.", " \u201cYour affair is not bad,\u201d said Athos, after having tasted like a connoisseur and indicated by a nod of his head that he thought the wine good; \u201cand one may draw fifty or sixty pistoles from this good man. Then there only remains to ascertain whether these fifty or sixty pistoles are worth the risk of four heads.\u201d \u201cBut observe,\u201d cried d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cthat there is a woman in the affair--a woman carried off, a woman who is doubtless threatened, tortured perhaps, and all because she is faithful to her mistress.\u201d \u201cBeware, d\u2019Artagnan, beware,\u201d said Aramis. \u201cYou grow a little too warm, in my opinion, about the fate of Madame Bonacieux. Woman was created for our destruction, and it is from her we inherit all our miseries.\u201d At this speech of Aramis, the brow of Athos became clouded and he bit his lips. \u201cIt is not Madame Bonacieux about whom I am anxious,\u201d cried d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cbut the queen, whom the king abandons, whom the cardinal persecutes, and who sees the heads of all her friends fall, one after the other.\u201d \u201cWhy does she love what we hate most in the world, the Spaniards and the English?\u201d \u201cSpain is her country,\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cand it is very natural that she should love the Spanish, who are the children of the same soil as herself."], "What does the Cardinal offer D\u2019Artagnan, which D\u2019Artagnan courteously declines during their meeting together?": [" \u201cPah! Where are you going?\u201d cried the two Musketeers in a breath. \u201cThe man of Meung!\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan, and disappeared. D\u2019Artagnan had more than once related to his friends his adventure with the stranger, as well as the apparition of the beautiful foreigner, to whom this man had confided some important missive. The opinion of Athos was that d\u2019Artagnan had lost his letter in the skirmish. A gentleman, in his opinion--and according to d\u2019Artagnan\u2019s portrait of him, the stranger must be a gentleman--would be incapable of the baseness of stealing a letter. Porthos saw nothing in all this but a love meeting, given by a lady to a cavalier, or by a cavalier to a lady, which had been disturbed by the presence of d\u2019Artagnan and his yellow horse. Aramis said that as these sorts of affairs were mysterious, it was better not to fathom them. They understood, then, from the few words which escaped from d\u2019Artagnan, what affair was in hand, and as they thought that overtaking his man, or losing sight of him, d\u2019Artagnan would return to his rooms, they kept on their way.", " One of the two Guardsmen was engaged that evening, and another the next, so the meeting was fixed for the day after that. D\u2019Artagnan, on his return, sent the twelve bottles of wine to the refreshment room of the Guards, with strict orders that great care should be taken of it; and then, on the day appointed, as the dinner was fixed for midday d\u2019Artagnan sent Planchet at nine in the morning to assist in preparing everything for the entertainment. Planchet, very proud of being raised to the dignity of landlord, thought he would make all ready, like an intelligent man; and with this view called in the assistance of the lackey of one of his master\u2019s guests, named Fourreau, and the false soldier who had tried to kill d\u2019Artagnan and who, belonging to no corps, had entered into the service of d\u2019Artagnan, or rather of Planchet, after d\u2019Artagnan had saved his life. The hour of the banquet being come, the two guards arrived, took their places, and the dishes were arranged on the table.", " D\u2019Artagnan fell at the feet of the cardinal. \u201cMonseigneur,\u201d said he, \u201cmy life is yours; henceforth dispose of it. But this favor which you bestow upon me I do not merit. I have three friends who are more meritorious and more worthy--\u201d \u201cYou are a brave youth, d\u2019Artagnan,\u201d interrupted the cardinal, tapping him familiarly on the shoulder, charmed at having vanquished this rebellious nature. \u201cDo with this commission what you will; only remember, though the name be blank, it is to you I give it.\u201d \u201cI shall never forget it,\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cYour Eminence may be certain of that.\u201d The cardinal turned and said in a loud voice, \u201cRochefort!\u201d The chevalier, who no doubt was near the door, entered immediately. \u201cRochefort,\u201d said the cardinal, \u201cyou see Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan. I receive him among the number of my friends. Greet each other, then; and be wise if you wish to preserve your heads.\u201d Rochefort and d\u2019Artagnan coolly greeted each other with their lips; but the cardinal was there, observing them with his vigilant eye.", " Mounting on the breach, with his musket in one hand and his hat in the other, he said, bowing courteously and addressing the soldiers and the pioneers, who, astonished at this apparition, stopped fifty paces from the bastion: \u201cGentlemen, a few friends and myself are about to breakfast in this bastion. Now, you know nothing is more disagreeable than being disturbed when one is at breakfast. We request you, then, if you really have business here, to wait till we have finished our repast, or to come again a short time hence; unless, which would be far better, you form the salutary resolution to quit the side of the rebels, and come and drink with us to the health of the King of France.\u201d \u201cTake care, Athos!\u201d cried d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cdon\u2019t you see they are aiming?\u201d \u201cYes, yes,\u201d said Athos; \u201cbut they are only civilians--very bad marksmen, who will be sure not to hit me.\u201d In fact, at the same instant four shots were fired, and the balls were flattened against the wall around Athos, but not one touched him."], "How does Milady attempt to kill D\u2019Artagnan before the siege of La Rochelle?": [" 41 THE SEIGE OF LA ROCHELLE The Siege of La Rochelle was one of the great political events of the reign of Louis XIII, and one of the great military enterprises of the cardinal. It is, then, interesting and even necessary that we should say a few words about it, particularly as many details of this siege are connected in too important a manner with the story we have undertaken to relate to allow us to pass it over in silence. The political plans of the cardinal when he undertook this siege were extensive. Let us unfold them first, and then pass on to the private plans which perhaps had not less influence upon his Eminence than the others. Of the important cities given up by Henry IV to the Huguenots as places of safety, there only remained La Rochelle. It became necessary, therefore, to destroy this last bulwark of Calvinism--a dangerous leaven with which the ferments of civil revolt and foreign war were constantly mingling.", " 42 THE ANJOU WINE After the most disheartening news of the king\u2019s health, a report of his convalescence began to prevail in the camp; and as he was very anxious to be in person at the siege, it was said that as soon as he could mount a horse he would set forward. Meantime, Monsieur, who knew that from one day to the other he might expect to be removed from his command by the Duc d\u2019Angouleme, by Bassompierre, or by Schomberg, who were all eager for his post, did but little, lost his days in wavering, and did not dare to attempt any great enterprise to drive the English from the Isle of Re, where they still besieged the citadel St. Martin and the fort of La Pree, as on their side the French were besieging La Rochelle. D\u2019Artagnan, as we have said, had become more tranquil, as always happens after a past danger, particularly when the danger seems to have vanished. He only felt one uneasiness, and that was at not hearing any tidings from his friends.", " \u201cMy poor friend, I had forgotten you were in love.\u201d \u201cWell, but,\u201d said Aramis, \u201chave you not learned by the letter you found on the wretched corpse that she is in a convent? One may be very comfortable in a convent; and as soon as the siege of La Rochelle is terminated, I promise you on my part--\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d cried Athos, \u201cgood! Yes, my dear Aramis, we all know that your views have a religious tendency.\u201d \u201cI am only temporarily a Musketeer,\u201d said Aramis, humbly. \u201cIt is some time since we heard from his mistress,\u201d said Athos, in a low voice. \u201cBut take no notice; we know all about that.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Porthos, \u201cit appears to me that the means are very simple.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d asked d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cYou say she is in a convent?\u201d replied Porthos. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cVery well. As soon as the siege is over, we\u2019ll carry her off from that convent.\u201d \u201cBut we must first learn what convent she is in.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d said Porthos.", " Spaniards, Englishmen, and Italian malcontents, adventurers of all nations, and soldiers of fortune of every sect, flocked at the first summons under the standard of the Protestants, and organized themselves like a vast association, whose branches diverged freely over all parts of Europe. La Rochelle, which had derived a new importance from the ruin of the other Calvinist cities, was, then, the focus of dissensions and ambition. Moreover, its port was the last in the kingdom of France open to the English, and by closing it against England, our eternal enemy, the cardinal completed the work of Joan of Arc and the Duc de Guise. Thus Bassompierre, who was at once Protestant and Catholic--Protestant by conviction and Catholic as commander of the order of the Holy Ghost; Bassompierre, who was a German by birth and a Frenchman at heart--in short, Bassompierre, who had a distinguished command at the siege of La Rochelle, said, in charging at the head of several other Protestant nobles like himself, \u201cYou will see, gentlemen, that we shall be fools enough to take La Rochelle.\u201d And Bassompierre was right."], "What does Athos steal from Milady after confronting her about her attempts to kill D\u2019Artagnan?": [" It was evident that the cardinal was weighing beforehand the terms in which he was about to speak, and that Milady was collecting all her intellectual faculties to comprehend the things he was about to say, and to engrave them in her memory when they should be spoken. Athos took advantage of this moment to tell his two companions to fasten the door inside, and to make them a sign to come and listen with him. The two Musketeers, who loved their ease, brought a chair for each of themselves and one for Athos. All three then sat down with their heads together and their ears on the alert. \u201cYou will go to London,\u201d continued the cardinal. \u201cArrived in London, you will seek Buckingham.\u201d \u201cI must beg your Eminence to observe,\u201d said Milady, \u201cthat since the affair of the diamond studs, about which the duke always suspected me, his Grace distrusts me.\u201d \u201cWell, this time,\u201d said the cardinal, \u201cit is not necessary to steal his confidence, but to present yourself frankly and loyally as a negotiator.\u201d \u201cFrankly and loyally,\u201d repeated Milady, with an unspeakable expression of duplicity.", " He was not deceived; it was she whom he sought. At this moment a horse neighed. Milady raised her head, saw close to the panes the pale face of Athos, and screamed. Athos, perceiving that she knew him, pushed the window with his knee and hand. The window yielded. The squares were broken to shivers; and Athos, like the spectre of vengeance, leaped into the room. Milady rushed to the door and opened it. More pale and menacing than Athos, d\u2019Artagnan stood on the threshold. Milady recoiled, uttering a cry. D\u2019Artagnan, believing she might have means of flight and fearing she should escape, drew a pistol from his belt; but Athos raised his hand. \u201cPut back that weapon, d\u2019Artagnan!\u201d said he; \u201cthis woman must be tried, not assassinated. Wait an instant, my friend, and you shall be satisfied. Come in, gentlemen.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan obeyed; for Athos had the solemn voice and the powerful gesture of a judge sent by the Lord himself.", " At the noise he made in pushing the bolt, Milady turned round. Athos was standing before the door, enveloped in his cloak, with his hat pulled down over his eyes. On seeing this figure, mute and immovable as a statue, Milady was frightened. \u201cWho are you, and what do you want?\u201d cried she. \u201cHumph,\u201d murmured Athos, \u201cit is certainly she!\u201d And letting fall his cloak and raising his hat, he advanced toward Milady. \u201cDo you know me, madame?\u201d said he. Milady made one step forward, and then drew back as if she had seen a serpent. \u201cSo far, well,\u201d said Athos, \u201cI perceive you know me.\u201d \u201cThe Comte de la Fere!\u201d murmured Milady, becoming exceedingly pale, and drawing back till the wall prevented her from going any farther. \u201cYes, Milady,\u201d replied Athos; \u201cthe Comte de la Fere in person, who comes expressly from the other world to have the pleasure of paying you a visit. Sit down, madame, and let us talk, as the cardinal said.\u201d Milady, under the influence of inexpressible terror, sat down without uttering a word.", " To you--my preserver, perhaps! One minute that knife, one minute, a single minute, and I will restore it to you through the grating of the door. Only one minute, Mr. Felton, and you will have saved my honor!\u201d \u201cTo kill yourself?\u201d cried Felton, with terror, forgetting to withdraw his hands from the hands of the prisoner, \u201cto kill yourself?\u201d \u201cI have told, sir,\u201d murmured Milady, lowering her voice, and allowing herself to sink overpowered to the ground; \u201cI have told my secret! He knows all! My God, I am lost!\u201d Felton remained standing, motionless and undecided. \u201cHe still doubts,\u201d thought Milady; \u201cI have not been earnest enough.\u201d Someone was heard in the corridor; Milady recognized the step of Lord de Winter. Felton recognized it also, and made a step toward the door. Milady sprang toward him. \u201cOh, not a word,\u201d said she in a concentrated voice, \u201cnot a word of all that I have said to you to this man, or I am lost, and it would be you--you--\u201d Then as the steps drew near, she became silent for fear of being heard, applying, with a gesture of infinite terror, her beautiful hand to Felton\u2019s mouth."], "How long does Athos bet that he and his friends can hold the Saint Gervais Fort alone?": [" You cursed host! a dripping pan immediately, that I may not lose a drop of the fat of this estimable bird.\u201d \u201cYou was right,\u201d said the Swiss; \u201cgoose grease is kood with basdry.\u201d \u201cThere!\u201d said the dragoon. \u201cNow for the wager! We listen, Monsieur Athos.\u201d \u201cYes, the wager!\u201d said the light-horseman. \u201cWell, Monsieur de Busigny, I will bet you,\u201d said Athos, \u201cthat my three companions, Messieurs Porthos, Aramis, and d\u2019Artagnan, and myself, will go and breakfast in the bastion St. Gervais, and we will remain there an hour, by the watch, whatever the enemy may do to dislodge us.\u201d Porthos and Aramis looked at each other; they began to comprehend. \u201cBut,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, in the ear of Athos, \u201cyou are going to get us all killed without mercy.\u201d \u201cWe are much more likely to be killed,\u201d said Athos, \u201cif we do not go.\u201d \u201cMy faith, gentlemen,\u201d said Porthos, turning round upon his chair and twisting his mustache, \u201cthat\u2019s a fair bet, I hope.\u201d \u201cI take it,\u201d said M. de Busigny; \u201cso let us fix the stake.\u201d \u201cYou are four gentlemen,\u201d said Athos, \u201cand we are four; an unlimited dinner for eight.", " 46 THE BASTION SAINT-GERVAIS On arriving at the lodgings of his three friends, d\u2019Artagnan found them assembled in the same chamber. Athos was meditating; Porthos was twisting his mustache; Aramis was saying his prayers in a charming little Book of Hours, bound in blue velvet. \u201cPardieu, gentlemen,\u201d said he. \u201cI hope what you have to tell me is worth the trouble, or else, I warn you, I will not pardon you for making me come here instead of getting a little rest after a night spent in taking and dismantling a bastion. Ah, why were you not there, gentlemen? It was warm work.\u201d \u201cWe were in a place where it was not very cold,\u201d replied Porthos, giving his mustache a twist which was peculiar to him. \u201cHush!\u201d said Athos. \u201cOh, oh!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, comprehending the slight frown of the Musketeer. \u201cIt appears there is something fresh aboard.\u201d \u201cAramis,\u201d said Athos, \u201cyou went to breakfast the day before yesterday at the inn of the Parpaillot, I believe?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cHow did you fare?\u201d \u201cFor my part, I ate but little.", " \u201cListen, Milady,\u201d said the cardinal, \u201cthe affair is important.

Their days were passed in endeavoring to catch all that was said, in observing the proceeding of the cardinal, and in looking out for all the couriers who arrived. More than once an involuntary trembling seized them when called upon for some unexpected service. They had, besides, to look constantly to their own proper safety; Milady was a phantom which, when it had once appeared to people, did not allow them to sleep very quietly. On the morning of the eighth day, Bazin, fresh as ever, and smiling, according to custom, entered the cabaret of the Parpaillot as the four friends were sitting down to breakfast, saying, as had been agreed upon: \u201cMonsieur Aramis, the answer from your cousin.\u201d The four friends exchanged a joyful glance; half of the work was done."], "After hearing of the Saint Gervais Fort adventure, what does the Cardinal authorize Monsieur de Treville to do with D\u2019Artagnan?": [" The affair was described to the messenger with all the effervescence of enthusiasm. \u201cWell?\u201d asked the cardinal, on seeing La Houdiniere return. \u201cWell, monseigneur,\u201d replied the latter, \u201cthree Musketeers and a Guardsman laid a wager with Monsieur de Busigny that they would go and breakfast in the bastion St. Gervais; and while breakfasting they held it for two hours against the enemy, and have killed I don\u2019t know how many Rochellais.\u201d \u201cDid you inquire the names of those three Musketeers?\u201d \u201cYes, monseigneur.\u201d \u201cWhat are their names?\u201d \u201cMessieurs Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.\u201d \u201cStill my three brave fellows!\u201d murmured the cardinal. \u201cAnd the Guardsman?\u201d \u201cd\u2019Artagnan.\u201d \u201cStill my young scapegrace.

The king signed the order for release, and Treville carried it away without delay. As he was about to leave the presence, the cardinal gave him a friendly smile, and said, \u201cA perfect harmony reigns, sire, between the leaders and the soldiers of your Musketeers, which must be profitable for the service and honorable to all.\u201d \u201cHe will play me some dog\u2019s trick or other, and that immediately,\u201d said Treville. \u201cOne has never the last word with such a man.

You are a hundred times too good.\u201d \u201cBegone, then, find them instantly, and let all be done tonight! Ha! But first write your request to Dessessart. Perhaps you had a spy at your heels; and your visit, if it should ever be known to the cardinal, will thus seem legitimate.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan drew up his request, and M. de Treville, on receiving it, assured him that by two o\u2019clock in the morning the four leaves of absence should be at the respective domiciles of the travelers. \u201cHave the goodness to send mine to Athos\u2019s residence. I should dread some disagreeable encounter if I were to go home.\u201d \u201cBe easy. Adieu, and a prosperous voyage. A PROPOS,\u201d said M. de Treville, calling him back. D\u2019Artagnan returned. \u201cHave you any money?\u201d D\u2019Artagnan tapped the bag he had in his pocket. \u201cEnough?\u201d asked M. de Treville.", " And yet, in all this, the cardinal had not yet said a word about the Duke of Buckingham. At this instant M. de Treville entered, cool, polite, and in irreproachable costume. Informed of what had passed by the presence of the cardinal and the alteration in the king\u2019s countenance, M. de Treville felt himself something like Samson before the Philistines. Louis XIII had already placed his hand on the knob of the door; at the noise of M. de Treville\u2019s entrance he turned round. \u201cYou arrive in good time, monsieur,\u201d said the king, who, when his passions were raised to a certain point, could not dissemble; \u201cI have learned some fine things concerning your Musketeers.\u201d \u201cAnd I,\u201d said Treville, coldly, \u201cI have some pretty things to tell your Majesty concerning these gownsmen.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d said the king, with hauteur. \u201cI have the honor to inform your Majesty,\u201d continued M. de Treville, in the same tone, \u201cthat a party of PROCUREURS, commissaries, and men of the police--very estimable people, but very inveterate, as it appears, against the uniform--have taken upon themselves to arrest in a house, to lead away through the open street, and throw into Fort l\u2019Eveque, all upon an order which they have refused to show me, one of my, or rather your Musketeers, sire, of irreproachable conduct, of an almost illustrious reputation, and whom your Majesty knows favorably, Monsieur Athos.\u201d \u201cAthos,\u201d said the king, mechanically; \u201cyes, certainly I know that name.\u201d \u201cLet your Majesty remember,\u201d said Treville, \u201cthat Monsieur Athos is the Musketeer who, in the annoying duel which you are acquainted with, had the misfortune to wound Monsieur de Cahusac so seriously."], "What does Milady have two weeks to do before Lord de Winter banishes her to a faraway island?": [" My affianced husband returned. \u201c\u2018Hear me,\u2019 said he; \u2018this man has gone, and for the moment has consequently escaped my vengeance; but let us be united, as we were to have been, and then leave it to Lord de Winter to maintain his own honor and that of his wife.\u2019\u201d \u201cLord de Winter!\u201d cried Felton. \u201cYes,\u201d said Milady, \u201cLord de Winter; and now you can understand it all, can you not? Buckingham remained nearly a year absent. A week before his return Lord de Winter died, leaving me his sole heir. Whence came the blow? God who knows all, knows without doubt; but as for me, I accuse nobody.\u201d \u201cOh, what an abyss; what an abyss!\u201d cried Felton. \u201cLord de Winter died without revealing anything to his brother. The terrible secret was to be concealed till it burst, like a clap of thunder, over the head of the guilty. Your protector had seen with pain this marriage of his elder brother with a portionless girl.", " I was sensible that I could look for no support from a man disappointed in his hopes of an inheritance. I went to France, with a determination to remain there for the rest of my life. But all my fortune is in England. Communication being closed by the war, I was in want of everything. I was then obliged to come back again. Six days ago, I landed at Portsmouth.\u201d \u201cWell?\u201d said Felton. \u201cWell; Buckingham heard by some means, no doubt, of my return. He spoke of me to Lord de Winter, already prejudiced against me, and told him that his sister-in-law was a prostitute, a branded woman. The noble and pure voice of my husband was no longer here to defend me. Lord de Winter believed all that was told him with so much the more ease that it was his interest to believe it. He caused me to be arrested, had me conducted hither, and placed me under your guard. You know the rest. The day after tomorrow he banishes me, he transports me; the day after tomorrow he exiles me among the infamous.", " \u201cAh, you fear your prisoner should escape!\u201d said she. \u201cWell, ask your worthy jailer what favor I this instant solicited of him.\u201d \u201cYou demanded a favor?\u201d said the baron, suspiciously. \u201cYes, my Lord,\u201d replied the young man, confused. \u201cAnd what favor, pray?\u201d asked Lord de Winter. \u201cA knife, which she would return to me through the grating of the door a minute after she had received it,\u201d replied Felton. \u201cThere is someone, then, concealed here whose throat this amiable lady is desirous of cutting,\u201d said de Winter, in an ironical, contemptuous tone. \u201cThere is myself,\u201d replied Milady. \u201cI have given you the choice between America and Tyburn,\u201d replied Lord de Winter. \u201cChoose Tyburn, madame. Believe me, the cord is more certain than the knife.\u201d Felton grew pale, and made a step forward, remembering that at the moment he entered Milady had a rope in her hand. \u201cYou are right,\u201d said she, \u201cI have often thought of it.\u201d Then she added in a low voice, \u201cAnd I will think of it again.\u201d Felton felt a shudder run to the marrow of his bones; probably Lord de Winter perceived this emotion.", " The conversation took a cheerful turn. Milady appeared to have entirely recovered. She told d\u2019Artagnan that Lord de Winter was her brother-in-law, and not her brother. She had married a younger brother of the family, who had left her a widow with one child. This child was the only heir to Lord de Winter, if Lord de Winter did not marry. All this showed d\u2019Artagnan that there was a veil which concealed something; but he could not yet see under this veil. In addition to this, after a half hour\u2019s conversation d\u2019Artagnan was convinced that Milady was his compatriot; she spoke French with an elegance and a purity that left no doubt on that head. D\u2019Artagnan was profuse in gallant speeches and protestations of devotion. To all the simple things which escaped our Gascon, Milady replied with a smile of kindness. The hour came for him to retire. D\u2019Artagnan took leave of Milady, and left the saloon the happiest of men."], "What is the Cardinal\u2019s aim in throwing fliers over the walls of La Rochelle?": [" 41 THE SEIGE OF LA ROCHELLE The Siege of La Rochelle was one of the great political events of the reign of Louis XIII, and one of the great military enterprises of the cardinal. It is, then, interesting and even necessary that we should say a few words about it, particularly as many details of this siege are connected in too important a manner with the story we have undertaken to relate to allow us to pass it over in silence. The political plans of the cardinal when he undertook this siege were extensive. Let us unfold them first, and then pass on to the private plans which perhaps had not less influence upon his Eminence than the others. Of the important cities given up by Henry IV to the Huguenots as places of safety, there only remained La Rochelle. It became necessary, therefore, to destroy this last bulwark of Calvinism--a dangerous leaven with which the ferments of civil revolt and foreign war were constantly mingling.", " Buckingham was their Messiah. It was evident that if they one day learned positively that they must not count on Buckingham, their courage would fail with their hope. The cardinal looked, then, with great impatience for the news from England which would announce to him that Buckingham would not come. The question of carrying the city by assault, though often debated in the council of the king, had been always rejected. In the first place, La Rochelle appeared impregnable. Then the cardinal, whatever he said, very well knew that the horror of bloodshed in this encounter, in which Frenchman would combat against Frenchman, was a retrograde movement of sixty years impressed upon his policy; and the cardinal was at that period what we now call a man of progress. In fact, the sack of La Rochelle, and the assassination of three of four thousand Huguenots who allowed themselves to be killed, would resemble too closely, in 1628, the massacre of St. Bartholomew in 1572; and then, above all this, this extreme measure, which was not at all repugnant to the king, good Catholic as he was, always fell before this argument of the besieging generals--La Rochelle is impregnable except to famine.", " He continued to press the raising of the famous dyke which was to starve La Rochelle. Meanwhile, he cast his eyes over that unfortunate city, which contained so much deep misery and so many heroic virtues, and recalling the saying of Louis XI, his political predecessor, as he himself was the predecessor of Robespierre, he repeated this maxim of Tristan\u2019s gossip: \u201cDivide in order to reign.\u201d Henry IV, when besieging Paris, had loaves and provisions thrown over the walls. The cardinal had little notes thrown over in which he represented to the Rochellais how unjust, selfish, and barbarous was the conduct of their leaders. These leaders had corn in abundance, and would not let them partake of it; they adopted as a maxim--for they, too, had maxims--that it was of very little consequence that women, children, and old men should die, so long as the men who were to defend the walls remained strong and healthy.", " Spaniards, Englishmen, and Italian malcontents, adventurers of all nations, and soldiers of fortune of every sect, flocked at the first summons under the standard of the Protestants, and organized themselves like a vast association, whose branches diverged freely over all parts of Europe. La Rochelle, which had derived a new importance from the ruin of the other Calvinist cities, was, then, the focus of dissensions and ambition. Moreover, its port was the last in the kingdom of France open to the English, and by closing it against England, our eternal enemy, the cardinal completed the work of Joan of Arc and the Duc de Guise. Thus Bassompierre, who was at once Protestant and Catholic--Protestant by conviction and Catholic as commander of the order of the Holy Ghost; Bassompierre, who was a German by birth and a Frenchman at heart--in short, Bassompierre, who had a distinguished command at the siege of La Rochelle, said, in charging at the head of several other Protestant nobles like himself, \u201cYou will see, gentlemen, that we shall be fools enough to take La Rochelle.\u201d And Bassompierre was right."], "What do the musketeers refuse to do for the Cardinal when he encounters them on the beach?": [" \u201cYou have told me the truth, my gentlemen,\u201d said he, addressing the Musketeers, \u201cand it will not be my fault if our encounter this evening be not advantageous to you. In the meantime, follow me.\u201d The cardinal alighted; the three Musketeers did likewise. The cardinal threw the bridle of his horse to his esquire; the three Musketeers fastened the horses to the shutters. The host stood at the door. For him, the cardinal was only an officer coming to visit a lady. \u201cHave you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can wait near a good fire?\u201d said the cardinal. The host opened the door of a large room, in which an old stove had just been replaced by a large and excellent chimney. \u201cI have this,\u201d said he. \u201cThat will do,\u201d replied the cardinal. \u201cEnter, gentlemen, and be kind enough to wait for me; I shall not be more than half an hour.\u201d And while the three Musketeers entered the ground floor room, the cardinal, without asking further information, ascended the staircase like a man who has no need of having his road pointed out to him.", " Sometimes when the cardinal, always on horseback, like the lowest GENDARME of the army, cast a pensive glance over those works, so slowly keeping pace with his wishes, which the engineers, brought from all the corners of France, were executing under his orders, if he met a Musketeer of the company of Treville, he drew near and looked at him in a peculiar manner, and not recognizing in him one of our four companions, he turned his penetrating look and profound thoughts in another direction. One day when oppressed with a mortal weariness of mind, without hope in the negotiations with the city, without news from England, the cardinal went out, without any other aim than to be out of doors, and accompanied only by Cahusac and La Houdiniere, strolled along the beach. Mingling the immensity of his dreams with the immensity of the ocean, he came, his horse going at a foot\u2019s pace, to a hill from the top of which he perceived behind a hedge, reclining on the sand and catching in its passage one of those rays of the sun so rare at this period of the year, seven men surrounded by empty bottles.", " The result was that even if the king\u2019s troops remained quietly in their camp, it was evident that some day or other, Buckingham, who only continued in the Isle from obstinacy, would be obliged to raise the siege. But as M. de Toiras gave information that everything was preparing in the enemy\u2019s camp for a fresh assault, the king judged that it would be best to put an end to the affair, and gave the necessary orders for a decisive action. As it is not our intention to give a journal of the siege, but on the contrary only to describe such of the events of it as are connected with the story we are relating, we will content ourselves with saying in two words that the expedition succeeded, to the great astonishment of the king and the great glory of the cardinal. The English, repulsed foot by foot, beaten in all encounters, and defeated in the passage of the Isle of Loie, were obliged to re-embark, leaving on the field of battle two thousand men, among whom were five colonels, three lieutenant colonels, two hundred and fifty captains, twenty gentlemen of rank, four pieces of cannon, and sixty flags, which were taken to Paris by Claude de St. Simon, and suspended with great pomp in the arches of Notre Dame.", " \u201cYes, yes,\u201d continued Lord de Winter, \u201cI understand. You would like very well to be at liberty on that beach! You would like very well to be in a good ship dancing upon the waves of that emerald-green sea; you would like very well, either on land or on the ocean, to lay for me one of those nice little ambuscades you are so skillful in planning. Patience, patience! In four days\u2019 time the shore will be beneath your feet, the sea will be open to you--more open than will perhaps be agreeable to you, for in four days England will be relieved of you.\u201d Milady folded her hands, and raising her fine eyes toward heaven, \u201cLord, Lord,\u201d said she, with an angelic meekness of gesture and tone, \u201cpardon this man, as I myself pardon him.\u201d \u201cYes, pray, accursed woman!\u201d cried the baron; \u201cyour prayer is so much the more generous from your being, I swear to you, in the power of a man who will never pardon you!\u201d and he went out."], "Where does Madame de Chevreuse reveal that Madame Bonacieux is being kept, in her letter to Aramis?": [" \u201cI am a faithful subject of the king, madame, and all that his Majesty commands I shall do.\u201d \u201cWell, it is true!\u201d said Anne of Austria; \u201cand the spies of the cardinal have served him faithfully. I have written a letter today; that letter is not yet gone. The letter is here.\u201d And the queen laid her beautiful hand on her bosom. \u201cThen give me that letter, madame,\u201d said the chancellor. \u201cI will give it to none but the king, monsieur,\u201d said Anne. \u201cIf the king had desired that the letter should be given to him, madame, he would have demanded it of you himself. But I repeat to you, I am charged with reclaiming it; and if you do not give it up--\u201d \u201cWell?\u201d \u201cHe has, then, charged me to take it from you.\u201d \u201cHow!

If you loved me, oh, if you loved me, that would be too great happiness, and I should run mad. Ah, Madame de Chevreuse was less cruel than you. Holland loved her, and she responded to his love.\u201d \u201cMadame de Chevreuse was not queen,\u201d murmured Anne of Austria, overcome, in spite of herself, by the expression of so profound a passion. \u201cYou would love me, then, if you were not queen! Madame, say that you would love me then! I can believe that it is the dignity of your rank alone which makes you cruel to me; I can believe that, had you been Madame de Chevreuse, poor Buckingham might have hoped. Thanks for those sweet words! Oh, my beautiful sovereign, a hundred times, thanks!\u201d \u201cOh, my Lord! You have ill understood, wrongly interpreted; I did not mean to say--\u201d \u201cSilence, silence!\u201d cried the duke. \u201cIf I am happy in an error, do not have the cruelty to lift me from it.", " \u201cMy dear fellow, be a Musketeer or an abbe. Be one or the other, but not both,\u201d replied Porthos. \u201cYou know what Athos told you the other day; you eat at everybody\u2019s mess. Ah, don\u2019t be angry, I beg of you, that would be useless; you know what is agreed upon between you, Athos and me. You go to Madame d\u2019Aguillon\u2019s, and you pay your court to her; you go to Madame de Bois-Tracy\u2019s, the cousin of Madame de Chevreuse, and you pass for being far advanced in the good graces of that lady. Oh, good Lord! Don\u2019t trouble yourself to reveal your good luck; no one asks for your secret-all the world knows your discretion. But since you possess that virtue, why the devil don\u2019t you make use of it with respect to her Majesty? Let whoever likes talk of the king and the cardinal, and how he likes; but the queen is sacred, and if anyone speaks of her, let it be respectfully.\u201d \u201cPorthos, you are as vain as Narcissus; I plainly tell you so,\u201d replied Aramis.", " \u201cA letter which was sent to your abode in your absence, and which was given to me for you.\u201d \u201cBut from whom is that letter?\u201d \u201cOh, from some heartbroken waiting woman, some desponding GRISETTE; from Madame de Chevreuse\u2019s chambermaid, perhaps, who was obliged to return to Tours with her mistress, and who, in order to appear smart and attractive, stole some perfumed paper, and sealed her letter with a duchess\u2019s coronet.\u201d \u201cWhat do you say?\u201d \u201cHold! I must have lost it,\u201d said the young man maliciously, pretending to search for it. \u201cBut fortunately the world is a sepulcher; the men, and consequently the women, are but shadows, and love is a sentiment to which you cry, \u2018Fie!

Lord de Winter himself could scarcely recognize the tigress who, a minute before, prepared apparently for a fight. \u201cShe is not to leave this chamber, understand, John,\u201d continued the baron. \u201cShe is to correspond with nobody; she is to speak to no one but you--if you will do her the honor to address a word to her.\u201d \u201cThat is sufficient, my Lord!", " Felton, in his turn a suppliant, clasped his hands. \u201cWell, then,\u201d said Milady, \u201cI confide in my brother; I will dare to--\u201d At this moment the steps of Lord de Winter were heard; but this time the terrible brother-in-law of Milady did not content himself, as on the preceding day, with passing before the door and going away again. He paused, exchanged two words with the sentinel; then the door opened, and he appeared. During the exchange of these two words Felton drew back quickly, and when Lord de Winter entered, he was several paces from the prisoner. The baron entered slowly, sending a scrutinizing glance from Milady to the young officer. \u201cYou have been here a very long time, John,\u201d said he. \u201cHas this woman been relating her crimes to you? In that case I can comprehend the length of the conversation.\u201d Felton started; and Milady felt she was lost if she did not come to the assistance of the disconcerted Puritan.", " Felton, my brother, my friend, I conjure you!\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d cried Felton, \u201cno; you shall live and you shall be avenged.\u201d \u201cFelton, I bring misfortune to all who surround me!

He found himself face to face with a sergeant commanding a watch-patrol. \u201cWell, what is the matter?\u201d asked the young lieutenant. \u201cYou told me to open the door if I heard anyone cry out,\u201d said the soldier; \u201cbut you forgot to leave me the key.", " If an angel appeared to that young man as an accuser of Milady, he would take him, in the mental disposition in which he now found himself, for a messenger sent by the devil.

Toward four o\u2019clock in the morning the doctor arrived; but since the time Milady stabbed herself, however short, the wound had closed. The doctor could therefore measure neither the direction nor the depth of it; he only satisfied himself by Milady\u2019s pulse that the case was not serious. In the morning Milady, under the pretext that she had not slept well in the night and wanted rest, sent away the woman who attended her.

Milady let one of those looks fall upon him which make a slave of a king. Felton was a Puritan; he abandoned the hand of this woman to kiss her feet. He no longer loved her; he adored her. When this crisis was past, when Milady appeared to have resumed her self-possession, which she had never lost; when Felton had seen her recover with the veil of chastity those treasures of love which were only concealed from him to make him desire them the more ardently, he said, \u201cAh, now!

Perhaps never in her life had this woman, who had experienced so many opposite and powerful emotions, felt her heart beat so violently. She was seated. Lord de Winter took a chair, drew it toward her, and sat down close beside her. Then taking a paper out of his pocket, he unfolded it slowly.", " *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE THREE MUSKETEERS, BY ALEXANDRE DUMAS, PERE *** Produced by John P.

Oh, no! I call to witness the God who hears us, that on the contrary I am a fervent Catholic!\u201d \u201cThen, madame,\u201d said the abbess, smiling, \u201cbe reassured; the house in which you are shall not be a very hard prison, and we will do all in our power to make you cherish your captivity. You will find here, moreover, the young woman of whom I spoke, who is persecuted, no doubt, in consequence of some court intrigue. She is amiable and well-behaved.\u201d \u201cWhat is her name?\u201d \u201cShe was sent to me by someone of high rank, under the name of Kitty. I have not tried to discover her other name.\u201d \u201cKitty!\u201d cried Milady. \u201cWhat? Are you sure?\u201d \u201cThat she is called so? Yes, madame. Do you know her?\u201d Milady smiled to herself at the idea which had occurred to her that this might be her old chambermaid.", " It appeared however to Milady that in one of the furtive glances she darted from time to time at the grating of the door she thought she saw the ardent eyes of the young man through the narrow opening. But whether this was reality or vision, he had this time sufficient self-command not to enter. However, a few instants after she had finished her religious song, Milady thought she heard a profound sigh. Then the same steps she had heard approach slowly withdrew, as if with regret. 55 CAPTIVITY: THE FOURTH DAY The next day, when Felton entered Milady\u2019s apartment he found her standing, mounted upon a chair, holding in her hands a cord made by means of torn cambric handkerchiefs, twisted into a kind of rope one with another, and tied at the ends. At the noise Felton made in entering, Milady leaped lightly to the ground, and tried to conceal behind her the improvised cord she held in her hand."], "What does John Felton do when Buckingham refuses to sign for Milady\u2019s release?": [" I hold this serpent in my hands. Well, I call you, and say to you: Friend Felton, John, my child, guard me, and more particularly guard yourself, against this woman. Swear, by your hopes of salvation, to keep her safely for the chastisement she has merited. John Felton, I trust your word! John Felton, I put faith in your loyalty!\u201d \u201cMy Lord,\u201d said the young officer, summoning to his mild countenance all the hatred he could find in his heart, \u201cmy Lord, I swear all shall be done as you desire.\u201d Milady received this look like a resigned victim; it was impossible to imagine a more submissive or a more mild expression than that which prevailed on her beautiful countenance. Lord de Winter himself could scarcely recognize the tigress who, a minute before, prepared apparently for a fight. \u201cShe is not to leave this chamber, understand, John,\u201d continued the baron. \u201cShe is to correspond with nobody; she is to speak to no one but you--if you will do her the honor to address a word to her.\u201d \u201cThat is sufficient, my Lord!", " Felton grew pale. \u201cAnd knowing that real name, my Lord,\u201d replied Felton, \u201cwill you sign it all the same?\u201d \u201cDoubtless,\u201d said Buckingham, \u201cand rather twice than once.\u201d \u201cI cannot believe,\u201d continued Felton, in a voice that became more sharp and rough, \u201cthat your Grace knows that it is to Milady de Winter this relates.\u201d \u201cI know it perfectly, although I am astonished that you know it.\u201d \u201cAnd will your Grace sign that order without remorse?\u201d Buckingham looked at the young man haughtily. \u201cDo you know, sir, that you are asking me very strange questions, and that I am very foolish to answer them?\u201d \u201cReply to them, my Lord,\u201d said Felton; \u201cthe circumstances are more serious than you perhaps believe.\u201d Buckingham reflected that the young man, coming from Lord de Winter, undoubtedly spoke in his name, and softened. \u201cWithout remorse,\u201d said he. \u201cThe baron knows, as well as myself, that Milady de Winter is a very guilty woman, and it is treating her very favorably to commute her punishment to transportation.\u201d The duke put his pen to the paper.", " \u201cBeware, my Lord, you are in the hands of God!\u201d \u201cIn the hands of the devil, you mean!\u201d cried Buckingham, raising his voice so as to attract the notice of his people, without absolutely shouting. \u201cSign, my Lord; sign the liberation of Milady de Winter,\u201d said Felton, holding out a paper to the duke. \u201cBy force? You are joking! Holloa, Patrick!\u201d \u201cSign, my Lord!\u201d \u201cNever.\u201d \u201cNever?\u201d \u201cHelp!\u201d shouted the duke; and at the same time he sprang toward his sword. But Felton did not give him time to draw it. He held the knife with which Milady had stabbed herself, open in his bosom; at one bound he was upon the duke. At that moment Patrick entered the room, crying, \u201cA letter from France, my Lord.\u201d \u201cFrom France!\u201d cried Buckingham, forgetting everything in thinking from whom that letter came. Felton took advantage of this moment, and plunged the knife into his side up to the handle. \u201cAh, traitor,\u201d cried Buckingham, \u201cyou have killed me!\u201d \u201cMurder!\u201d screamed Patrick.", " Felton, in his turn a suppliant, clasped his hands. \u201cWell, then,\u201d said Milady, \u201cI confide in my brother; I will dare to--\u201d At this moment the steps of Lord de Winter were heard; but this time the terrible brother-in-law of Milady did not content himself, as on the preceding day, with passing before the door and going away again. He paused, exchanged two words with the sentinel; then the door opened, and he appeared. During the exchange of these two words Felton drew back quickly, and when Lord de Winter entered, he was several paces from the prisoner. The baron entered slowly, sending a scrutinizing glance from Milady to the young officer. \u201cYou have been here a very long time, John,\u201d said he. \u201cHas this woman been relating her crimes to you? In that case I can comprehend the length of the conversation.\u201d Felton started; and Milady felt she was lost if she did not come to the assistance of the disconcerted Puritan."], "Where does Milady go when she returns to France?": [" \u201cAt what?\u201d said Milady, with the utmost ingenuousness. \u201cAt the language you use.\u201d \u201cWhat do you find so astonishing in that language?\u201d said Milady, smiling. \u201cYou are the friend of the cardinal, for he sends you hither, and yet--\u201d \u201cAnd yet I speak ill of him,\u201d replied Milady, finishing the thought of the superior. \u201cAt least you don\u2019t speak well of him.\u201d \u201cThat is because I am not his friend,\u201d said she, sighing, \u201cbut his victim!\u201d \u201cBut this letter in which he recommends you to me?\u201d \u201cIs an order for me to confine myself to a sort of prison, from which he will release me by one of his satellites.\u201d \u201cBut why have you not fled?\u201d \u201cWhither should I go? Do you believe there is a spot on the earth which the cardinal cannot reach if he takes the trouble to stretch forth his hand? If I were a man, that would barely be possible; but what can a woman do? This young boarder of yours, has she tried to fly?\u201d \u201cNo, that is true; but she--that is another thing; I believe she is detained in France by some love affair.\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d said Milady, with a sigh, \u201cif she loves she is not altogether wretched.\u201d \u201cThen,\u201d said the abbess, looking at Milady with increasing interest, \u201cI behold another poor victim?\u201d \u201cAlas, yes,\u201d said Milady.", " Milady Clarik received d\u2019Artagnan ceremoniously. Her hotel was remarkably sumptuous, and while the most part of the English had quit, or were about to quit, France on account of the war, Milady had just been laying out much money upon her residence; which proved that the general measure which drove the English from France did not affect her. \u201cYou see,\u201d said Lord de Winter, presenting d\u2019Artagnan to his sister, \u201ca young gentleman who has held my life in his hands, and who has not abused his advantage, although we have been twice enemies, although it was I who insulted him, and although I am an Englishman. Thank him, then, madame, if you have any affection for me.\u201d Milady frowned slightly; a scarcely visible cloud passed over her brow, and so peculiar a smile appeared upon her lips that the young man, who saw and observed this triple shade, almost shuddered at it. The brother did not perceive this; he had turned round to play with Milady\u2019s favorite monkey, which had pulled him by the doublet.", " In this case Milady would cross the garden and gain the village on foot. As we have already said, Milady was admirably acquainted with this part of France. If the Musketeers did not appear, things were to go on as had been agreed; Mme. Bonacieux was to get into the carriage as if to bid her adieu, and she was to take away Mme. Bonacieux. Mme. Bonacieux came in; and to remove all suspicion, if she had any, Milady repeated to the lackey, before her, the latter part of her instructions. Milady asked some questions about the carriage. It was a chaise drawn by three horses, driven by a postillion; Rochefort\u2019s lackey would precede it, as courier. Milady was wrong in fearing that Mme. Bonacieux would have any suspicion. The poor young woman was too pure to suppose that any female could be guilty of such perfidy; besides, the name of the Comtesse de Winter, which she had heard the abbess pronounce, was wholly unknown to her, and she was even ignorant that a woman had had so great and so fatal a share in the misfortune of her life.", " courage!\u201d The bell of the convent gate was sounded; Milady was not mistaken. \u201cGo to your chamber,\u201d said she to Mme. Bonacieux; \u201cyou have perhaps some jewels you would like to take.\u201d \u201cI have his letters,\u201d said she. \u201cWell, go and fetch them, and come to my apartment. We will snatch some supper; we shall perhaps travel part of the night, and must keep our strength up.\u201d \u201cGreat God!\u201d said Mme. Bonacieux, placing her hand upon her bosom, \u201cmy heart beats so I cannot walk.\u201d \u201cCourage, courage! remember that in a quarter of an hour you will be safe; and think that what you are about to do is for HIS sake.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, everything for him. You have restored my courage by a single word; go, I will rejoin you.\u201d Milady ran up to her apartment quickly; she there found Rochefort\u2019s lackey, and gave him his instructions. He was to wait at the gate; if by chance the Musketeers should appear, the carriage was to set off as fast as possible, pass around the convent, and go and wait for Milady at a little village which was situated at the other side of the wood."], "Who do we discover the \u201cMan from Meung\u201d to be when he visits Milady?": [" \u201cThere,\u201d said the young man, handing Kitty the letter sealed; \u201cgive that to Milady. It is the count\u2019s reply.\u201d Poor Kitty became as pale as death; she suspected what the letter contained. \u201cListen, my dear girl,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cyou cannot but perceive that all this must end, some way or other. Milady may discover that you gave the first billet to my lackey instead of to the count\u2019s; that it is I who have opened the others which ought to have been opened by de Wardes. Milady will then turn you out of doors, and you know she is not the woman to limit her vengeance.\u201d \u201cAlas!\u201d said Kitty, \u201cfor whom have I exposed myself to all that?\u201d \u201cFor me, I well know, my sweet girl,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cBut I am grateful, I swear to you.\u201d \u201cBut what does this note contain?\u201d \u201cMilady will tell you.\u201d \u201cAh, you do not love me!\u201d cried Kitty, \u201cand I am very wretched.\u201d To this reproach there is always one response which deludes women.", " This letter was in Milady\u2019s handwriting; only this time it was addressed to M. d\u2019Artagnan, and not to M. de Wardes. He opened it and read as follows: Dear M. d\u2019Artagnan, It is wrong thus to neglect your friends, particularly at the moment you are about to leave them for so long a time. My brother-in-law and myself expected you yesterday and the day before, but in vain. Will it be the same this evening? Your very grateful, Milady Clarik \u201cThat\u2019s all very simple,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cI expected this letter. My credit rises by the fall of that of the Comte de Wardes.\u201d \u201cAnd will you go?\u201d asked Kitty. \u201cListen to me, my dear girl,\u201d said the Gascon, who sought for an excuse in his own eyes for breaking the promise he had made Athos; \u201cyou must understand it would be impolitic not to accept such a positive invitation. Milady, not seeing me come again, would not be able to understand what could cause the interruption of my visits, and might suspect something; who could say how far the vengeance of such a woman would go?\u201d \u201cOh, my God!\u201d said Kitty, \u201cyou know how to represent things in such a way that you are always in the right.", " The abbess looked at her for an instant with uneasiness, as if a fresh thought suggested itself to her mind. \u201cYou are not an enemy of our holy faith?\u201d said she, hesitatingly. \u201cWho--I?\u201d cried Milady; \u201cI a Protestant? Oh, no! I call to witness the God who hears us, that on the contrary I am a fervent Catholic!\u201d \u201cThen, madame,\u201d said the abbess, smiling, \u201cbe reassured; the house in which you are shall not be a very hard prison, and we will do all in our power to make you cherish your captivity. You will find here, moreover, the young woman of whom I spoke, who is persecuted, no doubt, in consequence of some court intrigue. She is amiable and well-behaved.\u201d \u201cWhat is her name?\u201d \u201cShe was sent to me by someone of high rank, under the name of Kitty. I have not tried to discover her other name.\u201d \u201cKitty!\u201d cried Milady. \u201cWhat? Are you sure?\u201d \u201cThat she is called so? Yes, madame. Do you know her?\u201d Milady smiled to herself at the idea which had occurred to her that this might be her old chambermaid.", " Lord de Winter, on quitting d\u2019Artagnan, gave him his sister\u2019s address. She lived in the Place Royale--then the fashionable quarter--at Number 6, and he undertook to call and take d\u2019Artagnan with him in order to introduce him. D\u2019Artagnan appointed eight o\u2019clock at Athos\u2019s residence. This introduction to Milady Clarik occupied the head of our Gascon greatly. He remembered in what a strange manner this woman had hitherto been mixed up in his destiny. According to his conviction, she was some creature of the cardinal, and yet he felt himself invincibly drawn toward her by one of those sentiments for which we cannot account. His only fear was that Milady would recognize in him the man of Meung and of Dover. Then she knew that he was one of the friends of M. de Treville, and consequently, that he belonged body and soul to the king; which would make him lose a part of his advantage, since when known to Milady as he knew her, he played only an equal game with her."], "How does Milady kill Madame Bonacieux before leaving the convent?": [" \u201cMy poor friend, I had forgotten you were in love.\u201d \u201cWell, but,\u201d said Aramis, \u201chave you not learned by the letter you found on the wretched corpse that she is in a convent? One may be very comfortable in a convent; and as soon as the siege of La Rochelle is terminated, I promise you on my part--\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d cried Athos, \u201cgood! Yes, my dear Aramis, we all know that your views have a religious tendency.\u201d \u201cI am only temporarily a Musketeer,\u201d said Aramis, humbly. \u201cIt is some time since we heard from his mistress,\u201d said Athos, in a low voice. \u201cBut take no notice; we know all about that.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Porthos, \u201cit appears to me that the means are very simple.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d asked d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cYou say she is in a convent?\u201d replied Porthos. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cVery well. As soon as the siege is over, we\u2019ll carry her off from that convent.\u201d \u201cBut we must first learn what convent she is in.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d said Porthos.", " \u201cYes, to a convent.\u201d \u201cAnd to which?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know; the secret has been well kept.\u201d \u201cBut I will know!\u201d \u201cAnd your Eminence will tell me in what convent that woman is?\u201d \u201cI can see nothing inconvenient in that,\u201d said the cardinal. \u201cWell, now I have an enemy much more to be dreaded by me than this little Madame Bonacieux.\u201d \u201cWho is that?\u201d \u201cHer lover.\u201d \u201cWhat is his name?\u201d \u201cOh, your Eminence knows him well,\u201d cried Milady, carried away by her anger. \u201cHe is the evil genius of both of us. It is he who in an encounter with your Eminence\u2019s Guards decided the victory in favor of the king\u2019s Musketeers; it is he who gave three desperate wounds to de Wardes, your emissary, and who caused the affair of the diamond studs to fail; it is he who, knowing it was I who had Madame Bonacieux carried off, has sworn my death.\u201d \u201cAh, ah!\u201d said the cardinal, \u201cI know of whom you speak.\u201d \u201cI mean that miserable d\u2019Artagnan.\u201d \u201cHe is a bold fellow,\u201d said the cardinal.", " It was then that d\u2019Artagnan appreciated the favor the cardinal had conferred upon him in making him at last enter the Musketeers--for without that circumstance he would have been forced to remain in the camp while his companions left it. It goes without saying that this impatience to return toward Paris had for a cause the danger which Mme. Bonacieux would run of meeting at the convent of Bethune with Milady, her mortal enemy. Aramis therefore had written immediately to Marie Michon, the seamstress at Tours who had such fine acquaintances, to obtain from the queen authority for Mme. Bonacieux to leave the convent, and to retire either into Lorraine or Belgium. They had not long to wait for an answer. Eight or ten days afterward Aramis received the following letter: \u201cMy Dear Cousin, \u201cHere is the authorization from my sister to withdraw our little servant from the convent of Bethune, the air of which you think is bad for her.", " \u201cYes, you! I know you now. You are Madame Bonacieux!\u201d The young woman drew back, filled with surprise and terror. \u201cOh, do not deny it! Answer!\u201d continued Milady. \u201cWell, yes, madame,\u201d said the novice, \u201cAre we rivals?\u201d The countenance of Milady was illumined by so savage a joy that under any other circumstances Mme. Bonacieux would have fled in terror; but she was absorbed by jealousy. \u201cSpeak, madame!\u201d resumed Mme. Bonacieux, with an energy of which she might not have been believed capable. \u201cHave you been, or are you, his mistress?\u201d \u201cOh, no!\u201d cried Milady, with an accent that admitted no doubt of her truth. \u201cNever, never!\u201d \u201cI believe you,\u201d said Mme. Bonacieux; \u201cbut why, then, did you cry out so?\u201d \u201cDo you not understand?\u201d said Milady, who had already overcome her agitation and recovered all her presence of mind. \u201cHow can I understand? I know nothing.\u201d \u201cCan you not understand that Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan, being my friend, might take me into his confidence?\u201d \u201cTruly?\u201d \u201cDo you not perceive that I know all--your abduction from the little house at St. Germain, his despair, that of his friends, and their useless inquiries up to this moment?"], "What do the Musketeers do when they find Milady as she is leaving France?": [" It must, however, be confessed in his justification that the first use he made of his influence over Kitty was to try and find out what had become of Mme. Bonacieux; but the poor girl swore upon the crucifix to d\u2019Artagnan that she was entirely ignorant on that head, her mistress never admitting her into half her secrets--only she believed she could say she was not dead. As to the cause which was near making Milady lose her credit with the cardinal, Kitty knew nothing about it; but this time d\u2019Artagnan was better informed than she was. As he had seen Milady on board a vessel at the moment he was leaving England, he suspected that it was, almost without a doubt, on account of the diamond studs. But what was clearest in all this was that the true hatred, the profound hatred, the inveterate hatred of Milady, was increased by his not having killed her brother-in-law. D\u2019Artagnan came the next day to Milady\u2019s, and finding her in a very ill-humor, had no doubt that it was lack of an answer from M. de Wardes that provoked her thus.", " \u201cAt what?\u201d said Milady, with the utmost ingenuousness. \u201cAt the language you use.\u201d \u201cWhat do you find so astonishing in that language?\u201d said Milady, smiling. \u201cYou are the friend of the cardinal, for he sends you hither, and yet--\u201d \u201cAnd yet I speak ill of him,\u201d replied Milady, finishing the thought of the superior. \u201cAt least you don\u2019t speak well of him.\u201d \u201cThat is because I am not his friend,\u201d said she, sighing, \u201cbut his victim!\u201d \u201cBut this letter in which he recommends you to me?\u201d \u201cIs an order for me to confine myself to a sort of prison, from which he will release me by one of his satellites.\u201d \u201cBut why have you not fled?\u201d \u201cWhither should I go? Do you believe there is a spot on the earth which the cardinal cannot reach if he takes the trouble to stretch forth his hand? If I were a man, that would barely be possible; but what can a woman do? This young boarder of yours, has she tried to fly?\u201d \u201cNo, that is true; but she--that is another thing; I believe she is detained in France by some love affair.\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d said Milady, with a sigh, \u201cif she loves she is not altogether wretched.\u201d \u201cThen,\u201d said the abbess, looking at Milady with increasing interest, \u201cI behold another poor victim?\u201d \u201cAlas, yes,\u201d said Milady.", " But the wind was contrary, the sea bad; they tacked and kept offshore. Nine days after leaving the Charente, pale with fatigue and vexation, Milady saw only the blue coasts of Finisterre appear. She calculated that to cross this corner of France and return to the cardinal it would take her at least three days. Add another day for landing, and that would make four. Add these four to the nine others, that would be thirteen days lost--thirteen days, during which so many important events might pass in London. She reflected likewise that the cardinal would be furious at her return, and consequently would be more disposed to listen to the complaints brought against her than to the accusations she brought against others. She allowed the vessel to pass Lorient and Brest without repeating her request to the captain, who, on his part, took care not to remind her of it. Milady therefore continued her voyage, and on the very day that Planchet embarked at Portsmouth for France, the messenger of his Eminence entered the port in triumph.", " Milady Clarik received d\u2019Artagnan ceremoniously. Her hotel was remarkably sumptuous, and while the most part of the English had quit, or were about to quit, France on account of the war, Milady had just been laying out much money upon her residence; which proved that the general measure which drove the English from France did not affect her. \u201cYou see,\u201d said Lord de Winter, presenting d\u2019Artagnan to his sister, \u201ca young gentleman who has held my life in his hands, and who has not abused his advantage, although we have been twice enemies, although it was I who insulted him, and although I am an Englishman. Thank him, then, madame, if you have any affection for me.\u201d Milady frowned slightly; a scarcely visible cloud passed over her brow, and so peculiar a smile appeared upon her lips that the young man, who saw and observed this triple shade, almost shuddered at it. The brother did not perceive this; he had turned round to play with Milady\u2019s favorite monkey, which had pulled him by the doublet."], "According to the headsman, who was Milady before she began her life of crime?": [" He is a young, ingenuous, pure man who seems virtuous; him there are means of destroying.\u201d And Milady went to bed and fell asleep with a smile upon her lips. Anyone who had seen her sleeping might have said she was a young girl dreaming of the crown of flowers she was to wear on her brow at the next festival. 53 CAPTIVITY: THE SECOND DAY Milady dreamed that she at length had d\u2019Artagnan in her power, that she was present at his execution; and it was the sight of his odious blood, flowing beneath the ax of the headsman, which spread that charming smile upon her lips. She slept as a prisoner sleeps, rocked by his first hope. In the morning, when they entered her chamber she was still in bed. Felton remained in the corridor. He brought with him the woman of whom he had spoken the evening before, and who had just arrived; this woman entered, and approaching Milady\u2019s bed, offered her services.", " Behind d\u2019Artagnan entered Porthos, Aramis, Lord de Winter, and the man in the red cloak. The four lackeys guarded the door and the window. Milady had sunk into a chair, with her hands extended, as if to conjure this terrible apparition. Perceiving her brother-in-law, she uttered a terrible cry. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d screamed Milady. \u201cWe want,\u201d said Athos, \u201cCharlotte Backson, who first was called Comtesse de la Fere, and afterwards Milady de Winter, Baroness of Sheffield.\u201d \u201cThat is I! that is I!\u201d murmured Milady, in extreme terror; \u201cwhat do you want?\u201d \u201cWe wish to judge you according to your crime,\u201d said Athos; \u201cyou shall be free to defend yourself. Justify yourself if you can. M. d\u2019Artagnan, it is for you to accuse her first.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan advanced. \u201cBefore God and before men,\u201d said he, \u201cI accuse this woman of having poisoned Constance Bonacieux, who died yesterday evening.\u201d He turned towards Porthos and Aramis.", " Monseigneur!\u201d \u201cAU REVOIR, Monsieur Bonacieux, AU REVOIR.\u201d And the cardinal made him a sign with his hand, to which Bonacieux replied by bowing to the ground. He then went out backward, and when he was in the antechamber the cardinal heard him, in his enthusiasm, crying aloud, \u201cLong life to the Monseigneur! Long life to his Eminence! Long life to the great cardinal!\u201d The cardinal listened with a smile to this vociferous manifestation of the feelings of M. Bonacieux; and then, when Bonacieux\u2019s cries were no longer audible, \u201cGood!\u201d said he, \u201cthat man would henceforward lay down his life for me.\u201d And the cardinal began to examine with the greatest attention the map of La Rochelle, which, as we have said, lay open on the desk, tracing with a pencil the line in which the famous dyke was to pass which, eighteen months later, shut up the port of the besieged city. As he was in the deepest of his strategic meditations, the door opened, and Rochefort returned.", " No, sir. Besides, of what importance to you is the life or death of a condemned wretch? You are only responsible for my body, is it not so? And provided you produce a carcass that may be recognized as mine, they will require no more of you; nay, perhaps you will even have a double reward.\u201d \u201cI, madame, I?\u201d cried Felton. \u201cYou suppose that I would ever accept the price of your life? Oh, you cannot believe what you say!\u201d \u201cLet me act as I please, Felton, let me act as I please,\u201d said Milady, elated. \u201cEvery soldier must be ambitious, must he not? You are a lieutenant? Well, you will follow me to the grave with the rank of captain.\u201d \u201cWhat have I, then, done to you,\u201d said Felton, much agitated, \u201cthat you should load me with such a responsibility before God and before men? In a few days you will be away from this place; your life, madame, will then no longer be under my care, and,\u201d added he, with a sigh, \u201cthen you can do what you will with it.\u201d \u201cSo,\u201d cried Milady, as if she could not resist giving utterance to a holy indignation, \u201cyou, a pious man, you who are called a just man, you ask but one thing--and that is that you may not be inculpated, annoyed, by my death!\u201d \u201cIt is my duty to watch over your life, madame, and I will watch.\u201d \u201cBut do you understand the mission you are fulfilling?"], "What sentence do Porthos and Aramis give Milady for her crimes?": [" Beyond Portsmouth the sea was covered with vessels whose masts, like a forest of poplars despoiled by the winter, bent with each breath of the wind. Felton, in his rapid walk, reviewed in his mind all the accusations against the favorite of James I and Charles I, furnished by two years of premature meditation and a long sojourn among the Puritans. When he compared the public crimes of this minister--startling crimes, European crimes, if so we may say--with the private and unknown crimes with which Milady had charged him, Felton found that the more culpable of the two men which formed the character of Buckingham was the one of whom the public knew not the life. This was because his love, so strange, so new, and so ardent, made him view the infamous and imaginary accusations of Milady de Winter as, through a magnifying glass, one views as frightful monsters atoms in reality imperceptible by the side of an ant.", " You very well know, Porthos, that I continue to study theology for that purpose.\u201d \u201cHe will be one, as he says,\u201d cried Porthos; \u201che will be one, sooner or later.\u201d \u201cSooner,\u201d said Aramis. \u201cHe only waits for one thing to determine him to resume his cassock, which hangs behind his uniform,\u201d said another Musketeer. \u201cWhat is he waiting for?\u201d asked another. \u201cOnly till the queen has given an heir to the crown of France.\u201d \u201cNo jesting upon that subject, gentlemen,\u201d said Porthos; \u201cthank God the queen is still of an age to give one!\u201d \u201cThey say that Monsieur de Buckingham is in France,\u201d replied Aramis, with a significant smile which gave to this sentence, apparently so simple, a tolerably scandalous meaning. \u201cAramis, my good friend, this time you are wrong,\u201d interrupted Porthos. \u201cYour wit is always leading you beyond bounds; if Monsieur de Treville heard you, you would repent of speaking thus.\u201d \u201cAre you going to give me a lesson, Porthos?\u201d cried Aramis, from whose usually mild eye a flash passed like lightning.", " \u201cTo do justice to them who had condemned me, they kept their word. As soon as the identity of my brother was proved, I was set at liberty. \u201cThat is the crime of which I accuse her; that is the cause for which she was branded.\u201d \u201cMonsieur d\u2019Artagnan,\u201d said Athos, \u201cwhat is the penalty you demand against this woman?\u201d \u201cThe punishment of death,\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cMy Lord de Winter,\u201d continued Athos, \u201cwhat is the penalty you demand against this woman?\u201d \u201cThe punishment of death,\u201d replied Lord de Winter. \u201cMessieurs Porthos and Aramis,\u201d repeated Athos, \u201cyou who are her judges, what is the sentence you pronounce upon this woman?\u201d \u201cThe punishment of death,\u201d replied the Musketeers, in a hollow voice. Milady uttered a frightful shriek, and dragged herself along several paces upon her knees toward her judges. Athos stretched out his hand toward her. \u201cCharlotte Backson, Comtesse de la Fere, Milady de Winter,\u201d said he, \u201cyour crimes have wearied men on earth and God in heaven.", " \u201cWhat, monseigneur?\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, with a calmness which astonished the cardinal himself. \u201cYou are charged with having corresponded with the enemies of the kingdom; you are charged with having surprised state secrets; you are charged with having tried to thwart the plans of your general.\u201d \u201cAnd who charges me with this, monseigneur?\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, who had no doubt the accusation came from Milady, \u201ca woman branded by the justice of the country; a woman who has espoused one man in France and another in England; a woman who poisoned her second husband and who attempted both to poison and assassinate me!\u201d \u201cWhat do you say, monsieur?\u201d cried the cardinal, astonished; \u201cand of what woman are you speaking thus?\u201d \u201cOf Milady de Winter,\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cyes, of Milady de Winter, of whose crimes your Eminence is doubtless ignorant, since you have honored her with your confidence.\u201d \u201cMonsieur,\u201d said the cardinal, \u201cif Milady de Winter has committed the crimes you lay to her charge, she shall be punished.\u201d \u201cShe has been punished, monseigneur.\u201d \u201cAnd who has punished her?\u201d \u201cWe.\u201d \u201cShe is in prison?\u201d \u201cShe is dead.\u201d \u201cDead!\u201d repeated the cardinal, who could not believe what he heard, \u201cdead!"], "What does the Cardinal do when D\u2019Artagnan tells him that he killed Milady for her crimes?": [" Beyond Portsmouth the sea was covered with vessels whose masts, like a forest of poplars despoiled by the winter, bent with each breath of the wind.

His Eminence entered the chamber which served him as a study, and made a sign to Rochefort to bring in the young Musketeer. Rochefort obeyed and retired. D\u2019Artagnan remained alone in front of the cardinal; this was his second interview with Richelieu, and he afterward confessed that he felt well assured it would be his last. Richelieu remained standing, leaning against the mantelpiece; a table was between him and d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cMonsieur,\u201d said the cardinal, \u201cyou have been arrested by my orders.\u201d \u201cSo they tell me, monseigneur.\u201d \u201cDo you know why?\u201d \u201cNo, monseigneur, for the only thing for which I could be arrested is still unknown to your Eminence.\u201d Richelieu looked steadfastly at the young man. \u201cHolloa!\u201d said he, \u201cwhat does that mean?\u201d \u201cIf Monseigneur will have the goodness to tell me, in the first place, what crimes are imputed to me, I will then tell him the deeds I have really done.\u201d \u201cCrimes are imputed to you which had brought down far loftier heads than yours, monsieur,\u201d said the cardinal.", " As I told you, it is an old family jewel.\u201d \u201cAnd you--sold it?\u201d asked d\u2019Artagnan, hesitatingly. \u201cNo,\u201d replied Athos, with a singular smile. \u201cI gave it away in a night of love, as it has been given to you.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan became pensive in his turn; it appeared as if there were abysses in Milady\u2019s soul whose depths were dark and unknown. He took back the ring, but put it in his pocket and not on his finger. \u201cd\u2019Artagnan,\u201d said Athos, taking his hand, \u201cyou know I love you; if I had a son I could not love him better.

Although warned that the man she had loved so much was in great danger, the queen, when his death was announced to her, would not believe the fact, and even imprudently exclaimed, \u201cit is false; he has just written to me!\u201d But the next day she was obliged to believe this fatal intelligence; Laporte, detained in England, as everyone else had been, by the orders of Charles I, arrived, and was the bearer of the duke\u2019s dying gift to the queen. The joy of the king was lively. He did not even give himself the trouble to dissemble, and displayed it with affectation before the queen.", " When the chancellor had opened and shut twenty times the drawers of the secretaries, it became necessary, whatever hesitation he might experience--it became necessary, I say, to come to the conclusion of the affair; that is to say, to search the queen herself. The chancellor advanced, therefore, toward Anne of Austria, and said with a very perplexed and embarrassed air, \u201cAnd now it remains for me to make the principal examination.\u201d \u201cWhat is that?\u201d asked the queen, who did not understand, or rather was not willing to understand. \u201cHis majesty is certain that a letter has been written by you during the day; he knows that it has not yet been sent to its address. This letter is not in your table nor in your secretary; and yet this letter must be somewhere.\u201d \u201cWould you dare to lift your hand to your queen?\u201d said Anne of Austria, drawing herself up to her full height, and fixing her eyes upon the chancellor with an expression almost threatening.", " Nevertheless, Monsieur de Treville\u2019s company of Musketeers alone cannot maintain a war against the cardinal, who disposes of the forces of all France, and before whom the queen is without power and the king without will. D\u2019Artagnan, my friend, you are brave, you are prudent, you have excellent qualities; but the women will ruin you!\u201d He came to this melancholy conclusion as he entered the antechamber. He placed his letter in the hands of the usher on duty, who led him into the waiting room and passed on into the interior of the palace. In this waiting room were five or six of the cardinals Guards, who recognized d\u2019Artagnan, and knowing that it was he who had wounded Jussac, they looked upon him with a smile of singular meaning. This smile appeared to d\u2019Artagnan to be of bad augury. Only, as our Gascon was not easily intimidated--or rather, thanks to a great pride natural to the men of his country, he did not allow one easily to see what was passing in his mind when that which was passing at all resembled fear--he placed himself haughtily in front of Messieurs the Guards, and waited with his hand on his hip, in an attitude by no means deficient in majesty.", " When the lady of the red cushion came close to Porthos, Porthos drew his dripping hand from the font. The fair worshipper touched the great hand of Porthos with her delicate fingers, smiled, made the sign of the cross, and left the church. This was too much for the procurator\u2019s wife; she doubted not there was an intrigue between this lady and Porthos. If she had been a great lady she would have fainted; but as she was only a procurator\u2019s wife, she contented herself saying to the Musketeer with concentrated fury, \u201cEh, Monsieur Porthos, you don\u2019t offer me any holy water?\u201d Porthos, at the sound of that voice, started like a man awakened from a sleep of a hundred years. \u201cMa-madame!\u201d cried he; \u201cis that you? How is your husband, our dear Monsieur Coquenard? Is he still as stingy as ever? Where can my eyes have been not to have seen you during the two hours of the sermon?\u201d \u201cI was within two paces of you, monsieur,\u201d replied the procurator\u2019s wife; \u201cbut you did not perceive me because you had no eyes but for the pretty lady to whom you just now gave the holy water.\u201d Porthos pretended to be confused."]}
