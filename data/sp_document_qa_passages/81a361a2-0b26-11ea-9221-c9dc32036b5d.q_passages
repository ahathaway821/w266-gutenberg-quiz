{"Who promotes D\u2019Artagnan to the position of lieutenant at the end of the novel?": [" \u201cI wrote to her to send me fifty louis or so, of which I stood absolutely in need on account of my accident.\u201d \u201cWell?\u201d \u201cWell, she must be at her country seat, for she has not answered me.\u201d \u201cTruly?\u201d \u201cNo; so I yesterday addressed another epistle to her, still more pressing than the first. But you are here, my dear fellow, let us speak of you. I confess I began to be very uneasy on your account.\u201d \u201cBut your host behaves very well toward you, as it appears, my dear Porthos,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, directing the sick man\u2019s attention to the full stewpans and the empty bottles. \u201cSo, so,\u201d replied Porthos. \u201cOnly three or four days ago the impertinent jackanapes gave me his bill, and I was forced to turn both him and his bill out of the door; so that I am here something in the fashion of a conqueror, holding my position, as it were, my conquest. So you see, being in constant fear of being forced from that position, I am armed to the teeth.\u201d \u201cAnd yet,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, laughing, \u201cit appears to me that from time to time you must make SORTIES.\u201d And he again pointed to the bottles and the stewpans. \u201cNot I, unfortunately!\u201d said Porthos. \u201cThis miserable strain confines me to my bed; but Mousqueton forages, and brings in provisions. Friend Mousqueton, you see that we have a reinforcement, and we must have an increase of supplies.\u201d \u201cMousqueton,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cyou must render me a service.\u201d \u201cWhat, monsieur?\u201d \u201cYou must give your recipe to Planchet.", " A light appeared under the door; this light announced the reappearance of her jailers. Milady, who had arisen, threw herself quickly into the armchair, her head thrown back, her beautiful hair unbound and disheveled, her bosom half bare beneath her crumpled lace, one hand on her heart, and the other hanging down. The bolts were drawn; the door groaned upon its hinges. Steps sounded in the chamber, and drew near. \u201cPlace that table there,\u201d said a voice which the prisoner recognized as that of Felton. The order was executed. \u201cYou will bring lights, and relieve the sentinel,\u201d continued Felton. And this double order which the young lieutenant gave to the same individuals proved to Milady that her servants were the same men as her guards; that is to say, soldiers. Felton\u2019s orders were, for the rest, executed with a silent rapidity that gave a good idea of the way in which he maintained discipline. At length Felton, who had not yet looked at Milady, turned toward her. \u201cAh, ah!\u201d said he, \u201cshe is asleep; that\u2019s well. When she wakes she can sup.\u201d And he made some steps toward the door. \u201cBut, my lieutenant,\u201d said a soldier, less stoical than his chief, and who had approached Milady, \u201cthis woman is not asleep.\u201d \u201cWhat, not asleep!\u201d said Felton; \u201cwhat is she doing, then?\u201d \u201cShe has fainted. Her face is very pale, and I have listened in vain; I do not hear her breathe.\u201d \u201cYou are right,\u201d said Felton, after having looked at Milady from the spot on which he stood without moving a step toward her.", " He felt something like a secret joy at being forever relieved of this dangerous accomplice. Richelieu slowly tore the paper which d\u2019Artagnan had generously relinquished. \u201cI am lost!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan to himself. And he bowed profoundly before the cardinal, like a man who says, \u201cLord, Thy will be done!\u201d The cardinal approached the table, and without sitting down, wrote a few lines upon a parchment of which two-thirds were already filled, and affixed his seal. \u201cThat is my condemnation,\u201d thought d\u2019Artagnan; \u201che will spare me the ENNUI of the Bastille, or the tediousness of a trial. That\u2019s very kind of him.\u201d \u201cHere, monsieur,\u201d said the cardinal to the young man. \u201cI have taken from you one CARTE BLANCHE to give you another. The name is wanting in this commission; you can write it yourself.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan took the paper hesitatingly and cast his eyes over it; it was a lieutenant\u2019s commission in the Musketeers. D\u2019Artagnan fell at the feet of the cardinal. \u201cMonseigneur,\u201d said he, \u201cmy life is yours; henceforth dispose of it. But this favor which you bestow upon me I do not merit. I have three friends who are more meritorious and more worthy--\u201d \u201cYou are a brave youth, d\u2019Artagnan,\u201d interrupted the cardinal, tapping him familiarly on the shoulder, charmed at having vanquished this rebellious nature. \u201cDo with this commission what you will; only remember, though the name be blank, it is to you I give it.\u201d \u201cI shall never forget it,\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan.", " Nevertheless, day dawned without darkness having brought any accident. But d\u2019Artagnan well suspected that that which was deferred was not relinquished. D\u2019Artagnan remained all day in his quarters, assigning as a reason to himself that the weather was bad. At nine o\u2019clock the next morning, the drums beat to arms. The Duc d\u2019Orleans visited the posts. The guards were under arms, and d\u2019Artagnan took his place in the midst of his comrades. Monsieur passed along the front of the line; then all the superior officers approached him to pay their compliments, M. Dessessart, captain of the Guards, as well as the others. At the expiration of a minute or two, it appeared to d\u2019Artagnan that M. Dessessart made him a sign to approach. He waited for a fresh gesture on the part of his superior, for fear he might be mistaken; but this gesture being repeated, he left the ranks, and advanced to receive orders. \u201cMonsieur is about to ask for some men of good will for a dangerous mission, but one which will do honor to those who shall accomplish it; and I made you a sign in order that you might hold yourself in readiness.\u201d \u201cThanks, my captain!\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan, who wished for nothing better than an opportunity to distinguish himself under the eye of the lieutenant general. In fact the Rochellais had made a sortie during the night, and had retaken a bastion of which the royal army had gained possession two days before."], "What phrase best describes the tone that dominates at the beginning of The Three Musketeers?": [" M Dessessart, who esteemed d\u2019Artagnan, made him offers of help, as this change would entail expenses for equipment. D\u2019Artagnan refused; but thinking the opportunity a good one, he begged him to have the diamond he put into his hand valued, as he wished to turn it into money. The next day, M. Dessessart\u2019s valet came to d\u2019Artagnan\u2019s lodging, and gave him a bag containing seven thousand livres. This was the price of the queen\u2019s diamond. 48 A FAMILY AFFAIR Athos had invented the phrase, family affair. A family affair was not subject to the investigation of the cardinal; a family affair concerned nobody. People might employ themselves in a family affair before all the world. Therefore Athos had invented the phrase, family affair. Aramis had discovered the idea, the lackeys. Porthos had discovered the means, the diamond. D\u2019Artagnan alone had discovered nothing--he, ordinarily the most inventive of the four; but it must be also said that the very name of Milady paralyzed him. Ah! no, we were mistaken; he had discovered a purchaser for his diamond. The breakfast at M. de Treville\u2019s was as gay and cheerful as possible. D\u2019Artagnan already wore his uniform--for being nearly of the same size as Aramis, and as Aramis was so liberally paid by the publisher who purchased his poem as to allow him to buy everything double, he sold his friend a complete outfit. D\u2019Artagnan would have been at the height of his wishes if he had not constantly seen Milady like a dark cloud hovering in the horizon.", " Athos bowed. \u201cAnd now, gentlemen, that\u2019s well,\u201d continued the cardinal. \u201cI know what I wish to know; follow me.\u201d The three Musketeers passed behind his Eminence, who again enveloped his face in his cloak, and put his horse in motion, keeping from eight to ten paces in advance of his four companions. They soon arrived at the silent, solitary inn. No doubt the host knew what illustrious visitor was expected, and had consequently sent intruders out of the way. Ten paces from the door the cardinal made a sign to his esquire and the three Musketeers to halt. A saddled horse was fastened to the window shutter. The cardinal knocked three times, and in a peculiar manner. A man, enveloped in a cloak, came out immediately, and exchanged some rapid words with the cardinal; after which he mounted his horse, and set off in the direction of Surgeres, which was likewise the way to Paris. \u201cAdvance, gentlemen,\u201d said the cardinal. \u201cYou have told me the truth, my gentlemen,\u201d said he, addressing the Musketeers, \u201cand it will not be my fault if our encounter this evening be not advantageous to you. In the meantime, follow me.\u201d The cardinal alighted; the three Musketeers did likewise. The cardinal threw the bridle of his horse to his esquire; the three Musketeers fastened the horses to the shutters. The host stood at the door. For him, the cardinal was only an officer coming to visit a lady. \u201cHave you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can wait near a good fire?\u201d said the cardinal.", " The king was winning; and as he was very avaricious, he was in an excellent humor. Perceiving M. de Treville at a distance-- \u201cCome here, Monsieur Captain,\u201d said he, \u201ccome here, that I may growl at you. Do you know that his Eminence has been making fresh complaints against your Musketeers, and that with so much emotion, that this evening his Eminence is indisposed? Ah, these Musketeers of yours are very devils--fellows to be hanged.\u201d \u201cNo, sire,\u201d replied Treville, who saw at the first glance how things would go, \u201con the contrary, they are good creatures, as meek as lambs, and have but one desire, I\u2019ll be their warranty. And that is that their swords may never leave their scabbards but in your majesty\u2019s service. But what are they to do? The Guards of Monsieur the Cardinal are forever seeking quarrels with them, and for the honor of the corps even, the poor young men are obliged to defend themselves.\u201d \u201cListen to Monsieur de Treville,\u201d said the king; \u201clisten to him! Would not one say he was speaking of a religious community? In truth, my dear Captain, I have a great mind to take away your commission and give it to Mademoiselle de Chemerault, to whom I promised an abbey. But don\u2019t fancy that I am going to take you on your bare word. I am called Louis the Just, Monsieur de Treville, and by and by, by and by we will see.\u201d \u201cAh, sire; it is because I confide in that justice that I shall wait patiently and quietly the good pleasure of your Majesty.\u201d \u201cWait, then, monsieur, wait,\u201d said the king; \u201cI will not detain you long.\u201d In fact, fortune changed; and as the king began to lose what he had won, he was not sorry to find an excuse for playing Charlemagne--if we may use a gaming phrase of whose origin we confess our ignorance.", " \u201cHe told me that he should henceforth recruit his Musketeers from among the Guards of Monsieur the Cardinal.\u201d \u201cThe Guards of the cardinal! And why so?\u201d asked Porthos, warmly. \u201cBecause he plainly perceives that his piquette* stands in need of being enlivened by a mixture of good wine.\u201d _*A watered liquor, made from the second pressing of the grape._ The two Musketeers reddened to the whites of their eyes. D\u2019Artagnan did not know where he was, and wished himself a hundred feet underground. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d continued M. de Treville, growing warmer as he spoke, \u201cand his majesty was right; for, upon my honor, it is true that the Musketeers make but a miserable figure at court. The cardinal related yesterday while playing with the king, with an air of condolence very displeasing to me, that the day before yesterday those DAMNED MUSKETEERS, those DAREDEVILS--he dwelt upon those words with an ironical tone still more displeasing to me--those BRAGGARTS, added he, glancing at me with his tiger-cat\u2019s eye, had made a riot in the Rue Ferou in a cabaret, and that a party of his Guards (I thought he was going to laugh in my face) had been forced to arrest the rioters! MORBLEU! You must know something about it. Arrest Musketeers! You were among them--you were! Don\u2019t deny it; you were recognized, and the cardinal named you. But it\u2019s all my fault; yes, it\u2019s all my fault, because it is myself who selects my men."], "What literary genre is associated with the return to normalcy that ends The Three Musketeers?": [" Athos bowed. \u201cAnd now, gentlemen, that\u2019s well,\u201d continued the cardinal. \u201cI know what I wish to know; follow me.\u201d The three Musketeers passed behind his Eminence, who again enveloped his face in his cloak, and put his horse in motion, keeping from eight to ten paces in advance of his four companions.

For him, the cardinal was only an officer coming to visit a lady. \u201cHave you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can wait near a good fire?\u201d said the cardinal.", " \u201cA man wishes to see Monsieur at home,\u201d replied Bazin. \u201cA man! What man?\u201d \u201cA mendicant.\u201d \u201cGive him alms, Bazin, and bid him pray for a poor sinner.\u201d \u201cThis mendicant insists upon speaking to you, and pretends that you will be very glad to see him.\u201d \u201cHas he sent no particular message for me?\u201d \u201cYes. If Monsieur Aramis hesitates to come,\u201d he said, \u201ctell him I am from Tours.\u201d \u201cFrom Tours!\u201d cried Aramis. \u201cA thousand pardons, gentlemen; but no doubt this man brings me the news I expected.\u201d And rising also, he went off at a quick pace. There remained Athos and d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cI believe these fellows have managed their business. What do you think, d\u2019Artagnan?\u201d said Athos. \u201cI know that Porthos was in a fair way,\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cand as to Aramis to tell you the truth, I have never been seriously uneasy on his account. But you, my dear Athos--you, who so generously distributed the Englishman\u2019s pistoles, which were our legitimate property--what do you mean to do?\u201d \u201cI am satisfied with having killed that fellow, my boy, seeing that it is blessed bread to kill an Englishman; but if I had pocketed his pistoles, they would have weighed me down like a remorse.\u201d \u201cGo to, my dear Athos; you have truly inconceivable ideas.\u201d \u201cLet it pass. What do you think of Monsieur de Treville telling me, when he did me the honor to call upon me yesterday, that you associated with the suspected English, whom the cardinal protects?\u201d \u201cThat is to say, I visit an Englishwoman--the one I named.\u201d \u201cOh, ay!", " Then, in order that he might have nothing to reproach himself with, he directed his steps, for the last time, toward the residences of his three friends. No news had been received of them; only a letter, all perfumed and of an elegant writing in small characters, had come for Aramis. D\u2019Artagnan took charge of it. Ten minutes afterward Planchet joined him at the stables of the Hotel des Gardes. D\u2019Artagnan, in order that there might be no time lost, had saddled his horse himself. \u201cThat\u2019s well,\u201d said he to Planchet, when the latter added the portmanteau to the equipment. \u201cNow saddle the other three horses.\u201d \u201cDo you think, then, monsieur, that we shall travel faster with two horses apiece?\u201d said Planchet, with his shrewd air. \u201cNo, Monsieur Jester,\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cbut with our four horses we may bring back our three friends, if we should have the good fortune to find them living.\u201d \u201cWhich is a great chance,\u201d replied Planchet, \u201cbut we must not despair of the mercy of God.\u201d \u201cAmen!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, getting into his saddle. As they went from the Hotel des Gardes, they separated, leaving the street at opposite ends, one having to quit Paris by the Barriere de la Villette and the other by the Barriere Montmartre, to meet again beyond St. Denis--a strategic maneuver which, having been executed with equal punctuality, was crowned with the most fortunate results. D\u2019Artagnan and Planchet entered Pierrefitte together.", " At ten paces from the hedge he recognized the talkative Gascon; and as he had already perceived that these men were Musketeers, he did not doubt that the three others were those called the Inseparables; that is to say, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis. It may be supposed that his desire to hear the conversation was augmented by this discovery. His eyes took a strange expression, and with the step of a tiger-cat he advanced toward the hedge; but he had not been able to catch more than a few vague syllables without any positive sense, when a sonorous and short cry made him start, and attracted the attention of the Musketeers. \u201cOfficer!\u201d cried Grimaud. \u201cYou are speaking, you scoundrel!\u201d said Athos, rising upon his elbow, and transfixing Grimaud with his flaming look. Grimaud therefore added nothing to his speech, but contented himself with pointing his index finger in the direction of the hedge, announcing by this gesture the cardinal and his escort. With a single bound the Musketeers were on their feet, and saluted with respect. The cardinal seemed furious. \u201cIt appears that Messieurs the Musketeers keep guard,\u201d said he. \u201cAre the English expected by land, or do the Musketeers consider themselves superior officers?\u201d \u201cMonseigneur,\u201d replied Athos, for amid the general fright he alone had preserved the noble calmness and coolness that never forsook him, \u201cMonseigneur, the Musketeers, when they are not on duty, or when their duty is over, drink and play at dice, and they are certainly superior officers to their lackeys.\u201d \u201cLackeys?\u201d grumbled the cardinal."], "To what underlying cause does Dumas often attribute large-scale historical events?": [" I could not have believed she would risk her liberty for me, and yet for what other cause could she have returned to Paris?\u201d \u201cFor the cause which today takes us to England.\u201d \u201cAnd what is this cause?\u201d demanded Aramis. \u201cOh, you\u2019ll know it someday, Aramis; but at present I must imitate the discretion of \u2018the doctor\u2019s niece.\u2019\u201d Aramis smiled, as he remembered the tale he had told his friends on a certain evening. \u201cWell, then, since she has left Paris, and you are sure of it, d\u2019Artagnan, nothing prevents me, and I am ready to follow you. You say we are going--\u201d \u201cTo see Athos now, and if you will come thither, I beg you to make haste, for we have lost much time already. A PROPOS, inform Bazin.\u201d \u201cWill Bazin go with us?\u201d asked Aramis. \u201cPerhaps so. At all events, it is best that he should follow us to Athos\u2019s.\u201d Aramis called Bazin, and, after having ordered him to join them at Athos\u2019s residence, said \u201cLet us go then,\u201d at the same time taking his cloak, sword, and three pistols, opening uselessly two or three drawers to see if he could not find stray coin. When well assured this search was superfluous, he followed d\u2019Artagnan, wondering to himself how this young Guardsman should know so well who the lady was to whom he had given hospitality, and that he should know better than himself what had become of her. Only as they went out Aramis placed his hand upon the arm of d\u2019Artagnan, and looking at him earnestly, \u201cYou have not spoken of this lady?\u201d said he.", " \u201cListen! It was you who cut off the two diamond studs from the shoulder of the Duke of Buckingham; it was you had the Madame Bonacieux carried off; it was you who, in love with de Wardes and thinking to pass the night with him, opened the door to Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan; it was you who, believing that de Wardes had deceived you, wished to have him killed by his rival; it was you who, when this rival had discovered your infamous secret, wished to have him killed in his turn by two assassins, whom you sent in pursuit of him; it was you who, finding the balls had missed their mark, sent poisoned wine with a forged letter, to make your victim believe that the wine came from his friends. In short, it was you who have but now in this chamber, seated in this chair I now fill, made an engagement with Cardinal Richelieu to cause the Duke of Buckingham to be assassinated, in exchange for the promise he has made you to allow you to assassinate d\u2019Artagnan.\u201d Milady was livid. \u201cYou must be Satan!\u201d cried she. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d said Athos; \u201cBut at all events listen well to this. Assassinate the Duke of Buckingham, or cause him to be assassinated--I care very little about that! I don\u2019t know him. Besides, he is an Englishman. But do not touch with the tip of your finger a single hair of d\u2019Artagnan, who is a faithful friend whom I love and defend, or I swear to you by the head of my father the crime which you shall have endeavored to commit, or shall have committed, shall be the last.\u201d \u201cMonsieur d\u2019Artagnan has cruelly insulted me,\u201d said Milady, in a hollow tone; \u201cMonsieur d\u2019Artagnan shall die!\u201d \u201cIndeed!", " At the end of a quarter of an hour, however, surprised at the length of the journey, she leaned forward toward the door to see whither she was being conducted. Houses were no longer to be seen; trees appeared in the darkness like great black phantoms chasing one another. Milady shuddered. \u201cBut we are no longer in the city, sir,\u201d said she. The young officer preserved silence. \u201cI beg you to understand, sir, I will go no farther unless you tell me whither you are taking me.\u201d This threat brought no reply. \u201cOh, this is too much,\u201d cried Milady. \u201cHelp! help!\u201d No voice replied to hers; the carriage continued to roll on with rapidity; the officer seemed a statue. Milady looked at the officer with one of those terrible expressions peculiar to her countenance, and which so rarely failed of their effect; anger made her eyes flash in the darkness. The young man remained immovable. Milady tried to open the door in order to throw herself out. \u201cTake care, madame,\u201d said the young man, coolly, \u201cyou will kill yourself in jumping.\u201d Milady reseated herself, foaming. The officer leaned forward, looked at her in his turn, and appeared surprised to see that face, just before so beautiful, distorted with passion and almost hideous. The artful creature at once comprehended that she was injuring herself by allowing him thus to read her soul; she collected her features, and in a complaining voice said: \u201cIn the name of heaven, sir, tell me if it is to you, if it is to your government, if it is to an enemy I am to attribute the violence that is done me?\u201d \u201cNo violence will be offered to you, madame, and what happens to you is the result of a very simple measure which we are obliged to adopt with all who land in England.\u201d \u201cThen you don\u2019t know me, sir?\u201d \u201cIt is the first time I have had the honor of seeing you.\u201d \u201cAnd on your honor, you have no cause of hatred against me?\u201d \u201cNone, I swear to you.\u201d There was so much serenity, coolness, mildness even, in the voice of the young man, that Milady felt reassured.", " *** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE THREE MUSKETEERS, BY ALEXANDRE DUMAS, PERE *** Produced by John P.

So much the better, Duke, so much the better,\u201d said the king, advancing toward the door. \u201cAh! It is you, Treville. Where are your Musketeers?

I will write to him, then, nearly in these terms.\u201d \u201cLet us see,\u201d said Athos, assuming in advance a critical look. \u201cMonsieur and dear friend--\u201d \u201cAh, yes! Dear friend to an Englishman,\u201d interrupted Athos; \u201cwell commenced! Bravo, d\u2019Artagnan! Only with that word you would be quartered instead of being broken on the wheel.\u201d \u201cWell, perhaps. I will say, then, Monsieur, quite short.\u201d \u201cYou may even say, My Lord,\u201d replied Athos, who stickled for propriety. \u201cMy Lord, do you remember the little goat pasture of the Luxembourg?\u201d \u201cGood, the Luxembourg! One might believe this is an allusion to the queen-mother! That\u2019s ingenious,\u201d said Athos. \u201cWell, then, we will put simply, My Lord, do you remember a certain little enclosure where your life was spared?\u201d \u201cMy dear d\u2019Artagnan, you will never make anything but a very bad secretary. Where your life was spared!", " Athos bowed. \u201cAnd now, gentlemen, that\u2019s well,\u201d continued the cardinal. \u201cI know what I wish to know; follow me.\u201d The three Musketeers passed behind his Eminence, who again enveloped his face in his cloak, and put his horse in motion, keeping from eight to ten paces in advance of his four companions. They soon arrived at the silent, solitary inn. No doubt the host knew what illustrious visitor was expected, and had consequently sent intruders out of the way. Ten paces from the door the cardinal made a sign to his esquire and the three Musketeers to halt. A saddled horse was fastened to the window shutter. The cardinal knocked three times, and in a peculiar manner. A man, enveloped in a cloak, came out immediately, and exchanged some rapid words with the cardinal; after which he mounted his horse, and set off in the direction of Surgeres, which was likewise the way to Paris. \u201cAdvance, gentlemen,\u201d said the cardinal. \u201cYou have told me the truth, my gentlemen,\u201d said he, addressing the Musketeers, \u201cand it will not be my fault if our encounter this evening be not advantageous to you. In the meantime, follow me.\u201d The cardinal alighted; the three Musketeers did likewise. The cardinal threw the bridle of his horse to his esquire; the three Musketeers fastened the horses to the shutters. The host stood at the door. For him, the cardinal was only an officer coming to visit a lady. \u201cHave you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can wait near a good fire?\u201d said the cardinal."], "What drives the actions of the novel\u2019s romantic hero, D\u2019Artagnan?": [" \u201cOh, the women, the women!\u201d cried the old soldier. \u201cI know them by their romantic imagination. Everything that savors of mystery charms them. So you have seen the arm, that was all. You would meet the queen, and she would not know who you are?\u201d \u201cNo; but thanks to this diamond,\u201d replied the young man. \u201cListen,\u201d said M. de Treville; \u201cshall I give you counsel, good counsel, the counsel of a friend?\u201d \u201cYou will do me honor, monsieur,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cWell, then, off to the nearest goldsmith\u2019s, and sell that diamond for the highest price you can get from him. However much of a Jew he may be, he will give you at least eight hundred pistoles. Pistoles have no name, young man, and that ring has a terrible one, which may betray him who wears it.\u201d \u201cSell this ring, a ring which comes from my sovereign? Never!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cThen, at least turn the gem inside, you silly fellow; for everybody must be aware that a cadet from Gascony does not find such stones in his mother\u2019s jewel case.\u201d \u201cYou think, then, I have something to dread?\u201d asked d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cI mean to say, young man, that he who sleeps over a mine the match of which is already lighted, may consider himself in safety in comparison with you.\u201d \u201cThe devil!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, whom the positive tone of M. de Treville began to disquiet, \u201cthe devil! What must I do?\u201d \u201cAbove all things be always on your guard. The cardinal has a tenacious memory and a long arm; you may depend upon it, he will repay you by some ill turn.\u201d \u201cBut of what sort?\u201d \u201cEh!", " In consequence, after having traveled all night, at seven o\u2019clock she was at the fort of the Point; at eight o\u2019clock she had embarked; and at nine, the vessel, which with letters of marque from the cardinal was supposed to be sailing for Bayonne, raised anchor, and steered its course toward England. 46 THE BASTION SAINT-GERVAIS On arriving at the lodgings of his three friends, d\u2019Artagnan found them assembled in the same chamber. Athos was meditating; Porthos was twisting his mustache; Aramis was saying his prayers in a charming little Book of Hours, bound in blue velvet. \u201cPardieu, gentlemen,\u201d said he. \u201cI hope what you have to tell me is worth the trouble, or else, I warn you, I will not pardon you for making me come here instead of getting a little rest after a night spent in taking and dismantling a bastion. Ah, why were you not there, gentlemen? It was warm work.\u201d \u201cWe were in a place where it was not very cold,\u201d replied Porthos, giving his mustache a twist which was peculiar to him. \u201cHush!\u201d said Athos. \u201cOh, oh!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, comprehending the slight frown of the Musketeer. \u201cIt appears there is something fresh aboard.\u201d \u201cAramis,\u201d said Athos, \u201cyou went to breakfast the day before yesterday at the inn of the Parpaillot, I believe?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cHow did you fare?\u201d \u201cFor my part, I ate but little. The day before yesterday was a fish day, and they had nothing but meat.\u201d \u201cWhat,\u201d said Athos, \u201cno fish at a seaport?\u201d \u201cThey say,\u201d said Aramis, resuming his pious reading, \u201cthat the dyke which the cardinal is making drives them all out into the open sea.\u201d \u201cBut that is not quite what I mean to ask you, Aramis,\u201d replied Athos.", " \u201cFor you and your comrades.\u201d This greatness of spirit in a man who was quite destitute struck even Porthos; and this French generosity, repeated by Lord de Winter and his friend, was highly applauded, except by MM Grimaud, Bazin, Mousqueton and Planchet. Lord de Winter, on quitting d\u2019Artagnan, gave him his sister\u2019s address. She lived in the Place Royale--then the fashionable quarter--at Number 6, and he undertook to call and take d\u2019Artagnan with him in order to introduce him. D\u2019Artagnan appointed eight o\u2019clock at Athos\u2019s residence. This introduction to Milady Clarik occupied the head of our Gascon greatly. He remembered in what a strange manner this woman had hitherto been mixed up in his destiny. According to his conviction, she was some creature of the cardinal, and yet he felt himself invincibly drawn toward her by one of those sentiments for which we cannot account. His only fear was that Milady would recognize in him the man of Meung and of Dover. Then she knew that he was one of the friends of M. de Treville, and consequently, that he belonged body and soul to the king; which would make him lose a part of his advantage, since when known to Milady as he knew her, he played only an equal game with her. As to the commencement of an intrigue between her and M. de Wardes, our presumptuous hero gave but little heed to that, although the marquis was young, handsome, rich, and high in the cardinal\u2019s favor.", " Still further, Monsieur de Treville gains ten thousand crowns a year; he is therefore a great noble. He began as you begin. Go to him with this letter, and make him your model in order that you may do as he has done.\u201d Upon which M. d\u2019Artagnan the elder girded his own sword round his son, kissed him tenderly on both cheeks, and gave him his benediction. On leaving the paternal chamber, the young man found his mother, who was waiting for him with the famous recipe of which the counsels we have just repeated would necessitate frequent employment. The adieux were on this side longer and more tender than they had been on the other--not that M. d\u2019Artagnan did not love his son, who was his only offspring, but M. d\u2019Artagnan was a man, and he would have considered it unworthy of a man to give way to his feelings; whereas Mme. d\u2019Artagnan was a woman, and still more, a mother. She wept abundantly; and--let us speak it to the praise of M. d\u2019Artagnan the younger--notwithstanding the efforts he made to remain firm, as a future Musketeer ought, nature prevailed, and he shed many tears, of which he succeeded with great difficulty in concealing the half. The same day the young man set forward on his journey, furnished with the three paternal gifts, which consisted, as we have said, of fifteen crowns, the horse, and the letter for M. de Treville--the counsels being thrown into the bargain. With such a VADE MECUM d\u2019Artagnan was morally and physically an exact copy of the hero of Cervantes, to whom we so happily compared him when our duty of an historian placed us under the necessity of sketching his portrait."], "Which of the Three Musketeers is distinguished in every way, yet tortured by a deep melancholy?": [" \u201cHave the goodness to send mine to Athos\u2019s residence. I should dread some disagreeable encounter if I were to go home.\u201d \u201cBe easy. Adieu, and a prosperous voyage. A PROPOS,\u201d said M. de Treville, calling him back. D\u2019Artagnan returned. \u201cHave you any money?\u201d D\u2019Artagnan tapped the bag he had in his pocket. \u201cEnough?\u201d asked M. de Treville. \u201cThree hundred pistoles.\u201d \u201cOh, plenty! That would carry you to the end of the world. Begone, then!\u201d D\u2019Artagnan saluted M. de Treville, who held out his hand to him; d\u2019Artagnan pressed it with a respect mixed with gratitude. Since his first arrival at Paris, he had had constant occasion to honor this excellent man, whom he had always found worthy, loyal, and great. His first visit was to Aramis, at whose residence he had not been since the famous evening on which he had followed Mme. Bonacieux. Still further, he had seldom seen the young Musketeer; but every time he had seen him, he had remarked a deep sadness imprinted on his countenance. This evening, especially, Aramis was melancholy and thoughtful. D\u2019Artagnan asked some questions about this prolonged melancholy. Aramis pleaded as his excuse a commentary upon the eighteenth chapter of St. Augustine, which he was forced to write in Latin for the following week, and which preoccupied him a good deal. After the two friends had been chatting a few moments, a servant from M. de Treville entered, bringing a sealed packet.", " Athos bowed. \u201cAnd now, gentlemen, that\u2019s well,\u201d continued the cardinal. \u201cI know what I wish to know; follow me.\u201d The three Musketeers passed behind his Eminence, who again enveloped his face in his cloak, and put his horse in motion, keeping from eight to ten paces in advance of his four companions. They soon arrived at the silent, solitary inn. No doubt the host knew what illustrious visitor was expected, and had consequently sent intruders out of the way. Ten paces from the door the cardinal made a sign to his esquire and the three Musketeers to halt. A saddled horse was fastened to the window shutter. The cardinal knocked three times, and in a peculiar manner. A man, enveloped in a cloak, came out immediately, and exchanged some rapid words with the cardinal; after which he mounted his horse, and set off in the direction of Surgeres, which was likewise the way to Paris. \u201cAdvance, gentlemen,\u201d said the cardinal. \u201cYou have told me the truth, my gentlemen,\u201d said he, addressing the Musketeers, \u201cand it will not be my fault if our encounter this evening be not advantageous to you. In the meantime, follow me.\u201d The cardinal alighted; the three Musketeers did likewise. The cardinal threw the bridle of his horse to his esquire; the three Musketeers fastened the horses to the shutters. The host stood at the door. For him, the cardinal was only an officer coming to visit a lady. \u201cHave you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can wait near a good fire?\u201d said the cardinal.", " The host opened the door of a large room, in which an old stove had just been replaced by a large and excellent chimney. \u201cI have this,\u201d said he. \u201cThat will do,\u201d replied the cardinal. \u201cEnter, gentlemen, and be kind enough to wait for me; I shall not be more than half an hour.\u201d And while the three Musketeers entered the ground floor room, the cardinal, without asking further information, ascended the staircase like a man who has no need of having his road pointed out to him. 44 THE UTILITY OF STOVEPIPES It was evident that without suspecting it, and actuated solely by their chivalrous and adventurous character, our three friends had just rendered a service to someone the cardinal honored with his special protection. Now, who was that someone? That was the question the three Musketeers put to one another. Then, seeing that none of their replies could throw any light on the subject, Porthos called the host and asked for dice. Porthos and Aramis placed themselves at the table and began to play. Athos walked about in a contemplative mood. While thinking and walking, Athos passed and repassed before the pipe of the stove, broken in halves, the other extremity passing into the chamber above; and every time he passed and repassed he heard a murmur of words, which at length fixed his attention. Athos went close to it, and distinguished some words that appeared to merit so great an interest that he made a sign to his friends to be silent, remaining himself bent with his ear directed to the opening of the lower orifice.", " You incline me to think so,\u201d said the king. \u201cThere is no doubt they went thither to fight themselves.\u201d \u201cI do not accuse them, sire; but I leave your Majesty to judge what five armed men could possibly be going to do in such a deserted place as the neighborhood of the Convent des Carmes.\u201d \u201cYes, you are right, Treville, you are right!\u201d \u201cThen, upon seeing my Musketeers they changed their minds, and forgot their private hatred for partisan hatred; for your Majesty cannot be ignorant that the Musketeers, who belong to the king and nobody but the king, are the natural enemies of the Guardsmen, who belong to the cardinal.\u201d \u201cYes, Treville, yes,\u201d said the king, in a melancholy tone; \u201cand it is very sad, believe me, to see thus two parties in France, two heads to royalty. But all this will come to an end, Treville, will come to an end. You say, then, that the Guardsmen sought a quarrel with the Musketeers?\u201d \u201cI say that it is probable that things have fallen out so, but I will not swear to it, sire. You know how difficult it is to discover the truth; and unless a man be endowed with that admirable instinct which causes Louis XIII to be named the Just--\u201d \u201cYou are right, Treville; but they were not alone, your Musketeers. They had a youth with them?\u201d \u201cYes, sire, and one wounded man; so that three of the king\u2019s Musketeers--one of whom was wounded--and a youth not only maintained their ground against five of the most terrible of the cardinal\u2019s Guardsmen, but absolutely brought four of them to earth.\u201d \u201cWhy, this is a victory!\u201d cried the king, all radiant, \u201ca complete victory!\u201d \u201cYes, sire; as complete as that of the Bridge of Ce.\u201d \u201cFour men, one of them wounded, and a youth, say you?\u201d \u201cOne hardly a young man; but who, however, behaved himself so admirably on this occasion that I will take the liberty of recommending him to your Majesty.\u201d \u201cHow does he call himself?\u201d \u201cd\u2019Artagnan, sire; he is the son of one of my oldest friends--the son of a man who served under the king your father, of glorious memory, in the civil war.\u201d \u201cAnd you say this young man behaved himself well?"], "What does Aramis claim is his true calling?": [" D\u2019Artagnan felt a strong inclination to embrace Planchet as he had embraced him on his departure; but he feared lest this mark of affection, bestowed upon his lackey in the open street, might appear extraordinary to passers-by, and he restrained himself. \u201cI have the note,\u201d said he to Athos and to his friends. \u201cThat\u2019s well,\u201d said Athos, \u201clet us go home and read it.\u201d The note burned the hand of d\u2019Artagnan. He wished to hasten their steps; but Athos took his arm and passed it under his own, and the young man was forced to regulate his pace by that of his friend. At length they reached the tent, lit a lamp, and while Planchet stood at the entrance that the four friends might not be surprised, d\u2019Artagnan, with a trembling hand, broke the seal and opened the so anxiously expected letter. It contained half a line, in a hand perfectly British, and with a conciseness as perfectly Spartan: Thank you; be easy. d\u2019Artagnan translated this for the others. Athos took the letter from the hands of d\u2019Artagnan, approached the lamp, set fire to the paper, and did not let go till it was reduced to a cinder. Then, calling Planchet, he said, \u201cNow, my lad, you may claim your seven hundred livres, but you did not run much risk with such a note as that.\u201d \u201cI am not to blame for having tried every means to compress it,\u201d said Planchet. \u201cWell!\u201d cried d\u2019Artagnan, \u201ctell us all about it.\u201d \u201cDame, that\u2019s a long job, monsieur.\u201d \u201cYou are right, Planchet,\u201d said Athos; \u201cbesides, the tattoo has been sounded, and we should be observed if we kept a light burning much longer than the others.\u201d \u201cSo be it,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan.", " That brave and unfortunate Athos was wounded on that very shoulder against which I must run head foremost, like a ram. The only thing that astonishes me is that he did not strike me dead at once. He had good cause to do so; the pain I gave him must have been atrocious. As to Porthos--oh, as to Porthos, faith, that\u2019s a droll affair!\u201d And in spite of himself, the young man began to laugh aloud, looking round carefully, however, to see that his solitary laugh, without a cause in the eyes of passers-by, offended no one. \u201cAs to Porthos, that is certainly droll; but I am not the less a giddy fool. Are people to be run against without warning? No! And have I any right to go and peep under their cloaks to see what is not there? He would have pardoned me, he would certainly have pardoned me, if I had not said anything to him about that cursed baldric--in ambiguous words, it is true, but rather drolly ambiguous. Ah, cursed Gascon that I am, I get from one hobble into another. Friend d\u2019Artagnan,\u201d continued he, speaking to himself with all the amenity that he thought due himself, \u201cif you escape, of which there is not much chance, I would advise you to practice perfect politeness for the future. You must henceforth be admired and quoted as a model of it. To be obliging and polite does not necessarily make a man a coward. Look at Aramis, now; Aramis is mildness and grace personified. Well, did anybody ever dream of calling Aramis a coward?", " \u201cWhat is that?\u201d asked Aramis. \u201cThe leave of absence Monsieur has asked for,\u201d replied the lackey. \u201cFor me! I have asked for no leave of absence.\u201d \u201cHold your tongue and take it!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cAnd you, my friend, there is a demipistole for your trouble; you will tell Monsieur de Treville that Monsieur Aramis is very much obliged to him. Go.\u201d The lackey bowed to the ground and departed. \u201cWhat does all this mean?\u201d asked Aramis. \u201cPack up all you want for a journey of a fortnight, and follow me.\u201d \u201cBut I cannot leave Paris just now without knowing--\u201d Aramis stopped. \u201cWhat is become of her? I suppose you mean--\u201d continued d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cBecome of whom?\u201d replied Aramis. \u201cThe woman who was here--the woman with the embroidered handkerchief.\u201d \u201cWho told you there was a woman here?\u201d replied Aramis, becoming as pale as death. \u201cI saw her.\u201d \u201cAnd you know who she is?\u201d \u201cI believe I can guess, at least.\u201d \u201cListen!\u201d said Aramis. \u201cSince you appear to know so many things, can you tell me what is become of that woman?\u201d \u201cI presume that she has returned to Tours.\u201d \u201cTo Tours? Yes, that may be. You evidently know her. But why did she return to Tours without telling me anything?\u201d \u201cBecause she was in fear of being arrested.\u201d \u201cWhy has she not written to me, then?\u201d \u201cBecause she was afraid of compromising you.\u201d \u201cd\u2019Artagnan, you restore me to life!\u201d cried Aramis. \u201cI fancied myself despised, betrayed. I was so delighted to see her again!", " \u201cHave the goodness to send mine to Athos\u2019s residence. I should dread some disagreeable encounter if I were to go home.\u201d \u201cBe easy. Adieu, and a prosperous voyage. A PROPOS,\u201d said M. de Treville, calling him back. D\u2019Artagnan returned. \u201cHave you any money?\u201d D\u2019Artagnan tapped the bag he had in his pocket. \u201cEnough?\u201d asked M. de Treville. \u201cThree hundred pistoles.\u201d \u201cOh, plenty! That would carry you to the end of the world. Begone, then!\u201d D\u2019Artagnan saluted M. de Treville, who held out his hand to him; d\u2019Artagnan pressed it with a respect mixed with gratitude. Since his first arrival at Paris, he had had constant occasion to honor this excellent man, whom he had always found worthy, loyal, and great. His first visit was to Aramis, at whose residence he had not been since the famous evening on which he had followed Mme. Bonacieux. Still further, he had seldom seen the young Musketeer; but every time he had seen him, he had remarked a deep sadness imprinted on his countenance. This evening, especially, Aramis was melancholy and thoughtful. D\u2019Artagnan asked some questions about this prolonged melancholy. Aramis pleaded as his excuse a commentary upon the eighteenth chapter of St. Augustine, which he was forced to write in Latin for the following week, and which preoccupied him a good deal. After the two friends had been chatting a few moments, a servant from M. de Treville entered, bringing a sealed packet."], "Which of the following traits is not characteristic of Porthos?": [" They might have been supposed to be following tracks, so observant were they wherever they went. When they met they looked desolately at one another, as much as to say, \u201cHave you found anything?\u201d However, as Porthos had first found an idea, and had thought of it earnestly afterward, he was the first to act. He was a man of execution, this worthy Porthos. D\u2019Artagnan perceived him one day walking toward the church of St. Leu, and followed him instinctively. He entered, after having twisted his mustache and elongated his imperial, which always announced on his part the most triumphant resolutions. As d\u2019Artagnan took some precautions to conceal himself, Porthos believed he had not been seen. D\u2019Artagnan entered behind him. Porthos went and leaned against the side of a pillar. D\u2019Artagnan, still unperceived, supported himself against the other side. There happened to be a sermon, which made the church very full of people. Porthos took advantage of this circumstance to ogle the women. Thanks to the cares of Mousqueton, the exterior was far from announcing the distress of the interior. His hat was a little napless, his feather was a little faded, his gold lace was a little tarnished, his laces were a trifle frayed; but in the obscurity of the church these things were not seen, and Porthos was still the handsome Porthos. D\u2019Artagnan observed, on the bench nearest to the pillar against which Porthos leaned, a sort of ripe beauty, rather yellow and rather dry, but erect and haughty under her black hood.", " He went then to the queen, and according to custom accosted her with fresh menaces against those who surrounded her. Anne of Austria lowered her head, allowed the torrent to flow on without replying, hoping that it would cease of itself; but this was not what Louis XIII meant. Louis XIII wanted a discussion from which some light or other might break, convinced as he was that the cardinal had some afterthought and was preparing for him one of those terrible surprises which his Eminence was so skillful in getting up. He arrived at this end by his persistence in accusation. \u201cBut,\u201d cried Anne of Austria, tired of these vague attacks, \u201cbut, sire, you do not tell me all that you have in your heart. What have I done, then? Let me know what crime I have committed. It is impossible that your Majesty can make all this ado about a letter written to my brother.\u201d The king, attacked in a manner so direct, did not know what to answer; and he thought that this was the moment for expressing the desire which he was not going to have made until the evening before the fete. \u201cMadame,\u201d said he, with dignity, \u201cthere will shortly be a ball at the Hotel de Ville. I wish, in order to honor our worthy aldermen, you should appear in ceremonial costume, and above all, ornamented with the diamond studs which I gave you on your birthday. That is my answer.\u201d The answer was terrible. Anne of Austria believed that Louis XIII knew all, and that the cardinal had persuaded him to employ this long dissimulation of seven or eight days, which, likewise, was characteristic.", " \u201cNo, madame; but they who so assiduously try to buy things cheap ought to permit others to seek more generous friends.\u201d And Porthos, turning on his heel, made a step to retire. \u201cMonsieur Porthos! Monsieur Porthos!\u201d cried the procurator\u2019s wife. \u201cI have been wrong; I see it. I ought not to have driven a bargain when it was to equip a cavalier like you.\u201d Porthos, without reply, retreated a second step. The procurator\u2019s wife fancied she saw him in a brilliant cloud, all surrounded by duchesses and marchionesses, who cast bags of money at his feet. \u201cStop, in the name of heaven, Monsieur Porthos!\u201d cried she. \u201cStop, and let us talk.\u201d \u201cTalking with you brings me misfortune,\u201d said Porthos. \u201cBut, tell me, what do you ask?\u201d \u201cNothing; for that amounts to the same thing as if I asked you for something.\u201d The procurator\u2019s wife hung upon the arm of Porthos, and in the violence of her grief she cried out, \u201cMonsieur Porthos, I am ignorant of all such matters! How should I know what a horse is? How should I know what horse furniture is?\u201d \u201cYou should have left it to me, then, madame, who know what they are; but you wished to be frugal, and consequently to lend at usury.\u201d \u201cIt was wrong, Monsieur Porthos; but I will repair that wrong, upon my word of honor.\u201d \u201cHow so?\u201d asked the Musketeer. \u201cListen. This evening M. Coquenard is going to the house of the Due de Chaulnes, who has sent for him. It is for a consultation, which will last three hours at least.", " The procurator\u2019s wife took Porthos into an adjoining room, and they began to lay the basis of a reconciliation. \u201cYou can come and dine three times a week,\u201d said Mme. Coquenard. \u201cThanks, madame!\u201d said Porthos, \u201cbut I don\u2019t like to abuse your kindness; besides, I must think of my outfit!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d said the procurator\u2019s wife, groaning, \u201cthat unfortunate outfit!\u201d \u201cAlas, yes,\u201d said Porthos, \u201cit is so.\u201d \u201cBut of what, then, does the equipment of your company consist, Monsieur Porthos?\u201d \u201cOh, of many things!\u201d said Porthos. \u201cThe Musketeers are, as you know, picked soldiers, and they require many things useless to the Guardsmen or the Swiss.\u201d \u201cBut yet, detail them to me.\u201d \u201cWhy, they may amount to--\u201c, said Porthos, who preferred discussing the total to taking them one by one. The procurator\u2019s wife waited tremblingly. \u201cTo how much?\u201d said she. \u201cI hope it does not exceed--\u201d She stopped; speech failed her. \u201cOh, no,\u201d said Porthos, \u201cit does not exceed two thousand five hundred livres! I even think that with economy I could manage it with two thousand livres.\u201d \u201cGood God!\u201d cried she, \u201ctwo thousand livres! Why, that is a fortune!\u201d Porthos made a most significant grimace; Mme. Coquenard understood it. \u201cI wished to know the detail,\u201d said she, \u201cbecause, having many relatives in business, I was almost sure of obtaining things at a hundred per cent less than you would pay yourself.\u201d \u201cAh, ah!\u201d said Porthos, \u201cthat is what you meant to say!\u201d \u201cYes, dear Monsieur Porthos."], "Who is the most powerful and important person in France?": [" As you have several times since declared yourself the friend of that person, he thinks it his duty to respond to that friendship by sending you important information. Twice you have nearly been the victim of a near relative, whom you believe to be your heir because you are ignorant that before she contracted a marriage in England she was already married in France. But the third time, which is the present, you may succumb. Your relative left La Rochelle for England during the night. Watch her arrival, for she has great and terrible projects. If you require to know positively what she is capable of, read her past history on her left shoulder.\u201d \u201cWell, now that will do wonderfully well,\u201d said Athos. \u201cMy dear Aramis, you have the pen of a secretary of state. Lord de Winter will now be upon his guard if the letter should reach him; and even if it should fall into the hands of the cardinal, we shall not be compromised. But as the lackey who goes may make us believe he has been to London and may stop at Chatellerault, let us give him only half the sum promised him, with the letter, with an agreement that he shall have the other half in exchange for the reply. Have you the diamond?\u201d continued Athos. \u201cI have what is still better. I have the price;\u201d and d\u2019Artagnan threw the bag upon the table. At the sound of the gold Aramis raised his eyes and Porthos started. As to Athos, he remained unmoved.", " D\u2019Artagnan followed the soubrette with his eyes, and saw her go toward the terrace; but it happened that someone in the house called Lubin, so that Planchet remained alone, looking in all directions for the road where d\u2019Artagnan had disappeared. The maid approached Planchet, whom she took for Lubin, and holding out a little billet to him said, \u201cFor your master.\u201d \u201cFor my master?\u201d replied Planchet, astonished. \u201cYes, and important. Take it quickly.\u201d Thereupon she ran toward the carriage, which had turned round toward the way it came, jumped upon the step, and the carriage drove off. Planchet turned and returned the billet. Then, accustomed to passive obedience, he jumped down from the terrace, ran toward the lane, and at the end of twenty paces met d\u2019Artagnan, who, having seen all, was coming to him. \u201cFor you, monsieur,\u201d said Planchet, presenting the billet to the young man. \u201cFor me?\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan; \u201care you sure of that?\u201d \u201cPARDIEU, monsieur, I can\u2019t be more sure. The SOUBRETTE said, \u2018For your master.\u2019 I have no other master but you; so--a pretty little lass, my faith, is that SOUBRETTE!\u201d D\u2019Artagnan opened the letter, and read these words: \u201cA person who takes more interest in you than she is willing to confess wishes to know on what day it will suit you to walk in the forest? Tomorrow, at the Hotel Field of the Cloth of Gold, a lackey in black and red will wait for your reply.\u201d \u201cOh!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cthis is rather warm; it appears that Milady and I are anxious about the health of the same person.", " Where am I, and why am I here? If I am free, why these bars and these doors? If I am a prisoner, what crime have I committed?\u201d \u201cYou are here in the apartment destined for you, madame. I received orders to go and take charge of you on the sea, and to conduct you to this castle. This order I believe I have accomplished with all the exactness of a soldier, but also with the courtesy of a gentleman. There terminates, at least to the present moment, the duty I had to fulfill toward you; the rest concerns another person.\u201d \u201cAnd who is that other person?\u201d asked Milady, warmly. \u201cCan you not tell me his name?\u201d At the moment a great jingling of spurs was heard on the stairs. Some voices passed and faded away, and the sound of a single footstep approached the door. \u201cThat person is here, madame,\u201d said the officer, leaving the entrance open, and drawing himself up in an attitude of respect. At the same time the door opened; a man appeared on the threshold. He was without a hat, carried a sword, and flourished a handkerchief in his hand. Milady thought she recognized this shadow in the gloom; she supported herself with one hand upon the arm of the chair, and advanced her head as if to meet a certainty. The stranger advanced slowly, and as he advanced, after entering into the circle of light projected by the lamp, Milady involuntarily drew back. Then when she had no longer any doubt, she cried, in a state of stupor, \u201cWhat, my brother, is it you?\u201d \u201cYes, fair lady!\u201d replied Lord de Winter, making a bow, half courteous, half ironical; \u201cit is I, myself.\u201d \u201cBut this castle, then?\u201d \u201cIs mine.\u201d \u201cThis chamber?\u201d \u201cIs yours.\u201d \u201cI am, then, your prisoner?\u201d \u201cNearly so.\u201d \u201cBut this is a frightful abuse of power!\u201d \u201cNo high-sounding words!", " At last Louis XIII made Treville the captain of his Musketeers, who were to Louis XIII in devotedness, or rather in fanaticism, what his Ordinaries had been to Henry III, and his Scotch Guard to Louis XI. On his part, the cardinal was not behind the king in this respect. When he saw the formidable and chosen body with which Louis XIII had surrounded himself, this second, or rather this first king of France, became desirous that he, too, should have his guard. He had his Musketeers therefore, as Louis XIII had his, and these two powerful rivals vied with each other in procuring, not only from all the provinces of France, but even from all foreign states, the most celebrated swordsmen. It was not uncommon for Richelieu and Louis XIII to dispute over their evening game of chess upon the merits of their servants. Each boasted the bearing and the courage of his own people. While exclaiming loudly against duels and brawls, they excited them secretly to quarrel, deriving an immoderate satisfaction or genuine regret from the success or defeat of their own combatants. We learn this from the memoirs of a man who was concerned in some few of these defeats and in many of these victories. Treville had grasped the weak side of his master; and it was to this address that he owed the long and constant favor of a king who has not left the reputation behind him of being very faithful in his friendships."], "As the novel opens, where is the young D\u2019Artagnan about to go make his fortune?": [" I understand why you accepted it, and I grant you my pardon; but upon one condition.\u201d \u201cWhat is that?\u201d said the soldier, uneasy at perceiving that all was not over. \u201cThat you will go and fetch me the letter your comrade has in his pocket.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d cried the bandit, \u201cthat is only another way of killing me. How can I go and fetch that letter under the fire of the bastion?\u201d \u201cYou must nevertheless make up your mind to go and get it, or I swear you shall die by my hand.\u201d \u201cPardon, monsieur; pity! In the name of that young lady you love, and whom you perhaps believe dead but who is not!\u201d cried the bandit, throwing himself upon his knees and leaning upon his hand--for he began to lose his strength with his blood. \u201cAnd how do you know there is a young woman whom I love, and that I believed that woman dead?\u201d asked d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cBy that letter which my comrade has in his pocket.\u201d \u201cYou see, then,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cthat I must have that letter. So no more delay, no more hesitation; or else whatever may be my repugnance to soiling my sword a second time with the blood of a wretch like you, I swear by my faith as an honest man--\u201d and at these words d\u2019Artagnan made so fierce a gesture that the wounded man sprang up. \u201cStop, stop!\u201d cried he, regaining strength by force of terror. \u201cI will go--I will go!\u201d D\u2019Artagnan took the soldier\u2019s arquebus, made him go on before him, and urged him toward his companion by pricking him behind with his sword.", " Bonacieux looked earnestly at the young man. \u201cAnd if I give you this password,\u201d said she, \u201cwould you forget it as soon as you used it?\u201d \u201cBy my honor, by the faith of a gentleman!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, with an accent so truthful that no one could mistake it. \u201cThen I believe you. You appear to be a brave young man; besides, your fortune may perhaps be the result of your devotedness.\u201d \u201cI will do, without a promise and voluntarily, all that I can do to serve the king and be agreeable to the queen. Dispose of me, then, as a friend.\u201d \u201cBut I--where shall I go meanwhile?\u201d \u201cIs there nobody from whose house Monsieur Laporte can come and fetch you?\u201d \u201cNo, I can trust nobody.\u201d \u201cStop,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cwe are near Athos\u2019s door. Yes, here it is.\u201d \u201cWho is this Athos?\u201d \u201cOne of my friends.\u201d \u201cBut if he should be at home and see me?\u201d \u201cHe is not at home, and I will carry away the key, after having placed you in his apartment.\u201d \u201cBut if he should return?\u201d \u201cOh, he won\u2019t return; and if he should, he will be told that I have brought a woman with me, and that woman is in his apartment.\u201d \u201cBut that will compromise me sadly, you know.\u201d \u201cOf what consequence? Nobody knows you. Besides, we are in a situation to overlook ceremony.\u201d \u201cCome, then, let us go to your friend\u2019s house. Where does he live?\u201d \u201cRue Ferou, two steps from here.\u201d \u201cLet us go!\u201d Both resumed their way. As d\u2019Artagnan had foreseen, Athos was not within.", " I will be silent, but you must endure your captivity quietly. In fifteen or twenty days I shall set out for La Rochelle with the army; but on the eve of my departure a vessel which I shall see depart will take you hence and convey you to our colonies in the south. And be assured that you shall be accompanied by one who will blow your brains out at the first attempt you make to return to England or the Continent.\u201d Milady listened with an attention that dilated her inflamed eyes. \u201cYes, at present,\u201d continued Lord de Winter, \u201cyou will remain in this castle. The walls are thick, the doors strong, and the bars solid; besides, your window opens immediately over the sea. The men of my crew, who are devoted to me for life and death, mount guard around this apartment, and watch all the passages that lead to the courtyard. Even if you gained the yard, there would still be three iron gates for you to pass. The order is positive. A step, a gesture, a word, on your part, denoting an effort to escape, and you are to be fired upon. If they kill you, English justice will be under an obligation to me for having saved it trouble. Ah! I see your features regain their calmness, your countenance recovers its assurance. You are saying to yourself: \u2018Fifteen days, twenty days? Bah! I have an inventive mind; before that is expired some idea will occur to me. I have an infernal spirit. I shall meet with a victim.", " All this was answered by an expression of d\u2019Artagnan\u2019s. \u201cTomorrow,\u201d said he, \u201cyou will be avenged, or I shall be dead.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said she, \u201cyou will avenge me; but you will not be dead. He is a coward.\u201d \u201cWith women, perhaps; but not with men. I know something of him.\u201d \u201cBut it seems you had not much reason to complain of your fortune in your contest with him.\u201d \u201cFortune is a courtesan; favorable yesterday, she may turn her back tomorrow.\u201d \u201cWhich means that you now hesitate?\u201d \u201cNo, I do not hesitate; God forbid! But would it be just to allow me to go to a possible death without having given me at least something more than hope?\u201d Milady answered by a glance which said, \u201cIs that all?--speak, then.\u201d And then accompanying the glance with explanatory words, \u201cThat is but too just,\u201d said she, tenderly. \u201cOh, you are an angel!\u201d exclaimed the young man. \u201cThen all is agreed?\u201d said she. \u201cExcept that which I ask of you, dear love.\u201d \u201cBut when I assure you that you may rely on my tenderness?\u201d \u201cI cannot wait till tomorrow.\u201d \u201cSilence! I hear my brother. It will be useless for him to find you here.\u201d She rang the bell and Kitty appeared. \u201cGo out this way,\u201d said she, opening a small private door, \u201cand come back at eleven o\u2019clock; we will then terminate this conversation. Kitty will conduct you to my chamber.\u201d The poor girl almost fainted at hearing these words. \u201cWell, mademoiselle, what are you thinking about, standing there like a statue?"], "What does the gentleman in Meung steal from D\u2019Artagnan after having him beaten up?": [" From that moment I have neither seen nor heard anything.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan, entirely overcome by this terrible story, remained motionless and mute, while all the demons of anger and jealousy were howling in his heart. \u201cBut, my good gentleman,\u201d resumed the old man, upon whom this mute despair certainly produced a greater effect than cries and tears would have done, \u201cdo not take on so; they did not kill her, and that\u2019s a comfort.\u201d \u201cCan you guess,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cwho was the man who headed this infernal expedition?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know him.\u201d \u201cBut as you spoke to him you must have seen him.\u201d \u201cOh, it\u2019s a description you want?\u201d \u201cExactly so.\u201d \u201cA tall, dark man, with black mustaches, dark eyes, and the air of a gentleman.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the man!\u201d cried d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cagain he, forever he! He is my demon, apparently. And the other?\u201d \u201cWhich?\u201d \u201cThe short one.\u201d \u201cOh, he was not a gentleman, I\u2019ll answer for it; besides, he did not wear a sword, and the others treated him with small consideration.\u201d \u201cSome lackey,\u201d murmured d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cPoor woman, poor woman, what have they done with you?\u201d \u201cYou have promised to be secret, my good monsieur?\u201d said the old man. \u201cAnd I renew my promise. Be easy, I am a gentleman. A gentleman has but his word, and I have given you mine.\u201d With a heavy heart, d\u2019Artagnan again bent his way toward the ferry. Sometimes he hoped it could not be Mme. Bonacieux, and that he should find her next day at the Louvre; sometimes he feared she had had an intrigue with another, who, in a jealous fit, had surprised her and carried her off.", " They made all speed to come up to this gentleman, who appeared to be in great haste. His boots were covered with dust, and he inquired if he could not instantly cross over to England. \u201cNothing would be more easy,\u201d said the captain of a vessel ready to set sail, \u201cbut this morning came an order to let no one leave without express permission from the cardinal.\u201d \u201cI have that permission,\u201d said the gentleman, drawing the paper from his pocket; \u201chere it is.\u201d \u201cHave it examined by the governor of the port,\u201d said the shipmaster, \u201cand give me the preference.\u201d \u201cWhere shall I find the governor?\u201d \u201cAt his country house.\u201d \u201cAnd that is situated?\u201d \u201cAt a quarter of a league from the city. Look, you may see it from here--at the foot of that little hill, that slated roof.\u201d \u201cVery well,\u201d said the gentleman. And, with his lackey, he took the road to the governor\u2019s country house. D\u2019Artagnan and Planchet followed the gentleman at a distance of five hundred paces. Once outside the city, d\u2019Artagnan overtook the gentleman as he was entering a little wood. \u201cMonsieur, you appear to be in great haste?\u201d \u201cNo one can be more so, monsieur.\u201d \u201cI am sorry for that,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cfor as I am in great haste likewise, I wish to beg you to render me a service.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cTo let me sail first.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s impossible,\u201d said the gentleman; \u201cI have traveled sixty leagues in forty hours, and by tomorrow at midday I must be in London.\u201d \u201cI have performed that same distance in forty hours, and by ten o\u2019clock in the morning I must be in London.\u201d \u201cVery sorry, monsieur; but I was here first, and will not sail second.\u201d \u201cI am sorry, too, monsieur; but I arrived second, and must sail first.\u201d \u201cThe king\u2019s service!\u201d said the gentleman.", " You are rich then, my dear Monsieur Bonacieux?\u201d \u201cI am comfortably off, monsieur, that\u2019s all; I have scraped together some such things as an income of two or three thousand crowns in the haberdashery business, but more particularly in venturing some funds in the last voyage of the celebrated navigator Jean Moquet; so that you understand, monsieur--But!--\u201d cried the citizen. \u201cWhat!\u201d demanded d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cWhom do I see yonder?\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d \u201cIn the street, facing your window, in the embrasure of that door--a man wrapped in a cloak.\u201d \u201cIt is he!\u201d cried d\u2019Artagnan and the citizen at the same time, each having recognized his man. \u201cAh, this time,\u201d cried d\u2019Artagnan, springing to his sword, \u201cthis time he will not escape me!\u201d Drawing his sword from its scabbard, he rushed out of the apartment. On the staircase he met Athos and Porthos, who were coming to see him. They separated, and d\u2019Artagnan rushed between them like a dart. \u201cPah! Where are you going?\u201d cried the two Musketeers in a breath. \u201cThe man of Meung!\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan, and disappeared. D\u2019Artagnan had more than once related to his friends his adventure with the stranger, as well as the apparition of the beautiful foreigner, to whom this man had confided some important missive. The opinion of Athos was that d\u2019Artagnan had lost his letter in the skirmish. A gentleman, in his opinion--and according to d\u2019Artagnan\u2019s portrait of him, the stranger must be a gentleman--would be incapable of the baseness of stealing a letter.", " Don Quixote took windmills for giants, and sheep for armies; d\u2019Artagnan took every smile for an insult, and every look as a provocation--whence it resulted that from Tarbes to Meung his fist was constantly doubled, or his hand on the hilt of his sword; and yet the fist did not descend upon any jaw, nor did the sword issue from its scabbard. It was not that the sight of the wretched pony did not excite numerous smiles on the countenances of passers-by; but as against the side of this pony rattled a sword of respectable length, and as over this sword gleamed an eye rather ferocious than haughty, these passers-by repressed their hilarity, or if hilarity prevailed over prudence, they endeavored to laugh only on one side, like the masks of the ancients. D\u2019Artagnan, then, remained majestic and intact in his susceptibility, till he came to this unlucky city of Meung. But there, as he was alighting from his horse at the gate of the Jolly Miller, without anyone--host, waiter, or hostler--coming to hold his stirrup or take his horse, d\u2019Artagnan spied, though an open window on the ground floor, a gentleman, well-made and of good carriage, although of rather a stern countenance, talking with two persons who appeared to listen to him with respect. D\u2019Artagnan fancied quite naturally, according to his custom, that he must be the object of their conversation, and listened. This time d\u2019Artagnan was only in part mistaken; he himself was not in question, but his horse was."], "Who does D\u2019Artagnan first visit upon reaching Paris?": [" She found M. Bonacieux alone; the poor man was recovering with difficulty the order in his house, in which he had found most of the furniture broken and the closets nearly emptied--justice not being one of the three things which King Solomon names as leaving no traces of their passage. As to the servant, she had run away at the moment of her master\u2019s arrest. Terror had had such an effect upon the poor girl that she had never ceased walking from Paris till she reached Burgundy, her native place. The worthy mercer had, immediately upon re-entering his house, informed his wife of his happy return, and his wife had replied by congratulating him, and telling him that the first moment she could steal from her duties should be devoted to paying him a visit. This first moment had been delayed five days, which, under any other circumstances, might have appeared rather long to M. Bonacieux; but he had, in the visit he had made to the cardinal and in the visits Rochefort had made him, ample subjects for reflection, and as everybody knows, nothing makes time pass more quickly than reflection. This was the more so because Bonacieux\u2019s reflections were all rose-colored. Rochefort called him his friend, his dear Bonacieux, and never ceased telling him that the cardinal had a great respect for him. The mercer fancied himself already on the high road to honors and fortune. On her side Mme. Bonacieux had also reflected; but, it must be admitted, upon something widely different from ambition.", " Besides, the wheels of a carriage, which appeared to have come from Paris, had made a deep impression in the soft earth, which did not extend beyond the pavilion, but turned again toward Paris. At length d\u2019Artagnan, in pursuing his researches, found near the wall a woman\u2019s torn glove. This glove, wherever it had not touched the muddy ground, was of irreproachable odor. It was one of those perfumed gloves that lovers like to snatch from a pretty hand. As d\u2019Artagnan pursued his investigations, a more abundant and more icy sweat rolled in large drops from his forehead; his heart was oppressed by a horrible anguish; his respiration was broken and short. And yet he said, to reassure himself, that this pavilion perhaps had nothing in common with Mme. Bonacieux; that the young woman had made an appointment with him before the pavilion, and not in the pavilion; that she might have been detained in Paris by her duties, or perhaps by the jealousy of her husband. But all these reasons were combated, destroyed, overthrown, by that feeling of intimate pain which, on certain occasions, takes possession of our being, and cries to us so as to be understood unmistakably that some great misfortune is hanging over us. Then d\u2019Artagnan became almost wild. He ran along the high road, took the path he had before taken, and reaching the ferry, interrogated the boatman. About seven o\u2019clock in the evening, the boatman had taken over a young woman, wrapped in a black mantle, who appeared to be very anxious not to be recognized; but entirely on account of her precautions, the boatman had paid more attention to her and discovered that she was young and pretty.", " \u201cHave the goodness to send mine to Athos\u2019s residence. I should dread some disagreeable encounter if I were to go home.\u201d \u201cBe easy. Adieu, and a prosperous voyage. A PROPOS,\u201d said M. de Treville, calling him back. D\u2019Artagnan returned. \u201cHave you any money?\u201d D\u2019Artagnan tapped the bag he had in his pocket. \u201cEnough?\u201d asked M. de Treville. \u201cThree hundred pistoles.\u201d \u201cOh, plenty! That would carry you to the end of the world. Begone, then!\u201d D\u2019Artagnan saluted M. de Treville, who held out his hand to him; d\u2019Artagnan pressed it with a respect mixed with gratitude. Since his first arrival at Paris, he had had constant occasion to honor this excellent man, whom he had always found worthy, loyal, and great. His first visit was to Aramis, at whose residence he had not been since the famous evening on which he had followed Mme. Bonacieux. Still further, he had seldom seen the young Musketeer; but every time he had seen him, he had remarked a deep sadness imprinted on his countenance. This evening, especially, Aramis was melancholy and thoughtful. D\u2019Artagnan asked some questions about this prolonged melancholy. Aramis pleaded as his excuse a commentary upon the eighteenth chapter of St. Augustine, which he was forced to write in Latin for the following week, and which preoccupied him a good deal. After the two friends had been chatting a few moments, a servant from M. de Treville entered, bringing a sealed packet.", " \u201cYou were recommended to Monsieur de Treville, were you not?\u201d \u201cYes, monseigneur; but in that unfortunate affair at Meung--\u201d \u201cThe letter was lost,\u201d replied his Eminence; \u201cyes, I know that. But Monsieur de Treville is a skilled physiognomist, who knows men at first sight; and he placed you in the company of his brother-in-law, Monsieur Dessessart, leaving you to hope that one day or other you should enter the Musketeers.\u201d \u201cMonseigneur is correctly informed,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cSince that time many things have happened to you. You were walking one day behind the Chartreux, when it would have been better if you had been elsewhere. Then you took with your friends a journey to the waters of Forges; they stopped on the road, but you continued yours. That is all very simple: you had business in England.\u201d \u201cMonseigneur,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, quite confused, \u201cI went--\u201d \u201cHunting at Windsor, or elsewhere--that concerns nobody. I know, because it is my office to know everything. On your return you were received by an august personage, and I perceive with pleasure that you preserve the souvenir she gave you.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan placed his hand upon the queen\u2019s diamond, which he wore, and quickly turned the stone inward; but it was too late. \u201cThe day after that, you received a visit from Cavois,\u201d resumed the cardinal. \u201cHe went to desire you to come to the palace. You have not returned that visit, and you were wrong.\u201d \u201cMonseigneur, I feared I had incurred disgrace with your Eminence.\u201d \u201cHow could that be, monsieur?"], "How does de Treville initially treat Aramis and Porthos for their unsuccessful skirmish with the Cardinal\u2019s guards?": [" \u201cGentlemen,\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cI have already received by Monsieur de Cavois a similar invitation from his Eminence. I neglected it, and on the morrow a serious misfortune happened to me--Constance disappeared. Whatever may ensue, I will go.\u201d \u201cIf you are determined,\u201d said Athos, \u201cdo so.\u201d \u201cBut the Bastille?\u201d said Aramis. \u201cBah! you will get me out if they put me there,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cTo be sure we will,\u201d replied Aramis and Porthos, with admirable promptness and decision, as if that were the simplest thing in the world, \u201cto be sure we will get you out; but meantime, as we are to set off the day after tomorrow, you would do much better not to risk this Bastille.\u201d \u201cLet us do better than that,\u201d said Athos; \u201cdo not let us leave him during the whole evening. Let each of us wait at a gate of the palace with three Musketeers behind him; if we see a close carriage, at all suspicious in appearance, come out, let us fall upon it. It is a long time since we have had a skirmish with the Guards of Monsieur the Cardinal; Monsieur de Treville must think us dead.\u201d \u201cTo a certainty, Athos,\u201d said Aramis, \u201cyou were meant to be a general of the army! What do you think of the plan, gentlemen?\u201d \u201cAdmirable!\u201d replied the young men in chorus. \u201cWell,\u201d said Porthos, \u201cI will run to the hotel, and engage our comrades to hold themselves in readiness by eight o\u2019clock; the rendezvous, the Place du Palais-Cardinal.", " Returned home with Athos, Aramis and Porthos inquired eagerly the cause of the strange interview; but d\u2019Artagnan confined himself to telling them that M. de Richelieu had sent for him to propose to him to enter into his guards with the rank of ensign, and that he had refused. \u201cAnd you were right,\u201d cried Aramis and Porthos, with one voice. Athos fell into a profound reverie and answered nothing. But when they were alone he said, \u201cYou have done that which you ought to have done, d\u2019Artagnan; but perhaps you have been wrong.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan sighed deeply, for this voice responded to a secret voice of his soul, which told him that great misfortunes awaited him. The whole of the next day was spent in preparations for departure. D\u2019Artagnan went to take leave of M. de Treville. At that time it was believed that the separation of the Musketeers and the Guards would be but momentary, the king holding his Parliament that very day and proposing to set out the day after. M. de Treville contented himself with asking d\u2019Artagnan if he could do anything for him, but d\u2019Artagnan answered that he was supplied with all he wanted. That night brought together all those comrades of the Guards of M. Dessessart and the company of Musketeers of M. de Treville who had been accustomed to associate together. They were parting to meet again when it pleased God, and if it pleased God. That night, then, was somewhat riotous, as may be imagined.", " She appeared to take a great interest in him, asked him whence he came, who were his friends, and whether he had not sometimes thought of attaching himself to the cardinal. D\u2019Artagnan, who, as we have said, was exceedingly prudent for a young man of twenty, then remembered his suspicions regarding Milady. He launched into a eulogy of his Eminence, and said that he should not have failed to enter into the Guards of the cardinal instead of the king\u2019s Guards if he had happened to know M. de Cavois instead of M. de Treville. Milady changed the conversation without any appearance of affectation, and asked d\u2019Artagnan in the most careless manner possible if he had ever been in England. D\u2019Artagnan replied that he had been sent thither by M. de Treville to treat for a supply of horses, and that he had brought back four as specimens. Milady in the course of the conversation twice or thrice bit her lips; she had to deal with a Gascon who played close. At the same hour as on the preceding evening, d\u2019Artagnan retired. In the corridor he again met the pretty Kitty; that was the name of the SOUBRETTE. She looked at him with an expression of kindness which it was impossible to mistake; but d\u2019Artagnan was so preoccupied by the mistress that he noticed absolutely nothing but her. D\u2019Artagnan came again on the morrow and the day after that, and each day Milady gave him a more gracious reception. Every evening, either in the antechamber, the corridor, or on the stairs, he met the pretty SOUBRETTE.", " M. de Treville was about to reprehend this breach of the rules of etiquette, when he felt the hand of Athos, who had rallied all his energies to contend against pain, at length overcome by it, fell upon the floor as if he were dead. \u201cA surgeon!\u201d cried M. de Treville, \u201cmine! The king\u2019s! The best! A surgeon! Or, s\u2019blood, my brave Athos will die!\u201d At the cries of M. de Treville, the whole assemblage rushed into the cabinet, he not thinking to shut the door against anyone, and all crowded round the wounded man. But all this eager attention might have been useless if the doctor so loudly called for had not chanced to be in the hotel. He pushed through the crowd, approached Athos, still insensible, and as all this noise and commotion inconvenienced him greatly, he required, as the first and most urgent thing, that the Musketeer should be carried into an adjoining chamber. Immediately M. de Treville opened and pointed the way to Porthos and Aramis, who bore their comrade in their arms. Behind this group walked the surgeon; and behind the surgeon the door closed. The cabinet of M. de Treville, generally held so sacred, became in an instant the annex of the antechamber. Everyone spoke, harangued, and vociferated, swearing, cursing, and consigning the cardinal and his Guards to all the devils. An instant after, Porthos and Aramis re-entered, the surgeon and M. de Treville alone remaining with the wounded."], "What does D\u2019Artagnan do when he spots the Man from Meung during his interview with de Treville?": [" \u201cAlas, sir,\u201d said he, \u201cI cannot but perceive how sadly I miss the letter of introduction which my father gave me to present to you.\u201d \u201cI certainly am surprised,\u201d replied M. de Treville, \u201cthat you should undertake so long a journey without that necessary passport, the sole resource of us poor Bearnese.\u201d \u201cI had one, sir, and, thank God, such as I could wish,\u201d cried d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cbut it was perfidiously stolen from me.\u201d He then related the adventure of Meung, described the unknown gentleman with the greatest minuteness, and all with a warmth and truthfulness that delighted M. de Treville. \u201cThis is all very strange,\u201d said M. de Treville, after meditating a minute; \u201cyou mentioned my name, then, aloud?\u201d \u201cYes, sir, I certainly committed that imprudence; but why should I have done otherwise? A name like yours must be as a buckler to me on my way. Judge if I should not put myself under its protection.\u201d Flattery was at that period very current, and M. de Treville loved incense as well as a king, or even a cardinal. He could not refrain from a smile of visible satisfaction; but this smile soon disappeared, and returning to the adventure of Meung, \u201cTell me,\u201d continued he, \u201chad not this gentlemen a slight scar on his cheek?\u201d \u201cYes, such a one as would be made by the grazing of a ball.\u201d \u201cWas he not a fine-looking man?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cOf lofty stature.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cOf pale complexion and brown hair?\u201d \u201cYes, yes, that is he; how is it, sir, that you are acquainted with this man?", " All the events we have described had taken place within a half hour. Everything fell out as Mme. Bonacieux prophesied. On hearing the password, Germain bowed. In a few minutes, Laporte was at the lodge; in two words d\u2019Artagnan informed him where Mme. Bonacieux was. Laporte assured himself, by having it twice repeated, of the accurate address, and set off at a run. Hardly, however, had he taken ten steps before he returned. \u201cYoung man,\u201d said he to d\u2019Artagnan, \u201ca suggestion.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cYou may get into trouble by what has taken place.\u201d \u201cYou believe so?\u201d \u201cYes. Have you any friend whose clock is too slow?\u201d \u201cWell?\u201d \u201cGo and call upon him, in order that he may give evidence of your having been with him at half past nine. In a court of justice that is called an alibi.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan found his advice prudent. He took to his heels, and was soon at M. de Treville\u2019s; but instead of going into the saloon with the rest of the crowd, he asked to be introduced to M. de Treville\u2019s office. As d\u2019Artagnan so constantly frequented the hotel, no difficulty was made in complying with his request, and a servant went to inform M. de Treville that his young compatriot, having something important to communicate, solicited a private audience. Five minutes after, M. de Treville was asking d\u2019Artagnan what he could do to serve him, and what caused his visit at so late an hour. \u201cPardon me, monsieur,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, who had profited by the moment he had been left alone to put back M. de Treville\u2019s clock three-quarters of an hour, \u201cbut I thought, as it was yet only twenty-five minutes past nine, it was not too late to wait upon you.\u201d \u201cTwenty-five minutes past nine!\u201d cried M. de Treville, looking at the clock; \u201cwhy, that\u2019s impossible!\u201d \u201cLook, rather, monsieur,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cthe clock shows it.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d said M. de Treville; \u201cI believed it later.", " Returned home with Athos, Aramis and Porthos inquired eagerly the cause of the strange interview; but d\u2019Artagnan confined himself to telling them that M. de Richelieu had sent for him to propose to him to enter into his guards with the rank of ensign, and that he had refused. \u201cAnd you were right,\u201d cried Aramis and Porthos, with one voice.

In fact, ten minutes had scarcely passed away when the door of the king\u2019s closet opened, and M. de Treville saw M. de la Tremouille come out. The duke came straight up to him, and said: \u201cMonsieur de Treville, his Majesty has just sent for me in order to inquire respecting the circumstances which took place yesterday at my hotel. I have told him the truth; that is to say, that the fault lay with my people, and that I was ready to offer you my excuses. Since I have the good fortune to meet you, I beg you to receive them, and to hold me always as one of your friends.\u201d \u201cMonsieur the Duke,\u201d said M. de Treville, \u201cI was so confident of your loyalty that I required no other defender before his Majesty than yourself. I find that I have not been mistaken, and I thank you that there is still one man in France of whom may be said, without disappointment, what I have said of you.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s well said,\u201d cried the king, who had heard all these compliments through the open door; \u201conly tell him, Treville, since he wishes to be considered your friend, that I also wish to be one of his, but he neglects me; that it is nearly three years since I have seen him, and that I never do see him unless I send for him. Tell him all this for me, for these are things which a king cannot say for himself.\u201d \u201cThanks, sire, thanks,\u201d said the duke; \u201cbut your Majesty may be assured that it is not those--I do not speak of Monsieur de Treville--whom your Majesty sees at all hours of the day that are most devoted to you.\u201d \u201cAh!"], "How does D\u2019Artagnan anger Porthos as he pursues the Man from Meung?": [" Milady therefore continued, coloring her narrations more and more. \u201cI am very ignorant of these matters,\u201d said the abbess, at length; \u201cbut however distant from the court we may be, however remote from the interests of the world we may be placed, we have very sad examples of what you have related. And one of our boarders has suffered much from the vengeance and persecution of the cardinal!\u201d \u201cOne of your boarders?\u201d said Milady; \u201coh, my God! Poor woman! I pity her, then.\u201d \u201cAnd you have reason, for she is much to be pitied. Imprisonment, menaces, ill treatment-she has suffered everything. But after all,\u201d resumed the abbess, \u201cMonsieur Cardinal has perhaps plausible motives for acting thus; and though she has the look of an angel, we must not always judge people by the appearance.\u201d \u201cGood!\u201d said Milady to herself; \u201cwho knows! I am about, perhaps, to discover something here; I am in the vein.\u201d She tried to give her countenance an appearance of perfect candor. \u201cAlas,\u201d said Milady, \u201cI know it is so. It is said that we must not trust to the face; but in what, then, shall we place confidence, if not in the most beautiful work of the Lord?

But your wife, monsieur, what has she to do with all this?\u201d \u201cHer devotion to the queen is known; and they wish either to remove her from her mistress, or to intimidate her, in order to obtain her Majesty\u2019s secrets, or to seduce her and make use of her as a spy.\u201d \u201cThat is likely,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cbut the man who has abducted her--do you know him?\u201d \u201cI have told you that I believe I know him.\u201d \u201cHis name?\u201d \u201cI do not know that; what I do know is that he is a creature of the cardinal, his evil genius.\u201d \u201cBut you have seen him?\u201d \u201cYes, my wife pointed him out to me one day.\u201d \u201cHas he anything remarkable about him by which one may recognize him?\u201d \u201cOh, certainly; he is a noble of very lofty carriage, black hair, swarthy complexion, piercing eye, white teeth, and has a scar on his temple.\u201d \u201cA scar on his temple!\u201d cried d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cand with that, white teeth, a piercing eye, dark complexion, black hair, and haughty carriage--why, that\u2019s my man of Meung.\u201d \u201cHe is your man, do you say?\u201d \u201cYes, yes; but that has nothing to do with it.", " You are rich then, my dear Monsieur Bonacieux?\u201d \u201cI am comfortably off, monsieur, that\u2019s all; I have scraped together some such things as an income of two or three thousand crowns in the haberdashery business, but more particularly in venturing some funds in the last voyage of the celebrated navigator Jean Moquet; so that you understand, monsieur--But!--\u201d cried the citizen. \u201cWhat!\u201d demanded d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cWhom do I see yonder?\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d \u201cIn the street, facing your window, in the embrasure of that door--a man wrapped in a cloak.\u201d \u201cIt is he!\u201d cried d\u2019Artagnan and the citizen at the same time, each having recognized his man. \u201cAh, this time,\u201d cried d\u2019Artagnan, springing to his sword, \u201cthis time he will not escape me!\u201d Drawing his sword from its scabbard, he rushed out of the apartment. On the staircase he met Athos and Porthos, who were coming to see him. They separated, and d\u2019Artagnan rushed between them like a dart. \u201cPah! Where are you going?\u201d cried the two Musketeers in a breath. \u201cThe man of Meung!\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan, and disappeared. D\u2019Artagnan had more than once related to his friends his adventure with the stranger, as well as the apparition of the beautiful foreigner, to whom this man had confided some important missive. The opinion of Athos was that d\u2019Artagnan had lost his letter in the skirmish. A gentleman, in his opinion--and according to d\u2019Artagnan\u2019s portrait of him, the stranger must be a gentleman--would be incapable of the baseness of stealing a letter.", " Alas, like most things in this world which have nothing in their favor but appearances, the baldric was glittering with gold in the front, but was nothing but simple buff behind. Vainglorious as he was, Porthos could not afford to have a baldric wholly of gold, but had at least half. One could comprehend the necessity of the cold and the urgency of the cloak. \u201cBless me!\u201d cried Porthos, making strong efforts to disembarrass himself of d\u2019Artagnan, who was wriggling about his back; \u201cyou must be mad to run against people in this manner.\u201d \u201cExcuse me,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, reappearing under the shoulder of the giant, \u201cbut I am in such haste--I was running after someone and--\u201d \u201cAnd do you always forget your eyes when you run?\u201d asked Porthos. \u201cNo,\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan, piqued, \u201cand thanks to my eyes, I can see what other people cannot see.\u201d Whether Porthos understood him or did not understand him, giving way to his anger, \u201cMonsieur,\u201d said he, \u201cyou stand a chance of getting chastised if you rub Musketeers in this fashion.\u201d \u201cChastised, Monsieur!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cthe expression is strong.\u201d \u201cIt is one that becomes a man accustomed to look his enemies in the face.\u201d \u201cAh, PARDIEU! I know full well that you don\u2019t turn your back to yours.\u201d And the young man, delighted with his joke, went away laughing loudly. Porthos foamed with rage, and made a movement to rush after d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cPresently, presently,\u201d cried the latter, \u201cwhen you haven\u2019t your cloak on.\u201d \u201cAt one o\u2019clock, then, behind the Luxembourg.\u201d \u201cVery well, at one o\u2019clock, then,\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan, turning the angle of the street."], "Who does D\u2019Artagnan schedule a duel with as he pursues the Man from Meung?": [" Milady therefore continued, coloring her narrations more and more. \u201cI am very ignorant of these matters,\u201d said the abbess, at length; \u201cbut however distant from the court we may be, however remote from the interests of the world we may be placed, we have very sad examples of what you have related.

A name like yours must be as a buckler to me on my way. Judge if I should not put myself under its protection.\u201d Flattery was at that period very current, and M. de Treville loved incense as well as a king, or even a cardinal. He could not refrain from a smile of visible satisfaction; but this smile soon disappeared, and returning to the adventure of Meung, \u201cTell me,\u201d continued he, \u201chad not this gentlemen a slight scar on his cheek?\u201d \u201cYes, such a one as would be made by the grazing of a ball.\u201d \u201cWas he not a fine-looking man?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cOf lofty stature.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cOf pale complexion and brown hair?\u201d \u201cYes, yes, that is he; how is it, sir, that you are acquainted with this man?"], "What outcome does D\u2019Artagnan anticipate after scheduling duels with all three Musketeers?": [" But neither in the street he had passed through, nor in the one which his eager glance pervaded, could he see anyone; however slowly the stranger had walked, he was gone on his way, or perhaps had entered some house. D\u2019Artagnan inquired of everyone he met with, went down to the ferry, came up again by the Rue de Seine, and the Red Cross; but nothing, absolutely nothing! This chase was, however, advantageous to him in one sense, for in proportion as the perspiration broke from his forehead, his heart began to cool. He began to reflect upon the events that had passed; they were numerous and inauspicious. It was scarcely eleven o\u2019clock in the morning, and yet this morning had already brought him into disgrace with M. de Treville, who could not fail to think the manner in which d\u2019Artagnan had left him a little cavalier. Besides this, he had drawn upon himself two good duels with two men, each capable of killing three d\u2019Artagnans--with two Musketeers, in short, with two of those beings whom he esteemed so greatly that he placed them in his mind and heart above all other men. The outlook was sad. Sure of being killed by Athos, it may easily be understood that the young man was not very uneasy about Porthos. As hope, however, is the last thing extinguished in the heart of man, he finished by hoping that he might survive, even though with terrible wounds, in both these duels; and in case of surviving, he made the following reprehensions upon his own conduct: \u201cWhat a madcap I was, and what a stupid fellow I am!", " In addition to this, d\u2019Artagnan possessed that invincible stock of resolution which the counsels of his father had implanted in his heart: \u201cEndure nothing from anyone but the king, the cardinal, and Monsieur de Treville.\u201d He flew, then, rather than walked, toward the convent of the Carmes Dechausses, or rather Deschaux, as it was called at that period, a sort of building without a window, surrounded by barren fields--an accessory to the Preaux-Clercs, and which was generally employed as the place for the duels of men who had no time to lose. When d\u2019Artagnan arrived in sight of the bare spot of ground which extended along the foot of the monastery, Athos had been waiting about five minutes, and twelve o\u2019clock was striking. He was, then, as punctual as the Samaritan woman, and the most rigorous casuist with regard to duels could have nothing to say. Athos, who still suffered grievously from his wound, though it had been dressed anew by M. de Treville\u2019s surgeon, was seated on a post and waiting for his adversary with hat in hand, his feather even touching the ground. \u201cMonsieur,\u201d said Athos, \u201cI have engaged two of my friends as seconds; but these two friends are not yet come, at which I am astonished, as it is not at all their custom.\u201d \u201cI have no seconds on my part, monsieur,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cfor having only arrived yesterday in Paris, I as yet know no one but Monsieur de Treville, to whom I was recommended by my father, who has the honor to be, in some degree, one of his friends.\u201d Athos reflected for an instant.", " Athos bowed. \u201cAnd now, gentlemen, that\u2019s well,\u201d continued the cardinal. \u201cI know what I wish to know; follow me.\u201d The three Musketeers passed behind his Eminence, who again enveloped his face in his cloak, and put his horse in motion, keeping from eight to ten paces in advance of his four companions. They soon arrived at the silent, solitary inn. No doubt the host knew what illustrious visitor was expected, and had consequently sent intruders out of the way. Ten paces from the door the cardinal made a sign to his esquire and the three Musketeers to halt. A saddled horse was fastened to the window shutter. The cardinal knocked three times, and in a peculiar manner. A man, enveloped in a cloak, came out immediately, and exchanged some rapid words with the cardinal; after which he mounted his horse, and set off in the direction of Surgeres, which was likewise the way to Paris. \u201cAdvance, gentlemen,\u201d said the cardinal. \u201cYou have told me the truth, my gentlemen,\u201d said he, addressing the Musketeers, \u201cand it will not be my fault if our encounter this evening be not advantageous to you. In the meantime, follow me.\u201d The cardinal alighted; the three Musketeers did likewise. The cardinal threw the bridle of his horse to his esquire; the three Musketeers fastened the horses to the shutters. The host stood at the door. For him, the cardinal was only an officer coming to visit a lady. \u201cHave you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can wait near a good fire?\u201d said the cardinal.", " At ten paces from the hedge he recognized the talkative Gascon; and as he had already perceived that these men were Musketeers, he did not doubt that the three others were those called the Inseparables; that is to say, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis. It may be supposed that his desire to hear the conversation was augmented by this discovery. His eyes took a strange expression, and with the step of a tiger-cat he advanced toward the hedge; but he had not been able to catch more than a few vague syllables without any positive sense, when a sonorous and short cry made him start, and attracted the attention of the Musketeers. \u201cOfficer!\u201d cried Grimaud. \u201cYou are speaking, you scoundrel!\u201d said Athos, rising upon his elbow, and transfixing Grimaud with his flaming look. Grimaud therefore added nothing to his speech, but contented himself with pointing his index finger in the direction of the hedge, announcing by this gesture the cardinal and his escort. With a single bound the Musketeers were on their feet, and saluted with respect. The cardinal seemed furious. \u201cIt appears that Messieurs the Musketeers keep guard,\u201d said he. \u201cAre the English expected by land, or do the Musketeers consider themselves superior officers?\u201d \u201cMonseigneur,\u201d replied Athos, for amid the general fright he alone had preserved the noble calmness and coolness that never forsook him, \u201cMonseigneur, the Musketeers, when they are not on duty, or when their duty is over, drink and play at dice, and they are certainly superior officers to their lackeys.\u201d \u201cLackeys?\u201d grumbled the cardinal."], "Who distinguishes himself with his heroism when the Cardinal\u2019s guards show up to arrest the three musketeers for dueling?": [" \u201cHe told me that he should henceforth recruit his Musketeers from among the Guards of Monsieur the Cardinal.\u201d \u201cThe Guards of the cardinal! And why so?\u201d asked Porthos, warmly. \u201cBecause he plainly perceives that his piquette* stands in need of being enlivened by a mixture of good wine.\u201d _*A watered liquor, made from the second pressing of the grape._ The two Musketeers reddened to the whites of their eyes. D\u2019Artagnan did not know where he was, and wished himself a hundred feet underground. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d continued M. de Treville, growing warmer as he spoke, \u201cand his majesty was right; for, upon my honor, it is true that the Musketeers make but a miserable figure at court. The cardinal related yesterday while playing with the king, with an air of condolence very displeasing to me, that the day before yesterday those DAMNED MUSKETEERS, those DAREDEVILS--he dwelt upon those words with an ironical tone still more displeasing to me--those BRAGGARTS, added he, glancing at me with his tiger-cat\u2019s eye, had made a riot in the Rue Ferou in a cabaret, and that a party of his Guards (I thought he was going to laugh in my face) had been forced to arrest the rioters! MORBLEU! You must know something about it. Arrest Musketeers! You were among them--you were! Don\u2019t deny it; you were recognized, and the cardinal named you. But it\u2019s all my fault; yes, it\u2019s all my fault, because it is myself who selects my men.", " Athos bowed. \u201cAnd now, gentlemen, that\u2019s well,\u201d continued the cardinal. \u201cI know what I wish to know; follow me.\u201d The three Musketeers passed behind his Eminence, who again enveloped his face in his cloak, and put his horse in motion, keeping from eight to ten paces in advance of his four companions. They soon arrived at the silent, solitary inn. No doubt the host knew what illustrious visitor was expected, and had consequently sent intruders out of the way.

For him, the cardinal was only an officer coming to visit a lady. \u201cHave you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can wait near a good fire?\u201d said the cardinal.", " All without had heard, as we have said, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis called, and had guessed, from M. de Treville\u2019s tone of voice, that he was very angry about something. Ten curious heads were glued to the tapestry and became pale with fury; for their ears, closely applied to the door, did not lose a syllable of what he said, while their mouths repeated as he went on, the insulting expressions of the captain to all the people in the antechamber. In an instant, from the door of the cabinet to the street gate, the whole hotel was boiling. \u201cAh! The king\u2019s Musketeers are arrested by the Guards of the cardinal, are they?\u201d continued M. de Treville, as furious at heart as his soldiers, but emphasizing his words and plunging them, one by one, so to say, like so many blows of a stiletto, into the bosoms of his auditors. \u201cWhat! Six of his Eminence\u2019s Guards arrest six of his Majesty\u2019s Musketeers! MORBLEU! My part is taken! I will go straight to the louvre; I will give in my resignation as captain of the king\u2019s Musketeers to take a lieutenancy in the cardinal\u2019s Guards, and if he refuses me, MORBLEU! I will turn abbe.\u201d At these words, the murmur without became an explosion; nothing was to be heard but oaths and blasphemies. The MORBLEUS, the SANG DIEUS, the MORTS TOUTS LES DIABLES, crossed one another in the air. D\u2019Artagnan looked for some tapestry behind which he might hide himself, and felt an immense inclination to crawl under the table.", " Here we are at the camp; therefore, gentlemen, not a word more of this affair. We are observed; they are coming to meet us. We shall be carried in triumph.\u201d In fact, as we have said, the whole camp was in motion. More than two thousand persons had assisted, as at a spectacle, in this fortunate but wild undertaking of the four friends--an undertaking of which they were far from suspecting the real motive. Nothing was heard but cries of \u201cLive the Musketeers! Live the Guards!\u201d M. de Busigny was the first to come and shake Athos by the hand, and acknowledge that the wager was lost. The dragoon and the Swiss followed him, and all their comrades followed the dragoon and the Swiss. There was nothing but felicitations, pressures of the hand, and embraces; there was no end to the inextinguishable laughter at the Rochellais. The tumult at length became so great that the cardinal fancied there must be some riot, and sent La Houdiniere, his captain of the Guards, to inquire what was going on. The affair was described to the messenger with all the effervescence of enthusiasm. \u201cWell?\u201d asked the cardinal, on seeing La Houdiniere return. \u201cWell, monseigneur,\u201d replied the latter, \u201cthree Musketeers and a Guardsman laid a wager with Monsieur de Busigny that they would go and breakfast in the bastion St. Gervais; and while breakfasting they held it for two hours against the enemy, and have killed I don\u2019t know how many Rochellais.\u201d \u201cDid you inquire the names of those three Musketeers?\u201d \u201cYes, monseigneur.\u201d \u201cWhat are their names?\u201d \u201cMessieurs Athos, Porthos, and Aramis.\u201d \u201cStill my three brave fellows!\u201d murmured the cardinal."], "What does King Louis XIII give D\u2019Artagnan as a token of his gratitude after D\u2019Artagnan successfully fights the Cardinal\u2019s guards?": [" At last Louis XIII made Treville the captain of his Musketeers, who were to Louis XIII in devotedness, or rather in fanaticism, what his Ordinaries had been to Henry III, and his Scotch Guard to Louis XI. On his part, the cardinal was not behind the king in this respect. When he saw the formidable and chosen body with which Louis XIII had surrounded himself, this second, or rather this first king of France, became desirous that he, too, should have his guard. He had his Musketeers therefore, as Louis XIII had his, and these two powerful rivals vied with each other in procuring, not only from all the provinces of France, but even from all foreign states, the most celebrated swordsmen. It was not uncommon for Richelieu and Louis XIII to dispute over their evening game of chess upon the merits of their servants. Each boasted the bearing and the courage of his own people. While exclaiming loudly against duels and brawls, they excited them secretly to quarrel, deriving an immoderate satisfaction or genuine regret from the success or defeat of their own combatants. We learn this from the memoirs of a man who was concerned in some few of these defeats and in many of these victories. Treville had grasped the weak side of his master; and it was to this address that he owed the long and constant favor of a king who has not left the reputation behind him of being very faithful in his friendships.", " He went then to the queen, and according to custom accosted her with fresh menaces against those who surrounded her. Anne of Austria lowered her head, allowed the torrent to flow on without replying, hoping that it would cease of itself; but this was not what Louis XIII meant. Louis XIII wanted a discussion from which some light or other might break, convinced as he was that the cardinal had some afterthought and was preparing for him one of those terrible surprises which his Eminence was so skillful in getting up. He arrived at this end by his persistence in accusation. \u201cBut,\u201d cried Anne of Austria, tired of these vague attacks, \u201cbut, sire, you do not tell me all that you have in your heart. What have I done, then? Let me know what crime I have committed. It is impossible that your Majesty can make all this ado about a letter written to my brother.\u201d The king, attacked in a manner so direct, did not know what to answer; and he thought that this was the moment for expressing the desire which he was not going to have made until the evening before the fete. \u201cMadame,\u201d said he, with dignity, \u201cthere will shortly be a ball at the Hotel de Ville. I wish, in order to honor our worthy aldermen, you should appear in ceremonial costume, and above all, ornamented with the diamond studs which I gave you on your birthday. That is my answer.\u201d The answer was terrible. Anne of Austria believed that Louis XIII knew all, and that the cardinal had persuaded him to employ this long dissimulation of seven or eight days, which, likewise, was characteristic.", " If I made you that present it was that you might adorn yourself therewith. I tell you that you were wrong.\u201d The voice of the king was tremulous with anger. Everybody looked and listened with astonishment, comprehending nothing of what passed. \u201cSire,\u201d said the queen, \u201cI can send for them to the Louvre, where they are, and thus your Majesty\u2019s wishes will be complied with.\u201d \u201cDo so, madame, do so, and that at once; for within an hour the ballet will commence.\u201d The queen bent in token of submission, and followed the ladies who were to conduct her to her room. On his part the king returned to his apartment. There was a moment of trouble and confusion in the assembly. Everybody had remarked that something had passed between the king and queen; but both of them had spoken so low that everybody, out of respect, withdrew several steps, so that nobody had heard anything. The violins began to sound with all their might, but nobody listened to them. The king came out first from his room. He was in a most elegant hunting costume; and Monsieur and the other nobles were dressed like him. This was the costume that best became the king. So dressed, he really appeared the first gentleman of his kingdom. The cardinal drew near to the king, and placed in his hand a small casket. The king opened it, and found in it two diamond studs. \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d demanded he of the cardinal. \u201cNothing,\u201d replied the latter; \u201conly, if the queen has the studs, which I very much doubt, count them, sire, and if you only find ten, ask her Majesty who can have stolen from her the two studs that are here.\u201d The king looked at the cardinal as if to interrogate him; but he had not time to address any question to him--a cry of admiration burst from every mouth.", " \u201cGentlemen,\u201d said he, \u201cif Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan will surrender his sword to me and join his word to yours, I shall be satisfied with your promise to convey Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan to the quarters of Monseigneur the Cardinal.\u201d \u201cYou have my word, monsieur, and here is my sword.\u201d \u201cThis suits me the better,\u201d said Rochefort, \u201cas I wish to continue my journey.\u201d \u201cIf it is for the purpose of rejoining Milady,\u201d said Athos, coolly, \u201cit is useless; you will not find her.\u201d \u201cWhat has become of her, then?\u201d asked Rochefort, eagerly. \u201cReturn to camp and you shall know.\u201d Rochefort remained for a moment in thought; then, as they were only a day\u2019s journey from Surgeres, whither the cardinal was to come to meet the king, he resolved to follow the advice of Athos and go with them. Besides, this return offered him the advantage of watching his prisoner. They resumed their route. On the morrow, at three o\u2019clock in the afternoon, they arrived at Surgeres. The cardinal there awaited Louis XIII. The minister and the king exchanged numerous caresses, felicitating each other upon the fortunate chance which had freed France from the inveterate enemy who set all Europe against her. After which, the cardinal, who had been informed that d\u2019Artagnan was arrested and who was anxious to see him, took leave of the king, inviting him to come the next day to view the work already done upon the dyke. On returning in the evening to his quarters at the bridge of La Pierre, the cardinal found, standing before the house he occupied, d\u2019Artagnan, without his sword, and the three Musketeers armed."], "How do the four friends decide to spend the money that the King has given D\u2019Artagnan?": [" After breakfast, it was agreed that they should meet again in the evening at Athos\u2019s lodging, and there finish their plans. D\u2019Artagnan passed the day in exhibiting his Musketeer\u2019s uniform in every street of the camp. In the evening, at the appointed hour, the four friends met. There only remained three things to decide--what they should write to Milady\u2019s brother; what they should write to the clever person at Tours; and which should be the lackeys to carry the letters. Everyone offered his own. Athos talked of the discretion of Grimaud, who never spoke a word but when his master unlocked his mouth. Porthos boasted of the strength of Mousqueton, who was big enough to thrash four men of ordinary size. Aramis, confiding in the address of Bazin, made a pompous eulogium on his candidate. Finally, d\u2019Artagnan had entire faith in the bravery of Planchet, and reminded them of the manner in which he had conducted himself in the ticklish affair of Boulogne. These four virtues disputed the prize for a length of time, and gave birth to magnificent speeches which we do not repeat here for fear they should be deemed too long. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d said Athos, \u201che whom we send must possess in himself alone the four qualities united.\u201d \u201cBut where is such a lackey to be found?\u201d \u201cNot to be found!\u201d cried Athos. \u201cI know it well, so take Grimaud.\u201d \u201cTake Mousqueton.\u201d \u201cTake Bazin.\u201d \u201cTake Planchet. Planchet is brave and shrewd; they are two qualities out of the four.\u201d \u201cGentlemen,\u201d said Aramis, \u201cthe principal question is not to know which of our four lackeys is the most discreet, the most strong, the most clever, or the most brave; the principal thing is to know which loves money the best.\u201d \u201cWhat Aramis says is very sensible,\u201d replied Athos; \u201cwe must speculate upon the faults of people, and not upon their virtues.", " The house may be suspected; but I deny that it is so in the part of it inhabited by Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan, for I can affirm, sire, if I can believe what he says, that there does not exist a more devoted servant of your Majesty, or a more profound admirer of Monsieur the Cardinal.\u201d \u201cWas it not this d\u2019Artagnan who wounded Jussac one day, in that unfortunate encounter which took place near the Convent of the Carmes-Dechausses?\u201d asked the king, looking at the cardinal, who colored with vexation. \u201cAnd the next day, Bernajoux. Yes, sire, yes, it is the same; and your Majesty has a good memory.\u201d \u201cCome, how shall we decide?\u201d said the king. \u201cThat concerns your Majesty more than me,\u201d said the cardinal. \u201cI should affirm the culpability.\u201d \u201cAnd I deny it,\u201d said Treville. \u201cBut his Majesty has judges, and these judges will decide.\u201d \u201cThat is best,\u201d said the king. \u201cSend the case before the judges; it is their business to judge, and they shall judge.\u201d \u201cOnly,\u201d replied Treville, \u201cit is a sad thing that in the unfortunate times in which we live, the purest life, the most incontestable virtue, cannot exempt a man from infamy and persecution. The army, I will answer for it, will be but little pleased at being exposed to rigorous treatment on account of police affairs.\u201d The expression was imprudent; but M. de Treville launched it with knowledge of his cause. He was desirous of an explosion, because in that case the mine throws forth fire, and fire enlightens.", " As to the second vessel, we will tell hereafter whom it carried, and how it set sail. During this time nothing new occurred in the camp at La Rochelle; only the king, who was bored, as always, but perhaps a little more so in camp than elsewhere, resolved to go incognito and spend the festival of St. Louis at St. Germain, and asked the cardinal to order him an escort of only twenty Musketeers. The cardinal, who sometimes became weary of the king, granted this leave of absence with great pleasure to his royal lieutenant, who promised to return about the fifteenth of September. M de Treville, being informed of this by his Eminence, packed his portmanteau; and as without knowing the cause he knew the great desire and even imperative need which his friends had of returning to Paris, it goes without saying that he fixed upon them to form part of the escort. The four young men heard the news a quarter of an hour after M. de Treville, for they were the first to whom he communicated it. It was then that d\u2019Artagnan appreciated the favor the cardinal had conferred upon him in making him at last enter the Musketeers--for without that circumstance he would have been forced to remain in the camp while his companions left it. It goes without saying that this impatience to return toward Paris had for a cause the danger which Mme. Bonacieux would run of meeting at the convent of Bethune with Milady, her mortal enemy.", " This short interval was sufficient to determine d\u2019Artagnan on the part he was to take. It was one of those events which decide the life of a man; it was a choice between the king and the cardinal--the choice made, it must be persisted in. To fight, that was to disobey the law, that was to risk his head, that was to make at one blow an enemy of a minister more powerful than the king himself. All this the young man perceived, and yet, to his praise we speak it, he did not hesitate a second. Turning towards Athos and his friends, \u201cGentlemen,\u201d said he, \u201callow me to correct your words, if you please. You said you were but three, but it appears to me we are four.\u201d \u201cBut you are not one of us,\u201d said Porthos. \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cI have not the uniform, but I have the spirit. My heart is that of a Musketeer; I feel it, monsieur, and that impels me on.\u201d \u201cWithdraw, young man,\u201d cried Jussac, who doubtless, by his gestures and the expression of his countenance, had guessed d\u2019Artagnan\u2019s design. \u201cYou may retire; we consent to that. Save your skin; begone quickly.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan did not budge. \u201cDecidedly, you are a brave fellow,\u201d said Athos, pressing the young man\u2019s hand. \u201cCome, come, choose your part,\u201d replied Jussac. \u201cWell,\u201d said Porthos to Aramis, \u201cwe must do something.\u201d \u201cMonsieur is full of generosity,\u201d said Athos. But all three reflected upon the youth of d\u2019Artagnan, and dreaded his inexperience."], "According to Monsieur Bonacieux, Madame Bonacieux\u2019s knowledge ___ may be related to her kidnapping.": [" While d\u2019Artagnan was examining Mme. Bonacieux, and was, as we have said, close to her, he saw on the ground a fine cambric handkerchief, which he picked up, as was his habit, and at the corner of which he recognized the same cipher he had seen on the handkerchief which had nearly caused him and Aramis to cut each other\u2019s throat. From that time, d\u2019Artagnan had been cautious with respect to handkerchiefs with arms on them, and he therefore placed in the pocket of Mme. Bonacieux the one he had just picked up. At that moment Mme. Bonacieux recovered her senses. She opened her eyes, looked around her with terror, saw that the apartment was empty and that she was alone with her liberator. She extended her hands to him with a smile. Mme. Bonacieux had the sweetest smile in the world. \u201cAh, monsieur!\u201d said she, \u201cyou have saved me; permit me to thank you.\u201d \u201cMadame,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cI have only done what every gentleman would have done in my place; you owe me no thanks.\u201d \u201cOh, yes, monsieur, oh, yes; and I hope to prove to you that you have not served an ingrate. But what could these men, whom I at first took for robbers, want with me, and why is Monsieur Bonacieux not here?\u201d \u201cMadame, those men were more dangerous than any robbers could have been, for they are the agents of the cardinal; and as to your husband, Monsieur Bonacieux, he is not here because he was yesterday evening conducted to the Bastille.\u201d \u201cMy husband in the Bastille!\u201d cried Mme.", " Nevertheless, knowing the weakness of her husband, and more particularly his cupidity, she did not despair of bringing him round to her purpose. \u201cAh, you are a cardinalist, then, monsieur, are you?\u201d cried she; \u201cand you serve the party of those who maltreat your wife and insult your queen?\u201d \u201cPrivate interests are as nothing before the interests of all. I am for those who save the state,\u201d said Bonacieux, emphatically. \u201cAnd what do you know about the state you talk of?\u201d said Mme. Bonacieux, shrugging her shoulders. \u201cBe satisfied with being a plain, straightforward citizen, and turn to that side which offers the most advantages.\u201d \u201cEh, eh!\u201d said Bonacieux, slapping a plump, round bag, which returned a sound a money; \u201cwhat do you think of this, Madame Preacher?\u201d \u201cWhence comes that money?\u201d \u201cYou do not guess?\u201d \u201cFrom the cardinal?\u201d \u201cFrom him, and from my friend the Comte de Rochefort.\u201d \u201cThe Comte de Rochefort! Why, it was he who carried me off!\u201d \u201cThat may be, madame!\u201d \u201cAnd you receive silver from that man?\u201d \u201cHave you not said that that abduction was entirely political?\u201d \u201cYes; but that abduction had for its object the betrayal of my mistress, to draw from me by torture confessions that might compromise the honor, and perhaps the life, of my august mistress.\u201d \u201cMadame,\u201d replied Bonacieux, \u201cyour august mistress is a perfidious Spaniard, and what the cardinal does is well done.\u201d \u201cMonsieur,\u201d said the young woman, \u201cI know you to be cowardly, avaricious, and foolish, but I never till now believed you infamous!\u201d \u201cMadame,\u201d said Bonacieux, who had never seen his wife in a passion, and who recoiled before this conjugal anger, \u201cmadame, what do you say?\u201d \u201cI say you are a miserable creature!\u201d continued Mme.", " No one answered. Porthos, in order to make a greater display, had that evening borrowed Planchet. As to d\u2019Artagnan, he took care not to give the least sign of existence. The moment the hand of Bonacieux sounded on the door, the two young people felt their hearts bound within them. \u201cThere is nobody within,\u201d said Bonacieux. \u201cNever mind. Let us return to your apartment. We shall be safer there than in the doorway.\u201d \u201cAh, my God!\u201d whispered Mme. Bonacieux, \u201cwe shall hear no more.\u201d \u201cOn the contrary,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cwe shall hear better.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan raised the three or four boards which made his chamber another ear of Dionysius, spread a carpet on the floor, went upon his knees, and made a sign to Mme. Bonacieux to stoop as he did toward the opening. \u201cYou are sure there is nobody there?\u201d said the stranger. \u201cI will answer for it,\u201d said Bonacieux. \u201cAnd you think that your wife--\u201d \u201cHas returned to the Louvre.\u201d \u201cWithout speaking to anyone but yourself?\u201d \u201cI am sure of it.\u201d \u201cThat is an important point, do you understand?\u201d \u201cThen the news I brought you is of value?\u201d \u201cThe greatest, my dear Bonacieux; I don\u2019t conceal this from you.\u201d \u201cThen the cardinal will be pleased with me?\u201d \u201cI have no doubt of it.\u201d \u201cThe great cardinal!\u201d \u201cAre you sure, in her conversation with you, that your wife mentioned no names?\u201d \u201cI think not.\u201d \u201cShe did not name Madame de Chevreuse, the Duke of Buckingham, or Madame de Vernet?\u201d \u201cNo; she only told me she wished to send me to London to serve the interests of an illustrious personage.\u201d \u201cThe traitor!\u201d murmured Mme.", " I know them from having heard one of their friends, Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan, say a great deal about them.\u201d \u201cYou know Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan!\u201d cried the novice, in her turn seizing the hands of Milady and devouring her with her eyes. Then remarking the strange expression of Milady\u2019s countenance, she said, \u201cPardon me, madame; you know him by what title?\u201d \u201cWhy,\u201d replied Milady, embarrassed, \u201cwhy, by the title of friend.\u201d \u201cYou deceive me, madame,\u201d said the novice; \u201cyou have been his mistress!\u201d \u201cIt is you who have been his mistress, madame!\u201d cried Milady, in her turn. \u201cI?\u201d said the novice. \u201cYes, you! I know you now. You are Madame Bonacieux!\u201d The young woman drew back, filled with surprise and terror. \u201cOh, do not deny it! Answer!\u201d continued Milady. \u201cWell, yes, madame,\u201d said the novice, \u201cAre we rivals?\u201d The countenance of Milady was illumined by so savage a joy that under any other circumstances Mme. Bonacieux would have fled in terror; but she was absorbed by jealousy. \u201cSpeak, madame!\u201d resumed Mme. Bonacieux, with an energy of which she might not have been believed capable. \u201cHave you been, or are you, his mistress?\u201d \u201cOh, no!\u201d cried Milady, with an accent that admitted no doubt of her truth. \u201cNever, never!\u201d \u201cI believe you,\u201d said Mme. Bonacieux; \u201cbut why, then, did you cry out so?\u201d \u201cDo you not understand?\u201d said Milady, who had already overcome her agitation and recovered all her presence of mind."], "Who does D\u2019Artagnan suspect kidnapped Madame Bonacieux?": [" The citizen made a fresh pause and continued, \u201cI have a wife who is seamstress to the queen, monsieur, and who is not deficient in either virtue or beauty. I was induced to marry her about three years ago, although she had but very little dowry, because Monsieur Laporte, the queen\u2019s cloak bearer, is her godfather, and befriends her.\u201d \u201cWell, monsieur?\u201d asked d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cWell!\u201d resumed the citizen, \u201cwell, monsieur, my wife was abducted yesterday morning, as she was coming out of her workroom.\u201d \u201cAnd by whom was your wife abducted?\u201d \u201cI know nothing surely, monsieur, but I suspect someone.\u201d \u201cAnd who is the person whom you suspect?\u201d \u201cA man who has pursued her a long time.\u201d \u201cThe devil!\u201d \u201cBut allow me to tell you, monsieur,\u201d continued the citizen, \u201cthat I am convinced that there is less love than politics in all this.\u201d \u201cLess love than politics,\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan, with a reflective air; \u201cand what do you suspect?\u201d \u201cI do not know whether I ought to tell you what I suspect.\u201d \u201cMonsieur, I beg you to observe that I ask you absolutely nothing. It is you who have come to me. It is you who have told me that you had a secret to confide in me. Act, then, as you think proper; there is still time to withdraw.\u201d \u201cNo, monsieur, no; you appear to be an honest young man, and I will have confidence in you. I believe, then, that it is not on account of any intrigues of her own that my wife has been arrested, but because of those of a lady much greater than herself.\u201d \u201cAh, ah!", " \u201cThey have abducted her,\u201d added the commissary; \u201cand do you know the man who has committed this deed?\u201d \u201cI think I know him.\u201d \u201cWho is he?\u201d \u201cRemember that I affirm nothing, Monsieur the Commissary, and that I only suspect.\u201d \u201cWhom do you suspect? Come, answer freely.\u201d M Bonacieux was in the greatest perplexity possible. Had he better deny everything or tell everything? By denying all, it might be suspected that he must know too much to avow; by confessing all he might prove his good will. He decided, then, to tell all. \u201cI suspect,\u201d said he, \u201ca tall, dark man, of lofty carriage, who has the air of a great lord. He has followed us several times, as I think, when I have waited for my wife at the wicket of the Louvre to escort her home.\u201d The commissary now appeared to experience a little uneasiness. \u201cAnd his name?\u201d said he. \u201cOh, as to his name, I know nothing about it; but if I were ever to meet him, I should recognize him in an instant, I will answer for it, were he among a thousand persons.\u201d The face of the commissary grew still darker. \u201cYou should recognize him among a thousand, say you?\u201d continued he. \u201cThat is to say,\u201d cried Bonacieux, who saw he had taken a false step, \u201cthat is to say--\u201d \u201cYou have answered that you should recognize him,\u201d said the commissary. \u201cThat is all very well, and enough for today; before we proceed further, someone must be informed that you know the ravisher of your wife.\u201d \u201cBut I have not told you that I know him!\u201d cried Bonacieux, in despair.", " Bonacieux. \u201cOh, my God! What has he done? Poor dear man, he is innocence itself!\u201d And something like a faint smile lighted the still-terrified features of the young woman. \u201cWhat has he done, madame?\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cI believe that his only crime is to have at the same time the good fortune and the misfortune to be your husband.\u201d \u201cBut, monsieur, you know then--\u201d \u201cI know that you have been abducted, madame.\u201d \u201cAnd by whom? Do you know him? Oh, if you know him, tell me!\u201d \u201cBy a man of from forty to forty-five years, with black hair, a dark complexion, and a scar on his left temple.\u201d \u201cThat is he, that is he; but his name?\u201d \u201cAh, his name? I do not know that.\u201d \u201cAnd did my husband know I had been carried off?\u201d \u201cHe was informed of it by a letter, written to him by the abductor himself.\u201d \u201cAnd does he suspect,\u201d said Mme. Bonacieux, with some embarrassment, \u201cthe cause of this event?\u201d \u201cHe attributed it, I believe, to a political cause.\u201d \u201cI doubted from the first; and now I think entirely as he does. Then my dear Monsieur Bonacieux has not suspected me a single instant?\u201d \u201cSo far from it, madame, he was too proud of your prudence, and above all, of your love.\u201d A second smile, almost imperceptible, stole over the rosy lips of the pretty young woman. \u201cBut,\u201d continued d\u2019Artagnan, \u201chow did you escape?\u201d \u201cI took advantage of a moment when they left me alone; and as I had known since morning the reason of my abduction, with the help of the sheets I let myself down from the window.", " At sight of this man, d\u2019Artagnan started, and half drawing his sword, sprang toward the door. It was the man of Meung. \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d cried Mme. Bonacieux; \u201cyou will ruin us all!\u201d \u201cBut I have sworn to kill that man!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cYour life is devoted from this moment, and does not belong to you. In the name of the queen I forbid you to throw yourself into any peril which is foreign to that of your journey.\u201d \u201cAnd do you command nothing in your own name?\u201d \u201cIn my name,\u201d said Mme. Bonacieux, with great emotion, \u201cin my name I beg you! But listen; they appear to be speaking of me.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan drew near the window, and lent his ear. M Bonacieux had opened his door, and seeing the apartment, had returned to the man in the cloak, whom he had left alone for an instant. \u201cShe is gone,\u201d said he; \u201cshe must have returned to the Louvre.\u201d \u201cYou are sure,\u201d replied the stranger, \u201cthat she did not suspect the intentions with which you went out?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d replied Bonacieux, with a self-sufficient air, \u201cshe is too superficial a woman.\u201d \u201cIs the young Guardsman at home?\u201d \u201cI do not think he is; as you see, his shutter is closed, and you can see no light shine through the chinks of the shutters.\u201d \u201cAll the same, it is well to be certain.\u201d \u201cHow so?\u201d \u201cBy knocking at his door. Go.\u201d \u201cI will ask his servant.\u201d Bonacieux re-entered the house, passed through the same door that had afforded a passage for the two fugitives, went up to d\u2019Artagnan\u2019s door, and knocked."], "When Madame Bonacieux enters the \u201cmousetrap\u201d that the police have set up, D\u2019Artagnan ___.": [" \u201cWhat diabolical villainy you have performed here,\u201d said Porthos, when the officer had rejoined his companions and the four friends found themselves alone. \u201cShame, shame, for four Musketeers to allow an unfortunate fellow who cried for help to be arrested in their midst! And a gentleman to hobnob with a bailiff!\u201d \u201cPorthos,\u201d said Aramis, \u201cAthos has already told you that you are a simpleton, and I am quite of his opinion.

Indeed I do,\u201d said Athos; \u201cI not only approve of what he has done, but I congratulate him upon it.\u201d \u201cAnd now, gentlemen,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, without stopping to explain his conduct to Porthos, \u201cAll for one, one for all--that is our motto, is it not?\u201d \u201cAnd yet--\u201d said Porthos. \u201cHold out your hand and swear!\u201d cried Athos and Aramis at once. Overcome by example, grumbling to himself, nevertheless, Porthos stretched out his hand, and the four friends repeated with one voice the formula dictated by d\u2019Artagnan: \u201cAll for one, one for all.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s well! Now let us everyone retire to his own home,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, as if he had done nothing but command all his life; \u201cand attention! For from this moment we are at feud with the cardinal.\u201d 10 A MOUSETRAP IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY The invention of the mousetrap does not date from our days; as soon as societies, in forming, had invented any kind of police, that police invented mousetraps.", " As perhaps our readers are not familiar with the slang of the Rue de Jerusalem, and as it is fifteen years since we applied this word for the first time to this thing, allow us to explain to them what is a mousetrap. When in a house, of whatever kind it may be, an individual suspected of any crime is arrested, the arrest is held secret. Four or five men are placed in ambuscade in the first room. The door is opened to all who knock. It is closed after them, and they are arrested; so that at the end of two or three days they have in their power almost all the HABITUES of the establishment. And that is a mousetrap. The apartment of M. Bonacieux, then, became a mousetrap; and whoever appeared there was taken and interrogated by the cardinal\u2019s people. It must be observed that as a separate passage led to the first floor, in which d\u2019Artagnan lodged, those who called on him were exempted from this detention. Besides, nobody came thither but the three Musketeers; they had all been engaged in earnest search and inquiries, but had discovered nothing. Athos had even gone so far as to question M. de Treville--a thing which, considering the habitual reticence of the worthy Musketeer, had very much astonished his captain. But M. de Treville knew nothing, except that the last time he had seen the cardinal, the king, and the queen, the cardinal looked very thoughtful, the king uneasy, and the redness of the queen\u2019s eyes donated that she had been sleepless or tearful.", " You are not angry with me?\u201d \u201cNot the least in the world.\u201d \u201cTill then, then?\u201d \u201cTill then.\u201d Bonacieux kissed his wife\u2019s hand, and set off at a quick pace. \u201cWell,\u201d said Mme. Bonacieux, when her husband had shut the street door and she found herself alone; \u201cthat imbecile lacked but one thing: to become a cardinalist. And I, who have answered for him to the queen--I, who have promised my poor mistress--ah, my God, my God! She will take me for one of those wretches with whom the palace swarms and who are placed about her as spies! Ah, Monsieur Bonacieux, I never did love you much, but now it is worse than ever. I hate you, and on my word you shall pay for this!\u201d At the moment she spoke these words a rap on the ceiling made her raise her head, and a voice which reached her through the ceiling cried, \u201cDear Madame Bonacieux, open for me the little door on the alley, and I will come down to you.\u201d 18 LOVER AND HUSBAND Ah, Madame,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, entering by the door which the young woman opened for him, \u201callow me to tell you that you have a bad sort of a husband.\u201d \u201cYou have, then, overheard our conversation?\u201d asked Mme. Bonacieux, eagerly, and looking at d\u2019Artagnan with disquiet. \u201cThe whole.\u201d \u201cBut how, my God?\u201d \u201cBy a mode of proceeding known to myself, and by which I likewise overheard the more animated conversation which he had with the cardinal\u2019s police.\u201d \u201cAnd what did you understand by what we said?\u201d \u201cA thousand things.", " On the evening of the day after the arrest of poor Bonacieux, as Athos had just left d\u2019Artagnan to report at M. de Treville\u2019s, as nine o\u2019clock had just struck, and as Planchet, who had not yet made the bed, was beginning his task, a knocking was heard at the street door. The door was instantly opened and shut; someone was taken in the mousetrap. D\u2019Artagnan flew to his hole, laid himself down on the floor at full length, and listened. Cries were soon heard, and then moans, which someone appeared to be endeavoring to stifle. There were no questions. \u201cThe devil!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan to himself. \u201cIt seems like a woman! They search her; she resists; they use force--the scoundrels!\u201d In spite of his prudence, d\u2019Artagnan restrained himself with great difficulty from taking a part in the scene that was going on below. \u201cBut I tell you that I am the mistress of the house, gentlemen! I tell you I am Madame Bonacieux; I tell you I belong to the queen!\u201d cried the unfortunate woman. \u201cMadame Bonacieux!\u201d murmured d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cCan I be so lucky as to find what everybody is seeking for?\u201d The voice became more and more indistinct; a tumultuous movement shook the partition. The victim resisted as much as a woman could resist four men. \u201cPardon, gentlemen--par--\u201d murmured the voice, which could now only be heard in inarticulate sounds. \u201cThey are binding her; they are going to drag her away,\u201d cried d\u2019Artagnan to himself, springing up from the floor."], "How does D'Artagnan try to ensure the success of the alibi that de Treville will give him?": [" All the events we have described had taken place within a half hour. Everything fell out as Mme. Bonacieux prophesied. On hearing the password, Germain bowed. In a few minutes, Laporte was at the lodge; in two words d\u2019Artagnan informed him where Mme. Bonacieux was. Laporte assured himself, by having it twice repeated, of the accurate address, and set off at a run. Hardly, however, had he taken ten steps before he returned. \u201cYoung man,\u201d said he to d\u2019Artagnan, \u201ca suggestion.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cYou may get into trouble by what has taken place.\u201d \u201cYou believe so?\u201d \u201cYes. Have you any friend whose clock is too slow?\u201d \u201cWell?\u201d \u201cGo and call upon him, in order that he may give evidence of your having been with him at half past nine. In a court of justice that is called an alibi.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan found his advice prudent. He took to his heels, and was soon at M. de Treville\u2019s; but instead of going into the saloon with the rest of the crowd, he asked to be introduced to M. de Treville\u2019s office. As d\u2019Artagnan so constantly frequented the hotel, no difficulty was made in complying with his request, and a servant went to inform M. de Treville that his young compatriot, having something important to communicate, solicited a private audience. Five minutes after, M. de Treville was asking d\u2019Artagnan what he could do to serve him, and what caused his visit at so late an hour. \u201cPardon me, monsieur,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, who had profited by the moment he had been left alone to put back M. de Treville\u2019s clock three-quarters of an hour, \u201cbut I thought, as it was yet only twenty-five minutes past nine, it was not too late to wait upon you.\u201d \u201cTwenty-five minutes past nine!\u201d cried M. de Treville, looking at the clock; \u201cwhy, that\u2019s impossible!\u201d \u201cLook, rather, monsieur,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cthe clock shows it.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d said M. de Treville; \u201cI believed it later.", " But what can I do for you?\u201d Then d\u2019Artagnan told M. de Treville a long history about the queen. He expressed to him the fears he entertained with respect to her Majesty; he related to him what he had heard of the projects of the cardinal with regard to Buckingham, and all with a tranquillity and candor of which M. de Treville was the more the dupe, from having himself, as we have said, observed something fresh between the cardinal, the king, and the queen. As ten o\u2019clock was striking, d\u2019Artagnan left M. de Treville, who thanked him for his information, recommended him to have the service of the king and queen always at heart, and returned to the saloon; but at the foot of the stairs, d\u2019Artagnan remembered he had forgotten his cane. He consequently sprang up again, re-entered the office, with a turn of his finger set the clock right again, that it might not be perceived the next day that it had been put wrong, and certain from that time that he had a witness to prove his alibi, he ran downstairs and soon found himself in the street. 11 IN WHICH THE PLOT THICKENS His visit to M. de Treville being paid, the pensive d\u2019Artagnan took the longest way homeward. On what was d\u2019Artagnan thinking, that he strayed thus from his path, gazing at the stars of heaven, and sometimes sighing, sometimes smiling? He was thinking of Mme. Bonacieux. For an apprentice Musketeer the young woman was almost an ideal of love.", " D\u2019Artagnan, who was known as a familiar of the house, went straight to his office, and sent word that he wished to see him on something of importance. D\u2019Artagnan had been there scarcely five minutes when M. de Treville entered. At the first glance, and by the joy which was painted on his countenance, the worthy captain plainly perceived that something new was on foot. All the way along d\u2019Artagnan had been consulting with himself whether he should place confidence in M. de Treville, or whether he should only ask him to give him CARTE BLANCHE for some secret affair. But M. de Treville had always been so thoroughly his friend, had always been so devoted to the king and queen, and hated the cardinal so cordially, that the young man resolved to tell him everything. \u201cDid you ask for me, my good friend?\u201d said M. de Treville. \u201cYes, monsieur,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, lowering his voice, \u201cand you will pardon me, I hope, for having disturbed you when you know the importance of my business.\u201d \u201cSpeak, then, I am all attention.\u201d \u201cIt concerns nothing less,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cthan the honor, perhaps the life of the queen.\u201d \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d asked M. de Treville, glancing round to see if they were surely alone, and then fixing his questioning look upon d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cI say, monsieur, that chance has rendered me master of a secret--\u201d \u201cWhich you will guard, I hope, young man, as your life.\u201d \u201cBut which I must impart to you, monsieur, for you alone can assist me in the mission I have just received from her Majesty.\u201d \u201cIs this secret your own?\u201d \u201cNo, monsieur; it is her Majesty\u2019s.\u201d \u201cAre you authorized by her Majesty to communicate it to me?\u201d \u201cNo, monsieur, for, on the contrary, I am desired to preserve the profoundest mystery.\u201d \u201cWhy, then, are you about to betray it to me?\u201d \u201cBecause, as I said, without you I can do nothing; and I am afraid you will refuse me the favor I come to ask if you do not know to what end I ask it.\u201d \u201cKeep your secret, young man, and tell me what you wish.\u201d \u201cI wish you to obtain for me, from Monsieur Dessessart, leave of absence for fifteen days.\u201d \u201cWhen?\u201d \u201cThis very night.\u201d \u201cYou leave Paris?\u201d \u201cI am going on a mission.\u201d \u201cMay you tell me whither?\u201d \u201cTo London.\u201d \u201cHas anyone an interest in preventing your arrival there?\u201d \u201cThe cardinal, I believe, would give the world to prevent my success.\u201d \u201cAnd you are going alone?\u201d \u201cI am going alone.\u201d \u201cIn that case you will not get beyond Bondy.", " Toward six o\u2019clock d\u2019Artagnan awoke with that uncomfortable feeling which generally accompanies the break of day after a bad night. He was not long in making his toilet. He examined himself to see if advantage had been taken of his sleep, and having found his diamond ring on his finger, his purse in his pocket, and his pistols in his belt, he rose, paid for his bottle, and went out to try if he could have any better luck in his search after his lackey than he had had the night before. The first thing he perceived through the damp gray mist was honest Planchet, who, with the two horses in hand, awaited him at the door of a little blind cabaret, before which d\u2019Artagnan had passed without even a suspicion of its existence. 25 PORTHOS Instead of returning directly home, d\u2019Artagnan alighted at the door of M. de Treville, and ran quickly up the stairs. This time he had decided to relate all that had passed. M. de Treville would doubtless give him good advice as to the whole affair. Besides, as M. de Treville saw the queen almost daily, he might be able to draw from her Majesty some intelligence of the poor young woman, whom they were doubtless making pay very dearly for her devotedness to her mistress. M de Treville listened to the young man\u2019s account with a seriousness which proved that he saw something else in this adventure besides a love affair. When d\u2019Artagnan had finished, he said, \u201cHum!"], "What mistaken belief causes the police to arrest Athos?": [" \u201cPolice affairs!\u201d cried the king, taking up Treville\u2019s words, \u201cpolice affairs! And what do you know about them, Monsieur? Meddle with your Musketeers, and do not annoy me in this way. It appears, according to your account, that if by mischance a Musketeer is arrested, France is in danger. What a noise about a Musketeer! I would arrest ten of them, VENTREBLEU, a hundred, even, all the company, and I would not allow a whisper.\u201d \u201cFrom the moment they are suspected by your Majesty,\u201d said Treville, \u201cthe Musketeers are guilty; therefore, you see me prepared to surrender my sword--for after having accused my soldiers, there can be no doubt that Monsieur the Cardinal will end by accusing me. It is best to constitute myself at once a prisoner with Athos, who is already arrested, and with d\u2019Artagnan, who most probably will be.\u201d \u201cGascon-headed man, will you have done?\u201d said the king. \u201cSire,\u201d replied Treville, without lowering his voice in the least, \u201ceither order my Musketeer to be restored to me, or let him be tried.\u201d \u201cHe shall be tried,\u201d said the cardinal. \u201cWell, so much the better; for in that case I shall demand of his Majesty permission to plead for him.\u201d The king feared an outbreak. \u201cIf his Eminence,\u201d said he, \u201cdid not have personal motives--\u201d The cardinal saw what the king was about to say and interrupted him: \u201cPardon me,\u201d said he; \u201cbut the instant your Majesty considers me a prejudiced judge, I withdraw.\u201d \u201cCome,\u201d said the king, \u201cwill you swear, by my father, that Athos was at your residence during the event and that he took no part in it?\u201d \u201cBy your glorious father, and by yourself, whom I love and venerate above all the world, I swear it.\u201d \u201cBe so kind as to reflect, sire,\u201d said the cardinal.", " \u201cI do not know a woman that is worth the trouble of being sought for when she is once lost. Madame Bonacieux is lost; so much the worse for her if she is found.\u201d \u201cNo, Athos, no, you are mistaken,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cI love my poor Constance more than ever, and if I knew the place in which she is, were it at the end of the world, I would go to free her from the hands of her enemies; but I am ignorant. All my researches have been useless. What is to be said? I must divert my attention!\u201d \u201cAmuse yourself with Milady, my dear d\u2019Artagnan; I wish you may with all my heart, if that will amuse you.\u201d \u201cHear me, Athos,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cInstead of shutting yourself up here as if you were under arrest, get on horseback and come and take a ride with me to St. Germain.\u201d \u201cMy dear fellow,\u201d said Athos, \u201cI ride horses when I have any; when I have none, I go afoot.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, smiling at the misanthropy of Athos, which from any other person would have offended him, \u201cI ride what I can get; I am not so proud as you. So AU REVOIR, dear Athos.\u201d \u201cAU REVOIR,\u201d said the Musketeer, making a sign to Grimaud to uncork the bottle he had just brought. D\u2019Artagnan and Planchet mounted, and took the road to St. Germain. All along the road, what Athos had said respecting Mme. Bonacieux recurred to the mind of the young man. Although d\u2019Artagnan was not of a very sentimental character, the mercer\u2019s pretty wife had made a real impression upon his heart.", " \u201cWhat diabolical villainy you have performed here,\u201d said Porthos, when the officer had rejoined his companions and the four friends found themselves alone. \u201cShame, shame, for four Musketeers to allow an unfortunate fellow who cried for help to be arrested in their midst! And a gentleman to hobnob with a bailiff!\u201d \u201cPorthos,\u201d said Aramis, \u201cAthos has already told you that you are a simpleton, and I am quite of his opinion. D\u2019Artagnan, you are a great man; and when you occupy Monsieur de Treville\u2019s place, I will come and ask your influence to secure me an abbey.\u201d \u201cWell, I am in a maze,\u201d said Porthos; \u201cdo YOU approve of what d\u2019Artagnan has done?\u201d \u201cPARBLEU! Indeed I do,\u201d said Athos; \u201cI not only approve of what he has done, but I congratulate him upon it.\u201d \u201cAnd now, gentlemen,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, without stopping to explain his conduct to Porthos, \u201cAll for one, one for all--that is our motto, is it not?\u201d \u201cAnd yet--\u201d said Porthos. \u201cHold out your hand and swear!\u201d cried Athos and Aramis at once. Overcome by example, grumbling to himself, nevertheless, Porthos stretched out his hand, and the four friends repeated with one voice the formula dictated by d\u2019Artagnan: \u201cAll for one, one for all.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s well! Now let us everyone retire to his own home,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, as if he had done nothing but command all his life; \u201cand attention! For from this moment we are at feud with the cardinal.\u201d 10 A MOUSETRAP IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY The invention of the mousetrap does not date from our days; as soon as societies, in forming, had invented any kind of police, that police invented mousetraps.", " And yet, in all this, the cardinal had not yet said a word about the Duke of Buckingham. At this instant M. de Treville entered, cool, polite, and in irreproachable costume. Informed of what had passed by the presence of the cardinal and the alteration in the king\u2019s countenance, M. de Treville felt himself something like Samson before the Philistines. Louis XIII had already placed his hand on the knob of the door; at the noise of M. de Treville\u2019s entrance he turned round. \u201cYou arrive in good time, monsieur,\u201d said the king, who, when his passions were raised to a certain point, could not dissemble; \u201cI have learned some fine things concerning your Musketeers.\u201d \u201cAnd I,\u201d said Treville, coldly, \u201cI have some pretty things to tell your Majesty concerning these gownsmen.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d said the king, with hauteur. \u201cI have the honor to inform your Majesty,\u201d continued M. de Treville, in the same tone, \u201cthat a party of PROCUREURS, commissaries, and men of the police--very estimable people, but very inveterate, as it appears, against the uniform--have taken upon themselves to arrest in a house, to lead away through the open street, and throw into Fort l\u2019Eveque, all upon an order which they have refused to show me, one of my, or rather your Musketeers, sire, of irreproachable conduct, of an almost illustrious reputation, and whom your Majesty knows favorably, Monsieur Athos.\u201d \u201cAthos,\u201d said the king, mechanically; \u201cyes, certainly I know that name.\u201d \u201cLet your Majesty remember,\u201d said Treville, \u201cthat Monsieur Athos is the Musketeer who, in the annoying duel which you are acquainted with, had the misfortune to wound Monsieur de Cahusac so seriously."], "Why does the Duke of Buckingham visit Queen Anne in the company of Madame Bonacieux?": [" Buckingham remained for a moment dazzled. Never had Anne of Austria appeared to him so beautiful, amid balls, fetes, or carousals, as she appeared to him at this moment, dressed in a simple robe of white satin, and accompanied by Donna Estafania--the only one of her Spanish women who had not been driven from her by the jealousy of the king or by the persecutions of Richelieu. Anne of Austria took two steps forward. Buckingham threw himself at her feet, and before the queen could prevent him, kissed the hem of her robe. \u201cDuke, you already know that it is not I who caused you to be written to.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, madame! Yes, your Majesty!\u201d cried the duke. \u201cI know that I must have been mad, senseless, to believe that snow would become animated or marble warm; but what then! They who love believe easily in love. Besides, I have lost nothing by this journey because I see you.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d replied Anne, \u201cbut you know why and how I see you; because, insensible to all my sufferings, you persist in remaining in a city where, by remaining, you run the risk of your life, and make me run the risk of my honor. I see you to tell you that everything separates us--the depths of the sea, the enmity of kingdoms, the sanctity of vows. It is sacrilege to struggle against so many things, my Lord. In short, I see you to tell you that we must never see each other again.\u201d \u201cSpeak on, madame, speak on, Queen,\u201d said Buckingham; \u201cthe sweetness of your voice covers the harshness of your words.", " She wrote two lines, sealed the letter with her private seal, and gave it to Mme. Bonacieux. \u201cAnd now,\u201d said the queen, \u201cwe are forgetting one very necessary thing.\u201d \u201cWhat is that, madame?\u201d \u201cMoney.\u201d Mme. Bonacieux blushed. \u201cYes, that is true,\u201d said she, \u201cand I will confess to your Majesty that my husband--\u201d \u201cYour husband has none. Is that what you would say?\u201d \u201cHe has some, but he is very avaricious; that is his fault. Nevertheless, let not your Majesty be uneasy, we will find means.\u201d \u201cAnd I have none, either,\u201d said the queen. Those who have read the MEMOIRS of Mme. de Motteville will not be astonished at this reply. \u201cBut wait a minute.\u201d Anne of Austria ran to her jewel case. \u201cHere,\u201d said she, \u201chere is a ring of great value, as I have been assured. It came from my brother, the King of Spain. It is mine, and I am at liberty to dispose of it. Take this ring; raise money with it, and let your husband set out.\u201d \u201cIn an hour you shall be obeyed.\u201d \u201cYou see the address,\u201d said the queen, speaking so low that Mme. Bonacieux could hardly hear what she said, \u201cTo my Lord Duke of Buckingham, London.\u201d \u201cThe letter shall be given to himself.\u201d \u201cGenerous girl!\u201d cried Anne of Austria. Mme. Bonacieux kissed the hands of the queen, concealed the paper in the bosom of her dress, and disappeared with the lightness of a bird. Ten minutes afterward she was at home. As she told the queen, she had not seen her husband since his liberation; she was ignorant of the change that had taken place in him with respect to the cardinal--a change which had since been strengthened by two or three visits from the Comte de Rochefort, who had become the best friend of Bonacieux, and had persuaded him, without much trouble, that no culpable sentiments had prompted the abduction of his wife, but that it was only a political precaution.", " Bonacieux to take twenty steps ahead, and then followed them, ready to execute the instructions of the noble and elegant minister of Charles I. Fortunately, he had no opportunity to give the duke this proof of his devotion, and the young woman and the handsome Musketeer entered the Louvre by the wicket of the Echelle without any interference. As for d\u2019Artagnan, he immediately repaired to the cabaret of the Pomme-de-Pin, where he found Porthos and Aramis awaiting him. Without giving them any explanation of the alarm and inconvenience he had caused them, he told them that he had terminated the affair alone in which he had for a moment believed he should need their assistance. Meanwhile, carried away as we are by our narrative, we must leave our three friends to themselves, and follow the Duke of Buckingham and his guide through the labyrinths of the Louvre. 12 GEORGE VILLIERS, DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM Mme. Bonacieux and the duke entered the Louvre without difficulty. Mme. Bonacieux was known to belong to the queen; the duke wore the uniform of the Musketeers of M. de Treville, who, as we have said, were that evening on guard. Besides, Germain was in the interests of the queen; and if anything should happen, Mme. Bonacieux would be accused of having introduced her lover into the Louvre, that was all. She took the risk upon herself. Her reputation would be lost, it is true; but of what value in the world was the reputation of the little wife of a mercer?", " \u201cOh, fear nothing, madame!\u201d said the young woman, clasping her hands and weeping herself at the queen\u2019s sorrows; \u201cI am your Majesty\u2019s, body and soul, and however far I may be from you, however inferior may be my position, I believe I have discovered a means of extricating your Majesty from your trouble.\u201d \u201cYou, oh, heaven, you!\u201d cried the queen; \u201cbut look me in the face. I am betrayed on all sides. Can I trust in you?\u201d \u201cOh, madame!\u201d cried the young woman, falling on her knees; \u201cupon my soul, I am ready to die for your Majesty!\u201d This expression sprang from the very bottom of the heart, and, like the first, there was no mistaking it. \u201cYes,\u201d continued Mme. Bonacieux, \u201cyes, there are traitors here; but by the holy name of the Virgin, I swear that no one is more devoted to your Majesty than I am. Those studs which the king speaks of, you gave them to the Duke of Buckingham, did you not? Those studs were enclosed in a little rosewood box which he held under his arm? Am I deceived? Is it not so, madame?\u201d \u201cOh, my God, my God!\u201d murmured the queen, whose teeth chattered with fright. \u201cWell, those studs,\u201d continued Mme. Bonacieux, \u201cwe must have them back again.\u201d \u201cYes, without doubt, it is necessary,\u201d cried the queen; \u201cbut how am I to act? How can it be effected?\u201d \u201cSomeone must be sent to the duke.\u201d \u201cBut who, who? In whom can I trust?\u201d \u201cPlace confidence in me, madame; do me that honor, my queen, and I will find a messenger.\u201d \u201cBut I must write.\u201d \u201cOh, yes; that is indispensable."], "To what end does the Duke of Buckingham propose waging war on France?": [" \u201cI do not know the man who deserves being regretted during the whole life of another man; but leave us, I pray you.\u201d The baron went out sobbing.

A physician was sought for, but none was yet found. \u201cYou will live, my Lord, you will live!\u201d repeated the faithful servant of Anne of Austria, on his knees before the duke\u2019s sofa. \u201cWhat has she written to me?\u201d said Buckingham, feebly, streaming with blood, and suppressing his agony to speak of her he loved, \u201cwhat has she written to me? Read me her letter.\u201d \u201cOh, my Lord!\u201d said Laporte. \u201cObey, Laporte, do you not see I have no time to lose?\u201d Laporte broke the seal, and placed the paper before the eyes of the duke; but Buckingham in vain tried to make out the writing. \u201cRead!\u201d said he, \u201cread! I cannot see. Read, then! For soon, perhaps, I shall not hear, and I shall die without knowing what she has written to me.\u201d Laporte made no further objection, and read: \u201cMy Lord, By that which, since I have known you, have suffered by you and for you, I conjure you, if you have any care for my repose, to countermand those great armaments which you are preparing against France, to put an end to a war of which it is publicly said religion is the ostensible cause, and of which, it is generally whispered, your love for me is the concealed cause. This war may not only bring great catastrophes upon England and France, but misfortune upon you, my Lord, for which I should never console myself.", " God will punish you hereafter, but I will punish you here!\u201d \u201cAh, this is too much!\u201d cried Buckingham, making a step toward the door. Felton barred his passage. \u201cI ask it humbly of you, my Lord,\u201d said he; \u201csign the order for the liberation of Milady de Winter.

But Felton did not give him time to draw it. He held the knife with which Milady had stabbed herself, open in his bosom; at one bound he was upon the duke. At that moment Patrick entered the room, crying, \u201cA letter from France, my Lord.\u201d \u201cFrom France!\u201d cried Buckingham, forgetting everything in thinking from whom that letter came.

Buckingham at once remembered the circumstance, and suspecting that something was going on in France of which it was necessary he should be informed, he only took the time to inquire where the messenger was, and recognizing from afar the uniform of the Guards, he put his horse into a gallop, and rode straight up to d\u2019Artagnan. Patrick discreetly kept in the background. \u201cNo misfortune has happened to the queen?\u201d cried Buckingham, the instant he came up, throwing all his fear and love into the question. \u201cI believe not; nevertheless I believe she runs some great peril from which your Grace alone can extricate her.\u201d \u201cI!\u201d cried Buckingham. \u201cWhat is it?

Fortunately, he had no opportunity to give the duke this proof of his devotion, and the young woman and the handsome Musketeer entered the Louvre by the wicket of the Echelle without any interference. As for d\u2019Artagnan, he immediately repaired to the cabaret of the Pomme-de-Pin, where he found Porthos and Aramis awaiting him. Without giving them any explanation of the alarm and inconvenience he had caused them, he told them that he had terminated the affair alone in which he had for a moment believed he should need their assistance. Meanwhile, carried away as we are by our narrative, we must leave our three friends to themselves, and follow the Duke of Buckingham and his guide through the labyrinths of the Louvre. 12 GEORGE VILLIERS, DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM Mme. Bonacieux and the duke entered the Louvre without difficulty. Mme. Bonacieux was known to belong to the queen; the duke wore the uniform of the Musketeers of M. de Treville, who, as we have said, were that evening on guard. Besides, Germain was in the interests of the queen; and if anything should happen, Mme. Bonacieux would be accused of having introduced her lover into the Louvre, that was all. She took the risk upon herself. Her reputation would be lost, it is true; but of what value in the world was the reputation of the little wife of a mercer?", " Once within the interior of the court, the duke and the young woman followed the wall for the space of about twenty-five steps. This space passed, Mme. Bonacieux pushed a little servants\u2019 door, open by day but generally closed at night. The door yielded. Both entered, and found themselves in darkness; but Mme. Bonacieux was acquainted with all the turnings and windings of this part of the Louvre, appropriated for the people of the household. She closed the door after her, took the duke by the hand, and after a few experimental steps, grasped a balustrade, put her foot upon the bottom step, and began to ascend the staircase. The duke counted two stories. She then turned to the right, followed the course of a long corridor, descended a flight, went a few steps farther, introduced a key into a lock, opened a door, and pushed the duke into an apartment lighted only by a lamp, saying, \u201cRemain here, my Lord Duke; someone will come.\u201d She then went out by the same door, which she locked, so that the duke found himself literally a prisoner. Nevertheless, isolated as he was, we must say that the Duke of Buckingham did not experience an instant of fear. One of the salient points of his character was the search for adventures and a love of romance. Brave, rash, and enterprising, this was not the first time he had risked his life in such attempts. He had learned that the pretended message from Anne of Austria, upon the faith of which he had come to Paris, was a snare; but instead of regaining England, he had, abusing the position in which he had been placed, declared to the queen that he would not depart without seeing her.", " Besides, the casket is the more precious from being all that is left to me. You will say that I keep it.\u201d \u201cI will perform your commission, word for word, my Lord.\u201d \u201cAnd now,\u201d resumed Buckingham, looking earnestly at the young man, \u201chow shall I ever acquit myself of the debt I owe you?\u201d D\u2019Artagnan blushed up to the whites of his eyes.

The young man advanced rapidly into the chamber, leaving the door open behind him, and making a sign to Milady to be silent; his face was much agitated. \u201cWhat do you want with me?\u201d said she. \u201cListen,\u201d replied Felton, in a low voice. \u201cI have just sent away the sentinel that I might remain here without anybody knowing it, in order to speak to you without being overheard. The baron has just related a frightful story to me.\u201d Milady assumed her smile of a resigned victim, and shook her head. \u201cEither you are a demon,\u201d continued Felton, \u201cor the baron--my benefactor, my father--is a monster. I have known you four days; I have loved him four years. I therefore may hesitate between you. Be not alarmed at what I say; I want to be convinced. Tonight, after twelve, I will come and see you, and you shall convince me.\u201d \u201cNo, Felton, no, my brother,\u201d said she; \u201cthe sacrifice is too great, and I feel what it must cost you. No, I am lost; do not be lost with me. My death will be much more eloquent than my life, and the silence of the corpse will convince you much better than the words of the prisoner.\u201d \u201cBe silent, madame,\u201d cried Felton, \u201cand do not speak to me thus; I came to entreat you to promise me upon your honor, to swear to me by what you hold most sacred, that you will make no attempt upon your life.\u201d \u201cI will not promise,\u201d said Milady, \u201cfor no one has more respect for a promise or an oath than I have; and if I make a promise I must keep it.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Felton, \u201conly promise till you have seen me again.", " This time, as he was well attended, he looked at them sternly, and made a sign with his eye and hand for d\u2019Artagnan to follow him. D\u2019Artagnan obeyed. \u201cWe shall wait for you, d\u2019Artagnan,\u201d said Athos, loud enough for the cardinal to hear him. His Eminence bent his brow, stopped for an instant, and then kept on his way without uttering a single word. D\u2019Artagnan entered after the cardinal, and behind d\u2019Artagnan the door was guarded. His Eminence entered the chamber which served him as a study, and made a sign to Rochefort to bring in the young Musketeer. Rochefort obeyed and retired. D\u2019Artagnan remained alone in front of the cardinal; this was his second interview with Richelieu, and he afterward confessed that he felt well assured it would be his last. Richelieu remained standing, leaning against the mantelpiece; a table was between him and d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cMonsieur,\u201d said the cardinal, \u201cyou have been arrested by my orders.\u201d \u201cSo they tell me, monseigneur.\u201d \u201cDo you know why?\u201d \u201cNo, monseigneur, for the only thing for which I could be arrested is still unknown to your Eminence.\u201d Richelieu looked steadfastly at the young man. \u201cHolloa!\u201d said he, \u201cwhat does that mean?\u201d \u201cIf Monseigneur will have the goodness to tell me, in the first place, what crimes are imputed to me, I will then tell him the deeds I have really done.\u201d \u201cCrimes are imputed to you which had brought down far loftier heads than yours, monsieur,\u201d said the cardinal.", " While d\u2019Artagnan was examining Mme. Bonacieux, and was, as we have said, close to her, he saw on the ground a fine cambric handkerchief, which he picked up, as was his habit, and at the corner of which he recognized the same cipher he had seen on the handkerchief which had nearly caused him and Aramis to cut each other\u2019s throat. From that time, d\u2019Artagnan had been cautious with respect to handkerchiefs with arms on them, and he therefore placed in the pocket of Mme. Bonacieux the one he had just picked up. At that moment Mme. Bonacieux recovered her senses. She opened her eyes, looked around her with terror, saw that the apartment was empty and that she was alone with her liberator. She extended her hands to him with a smile. Mme. Bonacieux had the sweetest smile in the world. \u201cAh, monsieur!\u201d said she, \u201cyou have saved me; permit me to thank you.\u201d \u201cMadame,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cI have only done what every gentleman would have done in my place; you owe me no thanks.\u201d \u201cOh, yes, monsieur, oh, yes; and I hope to prove to you that you have not served an ingrate. But what could these men, whom I at first took for robbers, want with me, and why is Monsieur Bonacieux not here?\u201d \u201cMadame, those men were more dangerous than any robbers could have been, for they are the agents of the cardinal; and as to your husband, Monsieur Bonacieux, he is not here because he was yesterday evening conducted to the Bastille.\u201d \u201cMy husband in the Bastille!\u201d cried Mme.", " I will have my eye upon you, for I shall be there,\u201d replied the cardinal, pointing with his finger to a magnificent suit of armor he was to wear, \u201cand on our return, well--we will settle our account!\u201d \u201cYoung man,\u201d said Richelieu, \u201cif I shall be able to say to you at another time what I have said to you today, I promise you to do so.\u201d This last expression of Richelieu\u2019s conveyed a terrible doubt; it alarmed d\u2019Artagnan more than a menace would have done, for it was a warning. The cardinal, then, was seeking to preserve him from some misfortune which threatened him. He opened his mouth to reply, but with a haughty gesture the cardinal dismissed him. D\u2019Artagnan went out, but at the door his heart almost failed him, and he felt inclined to return. Then the noble and severe countenance of Athos crossed his mind; if he made the compact with the cardinal which he required, Athos would no more give him his hand--Athos would renounce him. It was this fear that restrained him, so powerful is the influence of a truly great character on all that surrounds it. D\u2019Artagnan descended by the staircase at which he had entered, and found Athos and the four Musketeers waiting his appearance, and beginning to grow uneasy. With a word, d\u2019Artagnan reassured them; and Planchet ran to inform the other sentinels that it was useless to keep guard longer, as his master had come out safe from the Palais-Cardinal."], "What secret does the King discover when he searches the Queen\u2019s private correspondence?": [" Half an hour after the entrance of the king, fresh acclamations were heard; these announced the arrival of the queen. The aldermen did as they had done before, and preceded by their sergeants, advanced to receive their illustrious guest. The queen entered the great hall; and it was remarked that, like the king, she looked dull and even weary. At the moment she entered, the curtain of a small gallery which to that time had been closed, was drawn, and the pale face of the cardinal appeared, he being dressed as a Spanish cavalier. His eyes were fixed upon those of the queen, and a smile of terrible joy passed over his lips; the queen did not wear her diamond studs. The queen remained for a short time to receive the compliments of the city dignitaries and to reply to the salutations of the ladies. All at once the king appeared with the cardinal at one of the doors of the hall. The cardinal was speaking to him in a low voice, and the king was very pale. The king made his way through the crowd without a mask, and the ribbons of his doublet scarcely tied. He went straight to the queen, and in an altered voice said, \u201cWhy, madame, have you not thought proper to wear your diamond studs, when you know it would give me so much gratification?\u201d The queen cast a glance around her, and saw the cardinal behind, with a diabolical smile on his countenance. \u201cSire,\u201d replied the queen, with a faltering voice, \u201cbecause, in the midst of such a crowd as this, I feared some accident might happen to them.\u201d \u201cAnd you were wrong, madame.", " In the first place, that, unfortunately, your husband is a simpleton and a fool; in the next place, you are in trouble, of which I am very glad, as it gives me an opportunity of placing myself at your service, and God knows I am ready to throw myself into the fire for you; finally, that the queen wants a brave, intelligent, devoted man to make a journey to London for her. I have at least two of the three qualities you stand in need of, and here I am.\u201d Mme. Bonacieux made no reply; but her heart beat with joy and secret hope shone in her eyes. \u201cAnd what guarantee will you give me,\u201d asked she, \u201cif I consent to confide this message to you?\u201d \u201cMy love for you. Speak! Command! What is to be done?\u201d \u201cMy God, my God!\u201d murmured the young woman, \u201cought I to confide such a secret to you, monsieur? You are almost a boy.\u201d \u201cI see that you require someone to answer for me?\u201d \u201cI admit that would reassure me greatly.\u201d \u201cDo you know Athos?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cPorthos?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cAramis?\u201d \u201cNo. Who are these gentleman?\u201d \u201cThree of the king\u2019s Musketeers. Do you know Monsieur de Treville, their captain?\u201d \u201cOh, yes, him! I know him; not personally, but from having heard the queen speak of him more than once as a brave and loyal gentleman.\u201d \u201cYou do not fear lest he should betray you to the cardinal?\u201d \u201cOh, no, certainly not!\u201d \u201cWell, reveal your secret to him, and ask him whether, however important, however valuable, however terrible it may be, you may not confide it to me.\u201d \u201cBut this secret is not mine, and I cannot reveal it in this manner.\u201d \u201cYou were about to confide it to Monsieur Bonacieux,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, with chagrin.", " If I made you that present it was that you might adorn yourself therewith. I tell you that you were wrong.\u201d The voice of the king was tremulous with anger. Everybody looked and listened with astonishment, comprehending nothing of what passed. \u201cSire,\u201d said the queen, \u201cI can send for them to the Louvre, where they are, and thus your Majesty\u2019s wishes will be complied with.\u201d \u201cDo so, madame, do so, and that at once; for within an hour the ballet will commence.\u201d The queen bent in token of submission, and followed the ladies who were to conduct her to her room. On his part the king returned to his apartment. There was a moment of trouble and confusion in the assembly. Everybody had remarked that something had passed between the king and queen; but both of them had spoken so low that everybody, out of respect, withdrew several steps, so that nobody had heard anything. The violins began to sound with all their might, but nobody listened to them. The king came out first from his room. He was in a most elegant hunting costume; and Monsieur and the other nobles were dressed like him. This was the costume that best became the king. So dressed, he really appeared the first gentleman of his kingdom. The cardinal drew near to the king, and placed in his hand a small casket. The king opened it, and found in it two diamond studs. \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d demanded he of the cardinal. \u201cNothing,\u201d replied the latter; \u201conly, if the queen has the studs, which I very much doubt, count them, sire, and if you only find ten, ask her Majesty who can have stolen from her the two studs that are here.\u201d The king looked at the cardinal as if to interrogate him; but he had not time to address any question to him--a cry of admiration burst from every mouth.", " If the king appeared to be the first gentleman of his kingdom, the queen was without doubt the most beautiful woman in France. It is true that the habit of a huntress became her admirably. She wore a beaver hat with blue feathers, a surtout of gray-pearl velvet, fastened with diamond clasps, and a petticoat of blue satin, embroidered with silver. On her left shoulder sparkled the diamond studs, on a bow of the same color as the plumes and the petticoat. The king trembled with joy and the cardinal with vexation; although, distant as they were from the queen, they could not count the studs. The queen had them. The only question was, had she ten or twelve? At that moment the violins sounded the signal for the ballet. The king advanced toward Madame the President, with whom he was to dance, and his Highness Monsieur with the queen. They took their places, and the ballet began. The king danced facing the queen, and every time he passed by her, he devoured with his eyes those studs of which he could not ascertain the number. A cold sweat covered the brow of the cardinal. The ballet lasted an hour, and had sixteen ENTREES. The ballet ended amid the applause of the whole assemblage, and everyone reconducted his lady to her place; but the king took advantage of the privilege he had of leaving his lady, to advance eagerly toward the queen. \u201cI thank you, madame,\u201d said he, \u201cfor the deference you have shown to my wishes, but I think you want two of the studs, and I bring them back to you.\u201d With these words he held out to the queen the two studs the cardinal had given him."], "How does the King feel when he discovers the Queen\u2019s plot against the Cardinal?": [" Half an hour after the entrance of the king, fresh acclamations were heard; these announced the arrival of the queen. The aldermen did as they had done before, and preceded by their sergeants, advanced to receive their illustrious guest. The queen entered the great hall; and it was remarked that, like the king, she looked dull and even weary. At the moment she entered, the curtain of a small gallery which to that time had been closed, was drawn, and the pale face of the cardinal appeared, he being dressed as a Spanish cavalier. His eyes were fixed upon those of the queen, and a smile of terrible joy passed over his lips; the queen did not wear her diamond studs. The queen remained for a short time to receive the compliments of the city dignitaries and to reply to the salutations of the ladies. All at once the king appeared with the cardinal at one of the doors of the hall. The cardinal was speaking to him in a low voice, and the king was very pale. The king made his way through the crowd without a mask, and the ribbons of his doublet scarcely tied. He went straight to the queen, and in an altered voice said, \u201cWhy, madame, have you not thought proper to wear your diamond studs, when you know it would give me so much gratification?\u201d The queen cast a glance around her, and saw the cardinal behind, with a diabolical smile on his countenance. \u201cSire,\u201d replied the queen, with a faltering voice, \u201cbecause, in the midst of such a crowd as this, I feared some accident might happen to them.\u201d \u201cAnd you were wrong, madame.", " If I made you that present it was that you might adorn yourself therewith. I tell you that you were wrong.\u201d The voice of the king was tremulous with anger. Everybody looked and listened with astonishment, comprehending nothing of what passed. \u201cSire,\u201d said the queen, \u201cI can send for them to the Louvre, where they are, and thus your Majesty\u2019s wishes will be complied with.\u201d \u201cDo so, madame, do so, and that at once; for within an hour the ballet will commence.\u201d The queen bent in token of submission, and followed the ladies who were to conduct her to her room. On his part the king returned to his apartment. There was a moment of trouble and confusion in the assembly. Everybody had remarked that something had passed between the king and queen; but both of them had spoken so low that everybody, out of respect, withdrew several steps, so that nobody had heard anything. The violins began to sound with all their might, but nobody listened to them. The king came out first from his room. He was in a most elegant hunting costume; and Monsieur and the other nobles were dressed like him. This was the costume that best became the king. So dressed, he really appeared the first gentleman of his kingdom. The cardinal drew near to the king, and placed in his hand a small casket. The king opened it, and found in it two diamond studs. \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d demanded he of the cardinal. \u201cNothing,\u201d replied the latter; \u201conly, if the queen has the studs, which I very much doubt, count them, sire, and if you only find ten, ask her Majesty who can have stolen from her the two studs that are here.\u201d The king looked at the cardinal as if to interrogate him; but he had not time to address any question to him--a cry of admiration burst from every mouth.", " \u201cHow, sire?\u201d cried the young queen, affecting surprise, \u201cyou are giving me, then, two more: I shall have fourteen.\u201d In fact the king counted them, and the twelve studs were all on her Majesty\u2019s shoulder. The king called the cardinal. \u201cWhat does this mean, Monsieur Cardinal?\u201d asked the king in a severe tone. \u201cThis means, sire,\u201d replied the cardinal, \u201cthat I was desirous of presenting her Majesty with these two studs, and that not daring to offer them myself, I adopted this means of inducing her to accept them.\u201d \u201cAnd I am the more grateful to your Eminence,\u201d replied Anne of Austria, with a smile that proved she was not the dupe of this ingenious gallantry, \u201cfrom being certain that these two studs alone have cost you as much as all the others cost his Majesty.\u201d Then saluting the king and the cardinal, the queen resumed her way to the chamber in which she had dressed, and where she was to take off her costume. The attention which we have been obliged to give, during the commencement of the chapter, to the illustrious personages we have introduced into it, has diverted us for an instant from him to whom Anne of Austria owed the extraordinary triumph she had obtained over the cardinal; and who, confounded, unknown, lost in the crowd gathered at one of the doors, looked on at this scene, comprehensible only to four persons--the king, the queen, his Eminence, and himself. The queen had just regained her chamber, and d\u2019Artagnan was about to retire, when he felt his shoulder lightly touched.", " But what can I do for you?\u201d Then d\u2019Artagnan told M. de Treville a long history about the queen. He expressed to him the fears he entertained with respect to her Majesty; he related to him what he had heard of the projects of the cardinal with regard to Buckingham, and all with a tranquillity and candor of which M. de Treville was the more the dupe, from having himself, as we have said, observed something fresh between the cardinal, the king, and the queen. As ten o\u2019clock was striking, d\u2019Artagnan left M. de Treville, who thanked him for his information, recommended him to have the service of the king and queen always at heart, and returned to the saloon; but at the foot of the stairs, d\u2019Artagnan remembered he had forgotten his cane. He consequently sprang up again, re-entered the office, with a turn of his finger set the clock right again, that it might not be perceived the next day that it had been put wrong, and certain from that time that he had a witness to prove his alibi, he ran downstairs and soon found himself in the street. 11 IN WHICH THE PLOT THICKENS His visit to M. de Treville being paid, the pensive d\u2019Artagnan took the longest way homeward. On what was d\u2019Artagnan thinking, that he strayed thus from his path, gazing at the stars of heaven, and sometimes sighing, sometimes smiling? He was thinking of Mme. Bonacieux. For an apprentice Musketeer the young woman was almost an ideal of love."], "How does the King try to make amends with the Queen for searching her private correspondence?": [" Half an hour after the entrance of the king, fresh acclamations were heard; these announced the arrival of the queen.

He saw that the duke was searching for a means of making him accept something and the idea that the blood of his friends and himself was about to be paid for with English gold was strangely repugnant to him. \u201cLet us understand each other, my Lord,\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cand let us make things clear beforehand in order that there may be no mistake. I am in the service of the King and Queen of France, and form part of the company of Monsieur Dessessart, who, as well as his brother-in-law, Monsieur de Treville, is particularly attached to their Majesties. What I have done, then, has been for the queen, and not at all for your Grace. And still further, it is very probable I should not have done anything of this, if it had not been to make myself agreeable to someone who is my lady, as the queen is yours.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said the duke, smiling, \u201cand I even believe that I know that other person; it is--\u201d \u201cMy Lord, I have not named her!\u201d interrupted the young man, warmly. \u201cThat is true,\u201d said the duke; \u201cand it is to this person I am bound to discharge my debt of gratitude.\u201d \u201cYou have said, my Lord; for truly, at this moment when there is question of war, I confess to you that I see nothing in your Grace but an Englishman, and consequently an enemy whom I should have much greater pleasure in meeting on the field of battle than in the park at Windsor or the corridors of the Louvre--all which, however, will not prevent me from executing to the very point my commission or from laying down my life, if there be need of it, to accomplish it; but I repeat it to your Grace, without your having personally on that account more to thank me for in this second interview than for what I did for you in the first.\u201d \u201cWe say, \u2018Proud as a Scotsman,\u2019\u201d murmured the Duke of Buckingham.", " If I made you that present it was that you might adorn yourself therewith.

D\u2019Artagnan took his hat, examined the hole made by the ball, and shook his head. The ball was not a musket ball--it was an arquebus ball. The accuracy of the aim had first given him the idea that a special weapon had been employed. This could not, then, be a military ambuscade, as the ball was not of the regular caliber. This might be a kind remembrance of Monsieur the Cardinal. It may be observed that at the very moment when, thanks to the ray of the sun, he perceived the gun barrel, he was thinking with astonishment on the forbearance of his Eminence with respect to him. But d\u2019Artagnan again shook his head. For people toward whom he had but to put forth his hand, his Eminence had rarely recourse to such means. It might be a vengeance of Milady; that was most probable.

Buckingham at once remembered the circumstance, and suspecting that something was going on in France of which it was necessary he should be informed, he only took the time to inquire where the messenger was, and recognizing from afar the uniform of the Guards, he put his horse into a gallop, and rode straight up to d\u2019Artagnan. Patrick discreetly kept in the background. \u201cNo misfortune has happened to the queen?\u201d cried Buckingham, the instant he came up, throwing all his fear and love into the question. \u201cI believe not; nevertheless I believe she runs some great peril from which your Grace alone can extricate her.\u201d \u201cI!\u201d cried Buckingham. \u201cWhat is it?

The queen was, as we have said, of great beauty. The commission might well be called delicate; and the king had reached, in his jealousy of Buckingham, the point of not being jealous of anyone else.", " The officer took Bonacieux by the arm, and led him into the antechamber, where he found his two guards.

M de Treville requested Athos, whatever might happen, to be observant of his duty to the king, but particularly to the queen, begging him to convey his desires to his comrades. As to d\u2019Artagnan, he did not budge from his apartment. He converted his chamber into an observatory. From his windows he saw all the visitors who were caught. Then, having removed a plank from his floor, and nothing remaining but a simple ceiling between him and the room beneath, in which the interrogatories were made, he heard all that passed between the inquisitors and the accused. The interrogatories, preceded by a minute search operated upon the persons arrested, were almost always framed thus: \u201cHas Madame Bonacieux sent anything to you for her husband, or any other person? Has Monsieur Bonacieux sent anything to you for his wife, or for any other person? Has either of them confided anything to you by word of mouth?\u201d \u201cIf they knew anything, they would not question people in this manner,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan to himself. \u201cNow, what is it they want to know? Why, they want to know if the Duke of Buckingham is in Paris, and if he has had, or is likely to have, an interview with the queen.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan held onto this idea, which, from what he had heard, was not wanting in probability. In the meantime, the mousetrap continued in operation, and likewise d\u2019Artagnan\u2019s vigilance."], "How does the Duke of Buckingham attempt to prevent Lady de Winter from getting to the Cardinal?": [" \u201cPardon, my Lord,\u201d said Felton, stopping the duke; \u201cbut does your Grace know that the name of Charlotte Backson is not the true name of this young woman?\u201d \u201cYes, sir, I know it,\u201d replied the duke, dipping the quill in the ink. \u201cThen your Grace knows her real name?\u201d asked Felton, in a sharp tone. \u201cI know it\u201d; and the duke put the quill to the paper. Felton grew pale. \u201cAnd knowing that real name, my Lord,\u201d replied Felton, \u201cwill you sign it all the same?\u201d \u201cDoubtless,\u201d said Buckingham, \u201cand rather twice than once.\u201d \u201cI cannot believe,\u201d continued Felton, in a voice that became more sharp and rough, \u201cthat your Grace knows that it is to Milady de Winter this relates.\u201d \u201cI know it perfectly, although I am astonished that you know it.\u201d \u201cAnd will your Grace sign that order without remorse?\u201d Buckingham looked at the young man haughtily. \u201cDo you know, sir, that you are asking me very strange questions, and that I am very foolish to answer them?\u201d \u201cReply to them, my Lord,\u201d said Felton; \u201cthe circumstances are more serious than you perhaps believe.\u201d Buckingham reflected that the young man, coming from Lord de Winter, undoubtedly spoke in his name, and softened. \u201cWithout remorse,\u201d said he. \u201cThe baron knows, as well as myself, that Milady de Winter is a very guilty woman, and it is treating her very favorably to commute her punishment to transportation.\u201d The duke put his pen to the paper. \u201cYou will not sign that order, my Lord!\u201d said Felton, making a step toward the duke.", " \u201cAh, traitor,\u201d cried Buckingham, \u201cyou have killed me!\u201d \u201cMurder!\u201d screamed Patrick. Felton cast his eyes round for means of escape, and seeing the door free, he rushed into the next chamber, in which, as we have said, the deputies from La Rochelle were waiting, crossed it as quickly as possible, and rushed toward the staircase; but upon the first step he met Lord de Winter, who, seeing him pale, confused, livid, and stained with blood both on his hands and face, seized him by the throat, crying, \u201cI knew it! I guessed it! But too late by a minute, unfortunate, unfortunate that I am!\u201d Felton made no resistance. Lord de Winter placed him in the hands of the guards, who led him, while awaiting further orders, to a little terrace commanding the sea; and then the baron hastened to the duke\u2019s chamber. At the cry uttered by the duke and the scream of Patrick, the man whom Felton had met in the antechamber rushed into the chamber. He found the duke reclining upon a sofa, with his hand pressed upon the wound. \u201cLaporte,\u201d said the duke, in a dying voice, \u201cLaporte, do you come from her?\u201d \u201cYes, monseigneur,\u201d replied the faithful cloak bearer of Anne of Austria, \u201cbut too late, perhaps.\u201d \u201cSilence, Laporte, you may be overheard. Patrick, let no one enter. Oh, I cannot tell what she says to me! My God, I am dying!\u201d And the duke swooned. Meanwhile, Lord de Winter, the deputies, the leaders of the expedition, the officers of Buckingham\u2019s household, had all made their way into the chamber.", " \u201cLieutenant Felton, from Lord de Winter,\u201d said Patrick. \u201cFrom Lord de Winter!\u201d repeated Buckingham; \u201clet him come in.\u201d Felton entered. At that moment Buckingham was throwing upon a couch a rich toilet robe, worked with gold, in order to put on a blue velvet doublet embroidered with pearls. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t the baron come himself?\u201d demanded Buckingham. \u201cI expected him this morning.\u201d \u201cHe desired me to tell your Grace,\u201d replied Felton, \u201cthat he very much regretted not having that honor, but that he was prevented by the guard he is obliged to keep at the castle.\u201d \u201cYes, I know that,\u201d said Buckingham; \u201che has a prisoner.\u201d \u201cIt is of that prisoner that I wish to speak to your Grace,\u201d replied Felton. \u201cWell, then, speak!\u201d \u201cThat which I have to say of her can only be heard by yourself, my Lord!\u201d \u201cLeave us, Patrick,\u201d said Buckingham; \u201cbut remain within sound of the bell. I shall call you presently.\u201d Patrick went out. \u201cWe are alone, sir,\u201d said Buckingham; \u201cspeak!\u201d \u201cMy Lord,\u201d said Felton, \u201cthe Baron de Winter wrote to you the other day to request you to sign an order of embarkation relative to a young woman named Charlotte Backson.\u201d \u201cYes, sir; and I answered him, to bring or send me that order and I would sign it.\u201d \u201cHere it is, my Lord.\u201d \u201cGive it to me,\u201d said the duke. And taking it from Felton, he cast a rapid glance over the paper, and perceiving that it was the one that had been mentioned to him, he placed it on the table, took a pen, and prepared to sign it.", " God will punish you hereafter, but I will punish you here!\u201d \u201cAh, this is too much!\u201d cried Buckingham, making a step toward the door. Felton barred his passage. \u201cI ask it humbly of you, my Lord,\u201d said he; \u201csign the order for the liberation of Milady de Winter. Remember that she is a woman whom you have dishonored.\u201d \u201cWithdraw, sir,\u201d said Buckingham, \u201cor I will call my attendant, and have you placed in irons.\u201d \u201cYou shall not call,\u201d said Felton, throwing himself between the duke and the bell placed on a stand encrusted with silver. \u201cBeware, my Lord, you are in the hands of God!\u201d \u201cIn the hands of the devil, you mean!\u201d cried Buckingham, raising his voice so as to attract the notice of his people, without absolutely shouting. \u201cSign, my Lord; sign the liberation of Milady de Winter,\u201d said Felton, holding out a paper to the duke. \u201cBy force? You are joking! Holloa, Patrick!\u201d \u201cSign, my Lord!\u201d \u201cNever.\u201d \u201cNever?\u201d \u201cHelp!\u201d shouted the duke; and at the same time he sprang toward his sword. But Felton did not give him time to draw it. He held the knife with which Milady had stabbed herself, open in his bosom; at one bound he was upon the duke. At that moment Patrick entered the room, crying, \u201cA letter from France, my Lord.\u201d \u201cFrom France!\u201d cried Buckingham, forgetting everything in thinking from whom that letter came. Felton took advantage of this moment, and plunged the knife into his side up to the handle."], "What does the Queen give D\u2019Artagnan as a token of her gratitude for retrieving her brooch?": [" Half an hour after the entrance of the king, fresh acclamations were heard; these announced the arrival of the queen. The aldermen did as they had done before, and preceded by their sergeants, advanced to receive their illustrious guest. The queen entered the great hall; and it was remarked that, like the king, she looked dull and even weary. At the moment she entered, the curtain of a small gallery which to that time had been closed, was drawn, and the pale face of the cardinal appeared, he being dressed as a Spanish cavalier. His eyes were fixed upon those of the queen, and a smile of terrible joy passed over his lips; the queen did not wear her diamond studs. The queen remained for a short time to receive the compliments of the city dignitaries and to reply to the salutations of the ladies. All at once the king appeared with the cardinal at one of the doors of the hall. The cardinal was speaking to him in a low voice, and the king was very pale. The king made his way through the crowd without a mask, and the ribbons of his doublet scarcely tied. He went straight to the queen, and in an altered voice said, \u201cWhy, madame, have you not thought proper to wear your diamond studs, when you know it would give me so much gratification?\u201d The queen cast a glance around her, and saw the cardinal behind, with a diabolical smile on his countenance. \u201cSire,\u201d replied the queen, with a faltering voice, \u201cbecause, in the midst of such a crowd as this, I feared some accident might happen to them.\u201d \u201cAnd you were wrong, madame.", " If I made you that present it was that you might adorn yourself therewith. I tell you that you were wrong.\u201d The voice of the king was tremulous with anger. Everybody looked and listened with astonishment, comprehending nothing of what passed. \u201cSire,\u201d said the queen, \u201cI can send for them to the Louvre, where they are, and thus your Majesty\u2019s wishes will be complied with.\u201d \u201cDo so, madame, do so, and that at once; for within an hour the ballet will commence.\u201d The queen bent in token of submission, and followed the ladies who were to conduct her to her room. On his part the king returned to his apartment. There was a moment of trouble and confusion in the assembly. Everybody had remarked that something had passed between the king and queen; but both of them had spoken so low that everybody, out of respect, withdrew several steps, so that nobody had heard anything. The violins began to sound with all their might, but nobody listened to them. The king came out first from his room. He was in a most elegant hunting costume; and Monsieur and the other nobles were dressed like him. This was the costume that best became the king. So dressed, he really appeared the first gentleman of his kingdom. The cardinal drew near to the king, and placed in his hand a small casket. The king opened it, and found in it two diamond studs. \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d demanded he of the cardinal. \u201cNothing,\u201d replied the latter; \u201conly, if the queen has the studs, which I very much doubt, count them, sire, and if you only find ten, ask her Majesty who can have stolen from her the two studs that are here.\u201d The king looked at the cardinal as if to interrogate him; but he had not time to address any question to him--a cry of admiration burst from every mouth.", " \u201cOnly grazed a little,\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cmy fingers were caught between two stones--that of the wall and that of my ring--and the skin was broken.\u201d \u201cThat comes of wearing diamonds, my master,\u201d said Athos, disdainfully. \u201cAh, to be sure,\u201d cried Porthos, \u201cthere is a diamond. Why the devil, then, do we plague ourselves about money, when there is a diamond?\u201d \u201cStop a bit!\u201d said Aramis. \u201cWell thought of, Porthos; this time you have an idea.\u201d \u201cUndoubtedly,\u201d said Porthos, drawing himself up at Athos\u2019s compliment; \u201cas there is a diamond, let us sell it.\u201d \u201cBut,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cit is the queen\u2019s diamond.\u201d \u201cThe stronger reason why it should be sold,\u201d replied Athos. \u201cThe queen saving Monsieur de Buckingham, her lover; nothing more just. The queen saving us, her friends; nothing more moral. Let us sell the diamond. What says Monsieur the Abbe? I don\u2019t ask Porthos; his opinion has been given.\u201d \u201cWhy, I think,\u201d said Aramis, blushing as usual, \u201cthat his ring not coming from a mistress, and consequently not being a love token, d\u2019Artagnan may sell it.\u201d \u201cMy dear Aramis, you speak like theology personified. Your advice, then, is--\u201d \u201cTo sell the diamond,\u201d replied Aramis. \u201cWell, then,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, gaily, \u201clet us sell the diamond, and say no more about it.\u201d The fusillade continued; but the four friends were out of reach, and the Rochellais only fired to appease their consciences. \u201cMy faith, it was time that idea came into Porthos\u2019s head.", " The officer took Bonacieux by the arm, and led him into the antechamber, where he found his two guards. The newly introduced personage followed Bonacieux impatiently with his eyes till he had gone out; and the moment the door closed, \u201cThey have seen each other;\u201d said he, approaching the cardinal eagerly. \u201cWho?\u201d asked his Eminence. \u201cHe and she.\u201d \u201cThe queen and the duke?\u201d cried Richelieu. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d \u201cAt the Louvre.\u201d \u201cAre you sure of it?\u201d \u201cPerfectly sure.\u201d \u201cWho told you of it?\u201d \u201cMadame de Lannoy, who is devoted to your Eminence, as you know.\u201d \u201cWhy did she not let me know sooner?\u201d \u201cWhether by chance or mistrust, the queen made Madame de Surgis sleep in her chamber, and detained her all day.\u201d \u201cWell, we are beaten!

Aramis said that as these sorts of affairs were mysterious, it was better not to fathom them. They understood, then, from the few words which escaped from d\u2019Artagnan, what affair was in hand, and as they thought that overtaking his man, or losing sight of him, d\u2019Artagnan would return to his rooms, they kept on their way. When they entered d\u2019Artagnan\u2019s chamber, it was empty; the landlord, dreading the consequences of the encounter which was doubtless about to take place between the young man and the stranger, had, consistent with the character he had given himself, judged it prudent to decamp. 9 D\u2019ARTAGNAN SHOWS HIMSELF As Athos and Porthos had foreseen, at the expiration of a half hour, d\u2019Artagnan returned. He had again missed his man, who had disappeared as if by enchantment. D\u2019Artagnan had run, sword in hand, through all the neighboring streets, but had found nobody resembling the man he sought for. Then he came back to the point where, perhaps, he ought to have begun, and that was to knock at the door against which the stranger had leaned; but this proved useless--for though he knocked ten or twelve times in succession, no one answered, and some of the neighbors, who put their noses out of their windows or were brought to their doors by the noise, had assured him that that house, all the openings of which were tightly closed, had not been inhabited for six months.", " I know them from having heard one of their friends, Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan, say a great deal about them.\u201d \u201cYou know Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan!\u201d cried the novice, in her turn seizing the hands of Milady and devouring her with her eyes. Then remarking the strange expression of Milady\u2019s countenance, she said, \u201cPardon me, madame; you know him by what title?\u201d \u201cWhy,\u201d replied Milady, embarrassed, \u201cwhy, by the title of friend.\u201d \u201cYou deceive me, madame,\u201d said the novice; \u201cyou have been his mistress!\u201d \u201cIt is you who have been his mistress, madame!\u201d cried Milady, in her turn. \u201cI?\u201d said the novice. \u201cYes, you! I know you now. You are Madame Bonacieux!\u201d The young woman drew back, filled with surprise and terror. \u201cOh, do not deny it! Answer!\u201d continued Milady. \u201cWell, yes, madame,\u201d said the novice, \u201cAre we rivals?\u201d The countenance of Milady was illumined by so savage a joy that under any other circumstances Mme. Bonacieux would have fled in terror; but she was absorbed by jealousy. \u201cSpeak, madame!\u201d resumed Mme. Bonacieux, with an energy of which she might not have been believed capable. \u201cHave you been, or are you, his mistress?\u201d \u201cOh, no!\u201d cried Milady, with an accent that admitted no doubt of her truth. \u201cNever, never!\u201d \u201cI believe you,\u201d said Mme. Bonacieux; \u201cbut why, then, did you cry out so?\u201d \u201cDo you not understand?\u201d said Milady, who had already overcome her agitation and recovered all her presence of mind.", " M Bonacieux was at his door. D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s intention was to go out without speaking to the worthy mercer; but the latter made so polite and friendly a salutation that his tenant felt obliged, not only to stop, but to enter into conversation with him. Besides, how is it possible to avoid a little condescension toward a husband whose pretty wife has appointed a meeting with you that same evening at St. Cloud, opposite D\u2019Estrees\u2019s pavilion? D\u2019Artagnan approached him with the most amiable air he could assume. The conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor man. M. Bonacieux, who was ignorant that d\u2019Artagnan had overheard his conversation with the stranger of Meung, related to his young tenant the persecutions of that monster, M. de Laffemas, whom he never ceased to designate, during his account, by the title of the \u201ccardinal\u2019s executioner,\u201d and expatiated at great length upon the Bastille, the bolts, the wickets, the dungeons, the gratings, the instruments of torture. D\u2019Artagnan listened to him with exemplary complaisance, and when he had finished said, \u201cAnd Madame Bonacieux, do you know who carried her off?--For I do not forget that I owe to that unpleasant circumstance the good fortune of having made your acquaintance.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d said Bonacieux, \u201cthey took good care not to tell me that; and my wife, on her part, has sworn to me by all that\u2019s sacred that she does not know.", " While d\u2019Artagnan was examining Mme. Bonacieux, and was, as we have said, close to her, he saw on the ground a fine cambric handkerchief, which he picked up, as was his habit, and at the corner of which he recognized the same cipher he had seen on the handkerchief which had nearly caused him and Aramis to cut each other\u2019s throat. From that time, d\u2019Artagnan had been cautious with respect to handkerchiefs with arms on them, and he therefore placed in the pocket of Mme. Bonacieux the one he had just picked up. At that moment Mme. Bonacieux recovered her senses. She opened her eyes, looked around her with terror, saw that the apartment was empty and that she was alone with her liberator. She extended her hands to him with a smile. Mme. Bonacieux had the sweetest smile in the world. \u201cAh, monsieur!\u201d said she, \u201cyou have saved me; permit me to thank you.\u201d \u201cMadame,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cI have only done what every gentleman would have done in my place; you owe me no thanks.\u201d \u201cOh, yes, monsieur, oh, yes; and I hope to prove to you that you have not served an ingrate. But what could these men, whom I at first took for robbers, want with me, and why is Monsieur Bonacieux not here?\u201d \u201cMadame, those men were more dangerous than any robbers could have been, for they are the agents of the cardinal; and as to your husband, Monsieur Bonacieux, he is not here because he was yesterday evening conducted to the Bastille.\u201d \u201cMy husband in the Bastille!\u201d cried Mme."], "To what cause does de Treville attribute Madame Bonacieux\u2019s apparent disappearance?": [" Bonacieux. \u201cOh, my God! What has he done? Poor dear man, he is innocence itself!\u201d And something like a faint smile lighted the still-terrified features of the young woman. \u201cWhat has he done, madame?\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cI believe that his only crime is to have at the same time the good fortune and the misfortune to be your husband.\u201d \u201cBut, monsieur, you know then--\u201d \u201cI know that you have been abducted, madame.\u201d \u201cAnd by whom? Do you know him? Oh, if you know him, tell me!\u201d \u201cBy a man of from forty to forty-five years, with black hair, a dark complexion, and a scar on his left temple.\u201d \u201cThat is he, that is he; but his name?\u201d \u201cAh, his name? I do not know that.\u201d \u201cAnd did my husband know I had been carried off?\u201d \u201cHe was informed of it by a letter, written to him by the abductor himself.\u201d \u201cAnd does he suspect,\u201d said Mme. Bonacieux, with some embarrassment, \u201cthe cause of this event?\u201d \u201cHe attributed it, I believe, to a political cause.\u201d \u201cI doubted from the first; and now I think entirely as he does. Then my dear Monsieur Bonacieux has not suspected me a single instant?\u201d \u201cSo far from it, madame, he was too proud of your prudence, and above all, of your love.\u201d A second smile, almost imperceptible, stole over the rosy lips of the pretty young woman. \u201cBut,\u201d continued d\u2019Artagnan, \u201chow did you escape?\u201d \u201cI took advantage of a moment when they left me alone; and as I had known since morning the reason of my abduction, with the help of the sheets I let myself down from the window.", " Bonacieux. \u201cSilence!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, taking her hand, which, without thinking of it, she abandoned to him. \u201cNever mind,\u201d continued the man in the cloak; \u201cyou were a fool not to have pretended to accept the mission. You would then be in present possession of the letter. The state, which is now threatened, would be safe, and you--\u201d \u201cAnd I?\u201d \u201cWell you--the cardinal would have given you letters of nobility.\u201d \u201cDid he tell you so?\u201d \u201cYes, I know that he meant to afford you that agreeable surprise.\u201d \u201cBe satisfied,\u201d replied Bonacieux; \u201cmy wife adores me, and there is yet time.\u201d \u201cThe ninny!\u201d murmured Mme. Bonacieux. \u201cSilence!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, pressing her hand more closely. \u201cHow is there still time?\u201d asked the man in the cloak. \u201cI go to the Louvre; I ask for Mme. Bonacieux; I say that I have reflected; I renew the affair; I obtain the letter, and I run directly to the cardinal.\u201d \u201cWell, go quickly! I will return soon to learn the result of your trip.\u201d The stranger went out. \u201cInfamous!\u201d said Mme. Bonacieux, addressing this epithet to her husband. \u201cSilence!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, pressing her hand still more warmly. A terrible howling interrupted these reflections of d\u2019Artagnan and Mme. Bonacieux. It was her husband, who had discovered the disappearance of the moneybag, and was crying \u201cThieves!\u201d \u201cOh, my God!\u201d cried Mme. Bonacieux, \u201che will rouse the whole quarter.\u201d Bonacieux called a long time; but as such cries, on account of their frequency, brought nobody in the Rue des Fossoyeurs, and as lately the mercer\u2019s house had a bad name, finding that nobody came, he went out continuing to call, his voice being heard fainter and fainter as he went in the direction of the Rue du Bac.", " All the events we have described had taken place within a half hour. Everything fell out as Mme. Bonacieux prophesied. On hearing the password, Germain bowed. In a few minutes, Laporte was at the lodge; in two words d\u2019Artagnan informed him where Mme. Bonacieux was. Laporte assured himself, by having it twice repeated, of the accurate address, and set off at a run. Hardly, however, had he taken ten steps before he returned. \u201cYoung man,\u201d said he to d\u2019Artagnan, \u201ca suggestion.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cYou may get into trouble by what has taken place.\u201d \u201cYou believe so?\u201d \u201cYes. Have you any friend whose clock is too slow?\u201d \u201cWell?\u201d \u201cGo and call upon him, in order that he may give evidence of your having been with him at half past nine. In a court of justice that is called an alibi.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan found his advice prudent. He took to his heels, and was soon at M. de Treville\u2019s; but instead of going into the saloon with the rest of the crowd, he asked to be introduced to M. de Treville\u2019s office. As d\u2019Artagnan so constantly frequented the hotel, no difficulty was made in complying with his request, and a servant went to inform M. de Treville that his young compatriot, having something important to communicate, solicited a private audience. Five minutes after, M. de Treville was asking d\u2019Artagnan what he could do to serve him, and what caused his visit at so late an hour. \u201cPardon me, monsieur,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, who had profited by the moment he had been left alone to put back M. de Treville\u2019s clock three-quarters of an hour, \u201cbut I thought, as it was yet only twenty-five minutes past nine, it was not too late to wait upon you.\u201d \u201cTwenty-five minutes past nine!\u201d cried M. de Treville, looking at the clock; \u201cwhy, that\u2019s impossible!\u201d \u201cLook, rather, monsieur,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cthe clock shows it.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d said M. de Treville; \u201cI believed it later.", " \u201cIf we release the prisoner thus, we shall never know the truth.\u201d \u201cAthos may always be found,\u201d replied Treville, \u201cready to answer, when it shall please the gownsmen to interrogate him. He will not desert, Monsieur the Cardinal, be assured of that; I will answer for him.\u201d \u201cNo, he will not desert,\u201d said the king; \u201che can always be found, as Treville says. Besides,\u201d added he, lowering his voice and looking with a suppliant air at the cardinal, \u201clet us give them apparent security; that is policy.\u201d This policy of Louis XIII made Richelieu smile. \u201cOrder it as you please, sire; you possess the right of pardon.\u201d \u201cThe right of pardoning only applies to the guilty,\u201d said Treville, who was determined to have the last word, \u201cand my Musketeer is innocent. It is not mercy, then, that you are about to accord, sire, it is justice.\u201d \u201cAnd he is in the Fort l\u2019Eveque?\u201d said the king. \u201cYes, sire, in solitary confinement, in a dungeon, like the lowest criminal.\u201d \u201cThe devil!\u201d murmured the king; \u201cwhat must be done?\u201d \u201cSign an order for his release, and all will be said,\u201d replied the cardinal. \u201cI believe with your Majesty that Monsieur de Treville\u2019s guarantee is more than sufficient.\u201d Treville bowed very respectfully, with a joy that was not unmixed with fear; he would have preferred an obstinate resistance on the part of the cardinal to this sudden yielding. The king signed the order for release, and Treville carried it away without delay."], "Who is Porthos\u2019 mistress, according to the innkeeper?": [" I have something to say to you.\u201d \u201cCertainly, madame,\u201d said Porthos, winking to himself, as a gambler does who laughs at the dupe he is about to pluck. At that moment d\u2019Artagnan passed in pursuit of Milady; he cast a passing glance at Porthos, and beheld this triumphant look. \u201cEh, eh!\u201d said he, reasoning to himself according to the strangely easy morality of that gallant period, \u201cthere is one who will be equipped in good time!\u201d Porthos, yielding to the pressure of the arm of the procurator\u2019s wife, as a bark yields to the rudder, arrived at the cloister St. Magloire--a little-frequented passage, enclosed with a turnstile at each end. In the daytime nobody was seen there but mendicants devouring their crusts, and children at play. \u201cAh, Monsieur Porthos,\u201d cried the procurator\u2019s wife, when she was assured that no one who was a stranger to the population of the locality could either see or hear her, \u201cah, Monsieur Porthos, you are a great conqueror, as it appears!\u201d \u201cI, madame?\u201d said Porthos, drawing himself up proudly; \u201chow so?\u201d \u201cThe signs just now, and the holy water! But that must be a princess, at least--that lady with her Negro boy and her maid!\u201d \u201cMy God! Madame, you are deceived,\u201d said Porthos; \u201cshe is simply a duchess.\u201d \u201cAnd that running footman who waited at the door, and that carriage with a coachman in grand livery who sat waiting on his seat?\u201d Porthos had seen neither the footman nor the carriage, but with the eye of a jealous woman, Mme.", " How can I tell? Has he not all the tricks of a demon at his command? The least that can be expected is that you will be arrested.\u201d \u201cWhat! Will they dare to arrest a man in his Majesty\u2019s service?\u201d \u201cPARDIEU! They did not scruple much in the case of Athos. At all events, young man, rely upon one who has been thirty years at court. Do not lull yourself in security, or you will be lost; but, on the contrary--and it is I who say it--see enemies in all directions. If anyone seeks a quarrel with you, shun it, were it with a child of ten years old. If you are attacked by day or by night, fight, but retreat, without shame; if you cross a bridge, feel every plank of it with your foot, lest one should give way beneath you; if you pass before a house which is being built, look up, for fear a stone should fall upon your head; if you stay out late, be always followed by your lackey, and let your lackey be armed--if, by the by, you can be sure of your lackey. Mistrust everybody, your friend, your brother, your mistress--your mistress above all.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan blushed. \u201cMy mistress above all,\u201d repeated he, mechanically; \u201cand why her rather than another?\u201d \u201cBecause a mistress is one of the cardinal\u2019s favorite means; he has not one that is more expeditious. A woman will sell you for ten pistoles, witness Delilah. You are acquainted with the Scriptures?\u201d D\u2019Artagnan thought of the appointment Mme. Bonacieux had made with him for that very evening; but we are bound to say, to the credit of our hero, that the bad opinion entertained by M. de Treville of women in general, did not inspire him with the least suspicion of his pretty hostess.", " Athos and d\u2019Artagnan watched their approach from the window. \u201cThe devil!\u201d cried Aramis, \u201cyou have a magnificent horse there, Porthos.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d replied Porthos, \u201cit is the one that ought to have been sent to me at first. A bad joke of the husband\u2019s substituted the other; but the husband has been punished since, and I have obtained full satisfaction.\u201d Planchet and Grimaud appeared in their turn, leading their masters\u2019 steeds. D\u2019Artagnan and Athos put themselves into saddle with their companions, and all four set forward; Athos upon a horse he owed to a woman, Aramis on a horse he owed to his mistress, Porthos on a horse he owed to his procurator\u2019s wife, and d\u2019Artagnan on a horse he owed to his good fortune--the best mistress possible. The lackeys followed. As Porthos had foreseen, the cavalcade produced a good effect; and if Mme. Coquenard had met Porthos and seen what a superb appearance he made upon his handsome Spanish genet, she would not have regretted the bleeding she had inflicted upon the strongbox of her husband. Near the Louvre the four friends met with M. de Treville, who was returning from St. Germain; he stopped them to offer his compliments upon their appointments, which in an instant drew round them a hundred gapers. D\u2019Artagnan profited by the circumstance to speak to M. de Treville of the letter with the great red seal and the cardinal\u2019s arms. It is well understood that he did not breathe a word about the other.", " Milady will then turn you out of doors, and you know she is not the woman to limit her vengeance.\u201d \u201cAlas!\u201d said Kitty, \u201cfor whom have I exposed myself to all that?\u201d \u201cFor me, I well know, my sweet girl,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cBut I am grateful, I swear to you.\u201d \u201cBut what does this note contain?\u201d \u201cMilady will tell you.\u201d \u201cAh, you do not love me!\u201d cried Kitty, \u201cand I am very wretched.\u201d To this reproach there is always one response which deludes women. D\u2019Artagnan replied in such a manner that Kitty remained in her great delusion. Although she cried freely before deciding to transmit the letter to her mistress, she did at last so decide, which was all d\u2019Artagnan wished. Finally he promised that he would leave her mistress\u2019s presence at an early hour that evening, and that when he left the mistress he would ascend with the maid. This promise completed poor Kitty\u2019s consolation. 34 IN WHICH THE EQUIPMENT OF ARAMIS AND PORTHOS IS TREATED OF Since the four friends had been each in search of his equipments, there had been no fixed meeting between them. They dined apart from one another, wherever they might happen to be, or rather where they could. Duty likewise on its part took a portion of that precious time which was gliding away so rapidly--only they had agreed to meet once a week, about one o\u2019clock, at the residence of Athos, seeing that he, in agreement with the vow he had formed, did not pass over the threshold of his door."], "Believing that his mistress has abandoned him, what is Aramis about to do when D'Artagnan delivers his letter?": [" My vocation commands me; it carries me away.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan smiled, but made no answer. Aramis continued, \u201cAnd yet, while I do belong to the earth, I wish to speak of you--of our friends.\u201d \u201cAnd on my part,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cI wished to speak of you, but I find you so completely detached from everything! To love you cry, \u2018Fie! Friends are shadows! The world is a sepulcher!\u2019\u201d \u201cAlas, you will find it so yourself,\u201d said Aramis, with a sigh. \u201cWell, then, let us say no more about it,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cand let us burn this letter, which, no doubt, announces to you some fresh infidelity of your GRISETTE or your chambermaid.\u201d \u201cWhat letter?\u201d cried Aramis, eagerly. \u201cA letter which was sent to your abode in your absence, and which was given to me for you.\u201d \u201cBut from whom is that letter?\u201d \u201cOh, from some heartbroken waiting woman, some desponding GRISETTE; from Madame de Chevreuse\u2019s chambermaid, perhaps, who was obliged to return to Tours with her mistress, and who, in order to appear smart and attractive, stole some perfumed paper, and sealed her letter with a duchess\u2019s coronet.\u201d \u201cWhat do you say?\u201d \u201cHold! I must have lost it,\u201d said the young man maliciously, pretending to search for it. \u201cBut fortunately the world is a sepulcher; the men, and consequently the women, are but shadows, and love is a sentiment to which you cry, \u2018Fie! Fie!\u2019\u201d \u201cd\u2019Artagnan, d\u2019Artagnan,\u201d cried Aramis, \u201cyou are killing me!\u201d \u201cWell, here it is at last!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, as he drew the letter from his pocket.", " Kitty guessed what was passing in the mind of the young man, and heaved a deep sigh. \u201cYou love my mistress, then, very dearly, Monsieur Chevalier?\u201d said she. \u201cOh, more than I can say, Kitty! I am mad for her!\u201d Kitty breathed a second sigh. \u201cAlas, monsieur,\u201d said she, \u201cthat is too bad.\u201d \u201cWhat the devil do you see so bad in it?\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cBecause, monsieur,\u201d replied Kitty, \u201cmy mistress loves you not at all.\u201d \u201cHEIN!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201ccan she have charged you to tell me so?\u201d \u201cOh, no, monsieur; but out of the regard I have for you, I have taken the resolution to tell you so.\u201d \u201cMuch obliged, my dear Kitty; but for the intention only--for the information, you must agree, is not likely to be at all agreeable.\u201d \u201cThat is to say, you don\u2019t believe what I have told you; is it not so?\u201d \u201cWe have always some difficulty in believing such things, my pretty dear, were it only from self-love.\u201d \u201cThen you don\u2019t believe me?\u201d \u201cI confess that unless you deign to give me some proof of what you advance--\u201d \u201cWhat do you think of this?\u201d Kitty drew a little note from her bosom. \u201cFor me?\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, seizing the letter. \u201cNo; for another.\u201d \u201cFor another?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cHis name; his name!\u201d cried d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cRead the address.\u201d \u201cMonsieur El Comte de Wardes.\u201d The remembrance of the scene at St. Germain presented itself to the mind of the presumptuous Gascon. As quick as thought, he tore open the letter, in spite of the cry which Kitty uttered on seeing what he was going to do, or rather, what he was doing.", " Indeed, this man is very much to blame for talking thus to other men; one would say he had never had to do with any but women and children.\u201d \u201cMy dear Athos, I admire you, but nevertheless we were in the wrong, after all.\u201d \u201cHow, in the wrong?\u201d said Athos. \u201cWhose, then, is the air we breathe? Whose is the ocean upon which we look? Whose is the sand upon which we were reclining? Whose is that letter of your mistress? Do these belong to the cardinal? Upon my honor, this man fancies the world belongs to him. There you stood, stammering, stupefied, annihilated. One might have supposed the Bastille appeared before you, and that the gigantic Medusa had converted you into stone. Is being in love conspiring? You are in love with a woman whom the cardinal has caused to be shut up, and you wish to get her out of the hands of the cardinal. That\u2019s a match you are playing with his Eminence; this letter is your game. Why should you expose your game to your adversary? That is never done. Let him find it out if he can! We can find out his!\u201d \u201cWell, that\u2019s all very sensible, Athos,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cIn that case, let there be no more question of what\u2019s past, and let Aramis resume the letter from his cousin where the cardinal interrupted him.\u201d Aramis drew the letter from his pocket; the three friends surrounded him, and the three lackeys grouped themselves again near the wine jar. \u201cYou had only read a line or two,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cread the letter again from the commencement.\u201d \u201cWillingly,\u201d said Aramis.", " Aramis then reperused the letter, and perceived a postscript: PS. You may behave politely to the bearer, who is a count and a grandee of Spain! \u201cGolden dreams!\u201d cried Aramis. \u201cOh, beautiful life! Yes, we are young; yes, we shall yet have happy days! My love, my blood, my life! all, all, all, are thine, my adored mistress!\u201d And he kissed the letter with passion, without even vouchsafing a look at the gold which sparkled on the table. Bazin scratched at the door, and as Aramis had no longer any reason to exclude him, he bade him come in. Bazin was stupefied at the sight of the gold, and forgot that he came to announce d\u2019Artagnan, who, curious to know who the mendicant could be, came to Aramis on leaving Athos. Now, as d\u2019Artagnan used no ceremony with Aramis, seeing that Bazin forgot to announce him, he announced himself. \u201cThe devil! my dear Aramis,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cif these are the prunes that are sent to you from Tours, I beg you will make my compliments to the gardener who gathers them.\u201d \u201cYou are mistaken, friend d\u2019Artagnan,\u201d said Aramis, always on his guard; \u201cthis is from my publisher, who has just sent me the price of that poem in one-syllable verse which I began yonder.\u201d \u201cAh, indeed,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cWell, your publisher is very generous, my dear Aramis, that\u2019s all I can say.\u201d \u201cHow, monsieur?\u201d cried Bazin, \u201ca poem sell so dear as that! It is incredible! Oh, monsieur, you can write as much as you like; you may become equal to Monsieur de Voiture and Monsieur de Benserade."], "How do Athos and Grimaud attempt to punish the innkeeper who aided an attack against them?": [" Athos recognized Grimaud. \u201cWhat\u2019s the manner?\u201d cried Athos. \u201cHas she left Armentieres?\u201d Grimaud made a sign in the affirmative. D\u2019Artagnan ground his teeth. \u201cSilence, d\u2019Artagnan!\u201d said Athos. \u201cI have charged myself with this affair. It is for me, then, to interrogate Grimaud.\u201d \u201cWhere is she?\u201d asked Athos. Grimaud extended his hands in the direction of the Lys. \u201cFar from here?\u201d asked Athos. Grimaud showed his master his forefinger bent. \u201cAlone?\u201d asked Athos. Grimaud made the sign yes. \u201cGentlemen,\u201d said Athos, \u201cshe is alone within half a league of us, in the direction of the river.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s well,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cLead us, Grimaud.\u201d Grimaud took his course across the country, and acted as guide to the cavalcade. At the end of five hundred paces, more or less, they came to a rivulet, which they forded. By the aid of the lightning they perceived the village of Erquinheim. \u201cIs she there, Grimaud?\u201d asked Athos. Grimaud shook his head negatively. \u201cSilence, then!\u201d cried Athos. And the troop continued their route. Another flash illuminated all around them. Grimaud extended his arm, and by the bluish splendor of the fiery serpent they distinguished a little isolated house on the banks of the river, within a hundred paces of a ferry. One window was lighted. \u201cHere we are!\u201d said Athos. At this moment a man who had been crouching in a ditch jumped up and came towards them. It was Mousqueton.", " D\u2019Artagnan alone did not seem convinced. Grimaud no doubt shared the misgivings of the young man, for seeing that they continued to advance toward the bastion--something he had till then doubted--he pulled his master by the skirt of his coat. \u201cWhere are we going?\u201d asked he, by a gesture. Athos pointed to the bastion. \u201cBut,\u201d said Grimaud, in the same silent dialect, \u201cwe shall leave our skins there.\u201d Athos raised his eyes and his finger toward heaven. Grimaud put his basket on the ground and sat down with a shake of the head. Athos took a pistol from his belt, looked to see if it was properly primed, cocked it, and placed the muzzle close to Grimaud\u2019s ear. Grimaud was on his legs again as if by a spring. Athos then made him a sign to take up his basket and to walk on first. Grimaud obeyed. All that Grimaud gained by this momentary pantomime was to pass from the rear guard to the vanguard. Arrived at the bastion, the four friends turned round. More than three hundred soldiers of all kinds were assembled at the gate of the camp; and in a separate group might be distinguished M. de Busigny, the dragoon, the Swiss, and the fourth bettor. Athos took off his hat, placed it on the end of his sword, and waved it in the air. All the spectators returned him his salute, accompanying this courtesy with a loud hurrah which was audible to the four; after which all four disappeared in the bastion, whither Grimaud had preceded them.", " 47 THE COUNCIL OF THE MUSKETEERS As Athos had foreseen, the bastion was only occupied by a dozen corpses, French and Rochellais. \u201cGentlemen,\u201d said Athos, who had assumed the command of the expedition, \u201cwhile Grimaud spreads the table, let us begin by collecting the guns and cartridges together. We can talk while performing that necessary task. These gentlemen,\u201d added he, pointing to the bodies, \u201ccannot hear us.\u201d \u201cBut we could throw them into the ditch,\u201d said Porthos, \u201cafter having assured ourselves they have nothing in their pockets.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Athos, \u201cthat\u2019s Grimaud\u2019s business.\u201d \u201cWell, then,\u201d cried d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cpray let Grimaud search them and throw them over the walls.\u201d \u201cHeaven forfend!\u201d said Athos; \u201cthey may serve us.\u201d \u201cThese bodies serve us?\u201d said Porthos. \u201cYou are mad, dear friend.\u201d \u201cJudge not rashly, say the gospel and the cardinal,\u201d replied Athos. \u201cHow many guns, gentlemen?\u201d \u201cTwelve,\u201d replied Aramis. \u201cHow many shots?\u201d \u201cA hundred.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s quite as many as we shall want. Let us load the guns.\u201d The four Musketeers went to work; and as they were loading the last musket Grimaud announced that the breakfast was ready. Athos replied, always by gestures, that that was well, and indicated to Grimaud, by pointing to a turret that resembled a pepper caster, that he was to stand as sentinel. Only, to alleviate the tediousness of the duty, Athos allowed him to take a loaf, two cutlets, and a bottle of wine.", " The moment she lost sight of him, Milady tumbled fainting into her chamber. 38 HOW, WITHOUT INCOMMDING HIMSELF, ATHOS PROCURES HIS EQUIPMENT D\u2019Artagnan was so completely bewildered that without taking any heed of what might become of Kitty he ran at full speed across half Paris, and did not stop till he came to Athos\u2019s door. The confusion of his mind, the terror which spurred him on, the cries of some of the patrol who started in pursuit of him, and the hooting of the people who, notwithstanding the early hour, were going to their work, only made him precipitate his course. He crossed the court, ran up the two flights to Athos\u2019s apartment, and knocked at the door enough to break it down. Grimaud came, rubbing his half-open eyes, to answer this noisy summons, and d\u2019Artagnan sprang with such violence into the room as nearly to overturn the astonished lackey. In spite of his habitual silence, the poor lad this time found his speech. \u201cHolloa, there!\u201d cried he; \u201cwhat do you want, you strumpet? What\u2019s your business here, you hussy?\u201d D\u2019Artagnan threw off his hood, and disengaged his hands from the folds of the cloak. At sight of the mustaches and the naked sword, the poor devil perceived he had to deal with a man. He then concluded it must be an assassin. \u201cHelp! murder! help!\u201d cried he. \u201cHold your tongue, you stupid fellow!\u201d said the young man; \u201cI am d\u2019Artagnan; don\u2019t you know me? Where is your master?\u201d \u201cYou, Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan!\u201d cried Grimaud, \u201cimpossible.\u201d \u201cGrimaud,\u201d said Athos, coming out of his apartment in a dressing gown, \u201cGrimaud, I thought I heard you permitting yourself to speak?\u201d \u201cAh, monsieur, it is--\u201d \u201cSilence!\u201d Grimaud contented himself with pointing d\u2019Artagnan out to his master with his finger."], "What does Athos drunkenly confess that he did when he discovered a Fleur-de-Lis on his wife\u2019s shoulder?": [" \u201cRepudiated by her husband,\u201d said Athos. \u201cBecause she had been branded,\u201d continued d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cBah!\u201d cried Porthos. \u201cImpossible! What do you say--that she wanted to have her brother-in-law killed?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cShe was married?\u201d asked Aramis. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cAnd her husband found out that she had a fleur-de-lis on her shoulder?\u201d cried Porthos. \u201cYes.\u201d These three yeses had been pronounced by Athos, each with a sadder intonation. \u201cAnd who has seen this fleur-de-lis?\u201d inquired Aramis. \u201cd\u2019Artagnan and I. Or rather, to observe the chronological order, I and d\u2019Artagnan,\u201d replied Athos. \u201cAnd does the husband of this frightful creature still live?\u201d said Aramis. \u201cHe still lives.\u201d \u201cAre you quite sure of it?\u201d \u201cI am he.\u201d There was a moment of cold silence, during which everyone was affected according to his nature. \u201cThis time,\u201d said Athos, first breaking the silence, \u201cd\u2019Artagnan has given us an excellent program, and the letter must be written at once.\u201d \u201cThe devil! You are right, Athos,\u201d said Aramis; \u201cand it is a rather difficult matter. The chancellor himself would be puzzled how to write such a letter, and yet the chancellor draws up an official report very readily. Never mind! Be silent, I will write.\u201d Aramis accordingly took the quill, reflected for a few moments, wrote eight or ten lines in a charming little female hand, and then with a voice soft and slow, as if each word had been scrupulously weighed, he read the following: \u201cMy Lord, The person who writes these few lines had the honor of crossing swords with you in the little enclosure of the Rue d\u2019Enfer.", " \u201cIn the first place,\u201d said Athos, \u201clet us leave this chamber; the dead are not agreeable company, particularly when they have died a violent death.\u201d \u201cPlanchet,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cI commit the corpse of this poor devil to your care. Let him be interred in holy ground. He committed a crime, it is true; but he repented of it.\u201d And the four friends quit the room, leaving to Planchet and Fourreau the duty of paying mortuary honors to Brisemont. The host gave them another chamber, and served them with fresh eggs and some water, which Athos went himself to draw at the fountain. In a few words, Porthos and Aramis were posted as to the situation. \u201cWell,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan to Athos, \u201cyou see, my dear friend, that this is war to the death.\u201d Athos shook his head. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d replied he, \u201cI perceive that plainly; but do you really believe it is she?\u201d \u201cI am sure of it.\u201d \u201cNevertheless, I confess I still doubt.\u201d \u201cBut the fleur-de-lis on her shoulder?\u201d \u201cShe is some Englishwoman who has committed a crime in France, and has been branded in consequence.\u201d \u201cAthos, she is your wife, I tell you,\u201d repeated d\u2019Artagnan; \u201conly reflect how much the two descriptions resemble each other.\u201d \u201cYes; but I should think the other must be dead, I hanged her so effectually.\u201d It was d\u2019Artagnan who now shook his head in his turn. \u201cBut in either case, what is to be done?\u201d said the young man. \u201cThe fact is, one cannot remain thus, with a sword hanging eternally over his head,\u201d said Athos.", " The ass! The idiot!\u201d \u201cHow so, if he love her?\u201d asked d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cWait,\u201d said Athos. \u201cHe took her to his chateau, and made her the first lady in the province; and in justice it must be allowed that she supported her rank becomingly.\u201d \u201cWell?\u201d asked d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cWell, one day when she was hunting with her husband,\u201d continued Athos, in a low voice, and speaking very quickly, \u201cshe fell from her horse and fainted. The count flew to her to help, and as she appeared to be oppressed by her clothes, he ripped them open with his poniard, and in so doing laid bare her shoulder. D\u2019Artagnan,\u201d said Athos, with a maniacal burst of laughter, \u201cguess what she had on her shoulder.\u201d \u201cHow can I tell?\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cA FLEUR-DE-LIS,\u201d said Athos. \u201cShe was branded.\u201d Athos emptied at a single draught the glass he held in his hand. \u201cHorror!\u201d cried d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cWhat do you tell me?\u201d \u201cTruth, my friend. The angel was a demon; the poor young girl had stolen the sacred vessels from a church.\u201d \u201cAnd what did the count do?\u201d \u201cThe count was of the highest nobility. He had on his estates the rights of high and low tribunals. He tore the dress of the countess to pieces; he tied her hands behind her, and hanged her on a tree.\u201d \u201cHeavens, Athos, a murder?\u201d cried d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cNo less,\u201d said Athos, as pale as a corpse. \u201cBut methinks I need wine!\u201d and he seized by the neck the last bottle that was left, put it to his mouth, and emptied it at a single draught, as he would have emptied an ordinary glass.", " My sister, how did your husband die?\u201d \u201cHorror!\u201d cried Porthos and Aramis. \u201cAssassin of Buckingham, assassin of Felton, assassin of my brother, I demand justice upon you, and I swear that if it be not granted to me, I will execute it myself.\u201d And Lord de Winter ranged himself by the side of d\u2019Artagnan, leaving the place free for another accuser. Milady let her head sink between her two hands, and tried to recall her ideas, whirling in a mortal vertigo. \u201cMy turn,\u201d said Athos, himself trembling as the lion trembles at the sight of the serpent--\u201cmy turn. I married that woman when she was a young girl; I married her in opposition to the wishes of all my family; I gave her my wealth, I gave her my name; and one day I discovered that this woman was branded--this woman was marked with a FLEUR-DE-LIS on her left shoulder.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said Milady, raising herself, \u201cI defy you to find any tribunal which pronounced that infamous sentence against me. I defy you to find him who executed it.\u201d \u201cSilence!\u201d said a hollow voice. \u201cIt is for me to reply to that!\u201d And the man in the red cloak came forward in his turn. \u201cWhat man is that? What man is that?\u201d cried Milady, suffocated by terror, her hair loosening itself, and rising above her livid countenance as if alive. All eyes were turned towards this man--for to all except Athos he was unknown. Even Athos looked at him with as much stupefaction as the others, for he knew not how he could in any way find himself mixed up with the horrible drama then unfolded."], "Why does de Treville\u2019s letter about the campaign against Britain cause the four friends consternation?": [" M de la Tremouille approached him, and made him inhale some salts, which recalled him to life. Then M. de Treville, unwilling that it should be thought that he had influenced the wounded man, requested M. de la Tremouille to interrogate him himself. That happened which M. de Treville had foreseen. Placed between life and death, as Bernajoux was, he had no idea for a moment of concealing the truth; and he described to the two nobles the affair exactly as it had passed. This was all that M. de Treville wanted. He wished Bernajoux a speedy convalescence, took leave of M. de la Tremouille, returned to his hotel, and immediately sent word to the four friends that he awaited their company at dinner. M de Treville entertained good company, wholly anticardinalist, though. It may easily be understood, therefore, that the conversation during the whole of dinner turned upon the two checks that his Eminence\u2019s Guardsmen had received. Now, as d\u2019Artagnan had been the hero of these two fights, it was upon him that all the felicitations fell, which Athos, Porthos, and Aramis abandoned to him, not only as good comrades, but as men who had so often had their turn that they could very well afford him his. Toward six o\u2019clock M. de Treville announced that it was time to go to the Louvre; but as the hour of audience granted by his Majesty was past, instead of claiming the ENTREE by the back stairs, he placed himself with the four young men in the antechamber.", " \u201cAnd the Guardsman?\u201d \u201cd\u2019Artagnan.\u201d \u201cStill my young scapegrace. Positively, these four men must be on my side.\u201d The same evening the cardinal spoke to M. de Treville of the exploit of the morning, which was the talk of the whole camp. M. de Treville, who had received the account of the adventure from the mouths of the heroes of it, related it in all its details to his Eminence, not forgetting the episode of the napkin. \u201cThat\u2019s well, Monsieur de Treville,\u201d said the cardinal; \u201cpray let that napkin be sent to me. I will have three fleur-de-lis embroidered on it in gold, and will give it to your company as a standard.\u201d \u201cMonseigneur,\u201d said M. de Treville, \u201cthat will be unjust to the Guardsmen. Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan is not with me; he serves under Monsieur Dessessart.\u201d \u201cWell, then, take him,\u201d said the cardinal; \u201cwhen four men are so much attached to one another, it is only fair that they should serve in the same company.\u201d That same evening M. de Treville announced this good news to the three Musketeers and d\u2019Artagnan, inviting all four to breakfast with him next morning. D\u2019Artagnan was beside himself with joy. We know that the dream of his life had been to become a Musketeer. The three friends were likewise greatly delighted. \u201cMy faith,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan to Athos, \u201cyou had a triumphant idea! As you said, we have acquired glory, and were enabled to carry on a conversation of the highest importance.\u201d \u201cWhich we can resume now without anybody suspecting us, for, with the help of God, we shall henceforth pass for cardinalists.\u201d That evening d\u2019Artagnan went to present his respects to M. Dessessart, and inform him of his promotion.", " Bravery is always respected, even in an enemy. The Musketeers saluted Bicarat with their swords, and returned them to their sheaths. D\u2019Artagnan did the same. Then, assisted by Bicarat, the only one left standing, they bore Jussac, Cahusac, and one of Aramis\u2019s adversaries who was only wounded, under the porch of the convent. The fourth, as we have said, was dead. They then rang the bell, and carrying away four swords out of five, they took their road, intoxicated with joy, toward the hotel of M. de Treville. They walked arm in arm, occupying the whole width of the street and taking in every Musketeer they met, so that in the end it became a triumphal march. The heart of d\u2019Artagnan swam in delirium; he marched between Athos and Porthos, pressing them tenderly. \u201cIf I am not yet a Musketeer,\u201d said he to his new friends, as he passed through the gateway of M. de Treville\u2019s hotel, \u201cat least I have entered upon my apprenticeship, haven\u2019t I?\u201d 6 HIS MAJESTY KING LOUIS XIII This affair made a great noise. M. de Treville scolded his Musketeers in public, and congratulated them in private; but as no time was to be lost in gaining the king, M. de Treville hastened to report himself at the Louvre. It was already too late. The king was closeted with the cardinal, and M. de Treville was informed that the king was busy and could not receive him at that moment. In the evening M. de Treville attended the king\u2019s gaming table.", " On arriving in Paris, d\u2019Artagnan found a letter from M. de Treville, which informed him that, at his request, the king had promised that he should enter the company of the Musketeers. As this was the height of d\u2019Artagnan\u2019s worldly ambition--apart, be it well understood, from his desire of finding Mme. Bonacieux--he ran, full of joy, to seek his comrades, whom he had left only half an hour before, but whom he found very sad and deeply preoccupied. They were assembled in council at the residence of Athos, which always indicated an event of some gravity. M. de Treville had intimated to them his Majesty\u2019s fixed intention to open the campaign on the first of May, and they must immediately prepare their outfits. The four philosophers looked at one another in a state of bewilderment. M. de Treville never jested in matters relating to discipline. \u201cAnd what do you reckon your outfit will cost?\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cOh, we can scarcely say. We have made our calculations with Spartan economy, and we each require fifteen hundred livres.\u201d \u201cFour times fifteen makes sixty--six thousand livres,\u201d said Athos. \u201cIt seems to me,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cwith a thousand livres each--I do not speak as a Spartan, but as a procurator--\u201d This word PROCURATOR roused Porthos. \u201cStop,\u201d said he, \u201cI have an idea.\u201d \u201cWell, that\u2019s something, for I have not the shadow of one,\u201d said Athos coolly; \u201cbut as to d\u2019Artagnan, gentlemen, the idea of belonging to OURS has driven him out of his senses."], "On whose behalf does D'Artagnan intercede in an argument with Lord de Winter?": [" My affianced husband returned. \u201c\u2018Hear me,\u2019 said he; \u2018this man has gone, and for the moment has consequently escaped my vengeance; but let us be united, as we were to have been, and then leave it to Lord de Winter to maintain his own honor and that of his wife.\u2019\u201d \u201cLord de Winter!\u201d cried Felton. \u201cYes,\u201d said Milady, \u201cLord de Winter; and now you can understand it all, can you not? Buckingham remained nearly a year absent. A week before his return Lord de Winter died, leaving me his sole heir. Whence came the blow? God who knows all, knows without doubt; but as for me, I accuse nobody.\u201d \u201cOh, what an abyss; what an abyss!\u201d cried Felton. \u201cLord de Winter died without revealing anything to his brother. The terrible secret was to be concealed till it burst, like a clap of thunder, over the head of the guilty. Your protector had seen with pain this marriage of his elder brother with a portionless girl. I was sensible that I could look for no support from a man disappointed in his hopes of an inheritance. I went to France, with a determination to remain there for the rest of my life. But all my fortune is in England. Communication being closed by the war, I was in want of everything. I was then obliged to come back again. Six days ago, I landed at Portsmouth.\u201d \u201cWell?\u201d said Felton. \u201cWell; Buckingham heard by some means, no doubt, of my return. He spoke of me to Lord de Winter, already prejudiced against me, and told him that his sister-in-law was a prostitute, a branded woman.", " \u201cGentlemen,\u201d continued the stranger, \u201csince you do not recognize a man who probably owes his life to you twice, I must name myself. I am Lord de Winter, brother-in-law of THAT WOMAN.\u201d The three friends uttered a cry of surprise. Athos rose, and offering him his hand, \u201cBe welcome, my Lord,\u201d said he, \u201cyou are one of us.\u201d \u201cI set out five hours after her from Portsmouth,\u201d said Lord de Winter. \u201cI arrived three hours after her at Boulogne. I missed her by twenty minutes at St. Omer. Finally, at Lilliers I lost all trace of her. I was going about at random, inquiring of everybody, when I saw you gallop past. I recognized Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan. I called to you, but you did not answer me; I wished to follow you, but my horse was too much fatigued to go at the same pace with yours. And yet it appears, in spite of all your diligence, you have arrived too late.\u201d \u201cYou see!\u201d said Athos, pointing to Mme. Bonacieux dead, and to d\u2019Artagnan, whom Porthos and Aramis were trying to recall to life. \u201cAre they both dead?\u201d asked Lord de Winter, sternly. \u201cNo,\u201d replied Athos, \u201cfortunately Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan has only fainted.\u201d \u201cAh, indeed, so much the better!\u201d said Lord de Winter. At that moment d\u2019Artagnan opened his eyes. He tore himself from the arms of Porthos and Aramis, and threw himself like a madman on the corpse of his mistress. Athos rose, walked toward his friend with a slow and solemn step, embraced him tenderly, and as he burst into violent sobs, he said to him with his noble and persuasive voice, \u201cFriend, be a man!", " Those lips were magnificent; they might be said to be of coral. The conversation took a cheerful turn. Milady appeared to have entirely recovered. She told d\u2019Artagnan that Lord de Winter was her brother-in-law, and not her brother. She had married a younger brother of the family, who had left her a widow with one child. This child was the only heir to Lord de Winter, if Lord de Winter did not marry. All this showed d\u2019Artagnan that there was a veil which concealed something; but he could not yet see under this veil. In addition to this, after a half hour\u2019s conversation d\u2019Artagnan was convinced that Milady was his compatriot; she spoke French with an elegance and a purity that left no doubt on that head. D\u2019Artagnan was profuse in gallant speeches and protestations of devotion. To all the simple things which escaped our Gascon, Milady replied with a smile of kindness. The hour came for him to retire. D\u2019Artagnan took leave of Milady, and left the saloon the happiest of men. On the staircase he met the pretty SOUBRETTE, who brushed gently against him as she passed, and then, blushing to the eyes, asked his pardon for having touched him in a voice so sweet that the pardon was granted instantly. D\u2019Artagnan came again on the morrow, and was still better received than on the evening before. Lord de Winter was not at home; and it was Milady who this time did all the honors of the evening.", " He paused, exchanged two words with the sentinel; then the door opened, and he appeared. During the exchange of these two words Felton drew back quickly, and when Lord de Winter entered, he was several paces from the prisoner. The baron entered slowly, sending a scrutinizing glance from Milady to the young officer. \u201cYou have been here a very long time, John,\u201d said he. \u201cHas this woman been relating her crimes to you? In that case I can comprehend the length of the conversation.\u201d Felton started; and Milady felt she was lost if she did not come to the assistance of the disconcerted Puritan. \u201cAh, you fear your prisoner should escape!\u201d said she. \u201cWell, ask your worthy jailer what favor I this instant solicited of him.\u201d \u201cYou demanded a favor?\u201d said the baron, suspiciously. \u201cYes, my Lord,\u201d replied the young man, confused. \u201cAnd what favor, pray?\u201d asked Lord de Winter. \u201cA knife, which she would return to me through the grating of the door a minute after she had received it,\u201d replied Felton. \u201cThere is someone, then, concealed here whose throat this amiable lady is desirous of cutting,\u201d said de Winter, in an ironical, contemptuous tone. \u201cThere is myself,\u201d replied Milady. \u201cI have given you the choice between America and Tyburn,\u201d replied Lord de Winter. \u201cChoose Tyburn, madame. Believe me, the cord is more certain than the knife.\u201d Felton grew pale, and made a step forward, remembering that at the moment he entered Milady had a rope in her hand."], "What reason does D'Artagnan give for sparing Lord de Winter\u2019s life in their duel?": [" My affianced husband returned. \u201c\u2018Hear me,\u2019 said he; \u2018this man has gone, and for the moment has consequently escaped my vengeance; but let us be united, as we were to have been, and then leave it to Lord de Winter to maintain his own honor and that of his wife.\u2019\u201d \u201cLord de Winter!\u201d cried Felton. \u201cYes,\u201d said Milady, \u201cLord de Winter; and now you can understand it all, can you not?

Athos rose, walked toward his friend with a slow and solemn step, embraced him tenderly, and as he burst into violent sobs, he said to him with his noble and persuasive voice, \u201cFriend, be a man!", " \u201cOh, yes,\u201d said she, smiling, \u201cbut we won\u2019t tell him!\u201d In the evening Lord de Winter accompanied the supper. \u201cSir,\u201d said Milady, \u201cis your presence an indispensable accessory of my captivity? Could you not spare me the increase of torture which your visits cause me?\u201d \u201cHow, dear sister!\u201d said Lord de Winter. \u201cDid not you sentimentally inform me with that pretty mouth of yours, so cruel to me today, that you came to England solely for the pleasure of seeing me at your ease, an enjoyment of which you told me you so sensibly felt the deprivation that you had risked everything for it--seasickness, tempest, captivity? Well, here I am; be satisfied. Besides, this time, my visit has a motive.\u201d Milady trembled; she thought Felton had told all. Perhaps never in her life had this woman, who had experienced so many opposite and powerful emotions, felt her heart beat so violently. She was seated. Lord de Winter took a chair, drew it toward her, and sat down close beside her. Then taking a paper out of his pocket, he unfolded it slowly. \u201cHere,\u201d said he, \u201cI want to show you the kind of passport which I have drawn up, and which will serve you henceforward as the rule of order in the life I consent to leave you.\u201d Then turning his eyes from Milady to the paper, he read: \u201c\u2018Order to conduct--\u2019 The name is blank,\u201d interrupted Lord de Winter. \u201cIf you have any preference you can point it out to me; and if it be not within a thousand leagues of London, attention will be paid to your wishes.", " \u201cYou can restore it to his family,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cHis family will care much about such a trifle as that! His family will inherit fifteen thousand louis a year from him. Keep the purse for your lackeys.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan put the purse into his pocket. \u201cAnd now, my young friend, for you will permit me, I hope, to give you that name,\u201d said Lord de Winter, \u201con this very evening, if agreeable to you, I will present you to my sister, Milady Clarik, for I am desirous that she should take you into her good graces; and as she is not in bad odor at court, she may perhaps on some future day speak a word that will not prove useless to you.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan blushed with pleasure, and bowed a sign of assent. At this time Athos came up to d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cWhat do you mean to do with that purse?\u201d whispered he. \u201cWhy, I meant to pass it over to you, my dear Athos.\u201d \u201cMe! why to me?\u201d \u201cWhy, you killed him! They are the spoils of victory.\u201d \u201cI, the heir of an enemy!\u201d said Athos; \u201cfor whom, then, do you take me?\u201d \u201cIt is the custom in war,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cwhy should it not be the custom in a duel?\u201d \u201cEven on the field of battle, I have never done that.\u201d Porthos shrugged his shoulders; Aramis by a movement of his lips endorsed Athos. \u201cThen,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201clet us give the money to the lackeys, as Lord de Winter desired us to do.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Athos; \u201clet us give the money to the lackeys--not to our lackeys, but to the lackeys of the Englishmen.\u201d Athos took the purse, and threw it into the hand of the coachman."], "What does Lady de Winter do when she believes nobody is watching?": [" The eyes of Porthos were furtively cast upon this lady, and then roved about at large over the nave. On her side the lady, who from time to time blushed, darted with the rapidity of lightning a glance toward the inconstant Porthos; and then immediately the eyes of Porthos wandered anxiously. It was plain that this mode of proceeding piqued the lady in the black hood, for she bit her lips till they bled, scratched the end of her nose, and could not sit still in her seat. Porthos, seeing this, retwisted his mustache, elongated his imperial a second time, and began to make signals to a beautiful lady who was near the choir, and who not only was a beautiful lady, but still further, no doubt, a great lady--for she had behind her a Negro boy who had brought the cushion on which she knelt, and a female servant who held the emblazoned bag in which was placed the book from which she read the Mass. The lady with the black hood followed through all their wanderings the looks of Porthos, and perceived that they rested upon the lady with the velvet cushion, the little Negro, and the maid-servant. During this time Porthos played close. It was almost imperceptible motions of his eyes, fingers placed upon the lips, little assassinating smiles, which really did assassinate the disdained beauty. Then she cried, \u201cAhem!\u201d under cover of the MEA CULPA, striking her breast so vigorously that everybody, even the lady with the red cushion, turned round toward her.", " My affianced husband returned. \u201c\u2018Hear me,\u2019 said he; \u2018this man has gone, and for the moment has consequently escaped my vengeance; but let us be united, as we were to have been, and then leave it to Lord de Winter to maintain his own honor and that of his wife.\u2019\u201d \u201cLord de Winter!\u201d cried Felton. \u201cYes,\u201d said Milady, \u201cLord de Winter; and now you can understand it all, can you not? Buckingham remained nearly a year absent. A week before his return Lord de Winter died, leaving me his sole heir. Whence came the blow? God who knows all, knows without doubt; but as for me, I accuse nobody.\u201d \u201cOh, what an abyss; what an abyss!\u201d cried Felton. \u201cLord de Winter died without revealing anything to his brother. The terrible secret was to be concealed till it burst, like a clap of thunder, over the head of the guilty. Your protector had seen with pain this marriage of his elder brother with a portionless girl. I was sensible that I could look for no support from a man disappointed in his hopes of an inheritance. I went to France, with a determination to remain there for the rest of my life. But all my fortune is in England. Communication being closed by the war, I was in want of everything. I was then obliged to come back again. Six days ago, I landed at Portsmouth.\u201d \u201cWell?\u201d said Felton. \u201cWell; Buckingham heard by some means, no doubt, of my return. He spoke of me to Lord de Winter, already prejudiced against me, and told him that his sister-in-law was a prostitute, a branded woman.", " The cardinal, as it appears, pursues her and persecutes her more than ever. He cannot pardon her the history of the Saraband. You know the history of the Saraband?\u201d \u201cPARDIEU! Know it!\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan, who knew nothing about it, but who wished to appear to know everything that was going on. \u201cSo that now it is no longer hatred, but vengeance.\u201d \u201cIndeed!\u201d \u201cAnd the queen believes--\u201d \u201cWell, what does the queen believe?\u201d \u201cShe believes that someone has written to the Duke of Buckingham in her name.\u201d \u201cIn the queen\u2019s name?\u201d \u201cYes, to make him come to Paris; and when once come to Paris, to draw him into some snare.\u201d \u201cThe devil! But your wife, monsieur, what has she to do with all this?\u201d \u201cHer devotion to the queen is known; and they wish either to remove her from her mistress, or to intimidate her, in order to obtain her Majesty\u2019s secrets, or to seduce her and make use of her as a spy.\u201d \u201cThat is likely,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cbut the man who has abducted her--do you know him?\u201d \u201cI have told you that I believe I know him.\u201d \u201cHis name?\u201d \u201cI do not know that; what I do know is that he is a creature of the cardinal, his evil genius.\u201d \u201cBut you have seen him?\u201d \u201cYes, my wife pointed him out to me one day.\u201d \u201cHas he anything remarkable about him by which one may recognize him?\u201d \u201cOh, certainly; he is a noble of very lofty carriage, black hair, swarthy complexion, piercing eye, white teeth, and has a scar on his temple.\u201d \u201cA scar on his temple!\u201d cried d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cand with that, white teeth, a piercing eye, dark complexion, black hair, and haughty carriage--why, that\u2019s my man of Meung.\u201d \u201cHe is your man, do you say?\u201d \u201cYes, yes; but that has nothing to do with it.", " Milady was wrong in fearing that Mme. Bonacieux would have any suspicion. The poor young woman was too pure to suppose that any female could be guilty of such perfidy; besides, the name of the Comtesse de Winter, which she had heard the abbess pronounce, was wholly unknown to her, and she was even ignorant that a woman had had so great and so fatal a share in the misfortune of her life. \u201cYou see,\u201d said she, when the lackey had gone out, \u201ceverything is ready. The abbess suspects nothing, and believes that I am taken by order of the cardinal. This man goes to give his last orders; take the least thing, drink a finger of wine, and let us be gone.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Mme. Bonacieux, mechanically, \u201cyes, let us be gone.\u201d Milady made her a sign to sit down opposite, poured her a small glass of Spanish wine, and helped her to the wing of a chicken. \u201cSee,\u201d said she, \u201cif everything does not second us! Here is night coming on; by daybreak we shall have reached our retreat, and nobody can guess where we are. Come, courage! take something.\u201d Mme. Bonacieux ate a few mouthfuls mechanically, and just touched the glass with her lips. \u201cCome, come!\u201d said Milady, lifting hers to her mouth, \u201cdo as I do.\u201d But at the moment the glass touched her lips, her hand remained suspended; she heard something on the road which sounded like the rattling of a distant gallop. Then it grew nearer, and it seemed to her, almost at the same time, that she heard the neighing of horses."], "What did D\u2019Artagnan do to cause Milady to hate him?": [" I could not have believed she would risk her liberty for me, and yet for what other cause could she have returned to Paris?\u201d \u201cFor the cause which today takes us to England.\u201d \u201cAnd what is this cause?\u201d demanded Aramis. \u201cOh, you\u2019ll know it someday, Aramis; but at present I must imitate the discretion of \u2018the doctor\u2019s niece.\u2019\u201d Aramis smiled, as he remembered the tale he had told his friends on a certain evening. \u201cWell, then, since she has left Paris, and you are sure of it, d\u2019Artagnan, nothing prevents me, and I am ready to follow you. You say we are going--\u201d \u201cTo see Athos now, and if you will come thither, I beg you to make haste, for we have lost much time already. A PROPOS, inform Bazin.\u201d \u201cWill Bazin go with us?\u201d asked Aramis. \u201cPerhaps so. At all events, it is best that he should follow us to Athos\u2019s.\u201d Aramis called Bazin, and, after having ordered him to join them at Athos\u2019s residence, said \u201cLet us go then,\u201d at the same time taking his cloak, sword, and three pistols, opening uselessly two or three drawers to see if he could not find stray coin. When well assured this search was superfluous, he followed d\u2019Artagnan, wondering to himself how this young Guardsman should know so well who the lady was to whom he had given hospitality, and that he should know better than himself what had become of her. Only as they went out Aramis placed his hand upon the arm of d\u2019Artagnan, and looking at him earnestly, \u201cYou have not spoken of this lady?\u201d said he.", " This coldness toward the only interests that occupied her mind terrified Milady, whose questions became more pressing. Then d\u2019Artagnan, who had never seriously thought of this impossible duel, endeavored to turn the conversation; but he could not succeed. Milady kept him within the limits she had traced beforehand with her irresistible spirit and her iron will. D\u2019Artagnan fancied himself very cunning when advising Milady to renounce, by pardoning de Wardes, the furious projects she had formed. But at the first word the young woman started, and exclaimed in a sharp, bantering tone, which sounded strangely in the darkness, \u201cAre you afraid, dear Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan?\u201d \u201cYou cannot think so, dear love!\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cbut now, suppose this poor Comte de Wardes were less guilty than you think him?\u201d \u201cAt all events,\u201d said Milady, seriously, \u201che has deceived me, and from the moment he deceived me, he merited death.\u201d \u201cHe shall die, then, since you condemn him!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, in so firm a tone that it appeared to Milady an undoubted proof of devotion. This reassured her. We cannot say how long the night seemed to Milady, but d\u2019Artagnan believed it to be hardly two hours before the daylight peeped through the window blinds, and invaded the chamber with its paleness. Seeing d\u2019Artagnan about to leave her, Milady recalled his promise to avenge her on the Comte de Wardes. \u201cI am quite ready,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cbut in the first place I should like to be certain of one thing.\u201d \u201cAnd what is that?\u201d asked Milady.", " \u201cListen! It was you who cut off the two diamond studs from the shoulder of the Duke of Buckingham; it was you had the Madame Bonacieux carried off; it was you who, in love with de Wardes and thinking to pass the night with him, opened the door to Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan; it was you who, believing that de Wardes had deceived you, wished to have him killed by his rival; it was you who, when this rival had discovered your infamous secret, wished to have him killed in his turn by two assassins, whom you sent in pursuit of him; it was you who, finding the balls had missed their mark, sent poisoned wine with a forged letter, to make your victim believe that the wine came from his friends. In short, it was you who have but now in this chamber, seated in this chair I now fill, made an engagement with Cardinal Richelieu to cause the Duke of Buckingham to be assassinated, in exchange for the promise he has made you to allow you to assassinate d\u2019Artagnan.\u201d Milady was livid. \u201cYou must be Satan!\u201d cried she. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d said Athos; \u201cBut at all events listen well to this. Assassinate the Duke of Buckingham, or cause him to be assassinated--I care very little about that! I don\u2019t know him. Besides, he is an Englishman. But do not touch with the tip of your finger a single hair of d\u2019Artagnan, who is a faithful friend whom I love and defend, or I swear to you by the head of my father the crime which you shall have endeavored to commit, or shall have committed, shall be the last.\u201d \u201cMonsieur d\u2019Artagnan has cruelly insulted me,\u201d said Milady, in a hollow tone; \u201cMonsieur d\u2019Artagnan shall die!\u201d \u201cIndeed!", " D\u2019Artagnan reassured her as well as he could, and promised to remain insensible to the seductions of Milady. He desired Kitty to tell her mistress that he could not be more grateful for her kindnesses than he was, and that he would be obedient to her orders. He did not dare to write for fear of not being able--to such experienced eyes as those of Milady--to disguise his writing sufficiently. As nine o\u2019clock sounded, d\u2019Artagnan was at the Place Royale. It was evident that the servants who waited in the antechamber were warned, for as soon as d\u2019Artagnan appeared, before even he had asked if Milady were visible, one of them ran to announce him. \u201cShow him in,\u201d said Milady, in a quick tone, but so piercing that d\u2019Artagnan heard her in the antechamber. He was introduced. \u201cI am at home to nobody,\u201d said Milady; \u201cobserve, to nobody.\u201d The servant went out. D\u2019Artagnan cast an inquiring glance at Milady. She was pale, and looked fatigued, either from tears or want of sleep. The number of lights had been intentionally diminished, but the young woman could not conceal the traces of the fever which had devoured her for two days. D\u2019Artagnan approached her with his usual gallantry. She then made an extraordinary effort to receive him, but never did a more distressed countenance give the lie to a more amiable smile. To the questions which d\u2019Artagnan put concerning her health, she replied, \u201cBad, very bad.\u201d \u201cThen,\u201d replied he, \u201cmy visit is ill-timed; you, no doubt, stand in need of repose, and I will withdraw.\u201d \u201cNo, no!\u201d said Milady."], "Why does Kitty help D\u2019Artagnan intercept Milady\u2019s correspondence with the Comte de Wardes?": [" Kitty came in, but Milady was very cross with her. The poor girl ventured a glance at d\u2019Artagnan which said, \u201cSee how I suffer on your account!\u201d Toward the end of the evening, however, the beautiful lioness became milder; she smilingly listened to the soft speeches of d\u2019Artagnan, and even gave him her hand to kiss. D\u2019Artagnan departed, scarcely knowing what to think, but as he was a youth who did not easily lose his head, while continuing to pay his court to Milady, he had framed a little plan in his mind. He found Kitty at the gate, and, as on the preceding evening, went up to her chamber. Kitty had been accused of negligence and severely scolded. Milady could not at all comprehend the silence of the Comte de Wardes, and she ordered Kitty to come at nine o\u2019clock in the morning to take a third letter. D\u2019Artagnan made Kitty promise to bring him that letter on the following morning. The poor girl promised all her lover desired; she was mad. Things passed as on the night before. D\u2019Artagnan concealed himself in his closet; Milady called, undressed, sent away Kitty, and shut the door. As the night before, d\u2019Artagnan did not return home till five o\u2019clock in the morning. At eleven o\u2019clock Kitty came to him. She held in her hand a fresh billet from Milady. This time the poor girl did not even argue with d\u2019Artagnan; she gave it to him at once. She belonged body and soul to her handsome soldier.", " For the rest this vengeance was very easy; for Milady, doubtless to conceal her blushes from her lover, had ordered Kitty to extinguish all the lights in the apartment, and even in the little chamber itself. Before daybreak M. de Wardes must take his departure, still in obscurity. Presently they heard Milady retire to her room. D\u2019Artagnan slipped into the wardrobe. Hardly was he concealed when the little bell sounded. Kitty went to her mistress, and did not leave the door open; but the partition was so thin that one could hear nearly all that passed between the two women. Milady seemed overcome with joy, and made Kitty repeat the smallest details of the pretended interview of the soubrette with de Wardes when he received the letter; how he had responded; what was the expression of his face; if he seemed very amorous. And to all these questions poor Kitty, forced to put on a pleasant face, responded in a stifled voice whose dolorous accent her mistress did not however remark, solely because happiness is egotistical. Finally, as the hour for her interview with the count approached, Milady had everything about her darkened, and ordered Kitty to return to her own chamber, and introduce de Wardes whenever he presented himself. Kitty\u2019s detention was not long. Hardly had d\u2019Artagnan seen, through a crevice in his closet, that the whole apartment was in obscurity, than he slipped out of his concealment, at the very moment when Kitty reclosed the door of communication.", " \u201cFor all this,\u201d continued Milady, \u201cI should long ago have revenged myself on him if, and I don\u2019t know why, the cardinal had not requested me to conciliate him.\u201d \u201cOh, yes; but Madame has not conciliated that little woman he was so fond of.\u201d \u201cWhat, the mercer\u2019s wife of the Rue des Fossoyeurs? Has he not already forgotten she ever existed? Fine vengeance that, on my faith!\u201d A cold sweat broke from d\u2019Artagnan\u2019s brow. Why, this woman was a monster! He resumed his listening, but unfortunately the toilet was finished. \u201cThat will do,\u201d said Milady; \u201cgo into your own room, and tomorrow endeavor again to get me an answer to the letter I gave you.\u201d \u201cFor Monsieur de Wardes?\u201d said Kitty. \u201cTo be sure; for Monsieur de Wardes.\u201d \u201cNow, there is one,\u201d said Kitty, \u201cwho appears to me quite a different sort of a man from that poor Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan.\u201d \u201cGo to bed, mademoiselle,\u201d said Milady; \u201cI don\u2019t like comments.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan heard the door close; then the noise of two bolts by which Milady fastened herself in. On her side, but as softly as possible, Kitty turned the key of the lock, and then d\u2019Artagnan opened the closet door. \u201cOh, good Lord!\u201d said Kitty, in a low voice, \u201cwhat is the matter with you? How pale you are!\u201d \u201cThe abominable creature,\u201d murmured d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cSilence, silence, begone!\u201d said Kitty. \u201cThere is nothing but a wainscot between my chamber and Milady\u2019s; every word that is uttered in one can be heard in the other.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s exactly the reason I won\u2019t go,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan.", " Kitty guessed what was passing in the mind of the young man, and heaved a deep sigh. \u201cYou love my mistress, then, very dearly, Monsieur Chevalier?\u201d said she. \u201cOh, more than I can say, Kitty! I am mad for her!\u201d Kitty breathed a second sigh. \u201cAlas, monsieur,\u201d said she, \u201cthat is too bad.\u201d \u201cWhat the devil do you see so bad in it?\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cBecause, monsieur,\u201d replied Kitty, \u201cmy mistress loves you not at all.\u201d \u201cHEIN!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201ccan she have charged you to tell me so?\u201d \u201cOh, no, monsieur; but out of the regard I have for you, I have taken the resolution to tell you so.\u201d \u201cMuch obliged, my dear Kitty; but for the intention only--for the information, you must agree, is not likely to be at all agreeable.\u201d \u201cThat is to say, you don\u2019t believe what I have told you; is it not so?\u201d \u201cWe have always some difficulty in believing such things, my pretty dear, were it only from self-love.\u201d \u201cThen you don\u2019t believe me?\u201d \u201cI confess that unless you deign to give me some proof of what you advance--\u201d \u201cWhat do you think of this?\u201d Kitty drew a little note from her bosom. \u201cFor me?\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, seizing the letter. \u201cNo; for another.\u201d \u201cFor another?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cHis name; his name!\u201d cried d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cRead the address.\u201d \u201cMonsieur El Comte de Wardes.\u201d The remembrance of the scene at St. Germain presented itself to the mind of the presumptuous Gascon. As quick as thought, he tore open the letter, in spite of the cry which Kitty uttered on seeing what he was going to do, or rather, what he was doing."], "Who does Milady make D\u2019Artagnan promise to kill?": [" Presently the door opened, and she perceived Felton. The young man advanced rapidly into the chamber, leaving the door open behind him, and making a sign to Milady to be silent; his face was much agitated. \u201cWhat do you want with me?\u201d said she. \u201cListen,\u201d replied Felton, in a low voice. \u201cI have just sent away the sentinel that I might remain here without anybody knowing it, in order to speak to you without being overheard. The baron has just related a frightful story to me.\u201d Milady assumed her smile of a resigned victim, and shook her head. \u201cEither you are a demon,\u201d continued Felton, \u201cor the baron--my benefactor, my father--is a monster. I have known you four days; I have loved him four years. I therefore may hesitate between you. Be not alarmed at what I say; I want to be convinced. Tonight, after twelve, I will come and see you, and you shall convince me.\u201d \u201cNo, Felton, no, my brother,\u201d said she; \u201cthe sacrifice is too great, and I feel what it must cost you. No, I am lost; do not be lost with me. My death will be much more eloquent than my life, and the silence of the corpse will convince you much better than the words of the prisoner.\u201d \u201cBe silent, madame,\u201d cried Felton, \u201cand do not speak to me thus; I came to entreat you to promise me upon your honor, to swear to me by what you hold most sacred, that you will make no attempt upon your life.\u201d \u201cI will not promise,\u201d said Milady, \u201cfor no one has more respect for a promise or an oath than I have; and if I make a promise I must keep it.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Felton, \u201conly promise till you have seen me again.", " This coldness toward the only interests that occupied her mind terrified Milady, whose questions became more pressing.

But at the first word the young woman started, and exclaimed in a sharp, bantering tone, which sounded strangely in the darkness, \u201cAre you afraid, dear Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan?\u201d \u201cYou cannot think so, dear love!\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cbut now, suppose this poor Comte de Wardes were less guilty than you think him?\u201d \u201cAt all events,\u201d said Milady, seriously, \u201che has deceived me, and from the moment he deceived me, he merited death.\u201d \u201cHe shall die, then, since you condemn him!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, in so firm a tone that it appeared to Milady an undoubted proof of devotion. This reassured her. We cannot say how long the night seemed to Milady, but d\u2019Artagnan believed it to be hardly two hours before the daylight peeped through the window blinds, and invaded the chamber with its paleness. Seeing d\u2019Artagnan about to leave her, Milady recalled his promise to avenge her on the Comte de Wardes. \u201cI am quite ready,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cbut in the first place I should like to be certain of one thing.\u201d \u201cAnd what is that?\u201d asked Milady.", " At that instant he felt himself ready to reveal all. He even opened his mouth to tell Milady who he was, and with what a revengeful purpose he had come; but she added, \u201cPoor angel, whom that monster of a Gascon barely failed to kill.\u201d The monster was himself. \u201cOh,\u201d continued Milady, \u201cdo your wounds still make you suffer?\u201d \u201cYes, much,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, who did not well know how to answer. \u201cBe tranquil,\u201d murmured Milady; \u201cI will avenge you--and cruelly!\u201d \u201cPESTE!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan to himself, \u201cthe moment for confidences has not yet come.\u201d It took some time for d\u2019Artagnan to resume this little dialogue; but then all the ideas of vengeance which he had brought with him had completely vanished. This woman exercised over him an unaccountable power; he hated and adored her at the same time. He would not have believed that two sentiments so opposite could dwell in the same heart, and by their union constitute a passion so strange, and as it were, diabolical. Presently it sounded one o\u2019clock. It was necessary to separate. D\u2019Artagnan at the moment of quitting Milady felt only the liveliest regret at the parting; and as they addressed each other in a reciprocally passionate adieu, another interview was arranged for the following week. Poor Kitty hoped to speak a few words to d\u2019Artagnan when he passed through her chamber; but Milady herself reconducted him through the darkness, and only quit him at the staircase.", " \u201cWell,\u201d replied Milady, after a moment of silence, \u201cfrom the present time, cease to talk of impossibilities.\u201d \u201cDo not overwhelm me with happiness,\u201d cried d\u2019Artagnan, throwing himself on his knees, and covering with kisses the hands abandoned to him. \u201cAvenge me of that infamous de Wardes,\u201d said Milady, between her teeth, \u201cand I shall soon know how to get rid of you--you double idiot, you animated sword blade!\u201d \u201cFall voluntarily into my arms, hypocritical and dangerous woman,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, likewise to himself, \u201cafter having abused me with such effrontery, and afterward I will laugh at you with him whom you wish me to kill.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan lifted up his head. \u201cI am ready,\u201d said he. \u201cYou have understood me, then, dear Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan,\u201d said Milady. \u201cI could interpret one of your looks.\u201d \u201cThen you would employ for me your arm which has already acquired so much renown?\u201d \u201cInstantly!\u201d \u201cBut on my part,\u201d said Milady, \u201chow should I repay such a service? I know these lovers. They are men who do nothing for nothing.\u201d \u201cYou know the only reply that I desire,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cthe only one worthy of you and of me!\u201d And he drew nearer to her. She scarcely resisted. \u201cInterested man!\u201d cried she, smiling. \u201cAh,\u201d cried d\u2019Artagnan, really carried away by the passion this woman had the power to kindle in his heart, \u201cah, that is because my happiness appears so impossible to me; and I have such fear that it should fly away from me like a dream that I pant to make a reality of it.\u201d \u201cWell, merit this pretended happiness, then!\u201d \u201cI am at your orders,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan."], "In the wake of D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s horrifying encounter with Milady, who do D\u2019Artagnan and Athos believe her to be?": [" This coldness toward the only interests that occupied her mind terrified Milady, whose questions became more pressing. Then d\u2019Artagnan, who had never seriously thought of this impossible duel, endeavored to turn the conversation; but he could not succeed. Milady kept him within the limits she had traced beforehand with her irresistible spirit and her iron will. D\u2019Artagnan fancied himself very cunning when advising Milady to renounce, by pardoning de Wardes, the furious projects she had formed. But at the first word the young woman started, and exclaimed in a sharp, bantering tone, which sounded strangely in the darkness, \u201cAre you afraid, dear Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan?\u201d \u201cYou cannot think so, dear love!\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cbut now, suppose this poor Comte de Wardes were less guilty than you think him?\u201d \u201cAt all events,\u201d said Milady, seriously, \u201che has deceived me, and from the moment he deceived me, he merited death.\u201d \u201cHe shall die, then, since you condemn him!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, in so firm a tone that it appeared to Milady an undoubted proof of devotion.

Seeing d\u2019Artagnan about to leave her, Milady recalled his promise to avenge her on the Comte de Wardes. \u201cI am quite ready,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cbut in the first place I should like to be certain of one thing.\u201d \u201cAnd what is that?\u201d asked Milady.", " \u201cAnd now to table,\u201d said Athos. The four friends seated themselves on the ground with their legs crossed like Turks, or even tailors. \u201cAnd now,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cas there is no longer any fear of being overheard, I hope you are going to let me into your secret.\u201d \u201cI hope at the same time to procure you amusement and glory, gentlemen,\u201d said Athos. \u201cI have induced you to take a charming promenade; here is a delicious breakfast; and yonder are five hundred persons, as you may see through the loopholes, taking us for heroes or madmen--two classes of imbeciles greatly resembling each other.\u201d \u201cBut the secret!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cThe secret is,\u201d said Athos, \u201cthat I saw Milady last night.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan was lifting a glass to his lips; but at the name of Milady, his hand trembled so, that he was obliged to put the glass on the ground again for fear of spilling the contents.\u201d \u201cYou saw your wi--\u201d \u201cHush!\u201d interrupted Athos. \u201cYou forget, my dear, you forget that these gentlemen are not initiated into my family affairs like yourself. I have seen Milady.\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d demanded d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cWithin two leagues of this place, at the inn of the Red Dovecot.\u201d \u201cIn that case I am lost,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cNot so bad yet,\u201d replied Athos; \u201cfor by this time she must have quit the shores of France.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan breathed again. \u201cBut after all,\u201d asked Porthos, \u201cwho is Milady?\u201d \u201cA charming woman!\u201d said Athos, sipping a glass of sparkling wine.", " Milady recoiled, uttering a cry. D\u2019Artagnan, believing she might have means of flight and fearing she should escape, drew a pistol from his belt; but Athos raised his hand. \u201cPut back that weapon, d\u2019Artagnan!\u201d said he; \u201cthis woman must be tried, not assassinated. Wait an instant, my friend, and you shall be satisfied. Come in, gentlemen.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan obeyed; for Athos had the solemn voice and the powerful gesture of a judge sent by the Lord himself. Behind d\u2019Artagnan entered Porthos, Aramis, Lord de Winter, and the man in the red cloak. The four lackeys guarded the door and the window. Milady had sunk into a chair, with her hands extended, as if to conjure this terrible apparition. Perceiving her brother-in-law, she uttered a terrible cry. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d screamed Milady. \u201cWe want,\u201d said Athos, \u201cCharlotte Backson, who first was called Comtesse de la Fere, and afterwards Milady de Winter, Baroness of Sheffield.\u201d \u201cThat is I! that is I!\u201d murmured Milady, in extreme terror; \u201cwhat do you want?\u201d \u201cWe wish to judge you according to your crime,\u201d said Athos; \u201cyou shall be free to defend yourself. Justify yourself if you can. M. d\u2019Artagnan, it is for you to accuse her first.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan advanced. \u201cBefore God and before men,\u201d said he, \u201cI accuse this woman of having poisoned Constance Bonacieux, who died yesterday evening.\u201d He turned towards Porthos and Aramis. \u201cWe bear witness to this,\u201d said the two Musketeers, with one voice.", " Porthos saw nothing in all this but a love meeting, given by a lady to a cavalier, or by a cavalier to a lady, which had been disturbed by the presence of d\u2019Artagnan and his yellow horse. Aramis said that as these sorts of affairs were mysterious, it was better not to fathom them. They understood, then, from the few words which escaped from d\u2019Artagnan, what affair was in hand, and as they thought that overtaking his man, or losing sight of him, d\u2019Artagnan would return to his rooms, they kept on their way. When they entered d\u2019Artagnan\u2019s chamber, it was empty; the landlord, dreading the consequences of the encounter which was doubtless about to take place between the young man and the stranger, had, consistent with the character he had given himself, judged it prudent to decamp. 9 D\u2019ARTAGNAN SHOWS HIMSELF As Athos and Porthos had foreseen, at the expiration of a half hour, d\u2019Artagnan returned. He had again missed his man, who had disappeared as if by enchantment. D\u2019Artagnan had run, sword in hand, through all the neighboring streets, but had found nobody resembling the man he sought for. Then he came back to the point where, perhaps, he ought to have begun, and that was to knock at the door against which the stranger had leaned; but this proved useless--for though he knocked ten or twelve times in succession, no one answered, and some of the neighbors, who put their noses out of their windows or were brought to their doors by the noise, had assured him that that house, all the openings of which were tightly closed, had not been inhabited for six months."], "What do D\u2019Artagnan and Athos pawn to buy equipment?": [" M Dessessart, who esteemed d\u2019Artagnan, made him offers of help, as this change would entail expenses for equipment. D\u2019Artagnan refused; but thinking the opportunity a good one, he begged him to have the diamond he put into his hand valued, as he wished to turn it into money. The next day, M. Dessessart\u2019s valet came to d\u2019Artagnan\u2019s lodging, and gave him a bag containing seven thousand livres. This was the price of the queen\u2019s diamond. 48 A FAMILY AFFAIR Athos had invented the phrase, family affair. A family affair was not subject to the investigation of the cardinal; a family affair concerned nobody. People might employ themselves in a family affair before all the world. Therefore Athos had invented the phrase, family affair. Aramis had discovered the idea, the lackeys. Porthos had discovered the means, the diamond. D\u2019Artagnan alone had discovered nothing--he, ordinarily the most inventive of the four; but it must be also said that the very name of Milady paralyzed him. Ah! no, we were mistaken; he had discovered a purchaser for his diamond. The breakfast at M. de Treville\u2019s was as gay and cheerful as possible. D\u2019Artagnan already wore his uniform--for being nearly of the same size as Aramis, and as Aramis was so liberally paid by the publisher who purchased his poem as to allow him to buy everything double, he sold his friend a complete outfit. D\u2019Artagnan would have been at the height of his wishes if he had not constantly seen Milady like a dark cloud hovering in the horizon.", " Meantime, you see that the lackeys saddle the horses.\u201d \u201cI have no horse,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cbut that is of no consequence, I can take one of Monsieur de Treville\u2019s.\u201d \u201cThat is not worth while,\u201d said Aramis, \u201cyou can have one of mine.\u201d \u201cOne of yours! how many have you, then?\u201d asked d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cThree,\u201d replied Aramis, smiling. \u201cCertes,\u201d cried Athos, \u201cyou are the best-mounted poet of France or Navarre.\u201d \u201cWell, my dear Aramis, you don\u2019t want three horses? I cannot comprehend what induced you to buy three!\u201d \u201cTherefore I only purchased two,\u201d said Aramis. \u201cThe third, then, fell from the clouds, I suppose?\u201d \u201cNo, the third was brought to me this very morning by a groom out of livery, who would not tell me in whose service he was, and who said he had received orders from his master.\u201d \u201cOr his mistress,\u201d interrupted d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cThat makes no difference,\u201d said Aramis, coloring; \u201cand who affirmed, as I said, that he had received orders from his master or mistress to place the horse in my stable, without informing me whence it came.\u201d \u201cIt is only to poets that such things happen,\u201d said Athos, gravely. \u201cWell, in that case, we can manage famously,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cwhich of the two horses will you ride--that which you bought or the one that was given to you?\u201d \u201cThat which was given to me, assuredly. You cannot for a moment imagine, d\u2019Artagnan, that I would commit such an offense toward--\u201d \u201cThe unknown giver,\u201d interrupted d\u2019Artagnan.", " Madame de Bois-Tracy asked me, for one of her friends who resides in the provinces, I believe, for a trustworthy maid. If you can, my dear d\u2019Artagnan, answer for Mademoiselle-\u201d \u201cOh, monsieur, be assured that I shall be entirely devoted to the person who will give me the means of quitting Paris.\u201d \u201cThen,\u201d said Aramis, \u201cthis falls out very well.\u201d He placed himself at the table and wrote a little note which he sealed with a ring, and gave the billet to Kitty. \u201cAnd now, my dear girl,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cyou know that it is not good for any of us to be here. Therefore let us separate. We shall meet again in better days.\u201d \u201cAnd whenever we find each other, in whatever place it may be,\u201d said Kitty, \u201cyou will find me loving you as I love you today.\u201d \u201cDicers\u2019 oaths!\u201d said Athos, while d\u2019Artagnan went to conduct Kitty downstairs. An instant afterward the three young men separated, agreeing to meet again at four o\u2019clock with Athos, and leaving Planchet to guard the house. Aramis returned home, and Athos and d\u2019Artagnan busied themselves about pledging the sapphire. As the Gascon had foreseen, they easily obtained three hundred pistoles on the ring. Still further, the Jew told them that if they would sell it to him, as it would make a magnificent pendant for earrings, he would give five hundred pistoles for it. Athos and d\u2019Artagnan, with the activity of two soldiers and the knowledge of two connoisseurs, hardly required three hours to purchase the entire equipment of the Musketeer.", " This day of reunion was the same day as that on which Kitty came to find d\u2019Artagnan. Soon as Kitty left him, d\u2019Artagnan directed his steps toward the Rue Ferou. He found Athos and Aramis philosophizing. Aramis had some slight inclination to resume the cassock. Athos, according to his system, neither encouraged nor dissuaded him. Athos believed that everyone should be left to his own free will. He never gave advice but when it was asked, and even then he required to be asked twice. \u201cPeople, in general,\u201d he said, \u201conly ask advice not to follow it; or if they do follow it, it is for the sake of having someone to blame for having given it.\u201d Porthos arrived a minute after d\u2019Artagnan. The four friends were reunited. The four countenances expressed four different feelings: that of Porthos, tranquillity; that of d\u2019Artagnan, hope; that of Aramis, uneasiness; that of Athos, carelessness. At the end of a moment\u2019s conversation, in which Porthos hinted that a lady of elevated rank had condescended to relieve him from his embarrassment, Mousqueton entered. He came to request his master to return to his lodgings, where his presence was urgent, as he piteously said. \u201cIs it my equipment?\u201d \u201cYes and no,\u201d replied Mousqueton. \u201cWell, but can\u2019t you speak?\u201d \u201cCome, monsieur.\u201d Porthos rose, saluted his friends, and followed Mousqueton. An instant after, Bazin made his appearance at the door. \u201cWhat do you want with me, my friend?\u201d said Aramis, with that mildness of language which was observable in him every time that his ideas were directed toward the Church."], "What remains ambiguous to D\u2019Artagnan after his brief meeting with Madame Bonacieux on the bridge?": [" That brave and unfortunate Athos was wounded on that very shoulder against which I must run head foremost, like a ram. The only thing that astonishes me is that he did not strike me dead at once. He had good cause to do so; the pain I gave him must have been atrocious. As to Porthos--oh, as to Porthos, faith, that\u2019s a droll affair!\u201d And in spite of himself, the young man began to laugh aloud, looking round carefully, however, to see that his solitary laugh, without a cause in the eyes of passers-by, offended no one. \u201cAs to Porthos, that is certainly droll; but I am not the less a giddy fool. Are people to be run against without warning? No! And have I any right to go and peep under their cloaks to see what is not there? He would have pardoned me, he would certainly have pardoned me, if I had not said anything to him about that cursed baldric--in ambiguous words, it is true, but rather drolly ambiguous. Ah, cursed Gascon that I am, I get from one hobble into another. Friend d\u2019Artagnan,\u201d continued he, speaking to himself with all the amenity that he thought due himself, \u201cif you escape, of which there is not much chance, I would advise you to practice perfect politeness for the future. You must henceforth be admired and quoted as a model of it. To be obliging and polite does not necessarily make a man a coward. Look at Aramis, now; Aramis is mildness and grace personified. Well, did anybody ever dream of calling Aramis a coward?", " \u201cWell, then it appears that we are the Croesuses of the society. How much have you left of your hundred pistoles, d\u2019Artagnan?\u201d \u201cOf my hundred pistoles? Why, in the first place I gave you fifty.\u201d \u201cYou think so?\u201d \u201cPARDIEU!\u201d \u201cAh, that is true. I recollect.\u201d \u201cThen I paid the host six.\u201d \u201cWhat a brute of a host! Why did you give him six pistoles?\u201d \u201cYou told me to give them to him.\u201d \u201cIt is true; I am too good-natured. In brief, how much remains?\u201d \u201cTwenty-five pistoles,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cAnd I,\u201d said Athos, taking some small change from his pocket, \u201cI--\u201d \u201cYou? Nothing!\u201d \u201cMy faith! So little that it is not worth reckoning with the general stock.\u201d \u201cNow, then, let us calculate how much we posses in all.\u201d \u201cPorthos?\u201d \u201cThirty crowns.\u201d \u201cAramis?\u201d \u201cTen pistoles.\u201d \u201cAnd you, d\u2019Artagnan?\u201d \u201cTwenty-five.\u201d \u201cThat makes in all?\u201d said Athos. \u201cFour hundred and seventy-five livres,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, who reckoned like Archimedes. \u201cOn our arrival in Paris, we shall still have four hundred, besides the harnesses,\u201d said Porthos. \u201cBut our troop horses?\u201d said Aramis. \u201cWell, of the four horses of our lackeys we will make two for the masters, for which we will draw lots. With the four hundred livres we will make the half of one for one of the unmounted, and then we will give the turnings out of our pockets to d\u2019Artagnan, who has a steady hand, and will go and play in the first gaming house we come to. There!\u201d \u201cLet us dine, then,\u201d said Porthos; \u201cit is getting cold.\u201d The friends, at ease with regard to the future, did honor to the repast, the remains of which were abandoned to Mousqueton, Bazin, Planchet, and Grimaud.", " I know them from having heard one of their friends, Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan, say a great deal about them.\u201d \u201cYou know Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan!\u201d cried the novice, in her turn seizing the hands of Milady and devouring her with her eyes. Then remarking the strange expression of Milady\u2019s countenance, she said, \u201cPardon me, madame; you know him by what title?\u201d \u201cWhy,\u201d replied Milady, embarrassed, \u201cwhy, by the title of friend.\u201d \u201cYou deceive me, madame,\u201d said the novice; \u201cyou have been his mistress!\u201d \u201cIt is you who have been his mistress, madame!\u201d cried Milady, in her turn. \u201cI?\u201d said the novice. \u201cYes, you! I know you now. You are Madame Bonacieux!\u201d The young woman drew back, filled with surprise and terror. \u201cOh, do not deny it! Answer!\u201d continued Milady. \u201cWell, yes, madame,\u201d said the novice, \u201cAre we rivals?\u201d The countenance of Milady was illumined by so savage a joy that under any other circumstances Mme. Bonacieux would have fled in terror; but she was absorbed by jealousy. \u201cSpeak, madame!\u201d resumed Mme. Bonacieux, with an energy of which she might not have been believed capable. \u201cHave you been, or are you, his mistress?\u201d \u201cOh, no!\u201d cried Milady, with an accent that admitted no doubt of her truth. \u201cNever, never!\u201d \u201cI believe you,\u201d said Mme. Bonacieux; \u201cbut why, then, did you cry out so?\u201d \u201cDo you not understand?\u201d said Milady, who had already overcome her agitation and recovered all her presence of mind.", " M Bonacieux was at his door. D\u2019Artagnan\u2019s intention was to go out without speaking to the worthy mercer; but the latter made so polite and friendly a salutation that his tenant felt obliged, not only to stop, but to enter into conversation with him. Besides, how is it possible to avoid a little condescension toward a husband whose pretty wife has appointed a meeting with you that same evening at St. Cloud, opposite D\u2019Estrees\u2019s pavilion? D\u2019Artagnan approached him with the most amiable air he could assume. The conversation naturally fell upon the incarceration of the poor man. M. Bonacieux, who was ignorant that d\u2019Artagnan had overheard his conversation with the stranger of Meung, related to his young tenant the persecutions of that monster, M. de Laffemas, whom he never ceased to designate, during his account, by the title of the \u201ccardinal\u2019s executioner,\u201d and expatiated at great length upon the Bastille, the bolts, the wickets, the dungeons, the gratings, the instruments of torture. D\u2019Artagnan listened to him with exemplary complaisance, and when he had finished said, \u201cAnd Madame Bonacieux, do you know who carried her off?--For I do not forget that I owe to that unpleasant circumstance the good fortune of having made your acquaintance.\u201d \u201cAh!\u201d said Bonacieux, \u201cthey took good care not to tell me that; and my wife, on her part, has sworn to me by all that\u2019s sacred that she does not know."], "What does the Cardinal offer D\u2019Artagnan, which D\u2019Artagnan courteously declines during their meeting together?": [" I comprehend. Well, you have this excuse: advancement, the opening campaign, the opportunity which I offer you--so much for the world. As regards yourself, the need of protection; for it is fit you should know, Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan, that I have received heavy and serious complaints against you. You do not consecrate your days and nights wholly to the king\u2019s service.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan colored. \u201cIn fact,\u201d said the cardinal, placing his hand upon a bundle of papers, \u201cI have here a whole pile which concerns you. I know you to be a man of resolution; and your services, well directed, instead of leading you to ill, might be very advantageous to you. Come; reflect, and decide.\u201d \u201cYour goodness confounds me, monseigneur,\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cand I am conscious of a greatness of soul in your Eminence that makes me mean as an earthworm; but since Monseigneur permits me to speak freely--\u201d D\u2019Artagnan paused. \u201cYes; speak.\u201d \u201cThen, I will presume to say that all my friends are in the king\u2019s Musketeers and Guards, and that by an inconceivable fatality my enemies are in the service of your Eminence; I should, therefore, be ill received here and ill regarded there if I accepted what Monseigneur offers me.\u201d \u201cDo you happen to entertain the haughty idea that I have not yet made you an offer equal to your value?\u201d asked the cardinal, with a smile of disdain. \u201cMonseigneur, your Eminence is a hundred times too kind to me; and on the contrary, I think I have not proved myself worthy of your goodness.", " Returned home with Athos, Aramis and Porthos inquired eagerly the cause of the strange interview; but d\u2019Artagnan confined himself to telling them that M. de Richelieu had sent for him to propose to him to enter into his guards with the rank of ensign, and that he had refused. \u201cAnd you were right,\u201d cried Aramis and Porthos, with one voice. Athos fell into a profound reverie and answered nothing. But when they were alone he said, \u201cYou have done that which you ought to have done, d\u2019Artagnan; but perhaps you have been wrong.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan sighed deeply, for this voice responded to a secret voice of his soul, which told him that great misfortunes awaited him. The whole of the next day was spent in preparations for departure. D\u2019Artagnan went to take leave of M. de Treville. At that time it was believed that the separation of the Musketeers and the Guards would be but momentary, the king holding his Parliament that very day and proposing to set out the day after. M. de Treville contented himself with asking d\u2019Artagnan if he could do anything for him, but d\u2019Artagnan answered that he was supplied with all he wanted. That night brought together all those comrades of the Guards of M. Dessessart and the company of Musketeers of M. de Treville who had been accustomed to associate together. They were parting to meet again when it pleased God, and if it pleased God. That night, then, was somewhat riotous, as may be imagined.", " Porthos saw nothing in all this but a love meeting, given by a lady to a cavalier, or by a cavalier to a lady, which had been disturbed by the presence of d\u2019Artagnan and his yellow horse. Aramis said that as these sorts of affairs were mysterious, it was better not to fathom them. They understood, then, from the few words which escaped from d\u2019Artagnan, what affair was in hand, and as they thought that overtaking his man, or losing sight of him, d\u2019Artagnan would return to his rooms, they kept on their way. When they entered d\u2019Artagnan\u2019s chamber, it was empty; the landlord, dreading the consequences of the encounter which was doubtless about to take place between the young man and the stranger, had, consistent with the character he had given himself, judged it prudent to decamp. 9 D\u2019ARTAGNAN SHOWS HIMSELF As Athos and Porthos had foreseen, at the expiration of a half hour, d\u2019Artagnan returned. He had again missed his man, who had disappeared as if by enchantment. D\u2019Artagnan had run, sword in hand, through all the neighboring streets, but had found nobody resembling the man he sought for. Then he came back to the point where, perhaps, he ought to have begun, and that was to knock at the door against which the stranger had leaned; but this proved useless--for though he knocked ten or twelve times in succession, no one answered, and some of the neighbors, who put their noses out of their windows or were brought to their doors by the noise, had assured him that that house, all the openings of which were tightly closed, had not been inhabited for six months.", " He felt something like a secret joy at being forever relieved of this dangerous accomplice. Richelieu slowly tore the paper which d\u2019Artagnan had generously relinquished. \u201cI am lost!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan to himself. And he bowed profoundly before the cardinal, like a man who says, \u201cLord, Thy will be done!\u201d The cardinal approached the table, and without sitting down, wrote a few lines upon a parchment of which two-thirds were already filled, and affixed his seal. \u201cThat is my condemnation,\u201d thought d\u2019Artagnan; \u201che will spare me the ENNUI of the Bastille, or the tediousness of a trial. That\u2019s very kind of him.\u201d \u201cHere, monsieur,\u201d said the cardinal to the young man. \u201cI have taken from you one CARTE BLANCHE to give you another. The name is wanting in this commission; you can write it yourself.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan took the paper hesitatingly and cast his eyes over it; it was a lieutenant\u2019s commission in the Musketeers. D\u2019Artagnan fell at the feet of the cardinal. \u201cMonseigneur,\u201d said he, \u201cmy life is yours; henceforth dispose of it. But this favor which you bestow upon me I do not merit. I have three friends who are more meritorious and more worthy--\u201d \u201cYou are a brave youth, d\u2019Artagnan,\u201d interrupted the cardinal, tapping him familiarly on the shoulder, charmed at having vanquished this rebellious nature. \u201cDo with this commission what you will; only remember, though the name be blank, it is to you I give it.\u201d \u201cI shall never forget it,\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan."], "How does Milady attempt to kill D\u2019Artagnan before the siege of La Rochelle?": [" To a look of interrogation which they made, Milady replied by a sign that it was he. Then, certain that there could be no mistake in the execution of her orders, she started her horse and disappeared. The two men followed the company, and on leaving the Faubourg St. Antoine, mounted two horses properly equipped, which a servant without livery had waiting for them. 41 THE SEIGE OF LA ROCHELLE The Siege of La Rochelle was one of the great political events of the reign of Louis XIII, and one of the great military enterprises of the cardinal. It is, then, interesting and even necessary that we should say a few words about it, particularly as many details of this siege are connected in too important a manner with the story we have undertaken to relate to allow us to pass it over in silence. The political plans of the cardinal when he undertook this siege were extensive. Let us unfold them first, and then pass on to the private plans which perhaps had not less influence upon his Eminence than the others. Of the important cities given up by Henry IV to the Huguenots as places of safety, there only remained La Rochelle. It became necessary, therefore, to destroy this last bulwark of Calvinism--a dangerous leaven with which the ferments of civil revolt and foreign war were constantly mingling. Spaniards, Englishmen, and Italian malcontents, adventurers of all nations, and soldiers of fortune of every sect, flocked at the first summons under the standard of the Protestants, and organized themselves like a vast association, whose branches diverged freely over all parts of Europe.", " D\u2019Artagnan explained the sword wound of his companion by a sortie which he improvised. He described the death of the other soldier, and the perils they had encountered. This recital was for him the occasion of veritable triumph. The whole army talked of this expedition for a day, and Monsieur paid him his compliments upon it. Besides this, as every great action bears its recompense with it, the brave exploit of d\u2019Artagnan resulted in the restoration of the tranquility he had lost. In fact, d\u2019Artagnan believed that he might be tranquil, as one of his two enemies was killed and the other devoted to his interests. This tranquillity proved one thing--that d\u2019Artagnan did not yet know Milady. 42 THE ANJOU WINE After the most disheartening news of the king\u2019s health, a report of his convalescence began to prevail in the camp; and as he was very anxious to be in person at the siege, it was said that as soon as he could mount a horse he would set forward. Meantime, Monsieur, who knew that from one day to the other he might expect to be removed from his command by the Duc d\u2019Angouleme, by Bassompierre, or by Schomberg, who were all eager for his post, did but little, lost his days in wavering, and did not dare to attempt any great enterprise to drive the English from the Isle of Re, where they still besieged the citadel St. Martin and the fort of La Pree, as on their side the French were besieging La Rochelle.", " La Rochelle, which had derived a new importance from the ruin of the other Calvinist cities, was, then, the focus of dissensions and ambition. Moreover, its port was the last in the kingdom of France open to the English, and by closing it against England, our eternal enemy, the cardinal completed the work of Joan of Arc and the Duc de Guise. Thus Bassompierre, who was at once Protestant and Catholic--Protestant by conviction and Catholic as commander of the order of the Holy Ghost; Bassompierre, who was a German by birth and a Frenchman at heart--in short, Bassompierre, who had a distinguished command at the siege of La Rochelle, said, in charging at the head of several other Protestant nobles like himself, \u201cYou will see, gentlemen, that we shall be fools enough to take La Rochelle.\u201d And Bassompierre was right. The cannonade of the Isle of Re presaged to him the dragonnades of the Cevennes; the taking of La Rochelle was the preface to the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. We have hinted that by the side of these views of the leveling and simplifying minister, which belong to history, the chronicler is forced to recognize the lesser motives of the amorous man and jealous rival. Richelieu, as everyone knows, had loved the queen. Was this love a simple political affair, or was it naturally one of those profound passions which Anne of Austria inspired in those who approached her? That we are not able to say; but at all events, we have seen, by the anterior developments of this story, that Buckingham had the advantage over him, and in two or three circumstances, particularly that of the diamond studs, had, thanks to the devotedness of the three Musketeers and the courage and conduct of d\u2019Artagnan, cruelly mystified him.", " de Sevigne. The Comte de Toiras retired into the citadel St. Martin with his garrison, and threw a hundred men into a little fort called the fort of La Pree. This event had hastened the resolutions of the cardinal; and till the king and he could take the command of the siege of La Rochelle, which was determined, he had sent Monsieur to direct the first operations, and had ordered all the troops he could dispose of to march toward the theater of war. It was of this detachment, sent as a vanguard, that our friend d\u2019Artagnan formed a part. The king, as we have said, was to follow as soon as his Bed of Justice had been held; but on rising from his Bed of Justice on the twenty-eighth of June, he felt himself attacked by fever. He was, notwithstanding, anxious to set out; but his illness becoming more serious, he was forced to stop at Villeroy. Now, whenever the king halted, the Musketeers halted. It followed that d\u2019Artagnan, who was as yet purely and simply in the Guards, found himself, for the time at least, separated from his good friends--Athos, Porthos, and Aramis. This separation, which was no more than an unpleasant circumstance, would have certainly become a cause of serious uneasiness if he had been able to guess by what unknown dangers he was surrounded. He, however, arrived without accident in the camp established before La Rochelle, on the tenth of the month of September of the year 1627."], "What does Athos steal from Milady after confronting her about her attempts to kill D\u2019Artagnan?": [" \u201cLet us see,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cAre you SURE that the OTHER is dead?\u201d \u201cTHE OTHER?\u201d said Athos, in so stifled a voice that d\u2019Artagnan scarcely heard him. \u201cYes, she of whom you told me one day at Amiens.\u201d Athos uttered a groan, and let his head sink on his hands. \u201cThis is a woman of twenty-six or twenty-eight years.\u201d \u201cFair,\u201d said Athos, \u201cis she not?\u201d \u201cVery.\u201d \u201cBlue and clear eyes, of a strange brilliancy, with black eyelids and eyebrows?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cTall, well-made? She has lost a tooth, next to the eyetooth on the left?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cThe FLEUR-DE-LIS is small, rosy in color, and looks as if efforts had been made to efface it by the application of poultices?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cBut you say she is English?\u201d \u201cShe is called Milady, but she may be French. Lord de Winter is only her brother-in-law.\u201d \u201cI will see her, d\u2019Artagnan!\u201d \u201cBeware, Athos, beware. You tried to kill her; she is a woman to return you the like, and not to fail.\u201d \u201cShe will not dare to say anything; that would be to denounce herself.\u201d \u201cShe is capable of anything or everything. Did you ever see her furious?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d said Athos. \u201cA tigress, a panther! Ah, my dear Athos, I am greatly afraid I have drawn a terrible vengeance on both of us!\u201d D\u2019Artagnan then related all--the mad passion of Milady and her menaces of death. \u201cYou are right; and upon my soul, I would give my life for a hair,\u201d said Athos. \u201cFortunately, the day after tomorrow we leave Paris.", " According to the laws of dueling at that period, d\u2019Artagnan was at liberty to assist whom he pleased. While he was endeavoring to find out which of his companions stood in greatest need, he caught a glance from Athos. The glance was of sublime eloquence. Athos would have died rather than appeal for help; but he could look, and with that look ask assistance. D\u2019Artagnan interpreted it; with a terrible bound he sprang to the side of Cahusac, crying, \u201cTo me, Monsieur Guardsman; I will slay you!\u201d Cahusac turned. It was time; for Athos, whose great courage alone supported him, sank upon his knee. \u201cS\u2019blood!\u201d cried he to d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cdo not kill him, young man, I beg of you. I have an old affair to settle with him when I am cured and sound again. Disarm him only--make sure of his sword. That\u2019s it! Very well done!\u201d The exclamation was drawn from Athos by seeing the sword of Cahusac fly twenty paces from him. D\u2019Artagnan and Cahusac sprang forward at the same instant, the one to recover, the other to obtain, the sword; but d\u2019Artagnan, being the more active, reached it first and placed his foot upon it. Cahusac immediately ran to the Guardsman whom Aramis had killed, seized his rapier, and returned toward d\u2019Artagnan; but on his way he met Athos, who during his relief which d\u2019Artagnan had procured him had recovered his breath, and who, for fear that d\u2019Artagnan would kill his enemy, wished to resume the fight.", " \u201cAnd now to table,\u201d said Athos. The four friends seated themselves on the ground with their legs crossed like Turks, or even tailors. \u201cAnd now,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cas there is no longer any fear of being overheard, I hope you are going to let me into your secret.\u201d \u201cI hope at the same time to procure you amusement and glory, gentlemen,\u201d said Athos. \u201cI have induced you to take a charming promenade; here is a delicious breakfast; and yonder are five hundred persons, as you may see through the loopholes, taking us for heroes or madmen--two classes of imbeciles greatly resembling each other.\u201d \u201cBut the secret!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cThe secret is,\u201d said Athos, \u201cthat I saw Milady last night.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan was lifting a glass to his lips; but at the name of Milady, his hand trembled so, that he was obliged to put the glass on the ground again for fear of spilling the contents.\u201d \u201cYou saw your wi--\u201d \u201cHush!\u201d interrupted Athos. \u201cYou forget, my dear, you forget that these gentlemen are not initiated into my family affairs like yourself. I have seen Milady.\u201d \u201cWhere?\u201d demanded d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cWithin two leagues of this place, at the inn of the Red Dovecot.\u201d \u201cIn that case I am lost,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cNot so bad yet,\u201d replied Athos; \u201cfor by this time she must have quit the shores of France.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan breathed again. \u201cBut after all,\u201d asked Porthos, \u201cwho is Milady?\u201d \u201cA charming woman!\u201d said Athos, sipping a glass of sparkling wine.", " Milady recoiled, uttering a cry. D\u2019Artagnan, believing she might have means of flight and fearing she should escape, drew a pistol from his belt; but Athos raised his hand. \u201cPut back that weapon, d\u2019Artagnan!\u201d said he; \u201cthis woman must be tried, not assassinated. Wait an instant, my friend, and you shall be satisfied. Come in, gentlemen.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan obeyed; for Athos had the solemn voice and the powerful gesture of a judge sent by the Lord himself. Behind d\u2019Artagnan entered Porthos, Aramis, Lord de Winter, and the man in the red cloak. The four lackeys guarded the door and the window. Milady had sunk into a chair, with her hands extended, as if to conjure this terrible apparition. Perceiving her brother-in-law, she uttered a terrible cry. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d screamed Milady. \u201cWe want,\u201d said Athos, \u201cCharlotte Backson, who first was called Comtesse de la Fere, and afterwards Milady de Winter, Baroness of Sheffield.\u201d \u201cThat is I! that is I!\u201d murmured Milady, in extreme terror; \u201cwhat do you want?\u201d \u201cWe wish to judge you according to your crime,\u201d said Athos; \u201cyou shall be free to defend yourself. Justify yourself if you can. M. d\u2019Artagnan, it is for you to accuse her first.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan advanced. \u201cBefore God and before men,\u201d said he, \u201cI accuse this woman of having poisoned Constance Bonacieux, who died yesterday evening.\u201d He turned towards Porthos and Aramis. \u201cWe bear witness to this,\u201d said the two Musketeers, with one voice."], "How long does Athos bet that he and his friends can hold the Saint Gervais Fort alone?": [" We lost five men, and the Rochellais eight or ten.\u201d \u201cBalzempleu!\u201d said the Swiss, who, notwithstanding the admirable collection of oaths possessed by the German language, had acquired a habit of swearing in French. \u201cBut it is probable,\u201d said the light-horseman, \u201cthat they will send pioneers this morning to repair the bastion.\u201d \u201cYes, that\u2019s probable,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cGentlemen,\u201d said Athos, \u201ca wager!\u201d \u201cAh, wooi, a vager!\u201d cried the Swiss. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d said the light-horseman. \u201cStop a bit,\u201d said the dragoon, placing his saber like a spit upon the two large iron dogs which held the firebrands in the chimney, \u201cstop a bit, I am in it. You cursed host! a dripping pan immediately, that I may not lose a drop of the fat of this estimable bird.\u201d \u201cYou was right,\u201d said the Swiss; \u201cgoose grease is kood with basdry.\u201d \u201cThere!\u201d said the dragoon. \u201cNow for the wager! We listen, Monsieur Athos.\u201d \u201cYes, the wager!\u201d said the light-horseman. \u201cWell, Monsieur de Busigny, I will bet you,\u201d said Athos, \u201cthat my three companions, Messieurs Porthos, Aramis, and d\u2019Artagnan, and myself, will go and breakfast in the bastion St. Gervais, and we will remain there an hour, by the watch, whatever the enemy may do to dislodge us.\u201d Porthos and Aramis looked at each other; they began to comprehend. \u201cBut,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, in the ear of Athos, \u201cyou are going to get us all killed without mercy.\u201d \u201cWe are much more likely to be killed,\u201d said Athos, \u201cif we do not go.\u201d \u201cMy faith, gentlemen,\u201d said Porthos, turning round upon his chair and twisting his mustache, \u201cthat\u2019s a fair bet, I hope.\u201d \u201cI take it,\u201d said M. de Busigny; \u201cso let us fix the stake.\u201d \u201cYou are four gentlemen,\u201d said Athos, \u201cand we are four; an unlimited dinner for eight.", " In consequence, after having traveled all night, at seven o\u2019clock she was at the fort of the Point; at eight o\u2019clock she had embarked; and at nine, the vessel, which with letters of marque from the cardinal was supposed to be sailing for Bayonne, raised anchor, and steered its course toward England. 46 THE BASTION SAINT-GERVAIS On arriving at the lodgings of his three friends, d\u2019Artagnan found them assembled in the same chamber. Athos was meditating; Porthos was twisting his mustache; Aramis was saying his prayers in a charming little Book of Hours, bound in blue velvet. \u201cPardieu, gentlemen,\u201d said he. \u201cI hope what you have to tell me is worth the trouble, or else, I warn you, I will not pardon you for making me come here instead of getting a little rest after a night spent in taking and dismantling a bastion. Ah, why were you not there, gentlemen? It was warm work.\u201d \u201cWe were in a place where it was not very cold,\u201d replied Porthos, giving his mustache a twist which was peculiar to him. \u201cHush!\u201d said Athos. \u201cOh, oh!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, comprehending the slight frown of the Musketeer. \u201cIt appears there is something fresh aboard.\u201d \u201cAramis,\u201d said Athos, \u201cyou went to breakfast the day before yesterday at the inn of the Parpaillot, I believe?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cHow did you fare?\u201d \u201cFor my part, I ate but little. The day before yesterday was a fish day, and they had nothing but meat.\u201d \u201cWhat,\u201d said Athos, \u201cno fish at a seaport?\u201d \u201cThey say,\u201d said Aramis, resuming his pious reading, \u201cthat the dyke which the cardinal is making drives them all out into the open sea.\u201d \u201cBut that is not quite what I mean to ask you, Aramis,\u201d replied Athos.", " \u201cListen, Milady,\u201d said the cardinal, \u201cthe affair is important.

It was evident that the cardinal was weighing beforehand the terms in which he was about to speak, and that Milady was collecting all her intellectual faculties to comprehend the things he was about to say, and to engrave them in her memory when they should be spoken. Athos took advantage of this moment to tell his two companions to fasten the door inside, and to make them a sign to come and listen with him.", " Bonacieux, who saw she was regaining some little influence over her husband. \u201cYou meddle with politics, do you--and still more, with cardinalist politics?

Athos took advantage of this moment to tell his two companions to fasten the door inside, and to make them a sign to come and listen with him.", " In consequence, after having traveled all night, at seven o\u2019clock she was at the fort of the Point; at eight o\u2019clock she had embarked; and at nine, the vessel, which with letters of marque from the cardinal was supposed to be sailing for Bayonne, raised anchor, and steered its course toward England. 46 THE BASTION SAINT-GERVAIS On arriving at the lodgings of his three friends, d\u2019Artagnan found them assembled in the same chamber. Athos was meditating; Porthos was twisting his mustache; Aramis was saying his prayers in a charming little Book of Hours, bound in blue velvet. \u201cPardieu, gentlemen,\u201d said he. \u201cI hope what you have to tell me is worth the trouble, or else, I warn you, I will not pardon you for making me come here instead of getting a little rest after a night spent in taking and dismantling a bastion. Ah, why were you not there, gentlemen? It was warm work.\u201d \u201cWe were in a place where it was not very cold,\u201d replied Porthos, giving his mustache a twist which was peculiar to him. \u201cHush!\u201d said Athos. \u201cOh, oh!\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, comprehending the slight frown of the Musketeer. \u201cIt appears there is something fresh aboard.\u201d \u201cAramis,\u201d said Athos, \u201cyou went to breakfast the day before yesterday at the inn of the Parpaillot, I believe?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cHow did you fare?\u201d \u201cFor my part, I ate but little. The day before yesterday was a fish day, and they had nothing but meat.\u201d \u201cWhat,\u201d said Athos, \u201cno fish at a seaport?\u201d \u201cThey say,\u201d said Aramis, resuming his pious reading, \u201cthat the dyke which the cardinal is making drives them all out into the open sea.\u201d \u201cBut that is not quite what I mean to ask you, Aramis,\u201d replied Athos.", " The brigadier and two pioneers fell dead; the rest of the troop took to flight. \u201cNow, gentlemen, a sortie!\u201d cried Athos. And the four friends rushed out of the fort, gained the field of battle, picked up the four muskets of the privates and the half-pike of the brigadier, and convinced that the fugitives would not stop till they reached the city, turned again toward the bastion, bearing with them the trophies of their victory. \u201cReload the muskets, Grimaud,\u201d said Athos, \u201cand we, gentlemen, will go on with our breakfast, and resume our conversation. Where were we?\u201d \u201cI recollect you were saying,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cthat after having demanded my head of the cardinal, Milady had quit the shores of France. Whither goes she?\u201d added he, strongly interested in the route Milady followed. \u201cShe goes into England,\u201d said Athos. \u201cWith what view?\u201d \u201cWith the view of assassinating, or causing to be assassinated, the Duke of Buckingham.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan uttered an exclamation of surprise and indignation. \u201cBut this is infamous!\u201d cried he. \u201cAs to that,\u201d said Athos, \u201cI beg you to believe that I care very little about it. Now you have done, Grimaud, take our brigadier\u2019s half-pike, tie a napkin to it, and plant it on top of our bastion, that these rebels of Rochellais may see that they have to deal with brave and loyal soldiers of the king.\u201d Grimaud obeyed without replying. An instant afterward, the white flag was floating over the heads of the four friends.", " Bazin set out the next day for Tours, and was allowed eight days for performing his commission. The four friends, during the period of these two absences, had, as may well be supposed, the eye on the watch, the nose to the wind, and the ear on the hark. Their days were passed in endeavoring to catch all that was said, in observing the proceeding of the cardinal, and in looking out for all the couriers who arrived. More than once an involuntary trembling seized them when called upon for some unexpected service. They had, besides, to look constantly to their own proper safety; Milady was a phantom which, when it had once appeared to people, did not allow them to sleep very quietly. On the morning of the eighth day, Bazin, fresh as ever, and smiling, according to custom, entered the cabaret of the Parpaillot as the four friends were sitting down to breakfast, saying, as had been agreed upon: \u201cMonsieur Aramis, the answer from your cousin.\u201d The four friends exchanged a joyful glance; half of the work was done. It is true, however, that it was the shorter and easier part. Aramis, blushing in spite of himself, took the letter, which was in a large, coarse hand and not particular for its orthography. \u201cGood God!\u201d cried he, laughing, \u201cI quite despair of my poor Michon; she will never write like Monsieur de Voiture.\u201d \u201cWhat does you mean by boor Michon?\u201d said the Swiss, who was chatting with the four friends when the letter came."], "After hearing of the Saint Gervais Fort adventure, what does the Cardinal authorize Monsieur de Treville to do with D\u2019Artagnan?": [" \u201cAnd the Guardsman?\u201d \u201cd\u2019Artagnan.\u201d \u201cStill my young scapegrace. Positively, these four men must be on my side.\u201d The same evening the cardinal spoke to M. de Treville of the exploit of the morning, which was the talk of the whole camp. M. de Treville, who had received the account of the adventure from the mouths of the heroes of it, related it in all its details to his Eminence, not forgetting the episode of the napkin. \u201cThat\u2019s well, Monsieur de Treville,\u201d said the cardinal; \u201cpray let that napkin be sent to me. I will have three fleur-de-lis embroidered on it in gold, and will give it to your company as a standard.\u201d \u201cMonseigneur,\u201d said M. de Treville, \u201cthat will be unjust to the Guardsmen. Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan is not with me; he serves under Monsieur Dessessart.\u201d \u201cWell, then, take him,\u201d said the cardinal; \u201cwhen four men are so much attached to one another, it is only fair that they should serve in the same company.\u201d That same evening M. de Treville announced this good news to the three Musketeers and d\u2019Artagnan, inviting all four to breakfast with him next morning. D\u2019Artagnan was beside himself with joy. We know that the dream of his life had been to become a Musketeer. The three friends were likewise greatly delighted. \u201cMy faith,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan to Athos, \u201cyou had a triumphant idea! As you said, we have acquired glory, and were enabled to carry on a conversation of the highest importance.\u201d \u201cWhich we can resume now without anybody suspecting us, for, with the help of God, we shall henceforth pass for cardinalists.\u201d That evening d\u2019Artagnan went to present his respects to M. Dessessart, and inform him of his promotion.", " And yet, in all this, the cardinal had not yet said a word about the Duke of Buckingham. At this instant M. de Treville entered, cool, polite, and in irreproachable costume. Informed of what had passed by the presence of the cardinal and the alteration in the king\u2019s countenance, M. de Treville felt himself something like Samson before the Philistines. Louis XIII had already placed his hand on the knob of the door; at the noise of M. de Treville\u2019s entrance he turned round. \u201cYou arrive in good time, monsieur,\u201d said the king, who, when his passions were raised to a certain point, could not dissemble; \u201cI have learned some fine things concerning your Musketeers.\u201d \u201cAnd I,\u201d said Treville, coldly, \u201cI have some pretty things to tell your Majesty concerning these gownsmen.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d said the king, with hauteur. \u201cI have the honor to inform your Majesty,\u201d continued M. de Treville, in the same tone, \u201cthat a party of PROCUREURS, commissaries, and men of the police--very estimable people, but very inveterate, as it appears, against the uniform--have taken upon themselves to arrest in a house, to lead away through the open street, and throw into Fort l\u2019Eveque, all upon an order which they have refused to show me, one of my, or rather your Musketeers, sire, of irreproachable conduct, of an almost illustrious reputation, and whom your Majesty knows favorably, Monsieur Athos.\u201d \u201cAthos,\u201d said the king, mechanically; \u201cyes, certainly I know that name.\u201d \u201cLet your Majesty remember,\u201d said Treville, \u201cthat Monsieur Athos is the Musketeer who, in the annoying duel which you are acquainted with, had the misfortune to wound Monsieur de Cahusac so seriously.", " All the events we have described had taken place within a half hour. Everything fell out as Mme. Bonacieux prophesied. On hearing the password, Germain bowed. In a few minutes, Laporte was at the lodge; in two words d\u2019Artagnan informed him where Mme. Bonacieux was. Laporte assured himself, by having it twice repeated, of the accurate address, and set off at a run. Hardly, however, had he taken ten steps before he returned. \u201cYoung man,\u201d said he to d\u2019Artagnan, \u201ca suggestion.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cYou may get into trouble by what has taken place.\u201d \u201cYou believe so?\u201d \u201cYes. Have you any friend whose clock is too slow?\u201d \u201cWell?\u201d \u201cGo and call upon him, in order that he may give evidence of your having been with him at half past nine. In a court of justice that is called an alibi.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan found his advice prudent. He took to his heels, and was soon at M. de Treville\u2019s; but instead of going into the saloon with the rest of the crowd, he asked to be introduced to M. de Treville\u2019s office. As d\u2019Artagnan so constantly frequented the hotel, no difficulty was made in complying with his request, and a servant went to inform M. de Treville that his young compatriot, having something important to communicate, solicited a private audience. Five minutes after, M. de Treville was asking d\u2019Artagnan what he could do to serve him, and what caused his visit at so late an hour. \u201cPardon me, monsieur,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, who had profited by the moment he had been left alone to put back M. de Treville\u2019s clock three-quarters of an hour, \u201cbut I thought, as it was yet only twenty-five minutes past nine, it was not too late to wait upon you.\u201d \u201cTwenty-five minutes past nine!\u201d cried M. de Treville, looking at the clock; \u201cwhy, that\u2019s impossible!\u201d \u201cLook, rather, monsieur,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cthe clock shows it.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d said M. de Treville; \u201cI believed it later.", " As he was about to leave the presence, the cardinal gave him a friendly smile, and said, \u201cA perfect harmony reigns, sire, between the leaders and the soldiers of your Musketeers, which must be profitable for the service and honorable to all.\u201d \u201cHe will play me some dog\u2019s trick or other, and that immediately,\u201d said Treville. \u201cOne has never the last word with such a man. But let us be quick--the king may change his mind in an hour; and at all events it is more difficult to replace a man in the Fort l\u2019Eveque or the Bastille who has got out, than to keep a prisoner there who is in.\u201d M de Treville made his entrance triumphantly into the Fort l\u2019Eveque, whence he delivered the Musketeer, whose peaceful indifference had not for a moment abandoned him. The first time he saw d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cYou have come off well,\u201d said he to him; \u201cthere is your Jussac thrust paid for. There still remains that of Bernajoux, but you must not be too confident.\u201d As to the rest, M. de Treville had good reason to mistrust the cardinal and to think that all was not over, for scarcely had the captain of the Musketeers closed the door after him, than his Eminence said to the king, \u201cNow that we are at length by ourselves, we will, if your Majesty pleases, converse seriously. Sire, Buckingham has been in Paris five days, and only left this morning.\u201d 16 IN WHICH M. SEGUIER, KEEPER OF THE SEALS, LOOKS MORE THAN ONCE FOR THE BELL It is impossible to form an idea of the impression these few words made upon Louis XIII."], "What does Milady have two weeks to do before Lord de Winter banishes her to a faraway island?": [" My affianced husband returned. \u201c\u2018Hear me,\u2019 said he; \u2018this man has gone, and for the moment has consequently escaped my vengeance; but let us be united, as we were to have been, and then leave it to Lord de Winter to maintain his own honor and that of his wife.\u2019\u201d \u201cLord de Winter!\u201d cried Felton. \u201cYes,\u201d said Milady, \u201cLord de Winter; and now you can understand it all, can you not? Buckingham remained nearly a year absent. A week before his return Lord de Winter died, leaving me his sole heir. Whence came the blow? God who knows all, knows without doubt; but as for me, I accuse nobody.\u201d \u201cOh, what an abyss; what an abyss!\u201d cried Felton. \u201cLord de Winter died without revealing anything to his brother. The terrible secret was to be concealed till it burst, like a clap of thunder, over the head of the guilty. Your protector had seen with pain this marriage of his elder brother with a portionless girl. I was sensible that I could look for no support from a man disappointed in his hopes of an inheritance. I went to France, with a determination to remain there for the rest of my life. But all my fortune is in England. Communication being closed by the war, I was in want of everything. I was then obliged to come back again. Six days ago, I landed at Portsmouth.\u201d \u201cWell?\u201d said Felton. \u201cWell; Buckingham heard by some means, no doubt, of my return. He spoke of me to Lord de Winter, already prejudiced against me, and told him that his sister-in-law was a prostitute, a branded woman.", " Those lips were magnificent; they might be said to be of coral. The conversation took a cheerful turn. Milady appeared to have entirely recovered. She told d\u2019Artagnan that Lord de Winter was her brother-in-law, and not her brother. She had married a younger brother of the family, who had left her a widow with one child. This child was the only heir to Lord de Winter, if Lord de Winter did not marry. All this showed d\u2019Artagnan that there was a veil which concealed something; but he could not yet see under this veil. In addition to this, after a half hour\u2019s conversation d\u2019Artagnan was convinced that Milady was his compatriot; she spoke French with an elegance and a purity that left no doubt on that head. D\u2019Artagnan was profuse in gallant speeches and protestations of devotion. To all the simple things which escaped our Gascon, Milady replied with a smile of kindness. The hour came for him to retire. D\u2019Artagnan took leave of Milady, and left the saloon the happiest of men. On the staircase he met the pretty SOUBRETTE, who brushed gently against him as she passed, and then, blushing to the eyes, asked his pardon for having touched him in a voice so sweet that the pardon was granted instantly. D\u2019Artagnan came again on the morrow, and was still better received than on the evening before. Lord de Winter was not at home; and it was Milady who this time did all the honors of the evening.", " \u201cAh, to see me?\u201d said de Winter, cunningly. \u201cTo be sure, to see you. What is there astonishing in that?\u201d \u201cAnd you had no other object in coming to England but to see me?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cSo it was for me alone you have taken the trouble to cross the Channel?\u201d \u201cFor you alone.\u201d \u201cThe deuce! What tenderness, my sister!\u201d \u201cBut am I not your nearest relative?\u201d demanded Milady, with a tone of the most touching ingenuousness. \u201cAnd my only heir, are you not?\u201d said Lord de Winter in his turn, fixing his eyes on those of Milady. Whatever command she had over herself, Milady could not help starting; and as in pronouncing the last words Lord de Winter placed his hand upon the arm of his sister, this start did not escape him. In fact, the blow was direct and severe. The first idea that occurred to Milady\u2019s mind was that she had been betrayed by Kitty, and that she had recounted to the baron the selfish aversion toward himself of which she had imprudently allowed some marks to escape before her servant. She also recollected the furious and imprudent attack she had made upon d\u2019Artagnan when he spared the life of her brother. \u201cI do not understand, my Lord,\u201d said she, in order to gain time and make her adversary speak out. \u201cWhat do you mean to say? Is there any secret meaning concealed beneath your words?\u201d \u201cOh, my God, no!\u201d said Lord de Winter, with apparent good nature. \u201cYou wish to see me, and you come to England.", " He paused, exchanged two words with the sentinel; then the door opened, and he appeared. During the exchange of these two words Felton drew back quickly, and when Lord de Winter entered, he was several paces from the prisoner. The baron entered slowly, sending a scrutinizing glance from Milady to the young officer. \u201cYou have been here a very long time, John,\u201d said he. \u201cHas this woman been relating her crimes to you? In that case I can comprehend the length of the conversation.\u201d Felton started; and Milady felt she was lost if she did not come to the assistance of the disconcerted Puritan. \u201cAh, you fear your prisoner should escape!\u201d said she. \u201cWell, ask your worthy jailer what favor I this instant solicited of him.\u201d \u201cYou demanded a favor?\u201d said the baron, suspiciously. \u201cYes, my Lord,\u201d replied the young man, confused. \u201cAnd what favor, pray?\u201d asked Lord de Winter. \u201cA knife, which she would return to me through the grating of the door a minute after she had received it,\u201d replied Felton. \u201cThere is someone, then, concealed here whose throat this amiable lady is desirous of cutting,\u201d said de Winter, in an ironical, contemptuous tone. \u201cThere is myself,\u201d replied Milady. \u201cI have given you the choice between America and Tyburn,\u201d replied Lord de Winter. \u201cChoose Tyburn, madame. Believe me, the cord is more certain than the knife.\u201d Felton grew pale, and made a step forward, remembering that at the moment he entered Milady had a rope in her hand."], "What is the Cardinal\u2019s aim in throwing fliers over the walls of La Rochelle?": [" La Rochelle, which had derived a new importance from the ruin of the other Calvinist cities, was, then, the focus of dissensions and ambition. Moreover, its port was the last in the kingdom of France open to the English, and by closing it against England, our eternal enemy, the cardinal completed the work of Joan of Arc and the Duc de Guise. Thus Bassompierre, who was at once Protestant and Catholic--Protestant by conviction and Catholic as commander of the order of the Holy Ghost; Bassompierre, who was a German by birth and a Frenchman at heart--in short, Bassompierre, who had a distinguished command at the siege of La Rochelle, said, in charging at the head of several other Protestant nobles like himself, \u201cYou will see, gentlemen, that we shall be fools enough to take La Rochelle.\u201d And Bassompierre was right. The cannonade of the Isle of Re presaged to him the dragonnades of the Cevennes; the taking of La Rochelle was the preface to the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. We have hinted that by the side of these views of the leveling and simplifying minister, which belong to history, the chronicler is forced to recognize the lesser motives of the amorous man and jealous rival. Richelieu, as everyone knows, had loved the queen. Was this love a simple political affair, or was it naturally one of those profound passions which Anne of Austria inspired in those who approached her? That we are not able to say; but at all events, we have seen, by the anterior developments of this story, that Buckingham had the advantage over him, and in two or three circumstances, particularly that of the diamond studs, had, thanks to the devotedness of the three Musketeers and the courage and conduct of d\u2019Artagnan, cruelly mystified him.", " Nevertheless, time passed on, and the Rochellais did not surrender. The last spy that was taken was the bearer of a letter. This letter told Buckingham that the city was at an extremity; but instead of adding, \u201cIf your succor does not arrive within fifteen days, we will surrender,\u201d it added, quite simply, \u201cIf your succor comes not within fifteen days, we shall all be dead with hunger when it comes.\u201d The Rochellais, then, had no hope but in Buckingham. Buckingham was their Messiah. It was evident that if they one day learned positively that they must not count on Buckingham, their courage would fail with their hope. The cardinal looked, then, with great impatience for the news from England which would announce to him that Buckingham would not come. The question of carrying the city by assault, though often debated in the council of the king, had been always rejected. In the first place, La Rochelle appeared impregnable. Then the cardinal, whatever he said, very well knew that the horror of bloodshed in this encounter, in which Frenchman would combat against Frenchman, was a retrograde movement of sixty years impressed upon his policy; and the cardinal was at that period what we now call a man of progress. In fact, the sack of La Rochelle, and the assassination of three of four thousand Huguenots who allowed themselves to be killed, would resemble too closely, in 1628, the massacre of St. Bartholomew in 1572; and then, above all this, this extreme measure, which was not at all repugnant to the king, good Catholic as he was, always fell before this argument of the besieging generals--La Rochelle is impregnable except to famine.", " These leaders had corn in abundance, and would not let them partake of it; they adopted as a maxim--for they, too, had maxims--that it was of very little consequence that women, children, and old men should die, so long as the men who were to defend the walls remained strong and healthy. Up to that time, whether from devotedness or from want of power to act against it, this maxim, without being generally adopted, nevertheless passed from theory into practice; but the notes did it injury. The notes reminded the men that the children, women, and old men whom they allowed to die were their sons, their wives, and their fathers, and that it would be more just for everyone to be reduced to the common misery, in order that equal conditions should give birth to unanimous resolutions. These notes had all the effect that he who wrote them could expect, in that they induced a great number of the inhabitants to open private negotiations with the royal army. But at the moment when the cardinal saw his means already bearing fruit, and applauded himself for having put it in action, an inhabitant of La Rochelle who had contrived to pass the royal lines--God knows how, such was the watchfulness of Bassompierre, Schomberg, and the Duc d\u2019Angouleme, themselves watched over by the cardinal--an inhabitant of La Rochelle, we say, entered the city, coming from Portsmouth, and saying that he had seen a magnificent fleet ready to sail within eight days.", " To a look of interrogation which they made, Milady replied by a sign that it was he. Then, certain that there could be no mistake in the execution of her orders, she started her horse and disappeared. The two men followed the company, and on leaving the Faubourg St. Antoine, mounted two horses properly equipped, which a servant without livery had waiting for them. 41 THE SEIGE OF LA ROCHELLE The Siege of La Rochelle was one of the great political events of the reign of Louis XIII, and one of the great military enterprises of the cardinal. It is, then, interesting and even necessary that we should say a few words about it, particularly as many details of this siege are connected in too important a manner with the story we have undertaken to relate to allow us to pass it over in silence. The political plans of the cardinal when he undertook this siege were extensive. Let us unfold them first, and then pass on to the private plans which perhaps had not less influence upon his Eminence than the others. Of the important cities given up by Henry IV to the Huguenots as places of safety, there only remained La Rochelle. It became necessary, therefore, to destroy this last bulwark of Calvinism--a dangerous leaven with which the ferments of civil revolt and foreign war were constantly mingling. Spaniards, Englishmen, and Italian malcontents, adventurers of all nations, and soldiers of fortune of every sect, flocked at the first summons under the standard of the Protestants, and organized themselves like a vast association, whose branches diverged freely over all parts of Europe."], "What do the musketeers refuse to do for the Cardinal when he encounters them on the beach?": [" Athos bowed. \u201cAnd now, gentlemen, that\u2019s well,\u201d continued the cardinal. \u201cI know what I wish to know; follow me.\u201d The three Musketeers passed behind his Eminence, who again enveloped his face in his cloak, and put his horse in motion, keeping from eight to ten paces in advance of his four companions. They soon arrived at the silent, solitary inn. No doubt the host knew what illustrious visitor was expected, and had consequently sent intruders out of the way. Ten paces from the door the cardinal made a sign to his esquire and the three Musketeers to halt. A saddled horse was fastened to the window shutter. The cardinal knocked three times, and in a peculiar manner. A man, enveloped in a cloak, came out immediately, and exchanged some rapid words with the cardinal; after which he mounted his horse, and set off in the direction of Surgeres, which was likewise the way to Paris. \u201cAdvance, gentlemen,\u201d said the cardinal. \u201cYou have told me the truth, my gentlemen,\u201d said he, addressing the Musketeers, \u201cand it will not be my fault if our encounter this evening be not advantageous to you. In the meantime, follow me.\u201d The cardinal alighted; the three Musketeers did likewise. The cardinal threw the bridle of his horse to his esquire; the three Musketeers fastened the horses to the shutters. The host stood at the door. For him, the cardinal was only an officer coming to visit a lady. \u201cHave you any chamber on the ground floor where these gentlemen can wait near a good fire?\u201d said the cardinal.", " At ten paces from the hedge he recognized the talkative Gascon; and as he had already perceived that these men were Musketeers, he did not doubt that the three others were those called the Inseparables; that is to say, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis. It may be supposed that his desire to hear the conversation was augmented by this discovery. His eyes took a strange expression, and with the step of a tiger-cat he advanced toward the hedge; but he had not been able to catch more than a few vague syllables without any positive sense, when a sonorous and short cry made him start, and attracted the attention of the Musketeers. \u201cOfficer!\u201d cried Grimaud. \u201cYou are speaking, you scoundrel!\u201d said Athos, rising upon his elbow, and transfixing Grimaud with his flaming look. Grimaud therefore added nothing to his speech, but contented himself with pointing his index finger in the direction of the hedge, announcing by this gesture the cardinal and his escort. With a single bound the Musketeers were on their feet, and saluted with respect. The cardinal seemed furious. \u201cIt appears that Messieurs the Musketeers keep guard,\u201d said he. \u201cAre the English expected by land, or do the Musketeers consider themselves superior officers?\u201d \u201cMonseigneur,\u201d replied Athos, for amid the general fright he alone had preserved the noble calmness and coolness that never forsook him, \u201cMonseigneur, the Musketeers, when they are not on duty, or when their duty is over, drink and play at dice, and they are certainly superior officers to their lackeys.\u201d \u201cLackeys?\u201d grumbled the cardinal.", " \u201cHe told me that he should henceforth recruit his Musketeers from among the Guards of Monsieur the Cardinal.\u201d \u201cThe Guards of the cardinal! And why so?\u201d asked Porthos, warmly. \u201cBecause he plainly perceives that his piquette* stands in need of being enlivened by a mixture of good wine.\u201d _*A watered liquor, made from the second pressing of the grape._ The two Musketeers reddened to the whites of their eyes. D\u2019Artagnan did not know where he was, and wished himself a hundred feet underground. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d continued M. de Treville, growing warmer as he spoke, \u201cand his majesty was right; for, upon my honor, it is true that the Musketeers make but a miserable figure at court. The cardinal related yesterday while playing with the king, with an air of condolence very displeasing to me, that the day before yesterday those DAMNED MUSKETEERS, those DAREDEVILS--he dwelt upon those words with an ironical tone still more displeasing to me--those BRAGGARTS, added he, glancing at me with his tiger-cat\u2019s eye, had made a riot in the Rue Ferou in a cabaret, and that a party of his Guards (I thought he was going to laugh in my face) had been forced to arrest the rioters! MORBLEU! You must know something about it. Arrest Musketeers! You were among them--you were! Don\u2019t deny it; you were recognized, and the cardinal named you. But it\u2019s all my fault; yes, it\u2019s all my fault, because it is myself who selects my men.", " The English, repulsed foot by foot, beaten in all encounters, and defeated in the passage of the Isle of Loie, were obliged to re-embark, leaving on the field of battle two thousand men, among whom were five colonels, three lieutenant colonels, two hundred and fifty captains, twenty gentlemen of rank, four pieces of cannon, and sixty flags, which were taken to Paris by Claude de St. Simon, and suspended with great pomp in the arches of Notre Dame. Te Deums were chanted in camp, and afterward throughout France. The cardinal was left free to carry on the siege, without having, at least at the present, anything to fear on the part of the English. But it must be acknowledged, this response was but momentary. An envoy of the Duke of Buckingham, named Montague, was taken, and proof was obtained of a league between the German Empire, Spain, England, and Lorraine. This league was directed against France. Still further, in Buckingham\u2019s lodging, which he had been forced to abandon more precipitately than he expected, papers were found which confirmed this alliance and which, as the cardinal asserts in his memoirs, strongly compromised Mme. de Chevreuse and consequently the queen. It was upon the cardinal that all the responsibility fell, for one is not a despotic minister without responsibility. All, therefore, of the vast resources of his genius were at work night and day, engaged in listening to the least report heard in any of the great kingdoms of Europe."], "Where does Madame de Chevreuse reveal that Madame Bonacieux is being kept, in her letter to Aramis?": [" I have no hope of penetrating, sword in hand, to Paris, I know that well. But this war may bring round a peace; this peace will require a negotiator; that negotiator will be me. They will not dare to refuse me then; and I will return to Paris, and will see you again, and will be happy for an instant. Thousands of men, it is true, will have to pay for my happiness with their lives; but what is that to me, provided I see you again! All this is perhaps folly--perhaps insanity; but tell me what woman has a lover more truly in love; what queen a servant more ardent?\u201d \u201cMy Lord, my Lord, you invoke in your defense things which accuse you more strongly. All these proofs of love which you would give me are almost crimes.\u201d \u201cBecause you do not love me, madame! If you loved me, you would view all this otherwise. If you loved me, oh, if you loved me, that would be too great happiness, and I should run mad. Ah, Madame de Chevreuse was less cruel than you. Holland loved her, and she responded to his love.\u201d \u201cMadame de Chevreuse was not queen,\u201d murmured Anne of Austria, overcome, in spite of herself, by the expression of so profound a passion. \u201cYou would love me, then, if you were not queen! Madame, say that you would love me then! I can believe that it is the dignity of your rank alone which makes you cruel to me; I can believe that, had you been Madame de Chevreuse, poor Buckingham might have hoped.", " I know them from having heard one of their friends, Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan, say a great deal about them.\u201d \u201cYou know Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan!\u201d cried the novice, in her turn seizing the hands of Milady and devouring her with her eyes. Then remarking the strange expression of Milady\u2019s countenance, she said, \u201cPardon me, madame; you know him by what title?\u201d \u201cWhy,\u201d replied Milady, embarrassed, \u201cwhy, by the title of friend.\u201d \u201cYou deceive me, madame,\u201d said the novice; \u201cyou have been his mistress!\u201d \u201cIt is you who have been his mistress, madame!\u201d cried Milady, in her turn. \u201cI?\u201d said the novice. \u201cYes, you! I know you now. You are Madame Bonacieux!\u201d The young woman drew back, filled with surprise and terror. \u201cOh, do not deny it! Answer!\u201d continued Milady. \u201cWell, yes, madame,\u201d said the novice, \u201cAre we rivals?\u201d The countenance of Milady was illumined by so savage a joy that under any other circumstances Mme. Bonacieux would have fled in terror; but she was absorbed by jealousy. \u201cSpeak, madame!\u201d resumed Mme. Bonacieux, with an energy of which she might not have been believed capable. \u201cHave you been, or are you, his mistress?\u201d \u201cOh, no!\u201d cried Milady, with an accent that admitted no doubt of her truth. \u201cNever, never!\u201d \u201cI believe you,\u201d said Mme. Bonacieux; \u201cbut why, then, did you cry out so?\u201d \u201cDo you not understand?\u201d said Milady, who had already overcome her agitation and recovered all her presence of mind.", " I have written a letter today; that letter is not yet gone. The letter is here.\u201d And the queen laid her beautiful hand on her bosom. \u201cThen give me that letter, madame,\u201d said the chancellor. \u201cI will give it to none but the king, monsieur,\u201d said Anne. \u201cIf the king had desired that the letter should be given to him, madame, he would have demanded it of you himself. But I repeat to you, I am charged with reclaiming it; and if you do not give it up--\u201d \u201cWell?\u201d \u201cHe has, then, charged me to take it from you.\u201d \u201cHow! What do you say?\u201d \u201cThat my orders go far, madame; and that I am authorized to seek for the suspected paper, even on the person of your Majesty.\u201d \u201cWhat horror!\u201d cried the queen. \u201cBe kind enough, then, madame, to act more compliantly.\u201d \u201cThe conduct is infamously violent! Do you know that, monsieur?\u201d \u201cThe king commands it, madame; excuse me.\u201d \u201cI will not suffer it! No, no, I would rather die!\u201d cried the queen, in whom the imperious blood of Spain and Austria began to rise. The chancellor made a profound reverence. Then, with the intention quite patent of not drawing back a foot from the accomplishment of the commission with which he was charged, and as the attendant of an executioner might have done in the chamber of torture, he approached Anne of Austria, from whose eyes at the same instant sprang tears of rage. The queen was, as we have said, of great beauty. The commission might well be called delicate; and the king had reached, in his jealousy of Buckingham, the point of not being jealous of anyone else.", " Nevertheless, knowing the weakness of her husband, and more particularly his cupidity, she did not despair of bringing him round to her purpose. \u201cAh, you are a cardinalist, then, monsieur, are you?\u201d cried she; \u201cand you serve the party of those who maltreat your wife and insult your queen?\u201d \u201cPrivate interests are as nothing before the interests of all. I am for those who save the state,\u201d said Bonacieux, emphatically. \u201cAnd what do you know about the state you talk of?\u201d said Mme. Bonacieux, shrugging her shoulders. \u201cBe satisfied with being a plain, straightforward citizen, and turn to that side which offers the most advantages.\u201d \u201cEh, eh!\u201d said Bonacieux, slapping a plump, round bag, which returned a sound a money; \u201cwhat do you think of this, Madame Preacher?\u201d \u201cWhence comes that money?\u201d \u201cYou do not guess?\u201d \u201cFrom the cardinal?\u201d \u201cFrom him, and from my friend the Comte de Rochefort.\u201d \u201cThe Comte de Rochefort! Why, it was he who carried me off!\u201d \u201cThat may be, madame!\u201d \u201cAnd you receive silver from that man?\u201d \u201cHave you not said that that abduction was entirely political?\u201d \u201cYes; but that abduction had for its object the betrayal of my mistress, to draw from me by torture confessions that might compromise the honor, and perhaps the life, of my august mistress.\u201d \u201cMadame,\u201d replied Bonacieux, \u201cyour august mistress is a perfidious Spaniard, and what the cardinal does is well done.\u201d \u201cMonsieur,\u201d said the young woman, \u201cI know you to be cowardly, avaricious, and foolish, but I never till now believed you infamous!\u201d \u201cMadame,\u201d said Bonacieux, who had never seen his wife in a passion, and who recoiled before this conjugal anger, \u201cmadame, what do you say?\u201d \u201cI say you are a miserable creature!\u201d continued Mme."], "What does Milady pretend to be, in a bid to win the sympathies of her guard, John Felton?": [" She is young; she is beautiful; she possesses all earthly seductions. Well, she is a monster, who, at twenty-five years of age, has been guilty of as many crimes as you could read of in a year in the archives of our tribunals. Her voice prejudices her hearers in her favor; her beauty serves as a bait to her victims; her body even pays what she promises--I must do her that justice. She will try to seduce you, perhaps she will try to kill you. I have extricated you from misery, Felton; I have caused you to be named lieutenant; I once saved your life, you know on what occasion. I am for you not only a protector, but a friend; not only a benefactor, but a father. This woman has come back again into England for the purpose of conspiring against my life. I hold this serpent in my hands. Well, I call you, and say to you: Friend Felton, John, my child, guard me, and more particularly guard yourself, against this woman. Swear, by your hopes of salvation, to keep her safely for the chastisement she has merited. John Felton, I trust your word! John Felton, I put faith in your loyalty!\u201d \u201cMy Lord,\u201d said the young officer, summoning to his mild countenance all the hatred he could find in his heart, \u201cmy Lord, I swear all shall be done as you desire.\u201d Milady received this look like a resigned victim; it was impossible to imagine a more submissive or a more mild expression than that which prevailed on her beautiful countenance.", " \u201cAccomplish the orders of Lord de Winter,\u201d said Felton, with a gloomy smile. \u201cWhat orders?\u201d asked Milady. \u201cYou do not understand?\u201d asked Felton. \u201cNo; explain yourself, I beg.\u201d \u201cAs he mistrusted me, he determined to guard you himself, and sent me in his place to get Buckingham to sign the order for your transportation.\u201d \u201cBut if he mistrusted you, how could he confide such an order to you?\u201d \u201cHow could I know what I was the bearer of?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s true! And you are going to Portsmouth?\u201d \u201cI have no time to lose. Tomorrow is the twenty-third, and Buckingham sets sail tomorrow with his fleet.\u201d \u201cHe sets sail tomorrow! Where for?\u201d \u201cFor La Rochelle.\u201d \u201cHe need not sail!\u201d cried Milady, forgetting her usual presence of mind. \u201cBe satisfied,\u201d replied Felton; \u201che will not sail.\u201d Milady started with joy. She could read to the depths of the heart of this young man; the death of Buckingham was written there at full length. \u201cFelton,\u201d cried she, \u201cyou are as great as Judas Maccabeus! If you die, I will die with you; that is all I can say to you.\u201d \u201cSilence!\u201d cried Felton; \u201cwe are here.\u201d In fact, they touched the sloop. Felton mounted the ladder first, and gave his hand to Milady, while the sailors supported her, for the sea was still much agitated. An instant after they were on the deck. \u201cCaptain,\u201d said Felton, \u201cthis is the person of whom I spoke to you, and whom you must convey safe and sound to France.\u201d \u201cFor a thousand pistoles,\u201d said the captain.", " \u201cYou are right,\u201d said she, \u201cI have often thought of it.\u201d Then she added in a low voice, \u201cAnd I will think of it again.\u201d Felton felt a shudder run to the marrow of his bones; probably Lord de Winter perceived this emotion. \u201cMistrust yourself, John,\u201d said he. \u201cI have placed reliance upon you, my friend. Beware! I have warned you! But be of good courage, my lad; in three days we shall be delivered from this creature, and where I shall send her she can harm nobody.\u201d \u201cYou hear him!\u201d cried Milady, with vehemence, so that the baron might believe she was addressing heaven, and that Felton might understand she was addressing him. Felton lowered his head and reflected. The baron took the young officer by the arm, and turned his head over his shoulder, so as not to lose sight of Milady till he was gone out. \u201cWell,\u201d said the prisoner, when the door was shut, \u201cI am not so far advanced as I believed. De Winter has changed his usual stupidity into a strange prudence. It is the desire of vengeance, and how desire molds a man! As to Felton, he hesitates. Ah, he is not a man like that cursed d\u2019Artagnan. A Puritan only adores virgins, and he adores them by clasping his hands. A Musketeer loves women, and he loves them by clasping his arms round them.\u201d Milady waited, then, with much impatience, for she feared the day would pass away without her seeing Felton again. At last, in an hour after the scene we have just described, she heard someone speaking in a low voice at the door.", " \u201cNow,\u201d said he, \u201cwill you come?\u201d \u201cI am ready.\u201d Milady mounted upon a chair and passed the upper part of her body through the window. She saw the young officer suspended over the abyss by a ladder of ropes. For the first time an emotion of terror reminded her that she was a woman. The dark space frightened her. \u201cI expected this,\u201d said Felton. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, it\u2019s nothing!\u201d said Milady. \u201cI will descend with my eyes shut.\u201d \u201cHave you confidence in me?\u201d said Felton. \u201cYou ask that?\u201d \u201cPut your two hands together. Cross them; that\u2019s right!\u201d Felton tied her two wrists together with his handkerchief, and then with a cord over the handkerchief. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d asked Milady, with surprise. \u201cPass your arms around my neck, and fear nothing.\u201d \u201cBut I shall make you lose your balance, and we shall both be dashed to pieces.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. I am a sailor.\u201d Not a second was to be lost. Milady passed her two arms round Felton\u2019s neck, and let herself slip out of the window. Felton began to descend the ladder slowly, step by step. Despite the weight of two bodies, the blast of the hurricane shook them in the air. All at once Felton stopped. \u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d asked Milady. \u201cSilence,\u201d said Felton, \u201cI hear footsteps.\u201d \u201cWe are discovered!\u201d There was a silence of several seconds. \u201cNo,\u201d said Felton, \u201cit is nothing.\u201d \u201cBut what, then, is the noise?\u201d \u201cThat of the patrol going their rounds.\u201d \u201cWhere is their road?\u201d \u201cJust under us.\u201d \u201cThey will discover us!\u201d \u201cNo, if it does not lighten.\u201d \u201cBut they will run against the bottom of the ladder.\u201d \u201cFortunately it is too short by six feet.\u201d \u201cHere they are!"], "How does Milady prove herself to Felton and win his love?": [" LOVE! \u201cPardon for what?\u201d asked she. \u201cPardon me for having joined with your persecutors.\u201d Milady held out her hand to him. \u201cSo beautiful! so young!\u201d cried Felton, covering that hand with his kisses. Milady let one of those looks fall upon him which make a slave of a king. Felton was a Puritan; he abandoned the hand of this woman to kiss her feet. He no longer loved her; he adored her. When this crisis was past, when Milady appeared to have resumed her self-possession, which she had never lost; when Felton had seen her recover with the veil of chastity those treasures of love which were only concealed from him to make him desire them the more ardently, he said, \u201cAh, now! I have only one thing to ask of you; that is, the name of your true executioner. For to me there is but one; the other was an instrument, that was all.\u201d \u201cWhat, brother!\u201d cried Milady, \u201cmust I name him again? Have you not yet divined who he is?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d cried Felton, \u201che--again he--always he? What--the truly guilty?\u201d \u201cThe truly guilty,\u201d said Milady, \u201cis the ravager of England, the persecutor of true believers, the base ravisher of the honor of so many women--he who, to satisfy a caprice of his corrupt heart, is about to make England shed so much blood, who protects the Protestants today and will betray them tomorrow--\u201d \u201cBuckingham! It is, then, Buckingham!\u201d cried Felton, in a high state of excitement. Milady concealed her face in her hands, as if she could not endure the shame which this name recalled to her.", " \u201cNow,\u201d said he, \u201cwill you come?\u201d \u201cI am ready.\u201d Milady mounted upon a chair and passed the upper part of her body through the window.

Felton entered Milady\u2019s apartment. Milady arose. \u201cYou are here!\u201d said she. \u201cI promised to come,\u201d said Felton, \u201cand I have come.\u201d \u201cYou promised me something else.\u201d \u201cWhat, my God!\u201d said the young man, who in spite of his self-command felt his knees tremble and the sweat start from his brow. \u201cYou promised to bring a knife, and to leave it with me after our interview.\u201d \u201cSay no more of that, madame,\u201d said Felton. \u201cThere is no situation, however terrible it may be, which can authorize a creature of God to inflict death upon himself. I have reflected, and I cannot, must not be guilty of such a sin.\u201d \u201cAh, you have reflected!\u201d said the prisoner, sitting down in her armchair, with a smile of disdain; \u201cand I also have reflected.\u201d \u201cUpon what?\u201d \u201cThat I can have nothing to say to a man who does not keep his word.\u201d \u201cOh, my God!\u201d murmured Felton. \u201cYou may retire,\u201d said Milady. \u201cI will not talk.\u201d \u201cHere is the knife,\u201d said Felton, drawing from his pocket the weapon which he had brought, according to his promise, but which he hesitated to give to his prisoner. \u201cLet me see it,\u201d said Milady. \u201cFor what purpose?\u201d \u201cUpon my honor, I will instantly return it to you. You shall place it on that table, and you may remain between it and me.\u201d Felton offered the weapon to Milady, who examined the temper of it attentively, and who tried the point on the tip of her finger.", " \u201cAccomplish the orders of Lord de Winter,\u201d said Felton, with a gloomy smile. \u201cWhat orders?\u201d asked Milady. \u201cYou do not understand?\u201d asked Felton. \u201cNo; explain yourself, I beg.\u201d \u201cAs he mistrusted me, he determined to guard you himself, and sent me in his place to get Buckingham to sign the order for your transportation.\u201d \u201cBut if he mistrusted you, how could he confide such an order to you?\u201d \u201cHow could I know what I was the bearer of?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s true!

Could you not spare me the increase of torture which your visits cause me?\u201d \u201cHow, dear sister!\u201d said Lord de Winter. \u201cDid not you sentimentally inform me with that pretty mouth of yours, so cruel to me today, that you came to England solely for the pleasure of seeing me at your ease, an enjoyment of which you told me you so sensibly felt the deprivation that you had risked everything for it--seasickness, tempest, captivity? Well, here I am; be satisfied. Besides, this time, my visit has a motive.\u201d Milady trembled; she thought Felton had told all. Perhaps never in her life had this woman, who had experienced so many opposite and powerful emotions, felt her heart beat so violently. She was seated. Lord de Winter took a chair, drew it toward her, and sat down close beside her. Then taking a paper out of his pocket, he unfolded it slowly. \u201cHere,\u201d said he, \u201cI want to show you the kind of passport which I have drawn up, and which will serve you henceforward as the rule of order in the life I consent to leave you.\u201d Then turning his eyes from Milady to the paper, he read: \u201c\u2018Order to conduct--\u2019 The name is blank,\u201d interrupted Lord de Winter. \u201cIf you have any preference you can point it out to me; and if it be not within a thousand leagues of London, attention will be paid to your wishes.", " Oh, no! I call to witness the God who hears us, that on the contrary I am a fervent Catholic!\u201d \u201cThen, madame,\u201d said the abbess, smiling, \u201cbe reassured; the house in which you are shall not be a very hard prison, and we will do all in our power to make you cherish your captivity. You will find here, moreover, the young woman of whom I spoke, who is persecuted, no doubt, in consequence of some court intrigue. She is amiable and well-behaved.\u201d \u201cWhat is her name?\u201d \u201cShe was sent to me by someone of high rank, under the name of Kitty. I have not tried to discover her other name.\u201d \u201cKitty!\u201d cried Milady. \u201cWhat? Are you sure?\u201d \u201cThat she is called so? Yes, madame. Do you know her?\u201d Milady smiled to herself at the idea which had occurred to her that this might be her old chambermaid. There was connected with the remembrance of this girl a remembrance of anger; and a desire of vengeance disordered the features of Milady, which, however, immediately recovered the calm and benevolent expression which this woman of a hundred faces had for a moment allowed them to lose. \u201cAnd when can I see this young lady, for whom I already feel so great a sympathy?\u201d asked Milady. \u201cWhy, this evening,\u201d said the abbess; \u201ctoday even. But you have been traveling these four days, as you told me yourself. This morning you rose at five o\u2019clock; you must stand in need of repose. Go to bed and sleep; at dinnertime we will rouse you.\u201d Although Milady would very willingly have gone without sleep, sustained as she was by all the excitements which a new adventure awakened in her heart, ever thirsting for intrigues, she nevertheless accepted the offer of the superior.", " But whether this was reality or vision, he had this time sufficient self-command not to enter. However, a few instants after she had finished her religious song, Milady thought she heard a profound sigh. Then the same steps she had heard approach slowly withdrew, as if with regret. 55 CAPTIVITY: THE FOURTH DAY The next day, when Felton entered Milady\u2019s apartment he found her standing, mounted upon a chair, holding in her hands a cord made by means of torn cambric handkerchiefs, twisted into a kind of rope one with another, and tied at the ends. At the noise Felton made in entering, Milady leaped lightly to the ground, and tried to conceal behind her the improvised cord she held in her hand. The young man was more pale than usual, and his eyes, reddened by want of sleep, denoted that he had passed a feverish night. Nevertheless, his brow was armed with a severity more austere than ever. He advanced slowly toward Milady, who had seated herself, and taking an end of the murderous rope which by neglect, or perhaps by design, she allowed to be seen, \u201cWhat is this, madame?\u201d he asked coldly. \u201cThat? Nothing,\u201d said Milady, smiling with that painful expression which she knew so well how to give to her smile. \u201cEnnui is the mortal enemy of prisoners; I had ennui, and I amused myself with twisting that rope.\u201d Felton turned his eyes toward the part of the wall of the apartment before which he had found Milady standing in the armchair in which she was now seated, and over her head he perceived a gilt-headed screw, fixed in the wall for the purpose of hanging up clothes or weapons."], "What does John Felton do when Buckingham refuses to sign for Milady\u2019s release?": [" \u201cLieutenant Felton, from Lord de Winter,\u201d said Patrick. \u201cFrom Lord de Winter!\u201d repeated Buckingham; \u201clet him come in.\u201d Felton entered. At that moment Buckingham was throwing upon a couch a rich toilet robe, worked with gold, in order to put on a blue velvet doublet embroidered with pearls. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t the baron come himself?\u201d demanded Buckingham. \u201cI expected him this morning.\u201d \u201cHe desired me to tell your Grace,\u201d replied Felton, \u201cthat he very much regretted not having that honor, but that he was prevented by the guard he is obliged to keep at the castle.\u201d \u201cYes, I know that,\u201d said Buckingham; \u201che has a prisoner.\u201d \u201cIt is of that prisoner that I wish to speak to your Grace,\u201d replied Felton. \u201cWell, then, speak!\u201d \u201cThat which I have to say of her can only be heard by yourself, my Lord!\u201d \u201cLeave us, Patrick,\u201d said Buckingham; \u201cbut remain within sound of the bell. I shall call you presently.\u201d Patrick went out. \u201cWe are alone, sir,\u201d said Buckingham; \u201cspeak!\u201d \u201cMy Lord,\u201d said Felton, \u201cthe Baron de Winter wrote to you the other day to request you to sign an order of embarkation relative to a young woman named Charlotte Backson.\u201d \u201cYes, sir; and I answered him, to bring or send me that order and I would sign it.\u201d \u201cHere it is, my Lord.\u201d \u201cGive it to me,\u201d said the duke. And taking it from Felton, he cast a rapid glance over the paper, and perceiving that it was the one that had been mentioned to him, he placed it on the table, took a pen, and prepared to sign it.", " God will punish you hereafter, but I will punish you here!\u201d \u201cAh, this is too much!\u201d cried Buckingham, making a step toward the door. Felton barred his passage. \u201cI ask it humbly of you, my Lord,\u201d said he; \u201csign the order for the liberation of Milady de Winter. Remember that she is a woman whom you have dishonored.\u201d \u201cWithdraw, sir,\u201d said Buckingham, \u201cor I will call my attendant, and have you placed in irons.\u201d \u201cYou shall not call,\u201d said Felton, throwing himself between the duke and the bell placed on a stand encrusted with silver. \u201cBeware, my Lord, you are in the hands of God!\u201d \u201cIn the hands of the devil, you mean!\u201d cried Buckingham, raising his voice so as to attract the notice of his people, without absolutely shouting. \u201cSign, my Lord; sign the liberation of Milady de Winter,\u201d said Felton, holding out a paper to the duke. \u201cBy force? You are joking! Holloa, Patrick!\u201d \u201cSign, my Lord!\u201d \u201cNever.\u201d \u201cNever?\u201d \u201cHelp!\u201d shouted the duke; and at the same time he sprang toward his sword. But Felton did not give him time to draw it. He held the knife with which Milady had stabbed herself, open in his bosom; at one bound he was upon the duke. At that moment Patrick entered the room, crying, \u201cA letter from France, my Lord.\u201d \u201cFrom France!\u201d cried Buckingham, forgetting everything in thinking from whom that letter came. Felton took advantage of this moment, and plunged the knife into his side up to the handle.", " She is young; she is beautiful; she possesses all earthly seductions. Well, she is a monster, who, at twenty-five years of age, has been guilty of as many crimes as you could read of in a year in the archives of our tribunals. Her voice prejudices her hearers in her favor; her beauty serves as a bait to her victims; her body even pays what she promises--I must do her that justice. She will try to seduce you, perhaps she will try to kill you. I have extricated you from misery, Felton; I have caused you to be named lieutenant; I once saved your life, you know on what occasion. I am for you not only a protector, but a friend; not only a benefactor, but a father. This woman has come back again into England for the purpose of conspiring against my life. I hold this serpent in my hands. Well, I call you, and say to you: Friend Felton, John, my child, guard me, and more particularly guard yourself, against this woman. Swear, by your hopes of salvation, to keep her safely for the chastisement she has merited. John Felton, I trust your word! John Felton, I put faith in your loyalty!\u201d \u201cMy Lord,\u201d said the young officer, summoning to his mild countenance all the hatred he could find in his heart, \u201cmy Lord, I swear all shall be done as you desire.\u201d Milady received this look like a resigned victim; it was impossible to imagine a more submissive or a more mild expression than that which prevailed on her beautiful countenance.", " \u201cAccomplish the orders of Lord de Winter,\u201d said Felton, with a gloomy smile. \u201cWhat orders?\u201d asked Milady. \u201cYou do not understand?\u201d asked Felton. \u201cNo; explain yourself, I beg.\u201d \u201cAs he mistrusted me, he determined to guard you himself, and sent me in his place to get Buckingham to sign the order for your transportation.\u201d \u201cBut if he mistrusted you, how could he confide such an order to you?\u201d \u201cHow could I know what I was the bearer of?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s true! And you are going to Portsmouth?\u201d \u201cI have no time to lose. Tomorrow is the twenty-third, and Buckingham sets sail tomorrow with his fleet.\u201d \u201cHe sets sail tomorrow! Where for?\u201d \u201cFor La Rochelle.\u201d \u201cHe need not sail!\u201d cried Milady, forgetting her usual presence of mind. \u201cBe satisfied,\u201d replied Felton; \u201che will not sail.\u201d Milady started with joy. She could read to the depths of the heart of this young man; the death of Buckingham was written there at full length. \u201cFelton,\u201d cried she, \u201cyou are as great as Judas Maccabeus! If you die, I will die with you; that is all I can say to you.\u201d \u201cSilence!\u201d cried Felton; \u201cwe are here.\u201d In fact, they touched the sloop. Felton mounted the ladder first, and gave his hand to Milady, while the sailors supported her, for the sea was still much agitated. An instant after they were on the deck. \u201cCaptain,\u201d said Felton, \u201cthis is the person of whom I spoke to you, and whom you must convey safe and sound to France.\u201d \u201cFor a thousand pistoles,\u201d said the captain."], "Where does Milady go when she returns to France?": [" \u201cWell, go and fetch them, and come to my apartment. We will snatch some supper; we shall perhaps travel part of the night, and must keep our strength up.\u201d \u201cGreat God!\u201d said Mme. Bonacieux, placing her hand upon her bosom, \u201cmy heart beats so I cannot walk.\u201d \u201cCourage, courage! remember that in a quarter of an hour you will be safe; and think that what you are about to do is for HIS sake.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, everything for him. You have restored my courage by a single word; go, I will rejoin you.\u201d Milady ran up to her apartment quickly; she there found Rochefort\u2019s lackey, and gave him his instructions. He was to wait at the gate; if by chance the Musketeers should appear, the carriage was to set off as fast as possible, pass around the convent, and go and wait for Milady at a little village which was situated at the other side of the wood. In this case Milady would cross the garden and gain the village on foot. As we have already said, Milady was admirably acquainted with this part of France. If the Musketeers did not appear, things were to go on as had been agreed; Mme. Bonacieux was to get into the carriage as if to bid her adieu, and she was to take away Mme. Bonacieux. Mme. Bonacieux came in; and to remove all suspicion, if she had any, Milady repeated to the lackey, before her, the latter part of her instructions. Milady asked some questions about the carriage. It was a chaise drawn by three horses, driven by a postillion; Rochefort\u2019s lackey would precede it, as courier.", " \u201cAt what?\u201d said Milady, with the utmost ingenuousness. \u201cAt the language you use.\u201d \u201cWhat do you find so astonishing in that language?\u201d said Milady, smiling. \u201cYou are the friend of the cardinal, for he sends you hither, and yet--\u201d \u201cAnd yet I speak ill of him,\u201d replied Milady, finishing the thought of the superior. \u201cAt least you don\u2019t speak well of him.\u201d \u201cThat is because I am not his friend,\u201d said she, sighing, \u201cbut his victim!\u201d \u201cBut this letter in which he recommends you to me?\u201d \u201cIs an order for me to confine myself to a sort of prison, from which he will release me by one of his satellites.\u201d \u201cBut why have you not fled?\u201d \u201cWhither should I go? Do you believe there is a spot on the earth which the cardinal cannot reach if he takes the trouble to stretch forth his hand? If I were a man, that would barely be possible; but what can a woman do? This young boarder of yours, has she tried to fly?\u201d \u201cNo, that is true; but she--that is another thing; I believe she is detained in France by some love affair.\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d said Milady, with a sigh, \u201cif she loves she is not altogether wretched.\u201d \u201cThen,\u201d said the abbess, looking at Milady with increasing interest, \u201cI behold another poor victim?\u201d \u201cAlas, yes,\u201d said Milady. The abbess looked at her for an instant with uneasiness, as if a fresh thought suggested itself to her mind. \u201cYou are not an enemy of our holy faith?\u201d said she, hesitatingly. \u201cWho--I?\u201d cried Milady; \u201cI a Protestant?", " Would God send the same dreams to you as to me if you did not love me? Should we have the same presentiments if our existences did not touch at the heart? You love me, my beautiful queen, and you will weep for me?\u201d \u201cOh, my God, my God!\u201d cried Anne of Austria, \u201cthis is more than I can bear. In the name of heaven, Duke, leave me, go! I do not know whether I love you or love you not; but what I know is that I will not be perjured. Take pity on me, then, and go! Oh, if you are struck in France, if you die in France, if I could imagine that your love for me was the cause of your death, I could not console myself; I should run mad. Depart then, depart, I implore you!\u201d \u201cOh, how beautiful you are thus! Oh, how I love you!\u201d said Buckingham. \u201cGo, go, I implore you, and return hereafter! Come back as ambassador, come back as minister, come back surrounded with guards who will defend you, with servants who will watch over you, and then I shall no longer fear for your days, and I shall be happy in seeing you.\u201d \u201cOh, is this true what you say?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cOh, then, some pledge of your indulgence, some object which came from you, and may remind me that I have not been dreaming; something you have worn, and that I may wear in my turn--a ring, a necklace, a chain.\u201d \u201cWill you depart--will you depart, if I give you that you demand?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cThis very instant?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cYou will leave France, you will return to England?\u201d \u201cI will, I swear to you.\u201d \u201cWait, then, wait.\u201d Anne of Austria re-entered her apartment, and came out again almost immediately, holding a rosewood casket in her hand, with her cipher encrusted with gold.", " He therefore found d\u2019Artagnan alone, and as it was nearly eight o\u2019clock he took the young man with him. An elegant carriage waited below, and as it was drawn by two excellent horses, they were soon at the Place Royale. Milady Clarik received d\u2019Artagnan ceremoniously. Her hotel was remarkably sumptuous, and while the most part of the English had quit, or were about to quit, France on account of the war, Milady had just been laying out much money upon her residence; which proved that the general measure which drove the English from France did not affect her. \u201cYou see,\u201d said Lord de Winter, presenting d\u2019Artagnan to his sister, \u201ca young gentleman who has held my life in his hands, and who has not abused his advantage, although we have been twice enemies, although it was I who insulted him, and although I am an Englishman. Thank him, then, madame, if you have any affection for me.\u201d Milady frowned slightly; a scarcely visible cloud passed over her brow, and so peculiar a smile appeared upon her lips that the young man, who saw and observed this triple shade, almost shuddered at it. The brother did not perceive this; he had turned round to play with Milady\u2019s favorite monkey, which had pulled him by the doublet. \u201cYou are welcome, monsieur,\u201d said Milady, in a voice whose singular sweetness contrasted with the symptoms of ill-humor which d\u2019Artagnan had just remarked; \u201cyou have today acquired eternal rights to my gratitude.\u201d The Englishman then turned round and described the combat without omitting a single detail."], "Who do we discover the \u201cMan from Meung\u201d to be when he visits Milady?": [" He knows all! My God, I am lost!\u201d Felton remained standing, motionless and undecided. \u201cHe still doubts,\u201d thought Milady; \u201cI have not been earnest enough.\u201d Someone was heard in the corridor; Milady recognized the step of Lord de Winter. Felton recognized it also, and made a step toward the door. Milady sprang toward him. \u201cOh, not a word,\u201d said she in a concentrated voice, \u201cnot a word of all that I have said to you to this man, or I am lost, and it would be you--you--\u201d Then as the steps drew near, she became silent for fear of being heard, applying, with a gesture of infinite terror, her beautiful hand to Felton\u2019s mouth. Felton gently repulsed Milady, and she sank into a chair. Lord de Winter passed before the door without stopping, and they heard the noise of his footsteps soon die away. Felton, as pale as death, remained some instants with his ear bent and listening; then, when the sound was quite extinct, he breathed like a man awaking from a dream, and rushed out of the apartment. \u201cAh!\u201d said Milady, listening in her turn to the noise of Felton\u2019s steps, which withdrew in a direction opposite to those of Lord de Winter; \u201cat length you are mine!\u201d Then her brow darkened. \u201cIf he tells the baron,\u201d said she, \u201cI am lost--for the baron, who knows very well that I shall not kill myself, will place me before him with a knife in my hand, and he will discover that all this despair is but acted.\u201d She placed herself before the glass, and regarded herself attentively; never had she appeared more beautiful.", " Oh, no! I call to witness the God who hears us, that on the contrary I am a fervent Catholic!\u201d \u201cThen, madame,\u201d said the abbess, smiling, \u201cbe reassured; the house in which you are shall not be a very hard prison, and we will do all in our power to make you cherish your captivity. You will find here, moreover, the young woman of whom I spoke, who is persecuted, no doubt, in consequence of some court intrigue. She is amiable and well-behaved.\u201d \u201cWhat is her name?\u201d \u201cShe was sent to me by someone of high rank, under the name of Kitty. I have not tried to discover her other name.\u201d \u201cKitty!\u201d cried Milady. \u201cWhat? Are you sure?\u201d \u201cThat she is called so? Yes, madame. Do you know her?\u201d Milady smiled to herself at the idea which had occurred to her that this might be her old chambermaid. There was connected with the remembrance of this girl a remembrance of anger; and a desire of vengeance disordered the features of Milady, which, however, immediately recovered the calm and benevolent expression which this woman of a hundred faces had for a moment allowed them to lose. \u201cAnd when can I see this young lady, for whom I already feel so great a sympathy?\u201d asked Milady. \u201cWhy, this evening,\u201d said the abbess; \u201ctoday even. But you have been traveling these four days, as you told me yourself. This morning you rose at five o\u2019clock; you must stand in need of repose. Go to bed and sleep; at dinnertime we will rouse you.\u201d Although Milady would very willingly have gone without sleep, sustained as she was by all the excitements which a new adventure awakened in her heart, ever thirsting for intrigues, she nevertheless accepted the offer of the superior.", " D\u2019Artagnan asked the poor girl what was the matter with her; but she, as her only reply, drew a letter from her pocket and gave it to him. This letter was in Milady\u2019s handwriting; only this time it was addressed to M. d\u2019Artagnan, and not to M. de Wardes. He opened it and read as follows: Dear M. d\u2019Artagnan, It is wrong thus to neglect your friends, particularly at the moment you are about to leave them for so long a time. My brother-in-law and myself expected you yesterday and the day before, but in vain. Will it be the same this evening? Your very grateful, Milady Clarik \u201cThat\u2019s all very simple,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cI expected this letter. My credit rises by the fall of that of the Comte de Wardes.\u201d \u201cAnd will you go?\u201d asked Kitty. \u201cListen to me, my dear girl,\u201d said the Gascon, who sought for an excuse in his own eyes for breaking the promise he had made Athos; \u201cyou must understand it would be impolitic not to accept such a positive invitation. Milady, not seeing me come again, would not be able to understand what could cause the interruption of my visits, and might suspect something; who could say how far the vengeance of such a woman would go?\u201d \u201cOh, my God!\u201d said Kitty, \u201cyou know how to represent things in such a way that you are always in the right. You are going now to pay your court to her again, and if this time you succeed in pleasing her in your own name and with your own face, it will be much worse than before.\u201d Instinct made poor Kitty guess a part of what was to happen.", " \u201cAlas, sir,\u201d said he, \u201cI cannot but perceive how sadly I miss the letter of introduction which my father gave me to present to you.\u201d \u201cI certainly am surprised,\u201d replied M. de Treville, \u201cthat you should undertake so long a journey without that necessary passport, the sole resource of us poor Bearnese.\u201d \u201cI had one, sir, and, thank God, such as I could wish,\u201d cried d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cbut it was perfidiously stolen from me.\u201d He then related the adventure of Meung, described the unknown gentleman with the greatest minuteness, and all with a warmth and truthfulness that delighted M. de Treville. \u201cThis is all very strange,\u201d said M. de Treville, after meditating a minute; \u201cyou mentioned my name, then, aloud?\u201d \u201cYes, sir, I certainly committed that imprudence; but why should I have done otherwise? A name like yours must be as a buckler to me on my way. Judge if I should not put myself under its protection.\u201d Flattery was at that period very current, and M. de Treville loved incense as well as a king, or even a cardinal. He could not refrain from a smile of visible satisfaction; but this smile soon disappeared, and returning to the adventure of Meung, \u201cTell me,\u201d continued he, \u201chad not this gentlemen a slight scar on his cheek?\u201d \u201cYes, such a one as would be made by the grazing of a ball.\u201d \u201cWas he not a fine-looking man?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cOf lofty stature.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cOf pale complexion and brown hair?\u201d \u201cYes, yes, that is he; how is it, sir, that you are acquainted with this man?"], "How does Milady kill Madame Bonacieux before leaving the convent?": [" Then, if he persists, notwithstanding all this--as that is, as I have said, the limit of my mission--I shall have nothing to do but to pray God to work a miracle for the salvation of France. That is it, is it not, monseigneur, and I shall have nothing else to do?\u201d \u201cThat is it,\u201d replied the cardinal, dryly. \u201cAnd now,\u201d said Milady, without appearing to remark the change of the duke\u2019s tone toward her--\u201cnow that I have received the instructions of your Eminence as concerns your enemies, Monseigneur will permit me to say a few words to him of mine?\u201d \u201cHave you enemies, then?\u201d asked Richelieu. \u201cYes, monseigneur, enemies against whom you owe me all your support, for I made them by serving your Eminence.\u201d \u201cWho are they?\u201d replied the duke. \u201cIn the first place, there is a little intrigante named Bonacieux.\u201d \u201cShe is in the prison of Nantes.\u201d \u201cThat is to say, she was there,\u201d replied Milady; \u201cbut the queen has obtained an order from the king by means of which she has been conveyed to a convent.\u201d \u201cTo a convent?\u201d said the duke. \u201cYes, to a convent.\u201d \u201cAnd to which?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know; the secret has been well kept.\u201d \u201cBut I will know!\u201d \u201cAnd your Eminence will tell me in what convent that woman is?\u201d \u201cI can see nothing inconvenient in that,\u201d said the cardinal. \u201cWell, now I have an enemy much more to be dreaded by me than this little Madame Bonacieux.\u201d \u201cWho is that?\u201d \u201cHer lover.\u201d \u201cWhat is his name?\u201d \u201cOh, your Eminence knows him well,\u201d cried Milady, carried away by her anger.", " I know them from having heard one of their friends, Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan, say a great deal about them.\u201d \u201cYou know Monsieur d\u2019Artagnan!\u201d cried the novice, in her turn seizing the hands of Milady and devouring her with her eyes. Then remarking the strange expression of Milady\u2019s countenance, she said, \u201cPardon me, madame; you know him by what title?\u201d \u201cWhy,\u201d replied Milady, embarrassed, \u201cwhy, by the title of friend.\u201d \u201cYou deceive me, madame,\u201d said the novice; \u201cyou have been his mistress!\u201d \u201cIt is you who have been his mistress, madame!\u201d cried Milady, in her turn. \u201cI?\u201d said the novice. \u201cYes, you! I know you now. You are Madame Bonacieux!\u201d The young woman drew back, filled with surprise and terror. \u201cOh, do not deny it! Answer!\u201d continued Milady. \u201cWell, yes, madame,\u201d said the novice, \u201cAre we rivals?\u201d The countenance of Milady was illumined by so savage a joy that under any other circumstances Mme. Bonacieux would have fled in terror; but she was absorbed by jealousy. \u201cSpeak, madame!\u201d resumed Mme. Bonacieux, with an energy of which she might not have been believed capable. \u201cHave you been, or are you, his mistress?\u201d \u201cOh, no!\u201d cried Milady, with an accent that admitted no doubt of her truth. \u201cNever, never!\u201d \u201cI believe you,\u201d said Mme. Bonacieux; \u201cbut why, then, did you cry out so?\u201d \u201cDo you not understand?\u201d said Milady, who had already overcome her agitation and recovered all her presence of mind.", " One may be very comfortable in a convent; and as soon as the siege of La Rochelle is terminated, I promise you on my part--\u201d \u201cGood,\u201d cried Athos, \u201cgood! Yes, my dear Aramis, we all know that your views have a religious tendency.\u201d \u201cI am only temporarily a Musketeer,\u201d said Aramis, humbly. \u201cIt is some time since we heard from his mistress,\u201d said Athos, in a low voice. \u201cBut take no notice; we know all about that.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d said Porthos, \u201cit appears to me that the means are very simple.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d asked d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cYou say she is in a convent?\u201d replied Porthos. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cVery well. As soon as the siege is over, we\u2019ll carry her off from that convent.\u201d \u201cBut we must first learn what convent she is in.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d said Porthos. \u201cBut I think I have it,\u201d said Athos. \u201cDon\u2019t you say, dear d\u2019Artagnan, that it is the queen who has made choice of the convent for her?\u201d \u201cI believe so, at least.\u201d \u201cIn that case Porthos will assist us.\u201d \u201cAnd how so, if you please?\u201d \u201cWhy, by your marchioness, your duchess, your princess. She must have a long arm.\u201d \u201cHush!\u201d said Porthos, placing a finger on his lips. \u201cI believe her to be a cardinalist; she must know nothing of the matter.\u201d \u201cThen,\u201d said Aramis, \u201cI take upon myself to obtain intelligence of her.\u201d \u201cYou, Aramis?\u201d cried the three friends. \u201cYou! And how?\u201d \u201cBy the queen\u2019s almoner, to whom I am very intimately allied,\u201d said Aramis, coloring. And on this assurance, the four friends, who had finished their modest repast, separated, with the promise of meeting again that evening.", " \u201cWell, go and fetch them, and come to my apartment. We will snatch some supper; we shall perhaps travel part of the night, and must keep our strength up.\u201d \u201cGreat God!\u201d said Mme. Bonacieux, placing her hand upon her bosom, \u201cmy heart beats so I cannot walk.\u201d \u201cCourage, courage! remember that in a quarter of an hour you will be safe; and think that what you are about to do is for HIS sake.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, everything for him. You have restored my courage by a single word; go, I will rejoin you.\u201d Milady ran up to her apartment quickly; she there found Rochefort\u2019s lackey, and gave him his instructions. He was to wait at the gate; if by chance the Musketeers should appear, the carriage was to set off as fast as possible, pass around the convent, and go and wait for Milady at a little village which was situated at the other side of the wood. In this case Milady would cross the garden and gain the village on foot. As we have already said, Milady was admirably acquainted with this part of France. If the Musketeers did not appear, things were to go on as had been agreed; Mme. Bonacieux was to get into the carriage as if to bid her adieu, and she was to take away Mme. Bonacieux. Mme. Bonacieux came in; and to remove all suspicion, if she had any, Milady repeated to the lackey, before her, the latter part of her instructions. Milady asked some questions about the carriage. It was a chaise drawn by three horses, driven by a postillion; Rochefort\u2019s lackey would precede it, as courier."], "What do the Musketeers do when they find Milady as she is leaving France?": [" \u201cAt what?\u201d said Milady, with the utmost ingenuousness. \u201cAt the language you use.\u201d \u201cWhat do you find so astonishing in that language?\u201d said Milady, smiling. \u201cYou are the friend of the cardinal, for he sends you hither, and yet--\u201d \u201cAnd yet I speak ill of him,\u201d replied Milady, finishing the thought of the superior. \u201cAt least you don\u2019t speak well of him.\u201d \u201cThat is because I am not his friend,\u201d said she, sighing, \u201cbut his victim!\u201d \u201cBut this letter in which he recommends you to me?\u201d \u201cIs an order for me to confine myself to a sort of prison, from which he will release me by one of his satellites.\u201d \u201cBut why have you not fled?\u201d \u201cWhither should I go? Do you believe there is a spot on the earth which the cardinal cannot reach if he takes the trouble to stretch forth his hand? If I were a man, that would barely be possible; but what can a woman do? This young boarder of yours, has she tried to fly?\u201d \u201cNo, that is true; but she--that is another thing; I believe she is detained in France by some love affair.\u201d \u201cAh,\u201d said Milady, with a sigh, \u201cif she loves she is not altogether wretched.\u201d \u201cThen,\u201d said the abbess, looking at Milady with increasing interest, \u201cI behold another poor victim?\u201d \u201cAlas, yes,\u201d said Milady. The abbess looked at her for an instant with uneasiness, as if a fresh thought suggested itself to her mind. \u201cYou are not an enemy of our holy faith?\u201d said she, hesitatingly. \u201cWho--I?\u201d cried Milady; \u201cI a Protestant?", " My sister, how did your husband die?\u201d \u201cHorror!\u201d cried Porthos and Aramis. \u201cAssassin of Buckingham, assassin of Felton, assassin of my brother, I demand justice upon you, and I swear that if it be not granted to me, I will execute it myself.\u201d And Lord de Winter ranged himself by the side of d\u2019Artagnan, leaving the place free for another accuser. Milady let her head sink between her two hands, and tried to recall her ideas, whirling in a mortal vertigo. \u201cMy turn,\u201d said Athos, himself trembling as the lion trembles at the sight of the serpent--\u201cmy turn. I married that woman when she was a young girl; I married her in opposition to the wishes of all my family; I gave her my wealth, I gave her my name; and one day I discovered that this woman was branded--this woman was marked with a FLEUR-DE-LIS on her left shoulder.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said Milady, raising herself, \u201cI defy you to find any tribunal which pronounced that infamous sentence against me. I defy you to find him who executed it.\u201d \u201cSilence!\u201d said a hollow voice. \u201cIt is for me to reply to that!\u201d And the man in the red cloak came forward in his turn. \u201cWhat man is that? What man is that?\u201d cried Milady, suffocated by terror, her hair loosening itself, and rising above her livid countenance as if alive. All eyes were turned towards this man--for to all except Athos he was unknown. Even Athos looked at him with as much stupefaction as the others, for he knew not how he could in any way find himself mixed up with the horrible drama then unfolded.", " \u201cWell, go and fetch them, and come to my apartment. We will snatch some supper; we shall perhaps travel part of the night, and must keep our strength up.\u201d \u201cGreat God!\u201d said Mme. Bonacieux, placing her hand upon her bosom, \u201cmy heart beats so I cannot walk.\u201d \u201cCourage, courage! remember that in a quarter of an hour you will be safe; and think that what you are about to do is for HIS sake.\u201d \u201cYes, yes, everything for him.

It was a chaise drawn by three horses, driven by a postillion; Rochefort\u2019s lackey would precede it, as courier.", " \u201cWhat!\u201d said Kitty, blushing. \u201cOr, at least, I will go--later.\u201d He drew Kitty to him. She had the less motive to resist, resistance would make so much noise. Therefore Kitty surrendered. It was a movement of vengeance upon Milady. D\u2019Artagnan believed it right to say that vengeance is the pleasure of the gods. With a little more heart, he might have been contented with this new conquest; but the principal features of his character were ambition and pride. It must, however, be confessed in his justification that the first use he made of his influence over Kitty was to try and find out what had become of Mme. Bonacieux; but the poor girl swore upon the crucifix to d\u2019Artagnan that she was entirely ignorant on that head, her mistress never admitting her into half her secrets--only she believed she could say she was not dead. As to the cause which was near making Milady lose her credit with the cardinal, Kitty knew nothing about it; but this time d\u2019Artagnan was better informed than she was. As he had seen Milady on board a vessel at the moment he was leaving England, he suspected that it was, almost without a doubt, on account of the diamond studs. But what was clearest in all this was that the true hatred, the profound hatred, the inveterate hatred of Milady, was increased by his not having killed her brother-in-law. D\u2019Artagnan came the next day to Milady\u2019s, and finding her in a very ill-humor, had no doubt that it was lack of an answer from M. de Wardes that provoked her thus."], "According to the headsman, who was Milady before she began her life of crime?": [" Milady recoiled, uttering a cry. D\u2019Artagnan, believing she might have means of flight and fearing she should escape, drew a pistol from his belt; but Athos raised his hand. \u201cPut back that weapon, d\u2019Artagnan!\u201d said he; \u201cthis woman must be tried, not assassinated. Wait an instant, my friend, and you shall be satisfied. Come in, gentlemen.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan obeyed; for Athos had the solemn voice and the powerful gesture of a judge sent by the Lord himself. Behind d\u2019Artagnan entered Porthos, Aramis, Lord de Winter, and the man in the red cloak. The four lackeys guarded the door and the window. Milady had sunk into a chair, with her hands extended, as if to conjure this terrible apparition. Perceiving her brother-in-law, she uttered a terrible cry. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d screamed Milady. \u201cWe want,\u201d said Athos, \u201cCharlotte Backson, who first was called Comtesse de la Fere, and afterwards Milady de Winter, Baroness of Sheffield.\u201d \u201cThat is I! that is I!\u201d murmured Milady, in extreme terror; \u201cwhat do you want?\u201d \u201cWe wish to judge you according to your crime,\u201d said Athos; \u201cyou shall be free to defend yourself. Justify yourself if you can. M. d\u2019Artagnan, it is for you to accuse her first.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan advanced. \u201cBefore God and before men,\u201d said he, \u201cI accuse this woman of having poisoned Constance Bonacieux, who died yesterday evening.\u201d He turned towards Porthos and Aramis. \u201cWe bear witness to this,\u201d said the two Musketeers, with one voice.", " Before she went to bed she had pondered, analyzed, turned on all sides, examined on all points, the words, the steps, the gestures, the signs, and even the silence of her interlocutors; and of this profound, skillful, and anxious study the result was that Felton, everything considered, appeared the more vulnerable of her two persecutors. One expression above all recurred to the mind of the prisoner: \u201cIf I had listened to you,\u201d Lord de Winter had said to Felton. Felton, then, had spoken in her favor, since Lord de Winter had not been willing to listen to him. \u201cWeak or strong,\u201d repeated Milady, \u201cthat man has, then, a spark of pity in his soul; of that spark I will make a flame that shall devour him. As to the other, he knows me, he fears me, and knows what he has to expect of me if ever I escape from his hands. It is useless, then, to attempt anything with him. But Felton--that\u2019s another thing. He is a young, ingenuous, pure man who seems virtuous; him there are means of destroying.\u201d And Milady went to bed and fell asleep with a smile upon her lips. Anyone who had seen her sleeping might have said she was a young girl dreaming of the crown of flowers she was to wear on her brow at the next festival. 53 CAPTIVITY: THE SECOND DAY Milady dreamed that she at length had d\u2019Artagnan in her power, that she was present at his execution; and it was the sight of his odious blood, flowing beneath the ax of the headsman, which spread that charming smile upon her lips.", " He was not the less intoxicated with joy, electrified by love. He almost believed in the tenderness of Milady; he almost believed in the crime of de Wardes. If de Wardes had at that moment been under his hand, he would have killed him. Milady seized the occasion. \u201cHis name is--\u201d said she, in her turn. \u201cDe Wardes; I know it,\u201d cried d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cAnd how do you know it?\u201d asked Milady, seizing both his hands, and endeavoring to read with her eyes to the bottom of his heart. D\u2019Artagnan felt he had allowed himself to be carried away, and that he had committed an error. \u201cTell me, tell me, tell me, I say,\u201d repeated Milady, \u201chow do you know it?\u201d \u201cHow do I know it?\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cI know it because yesterday Monsieur de Wardes, in a saloon where I was, showed a ring which he said he had received from you.\u201d \u201cWretch!\u201d cried Milady. The epithet, as may be easily understood, resounded to the very bottom of d\u2019Artagnan\u2019s heart. \u201cWell?\u201d continued she. \u201cWell, I will avenge you of this wretch,\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan, giving himself the airs of Don Japhet of Armenia. \u201cThanks, my brave friend!\u201d cried Milady; \u201cand when shall I be avenged?\u201d \u201cTomorrow--immediately--when you please!\u201d Milady was about to cry out, \u201cImmediately,\u201d but she reflected that such precipitation would not be very gracious toward d\u2019Artagnan. Besides, she had a thousand precautions to take, a thousand counsels to give to her defender, in order that he might avoid explanations with the count before witnesses.", " If you know Monsieur de Treville, you must have visited him?\u201d \u201cOften!\u201d said Milady, who, having entered this track, and perceiving that falsehood succeeded, was determined to follow it to the end. \u201cWith him, then, you must have seen some of his Musketeers?\u201d \u201cAll those he is in the habit of receiving!\u201d replied Milady, for whom this conversation began to have a real interest. \u201cName a few of those whom you know, and you will see if they are my friends.\u201d \u201cWell!\u201d said Milady, embarrassed, \u201cI know Monsieur de Louvigny, Monsieur de Courtivron, Monsieur de Ferussac.\u201d The novice let her speak, then seeing that she paused, she said, \u201cDon\u2019t you know a gentleman named Athos?\u201d Milady became as pale as the sheets in which she was lying, and mistress as she was of herself, could not help uttering a cry, seizing the hand of the novice, and devouring her with looks. \u201cWhat is the matter? Good God!\u201d asked the poor woman, \u201chave I said anything that has wounded you?\u201d \u201cNo; but the name struck me, because I also have known that gentleman, and it appeared strange to me to meet with a person who appears to know him well.\u201d \u201cOh, yes, very well; not only him, but some of his friends, Messieurs Porthos and Aramis!\u201d \u201cIndeed! you know them likewise? I know them,\u201d cried Milady, who began to feel a chill penetrate her heart. \u201cWell, if you know them, you know that they are good and free companions. Why do you not apply to them, if you stand in need of help?\u201d \u201cThat is to say,\u201d stammered Milady, \u201cI am not really very intimate with any of them."], "What sentence do Porthos and Aramis give Milady for her crimes?": [" Beyond Portsmouth the sea was covered with vessels whose masts, like a forest of poplars despoiled by the winter, bent with each breath of the wind. Felton, in his rapid walk, reviewed in his mind all the accusations against the favorite of James I and Charles I, furnished by two years of premature meditation and a long sojourn among the Puritans. When he compared the public crimes of this minister--startling crimes, European crimes, if so we may say--with the private and unknown crimes with which Milady had charged him, Felton found that the more culpable of the two men which formed the character of Buckingham was the one of whom the public knew not the life. This was because his love, so strange, so new, and so ardent, made him view the infamous and imaginary accusations of Milady de Winter as, through a magnifying glass, one views as frightful monsters atoms in reality imperceptible by the side of an ant. The rapidity of his walk heated his blood still more; the idea that he left behind him, exposed to a frightful vengeance, the woman he loved, or rather whom he adored as a saint, the emotion he had experienced, present fatigue--all together exalted his mind above human feeling. He entered Portsmouth about eight o\u2019clock in the morning. The whole population was on foot; drums were beating in the streets and in the port; the troops about to embark were marching toward the sea.", " You very well know, Porthos, that I continue to study theology for that purpose.\u201d \u201cHe will be one, as he says,\u201d cried Porthos; \u201che will be one, sooner or later.\u201d \u201cSooner,\u201d said Aramis. \u201cHe only waits for one thing to determine him to resume his cassock, which hangs behind his uniform,\u201d said another Musketeer. \u201cWhat is he waiting for?\u201d asked another. \u201cOnly till the queen has given an heir to the crown of France.\u201d \u201cNo jesting upon that subject, gentlemen,\u201d said Porthos; \u201cthank God the queen is still of an age to give one!\u201d \u201cThey say that Monsieur de Buckingham is in France,\u201d replied Aramis, with a significant smile which gave to this sentence, apparently so simple, a tolerably scandalous meaning. \u201cAramis, my good friend, this time you are wrong,\u201d interrupted Porthos. \u201cYour wit is always leading you beyond bounds; if Monsieur de Treville heard you, you would repent of speaking thus.\u201d \u201cAre you going to give me a lesson, Porthos?\u201d cried Aramis, from whose usually mild eye a flash passed like lightning. \u201cMy dear fellow, be a Musketeer or an abbe. Be one or the other, but not both,\u201d replied Porthos. \u201cYou know what Athos told you the other day; you eat at everybody\u2019s mess. Ah, don\u2019t be angry, I beg of you, that would be useless; you know what is agreed upon between you, Athos and me. You go to Madame d\u2019Aguillon\u2019s, and you pay your court to her; you go to Madame de Bois-Tracy\u2019s, the cousin of Madame de Chevreuse, and you pass for being far advanced in the good graces of that lady.", " \u201cWhat, monseigneur?\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, with a calmness which astonished the cardinal himself. \u201cYou are charged with having corresponded with the enemies of the kingdom; you are charged with having surprised state secrets; you are charged with having tried to thwart the plans of your general.\u201d \u201cAnd who charges me with this, monseigneur?\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, who had no doubt the accusation came from Milady, \u201ca woman branded by the justice of the country; a woman who has espoused one man in France and another in England; a woman who poisoned her second husband and who attempted both to poison and assassinate me!\u201d \u201cWhat do you say, monsieur?\u201d cried the cardinal, astonished; \u201cand of what woman are you speaking thus?\u201d \u201cOf Milady de Winter,\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cyes, of Milady de Winter, of whose crimes your Eminence is doubtless ignorant, since you have honored her with your confidence.\u201d \u201cMonsieur,\u201d said the cardinal, \u201cif Milady de Winter has committed the crimes you lay to her charge, she shall be punished.\u201d \u201cShe has been punished, monseigneur.\u201d \u201cAnd who has punished her?\u201d \u201cWe.\u201d \u201cShe is in prison?\u201d \u201cShe is dead.\u201d \u201cDead!\u201d repeated the cardinal, who could not believe what he heard, \u201cdead! Did you not say she was dead?\u201d \u201cThree times she attempted to kill me, and I pardoned her; but she murdered the woman I loved. Then my friends and I took her, tried her, and condemned her.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan then related the poisoning of Mme.", " This woman passed for his sister. \u201cThe Lord of the estate on which the chapel of the curacy was situated saw this pretend sister, and became enamoured of her--amorous to such a degree that he proposed to marry her. Then she quitted him she had ruined for him she was destined to ruin, and became the Comtesse de la Fere--\u201d All eyes were turned towards Athos, whose real name that was, and who made a sign with his head that all was true which the executioner had said. \u201cThen,\u201d resumed he, \u201cmad, desperate, determined to get rid of an existence from which she had stolen everything, honor and happiness, my poor brother returned to Lille, and learning the sentence which had condemned me in his place, surrendered himself, and hanged himself that same night from the iron bar of the loophole of his prison. \u201cTo do justice to them who had condemned me, they kept their word. As soon as the identity of my brother was proved, I was set at liberty. \u201cThat is the crime of which I accuse her; that is the cause for which she was branded.\u201d \u201cMonsieur d\u2019Artagnan,\u201d said Athos, \u201cwhat is the penalty you demand against this woman?\u201d \u201cThe punishment of death,\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cMy Lord de Winter,\u201d continued Athos, \u201cwhat is the penalty you demand against this woman?\u201d \u201cThe punishment of death,\u201d replied Lord de Winter. \u201cMessieurs Porthos and Aramis,\u201d repeated Athos, \u201cyou who are her judges, what is the sentence you pronounce upon this woman?\u201d \u201cThe punishment of death,\u201d replied the Musketeers, in a hollow voice."], "What does the Cardinal do when D\u2019Artagnan tells him that he killed Milady for her crimes?": [" Beyond Portsmouth the sea was covered with vessels whose masts, like a forest of poplars despoiled by the winter, bent with each breath of the wind. Felton, in his rapid walk, reviewed in his mind all the accusations against the favorite of James I and Charles I, furnished by two years of premature meditation and a long sojourn among the Puritans. When he compared the public crimes of this minister--startling crimes, European crimes, if so we may say--with the private and unknown crimes with which Milady had charged him, Felton found that the more culpable of the two men which formed the character of Buckingham was the one of whom the public knew not the life. This was because his love, so strange, so new, and so ardent, made him view the infamous and imaginary accusations of Milady de Winter as, through a magnifying glass, one views as frightful monsters atoms in reality imperceptible by the side of an ant. The rapidity of his walk heated his blood still more; the idea that he left behind him, exposed to a frightful vengeance, the woman he loved, or rather whom he adored as a saint, the emotion he had experienced, present fatigue--all together exalted his mind above human feeling. He entered Portsmouth about eight o\u2019clock in the morning. The whole population was on foot; drums were beating in the streets and in the port; the troops about to embark were marching toward the sea.", " \u201cWhat, monseigneur?\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, with a calmness which astonished the cardinal himself. \u201cYou are charged with having corresponded with the enemies of the kingdom; you are charged with having surprised state secrets; you are charged with having tried to thwart the plans of your general.\u201d \u201cAnd who charges me with this, monseigneur?\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan, who had no doubt the accusation came from Milady, \u201ca woman branded by the justice of the country; a woman who has espoused one man in France and another in England; a woman who poisoned her second husband and who attempted both to poison and assassinate me!\u201d \u201cWhat do you say, monsieur?\u201d cried the cardinal, astonished; \u201cand of what woman are you speaking thus?\u201d \u201cOf Milady de Winter,\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cyes, of Milady de Winter, of whose crimes your Eminence is doubtless ignorant, since you have honored her with your confidence.\u201d \u201cMonsieur,\u201d said the cardinal, \u201cif Milady de Winter has committed the crimes you lay to her charge, she shall be punished.\u201d \u201cShe has been punished, monseigneur.\u201d \u201cAnd who has punished her?\u201d \u201cWe.\u201d \u201cShe is in prison?\u201d \u201cShe is dead.\u201d \u201cDead!\u201d repeated the cardinal, who could not believe what he heard, \u201cdead! Did you not say she was dead?\u201d \u201cThree times she attempted to kill me, and I pardoned her; but she murdered the woman I loved. Then my friends and I took her, tried her, and condemned her.\u201d D\u2019Artagnan then related the poisoning of Mme.", " This time, as he was well attended, he looked at them sternly, and made a sign with his eye and hand for d\u2019Artagnan to follow him. D\u2019Artagnan obeyed. \u201cWe shall wait for you, d\u2019Artagnan,\u201d said Athos, loud enough for the cardinal to hear him. His Eminence bent his brow, stopped for an instant, and then kept on his way without uttering a single word. D\u2019Artagnan entered after the cardinal, and behind d\u2019Artagnan the door was guarded. His Eminence entered the chamber which served him as a study, and made a sign to Rochefort to bring in the young Musketeer. Rochefort obeyed and retired. D\u2019Artagnan remained alone in front of the cardinal; this was his second interview with Richelieu, and he afterward confessed that he felt well assured it would be his last. Richelieu remained standing, leaning against the mantelpiece; a table was between him and d\u2019Artagnan. \u201cMonsieur,\u201d said the cardinal, \u201cyou have been arrested by my orders.\u201d \u201cSo they tell me, monseigneur.\u201d \u201cDo you know why?\u201d \u201cNo, monseigneur, for the only thing for which I could be arrested is still unknown to your Eminence.\u201d Richelieu looked steadfastly at the young man. \u201cHolloa!\u201d said he, \u201cwhat does that mean?\u201d \u201cIf Monseigneur will have the goodness to tell me, in the first place, what crimes are imputed to me, I will then tell him the deeds I have really done.\u201d \u201cCrimes are imputed to you which had brought down far loftier heads than yours, monsieur,\u201d said the cardinal.", " Take my advice, renounce this woman. I do not know her, but a sort of intuition tells me she is a lost creature, and that there is something fatal about her.\u201d \u201cYou are right,\u201d said d\u2019Artagnan; \u201cI will have done with her. I own that this woman terrifies me.\u201d \u201cShall you have the courage?\u201d said Athos. \u201cI shall,\u201d replied d\u2019Artagnan, \u201cand instantly.\u201d \u201cIn truth, my young friend, you will act rightly,\u201d said the gentleman, pressing the Gascon\u2019s hand with an affection almost paternal; \u201cand God grant that this woman, who has scarcely entered into your life, may not leave a terrible trace in it!\u201d And Athos bowed to d\u2019Artagnan like a man who wishes it understood that he would not be sorry to be left alone with his thoughts. On reaching home d\u2019Artagnan found Kitty waiting for him. A month of fever could not have changed her more than this one night of sleeplessness and sorrow. She was sent by her mistress to the false de Wardes. Her mistress was mad with love, intoxicated with joy. She wished to know when her lover would meet her a second night; and poor Kitty, pale and trembling, awaited d\u2019Artagnan\u2019s reply. The counsels of his friend, joined to the cries of his own heart, made him determine, now his pride was saved and his vengeance satisfied, not to see Milady again. As a reply, he wrote the following letter: Do not depend upon me, madame, for the next meeting. Since my convalescence I have so many affairs of this kind on my hands that I am forced to regulate them a little."], "What does Porthos do at the novel\u2019s conclusion?": [" \u201cNo, madame; but they who so assiduously try to buy things cheap ought to permit others to seek more generous friends.\u201d And Porthos, turning on his heel, made a step to retire. \u201cMonsieur Porthos! Monsieur Porthos!\u201d cried the procurator\u2019s wife. \u201cI have been wrong; I see it. I ought not to have driven a bargain when it was to equip a cavalier like you.\u201d Porthos, without reply, retreated a second step. The procurator\u2019s wife fancied she saw him in a brilliant cloud, all surrounded by duchesses and marchionesses, who cast bags of money at his feet. \u201cStop, in the name of heaven, Monsieur Porthos!\u201d cried she. \u201cStop, and let us talk.\u201d \u201cTalking with you brings me misfortune,\u201d said Porthos. \u201cBut, tell me, what do you ask?\u201d \u201cNothing; for that amounts to the same thing as if I asked you for something.\u201d The procurator\u2019s wife hung upon the arm of Porthos, and in the violence of her grief she cried out, \u201cMonsieur Porthos, I am ignorant of all such matters! How should I know what a horse is? How should I know what horse furniture is?\u201d \u201cYou should have left it to me, then, madame, who know what they are; but you wished to be frugal, and consequently to lend at usury.\u201d \u201cIt was wrong, Monsieur Porthos; but I will repair that wrong, upon my word of honor.\u201d \u201cHow so?\u201d asked the Musketeer. \u201cListen. This evening M. Coquenard is going to the house of the Due de Chaulnes, who has sent for him. It is for a consultation, which will last three hours at least.", " The procurator\u2019s wife took Porthos into an adjoining room, and they began to lay the basis of a reconciliation. \u201cYou can come and dine three times a week,\u201d said Mme. Coquenard. \u201cThanks, madame!\u201d said Porthos, \u201cbut I don\u2019t like to abuse your kindness; besides, I must think of my outfit!\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d said the procurator\u2019s wife, groaning, \u201cthat unfortunate outfit!\u201d \u201cAlas, yes,\u201d said Porthos, \u201cit is so.\u201d \u201cBut of what, then, does the equipment of your company consist, Monsieur Porthos?\u201d \u201cOh, of many things!\u201d said Porthos. \u201cThe Musketeers are, as you know, picked soldiers, and they require many things useless to the Guardsmen or the Swiss.\u201d \u201cBut yet, detail them to me.\u201d \u201cWhy, they may amount to--\u201c, said Porthos, who preferred discussing the total to taking them one by one. The procurator\u2019s wife waited tremblingly. \u201cTo how much?\u201d said she. \u201cI hope it does not exceed--\u201d She stopped; speech failed her. \u201cOh, no,\u201d said Porthos, \u201cit does not exceed two thousand five hundred livres! I even think that with economy I could manage it with two thousand livres.\u201d \u201cGood God!\u201d cried she, \u201ctwo thousand livres! Why, that is a fortune!\u201d Porthos made a most significant grimace; Mme. Coquenard understood it. \u201cI wished to know the detail,\u201d said she, \u201cbecause, having many relatives in business, I was almost sure of obtaining things at a hundred per cent less than you would pay yourself.\u201d \u201cAh, ah!\u201d said Porthos, \u201cthat is what you meant to say!\u201d \u201cYes, dear Monsieur Porthos.", " When she was only about three steps from him, he turned his head round, fixing his eyes steadfastly upon the lady with the red cushion, who had risen and was approaching, followed by her black boy and her woman. When the lady of the red cushion came close to Porthos, Porthos drew his dripping hand from the font. The fair worshipper touched the great hand of Porthos with her delicate fingers, smiled, made the sign of the cross, and left the church. This was too much for the procurator\u2019s wife; she doubted not there was an intrigue between this lady and Porthos. If she had been a great lady she would have fainted; but as she was only a procurator\u2019s wife, she contented herself saying to the Musketeer with concentrated fury, \u201cEh, Monsieur Porthos, you don\u2019t offer me any holy water?\u201d Porthos, at the sound of that voice, started like a man awakened from a sleep of a hundred years. \u201cMa-madame!\u201d cried he; \u201cis that you? How is your husband, our dear Monsieur Coquenard? Is he still as stingy as ever? Where can my eyes have been not to have seen you during the two hours of the sermon?\u201d \u201cI was within two paces of you, monsieur,\u201d replied the procurator\u2019s wife; \u201cbut you did not perceive me because you had no eyes but for the pretty lady to whom you just now gave the holy water.\u201d Porthos pretended to be confused. \u201cAh,\u201d said he, \u201cyou have remarked--\u201d \u201cI must have been blind not to have seen.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Porthos, \u201cthat is a duchess of my acquaintance whom I have great trouble to meet on account of the jealousy of her husband, and who sent me word that she should come today to this poor church, buried in this vile quarter, solely for the sake of seeing me.\u201d \u201cMonsieur Porthos,\u201d said the procurator\u2019s wife, \u201cwill you have the kindness to offer me your arm for five minutes?", " I have something to say to you.\u201d \u201cCertainly, madame,\u201d said Porthos, winking to himself, as a gambler does who laughs at the dupe he is about to pluck. At that moment d\u2019Artagnan passed in pursuit of Milady; he cast a passing glance at Porthos, and beheld this triumphant look. \u201cEh, eh!\u201d said he, reasoning to himself according to the strangely easy morality of that gallant period, \u201cthere is one who will be equipped in good time!\u201d Porthos, yielding to the pressure of the arm of the procurator\u2019s wife, as a bark yields to the rudder, arrived at the cloister St. Magloire--a little-frequented passage, enclosed with a turnstile at each end. In the daytime nobody was seen there but mendicants devouring their crusts, and children at play. \u201cAh, Monsieur Porthos,\u201d cried the procurator\u2019s wife, when she was assured that no one who was a stranger to the population of the locality could either see or hear her, \u201cah, Monsieur Porthos, you are a great conqueror, as it appears!\u201d \u201cI, madame?\u201d said Porthos, drawing himself up proudly; \u201chow so?\u201d \u201cThe signs just now, and the holy water! But that must be a princess, at least--that lady with her Negro boy and her maid!\u201d \u201cMy God! Madame, you are deceived,\u201d said Porthos; \u201cshe is simply a duchess.\u201d \u201cAnd that running footman who waited at the door, and that carriage with a coachman in grand livery who sat waiting on his seat?\u201d Porthos had seen neither the footman nor the carriage, but with the eye of a jealous woman, Mme."]}
