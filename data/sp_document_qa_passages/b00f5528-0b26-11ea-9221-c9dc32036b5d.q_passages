Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their society, their encounters, though not personal, have been royally attorneyed with interchange of gifts, letters, loving embassies, that they have seemed to be together, though absent; shook hands, as over a vast; and embraced as it were from the ends of opposed winds.", " Let me pass The same I am, ere ancient\u2019st order was Or what is now received.

It is fifteen years since I saw my country. Though I have for the most part been aired abroad, I desire to lay my bones there.

Sure the gods do this year connive at us, and we may do anything extempore. The prince himself is about a piece of iniquity, stealing away from his father with his clog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of honesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not do\u2019t: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it; and therein am I constant to my profession.", " Here comes Bohemia.

SECOND LADY. Who taught this? MAMILLIUS. I learn\u2019d it out of women\u2019s faces. Pray now, What colour are your eyebrows? FIRST LADY. Blue, my lord. MAMILLIUS. Nay, that\u2019s a mock. I have seen a lady\u2019s nose That has been blue, but not her eyebrows. FIRST LADY. Hark ye, The queen your mother rounds apace. We shall Present our services to a fine new prince One of these days, and then you\u2019d wanton with us, If we would have you. SECOND LADY. She is spread of late Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her! HERMIONE. What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now I am for you again. Pray you sit by us, And tell \u2019s a tale. MAMILLIUS.

You see, sweet maid, we marry A gentler scion to the wildest stock, And make conceive a bark of baser kind By bud of nobler race. This is an art Which does mend nature, change it rather, but The art itself is nature. PERDITA. So it is. POLIXENES. Then make your garden rich in gillyvors, And do not call them bastards. PERDITA.

Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their society, their encounters, though not personal, have been royally attorneyed with interchange of gifts, letters, loving embassies, that they have seemed to be together, though absent; shook hands, as over a vast; and embraced as it were from the ends of opposed winds.", " O Proserpina, From the flowers now that, frighted, thou let\u2019st fall From Dis\u2019s waggon! daffodils, That come before the swallow dares, and take The winds of March with beauty; violets dim, But sweeter than the lids of Juno\u2019s eyes Or Cytherea\u2019s breath; pale primroses, That die unmarried ere they can behold Bright Phoebus in his strength (a malady Most incident to maids); bold oxlips and The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds, The flower-de-luce being one.

Let us be clear\u2019d Of being tyrannous, since we so openly Proceed in justice, which shall have due course, Even to the guilt or the purgation. Produce the prisoner. OFFICER. It is his highness\u2019 pleasure that the queen Appear in person here in court. Silence! Hermione is brought in guarded; Paulina and Ladies attending. LEONTES. Read the indictment. OFFICER. [_Reads._] \u201cHermione, queen to the worthy Leontes, king of Sicilia, thou art here accused and arraigned of high treason, in committing adultery with Polixenes, king of Bohemia; and conspiring with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign lord the king, thy royal husband: the pretence whereof being by circumstances partly laid open, thou, Hermione, contrary to the faith and allegiance of a true subject, didst counsel and aid them, for their better safety, to fly away by night.\u201d HERMIONE. Since what I am to say must be but that Which contradicts my accusation, and The testimony on my part no other But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me To say \u201cNot guilty\u201d. Mine integrity, Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it, Be so receiv\u2019d.", " HERMIONE. By this we gather You have tripp\u2019d since. POLIXENES. O my most sacred lady, Temptations have since then been born to \u2019s! for In those unfledg\u2019d days was my wife a girl; Your precious self had then not cross\u2019d the eyes Of my young play-fellow. HERMIONE. Grace to boot! Of this make no conclusion, lest you say Your queen and I are devils. Yet go on; Th\u2019 offences we have made you do we\u2019ll answer, If you first sinn\u2019d with us, and that with us You did continue fault, and that you slipp\u2019d not With any but with us.

Never but once. HERMIONE. What! have I twice said well? when was\u2019t before? I prithee tell me. Cram \u2019s with praise, and make \u2019s As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that. Our praises are our wages. You may ride \u2019s With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere With spur we heat an acre. But to th\u2019 goal: My last good deed was to entreat his stay. What was my first? It has an elder sister, Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace! But once before I spoke to the purpose\u2014when? Nay, let me have\u2019t; I long. LEONTES. Why, that was when Three crabbed months had sour\u2019d themselves to death, Ere I could make thee open thy white hand And clap thyself my love; then didst thou utter \u201cI am yours for ever.\u201d HERMIONE.", " Come, sir, away.

You\u2019ll kiss me hard, and speak to me as if I were a baby still. I love you better. SECOND LADY. And why so, my lord? MAMILLIUS. Not for because Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say, Become some women best, so that there be not Too much hair there, but in a semicircle Or a half-moon made with a pen. SECOND LADY. Who taught this? MAMILLIUS. I learn\u2019d it out of women\u2019s faces. Pray now, What colour are your eyebrows? FIRST LADY. Blue, my lord. MAMILLIUS. Nay, that\u2019s a mock. I have seen a lady\u2019s nose That has been blue, but not her eyebrows. FIRST LADY. Hark ye, The queen your mother rounds apace. We shall Present our services to a fine new prince One of these days, and then you\u2019d wanton with us, If we would have you. SECOND LADY. She is spread of late Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her! HERMIONE. What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now I am for you again. Pray you sit by us, And tell \u2019s a tale. MAMILLIUS. Merry or sad shall\u2019t be? HERMIONE. As merry as you will. MAMILLIUS. A sad tale\u2019s best for winter. I have one Of sprites and goblins. HERMIONE.", " You\u2019ll stay? POLIXENES. No, madam.

You put me off with limber vows; but I, Though you would seek t\u2019 unsphere the stars with oaths, Should yet say \u201cSir, no going.\u201d Verily, You shall not go. A lady\u2019s verily is As potent as a lord\u2019s. Will go yet? Force me to keep you as a prisoner, Not like a guest: so you shall pay your fees When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you? My prisoner or my guest? By your dread \u201cverily,\u201d One of them you shall be. POLIXENES. Your guest, then, madam. To be your prisoner should import offending; Which is for me less easy to commit Than you to punish. HERMIONE. Not your gaoler then, But your kind hostess. Come, I\u2019ll question you Of my lord\u2019s tricks and yours when you were boys. You were pretty lordings then. POLIXENES. We were, fair queen, Two lads that thought there was no more behind But such a day tomorrow as today, And to be boy eternal. HERMIONE. Was not my lord The verier wag o\u2019 th\u2019 two? POLIXENES. We were as twinn\u2019d lambs that did frisk i\u2019 th\u2019 sun And bleat the one at th\u2019 other. What we chang\u2019d Was innocence for innocence; we knew not The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream\u2019d That any did. Had we pursu\u2019d that life, And our weak spirits ne\u2019er been higher rear\u2019d With stronger blood, we should have answer\u2019d heaven Boldly \u201cNot guilty,\u201d the imposition clear\u2019d Hereditary ours."], "Who is raised by a Shepherd?": [" Say you have none.

This cannot be but a great courtier. SHEPHERD. His garments are rich, but he wears them not handsomely. CLOWN. He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical: a great man, I\u2019ll warrant; I know by the picking on\u2019s teeth. AUTOLYCUS. The fardel there? What\u2019s i\u2019 th\u2019 fardel? Wherefore that box? SHEPHERD. Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box which none must know but the king; and which he shall know within this hour, if I may come to th\u2019 speech of him. AUTOLYCUS. Age, thou hast lost thy labour. SHEPHERD. Why, sir? AUTOLYCUS. The king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a new ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for, if thou beest capable of things serious, thou must know the king is full of grief. SHEPHERD. So \u2019tis said, sir; about his son, that should have married a shepherd\u2019s daughter. AUTOLYCUS. If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly. The curses he shall have, the tortures he shall feel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster. CLOWN. Think you so, sir? AUTOLYCUS. Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to him, though removed fifty times, shall all come under the hangman: which, though it be great pity, yet it is necessary.", " SHEPHERD. An \u2019t please you, sir, to undertake the business for us, here is that gold I have. I\u2019ll make it as much more, and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you. AUTOLYCUS. After I have done what I promised? SHEPHERD. Ay, sir. AUTOLYCUS. Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business? CLOWN. In some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it. AUTOLYCUS. O, that\u2019s the case of the shepherd\u2019s son. Hang him, he\u2019ll be made an example. CLOWN. Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show our strange sights. He must know \u2019tis none of your daughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, I will give you as much as this old man does when the business is performed, and remain, as he says, your pawn till it be brought you. AUTOLYCUS. I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side; go on the right-hand. I will but look upon the hedge, and follow you. CLOWN. We are blessed in this man, as I may say, even blessed. SHEPHERD. Let\u2019s before, as he bids us. He was provided to do us good. [_Exeunt Shepherd and Clown._] AUTOLYCUS. If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would not suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I am courted now with a double occasion: gold, and a means to do the prince my master good; which who knows how that may turn back to my advancement? I will bring these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him.", " Enter Clown and Shepherd. Aside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain: every lane\u2019s end, every shop, church, session, hanging, yields a careful man work. CLOWN. See, see; what a man you are now! There is no other way but to tell the king she\u2019s a changeling, and none of your flesh and blood. SHEPHERD. Nay, but hear me. CLOWN. Nay, but hear me. SHEPHERD. Go to, then. CLOWN. She being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh and blood has not offended the king; and so your flesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show those things you found about her, those secret things, all but what she has with her: this being done, let the law go whistle, I warrant you. SHEPHERD. I will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his son\u2019s pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest man neither to his father nor to me, to go about to make me the king\u2019s brother-in-law. CLOWN. Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you could have been to him, and then your blood had been the dearer by I know how much an ounce. AUTOLYCUS. [_Aside._] Very wisely, puppies! SHEPHERD. Well, let us to the king: there is that in this fardel will make him scratch his beard. AUTOLYCUS. [_Aside._] I know not what impediment this complaint may be to the flight of my master.

And so have I, boy! CLOWN. So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my father; for the king\u2019s son took me by the hand and called me brother; and then the two kings called my father brother; and then the prince, my brother, and the princess, my sister, called my father father; and so we wept; and there was the first gentleman-like tears that ever we shed. SHEPHERD. We may live, son, to shed many more. CLOWN. Ay; or else \u2019twere hard luck, being in so preposterous estate as we are. AUTOLYCUS. I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the faults I have committed to your worship, and to give me your good report to the prince my master. SHEPHERD. Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are gentlemen. CLOWN. Thou wilt amend thy life? AUTOLYCUS. Ay, an it like your good worship. CLOWN. Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia. SHEPHERD. You may say it, but not swear it. CLOWN. Not swear it, now I am a gentleman?

I would most gladly know the issue of it. FIRST GENTLEMAN. I make a broken delivery of the business; but the changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were very notes of admiration. They seemed almost, with staring on one another, to tear the cases of their eyes. There was speech in their dumbness, language in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard of a world ransomed, or one destroyed. A notable passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest beholder, that knew no more but seeing could not say if th\u2019 importance were joy or sorrow; but in the extremity of the one, it must needs be. Here comes a gentleman that happily knows more. Enter a Gentleman. The news, Rogero? SECOND GENTLEMAN. Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled: the king\u2019s daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that ballad-makers cannot be able to express it. Here comes the Lady Paulina\u2019s steward: he can deliver you more. Enter a third Gentleman. How goes it now, sir? This news, which is called true, is so like an old tale that the verity of it is in strong suspicion. Has the king found his heir? THIRD GENTLEMAN. Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance. That which you hear you\u2019ll swear you see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle of Queen Hermione\u2019s, her jewel about the neck of it, the letters of Antigonus found with it, which they know to be his character; the majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding, and many other evidences proclaim her with all certainty to be the king\u2019s daughter.", " Here comes Bohemia.

CAMILLO. None rare, my lord. POLIXENES. The king hath on him such a countenance As he had lost some province, and a region Lov\u2019d as he loves himself. Even now I met him With customary compliment, when he, Wafting his eyes to the contrary, and falling A lip of much contempt, speeds from me, and So leaves me to consider what is breeding That changes thus his manners. CAMILLO. I dare not know, my lord. POLIXENES. How, dare not? Do not? Do you know, and dare not? Be intelligent to me? \u2019Tis thereabouts; For, to yourself, what you do know, you must, And cannot say you dare not. Good Camillo, Your chang\u2019d complexions are to me a mirror Which shows me mine chang\u2019d too; for I must be A party in this alteration, finding Myself thus alter\u2019d with\u2019t. CAMILLO. There is a sickness Which puts some of us in distemper, but I cannot name the disease, and it is caught Of you that yet are well. POLIXENES. How caught of me? Make me not sighted like the basilisk.

Thou shalt accompany us to the place, where we will, not appearing what we are, have some question with the shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not uneasy to get the cause of my son\u2019s resort thither. Prithee, be my present partner in this business, and lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia. CAMILLO. I willingly obey your command. POLIXENES. My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.

AUTOLYCUS. _When daffodils begin to peer, With, hey! the doxy over the dale, Why, then comes in the sweet o\u2019 the year, For the red blood reigns in the winter\u2019s pale._ _The white sheet bleaching on the hedge, With, hey! the sweet birds, O, how they sing! Doth set my pugging tooth on edge; For a quart of ale is a dish for a king._ _The lark, that tirra-lirra chants, With, hey! with, hey! the thrush and the jay, Are summer songs for me and my aunts, While we lie tumbling in the hay._ I have served Prince Florizel, and in my time wore three-pile, but now I am out of service. _But shall I go mourn for that, my dear? The pale moon shines by night: And when I wander here and there, I then do most go right._ _If tinkers may have leave to live, And bear the sow-skin budget, Then my account I well may give And in the stocks avouch it._ My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to lesser linen.", " PAULINA. You are one of those Would have him wed again. DION. If you would not so, You pity not the state, nor the remembrance Of his most sovereign name; consider little What dangers, by his highness\u2019 fail of issue, May drop upon his kingdom, and devour Incertain lookers-on. What were more holy Than to rejoice the former queen is well? What holier than, for royalty\u2019s repair, For present comfort, and for future good, To bless the bed of majesty again With a sweet fellow to \u2019t? PAULINA. There is none worthy, Respecting her that\u2019s gone. Besides, the gods Will have fulfill\u2019d their secret purposes; For has not the divine Apollo said, Is \u2019t not the tenor of his oracle, That king Leontes shall not have an heir Till his lost child be found? Which that it shall, Is all as monstrous to our human reason As my Antigonus to break his grave And come again to me; who, on my life, Did perish with the infant. \u2019Tis your counsel My lord should to the heavens be contrary, Oppose against their wills. [_To Leontes._] Care not for issue; The crown will find an heir. Great Alexander Left his to th\u2019 worthiest; so his successor Was like to be the best. LEONTES. Good Paulina, Who hast the memory of Hermione, I know, in honour, O that ever I Had squar\u2019d me to thy counsel!

CLEOMENES Sir, you have done enough, and have perform\u2019d A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make Which you have not redeem\u2019d; indeed, paid down More penitence than done trespass: at the last, Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil; With them, forgive yourself. LEONTES. Whilst I remember Her and her virtues, I cannot forget My blemishes in them; and so still think of The wrong I did myself: which was so much That heirless it hath made my kingdom, and Destroy\u2019d the sweet\u2019st companion that e\u2019er man Bred his hopes out of. PAULINA. True, too true, my lord. If, one by one, you wedded all the world, Or from the all that are took something good, To make a perfect woman, she you kill\u2019d Would be unparallel\u2019d. LEONTES. I think so. Kill\u2019d! She I kill\u2019d! I did so: but thou strik\u2019st me Sorely, to say I did: it is as bitter Upon thy tongue as in my thought. Now, good now, Say so but seldom.

You might have spoken a thousand things that would Have done the time more benefit and grac\u2019d Your kindness better."], "Who or what initiated the friendship between Leontes and Polixenes?": [" Would I do this?

Besides, the penitent king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling sorrows I might be some allay, or I o\u2019erween to think so,\u2014which is another spur to my departure.", " Lady, Dear queen, that ended when I but began, Give me that hand of yours to kiss. PAULINA. O, patience! The statue is but newly fix\u2019d, the colour\u2019s Not dry. CAMILLO. My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on, Which sixteen winters cannot blow away, So many summers dry. Scarce any joy Did ever so long live; no sorrow But kill\u2019d itself much sooner. POLIXENES. Dear my brother, Let him that was the cause of this have power To take off so much grief from you as he Will piece up in himself. PAULINA. Indeed, my lord, If I had thought the sight of my poor image Would thus have wrought you\u2014for the stone is mine\u2014 I\u2019d not have show\u2019d it. LEONTES. Do not draw the curtain. PAULINA. No longer shall you gaze on\u2019t, lest your fancy May think anon it moves. LEONTES. Let be, let be. Would I were dead, but that methinks already\u2014 What was he that did make it? See, my lord, Would you not deem it breath\u2019d? And that those veins Did verily bear blood? POLIXENES. Masterly done: The very life seems warm upon her lip. LEONTES. The fixture of her eye has motion in \u2019t, As we are mock\u2019d with art. PAULINA. I\u2019ll draw the curtain: My lord\u2019s almost so far transported that He\u2019ll think anon it lives. LEONTES. O sweet Paulina, Make me to think so twenty years together! No settled senses of the world can match The pleasure of that madness. Let \u2019t alone. PAULINA. I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr\u2019d you: but I could afflict you further."], "Where does Polixenes tell Camillo they will go in disguise?": [" CAMILLO. I may not answer. POLIXENES. A sickness caught of me, and yet I well? I must be answer\u2019d. Dost thou hear, Camillo, I conjure thee, by all the parts of man Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare What incidency thou dost guess of harm Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near; Which way to be prevented, if to be; If not, how best to bear it. CAMILLO. Sir, I will tell you; Since I am charg\u2019d in honour, and by him That I think honourable. Therefore mark my counsel, Which must be ev\u2019n as swiftly follow\u2019d as I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me Cry lost, and so goodnight! POLIXENES. On, good Camillo. CAMILLO. I am appointed him to murder you. POLIXENES. By whom, Camillo? CAMILLO. By the king. POLIXENES. For what? CAMILLO. He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears, As he had seen\u2019t or been an instrument To vice you to\u2019t, that you have touch\u2019d his queen Forbiddenly. POLIXENES. O, then my best blood turn To an infected jelly, and my name Be yok\u2019d with his that did betray the Best! Turn then my freshest reputation to A savour that may strike the dullest nostril Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn\u2019d, Nay, hated too, worse than the great\u2019st infection That e\u2019er was heard or read! CAMILLO. Swear his thought over By each particular star in heaven and By all their influences, you may as well Forbid the sea for to obey the moon As or by oath remove or counsel shake The fabric of his folly, whose foundation Is pil\u2019d upon his faith, and will continue The standing of his body.", " Here comes Bohemia. Enter Polixenes. POLIXENES. This is strange. Methinks My favour here begins to warp. Not speak? Good day, Camillo. CAMILLO. Hail, most royal sir! POLIXENES. What is the news i\u2019 th\u2019 court? CAMILLO. None rare, my lord. POLIXENES. The king hath on him such a countenance As he had lost some province, and a region Lov\u2019d as he loves himself. Even now I met him With customary compliment, when he, Wafting his eyes to the contrary, and falling A lip of much contempt, speeds from me, and So leaves me to consider what is breeding That changes thus his manners. CAMILLO. I dare not know, my lord. POLIXENES. How, dare not? Do not? Do you know, and dare not? Be intelligent to me? \u2019Tis thereabouts; For, to yourself, what you do know, you must, And cannot say you dare not. Good Camillo, Your chang\u2019d complexions are to me a mirror Which shows me mine chang\u2019d too; for I must be A party in this alteration, finding Myself thus alter\u2019d with\u2019t. CAMILLO. There is a sickness Which puts some of us in distemper, but I cannot name the disease, and it is caught Of you that yet are well. POLIXENES. How caught of me? Make me not sighted like the basilisk. I have look\u2019d on thousands who have sped the better By my regard, but kill\u2019d none so. Camillo,\u2014 As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto Clerk-like, experienc\u2019d, which no less adorns Our gentry than our parents\u2019 noble names, In whose success we are gentle,\u2014I beseech you, If you know aught which does behove my knowledge Thereof to be inform\u2019d, imprison\u2019t not In ignorant concealment.", " CAMILLO. I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a daughter of most rare note: the report of her is extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage. POLIXENES. That\u2019s likewise part of my intelligence: but, I fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou shalt accompany us to the place, where we will, not appearing what we are, have some question with the shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not uneasy to get the cause of my son\u2019s resort thither. Prithee, be my present partner in this business, and lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia. CAMILLO. I willingly obey your command. POLIXENES. My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.

Doth set my pugging tooth on edge; For a quart of ale is a dish for a king._ _The lark, that tirra-lirra chants, With, hey! with, hey! the thrush and the jay, Are summer songs for me and my aunts, While we lie tumbling in the hay._ I have served Prince Florizel, and in my time wore three-pile, but now I am out of service. _But shall I go mourn for that, my dear? The pale moon shines by night: And when I wander here and there, I then do most go right._ _If tinkers may have leave to live, And bear the sow-skin budget, Then my account I well may give And in the stocks avouch it._ My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to lesser linen.", " LEONTES. We are tougher, brother, Than you can put us to \u2019t. POLIXENES. No longer stay. LEONTES. One seve\u2019night longer. POLIXENES. Very sooth, tomorrow. LEONTES. We\u2019ll part the time between \u2019s then: and in that I\u2019ll no gainsaying. POLIXENES.

My affairs Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder Were, in your love a whip to me; my stay To you a charge and trouble: to save both, Farewell, our brother. LEONTES. Tongue-tied, our queen? Speak you. HERMIONE. I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until You had drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir, Charge him too coldly. Tell him you are sure All in Bohemia\u2019s well: this satisfaction The by-gone day proclaimed. Say this to him, He\u2019s beat from his best ward. LEONTES. Well said, Hermione. HERMIONE. To tell he longs to see his son were strong. But let him say so then, and let him go; But let him swear so, and he shall not stay, We\u2019ll thwack him hence with distaffs.

CLOWN. His vices, you would say; there\u2019s no virtue whipped out of the court. They cherish it to make it stay there; and yet it will no more but abide. AUTOLYCUS. Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well. He hath been since an ape-bearer, then a process-server, a bailiff. Then he compassed a motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker\u2019s wife within a mile where my land and living lies; and, having flown over many knavish professions, he settled only in rogue. Some call him Autolycus. CLOWN. Out upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts wakes, fairs, and bear-baitings. AUTOLYCUS. Very true, sir; he, sir, he; that\u2019s the rogue that put me into this apparel. CLOWN. Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia. If you had but looked big and spit at him, he\u2019d have run. AUTOLYCUS. I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter. I am false of heart that way; and that he knew, I warrant him. CLOWN. How do you now? AUTOLYCUS. Sweet sir, much better than I was. I can stand and walk: I will even take my leave of you and pace softly towards my kinsman\u2019s. CLOWN. Shall I bring thee on the way? AUTOLYCUS. No, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir. CLOWN.

Maybe he has paid you more, which will shame you to give him again. CLOWN. Is there no manners left among maids? Will they wear their plackets where they should bear their faces?

If you can behold it, I\u2019ll make the statue move indeed, descend, And take you by the hand. But then you\u2019ll think (Which I protest against) I am assisted By wicked powers. LEONTES. What you can make her do I am content to look on: what to speak, I am content to hear; for \u2019tis as easy To make her speak as move. PAULINA. It is requir\u2019d You do awake your faith. Then all stand still; Or those that think it is unlawful business I am about, let them depart. LEONTES. Proceed: No foot shall stir. PAULINA. Music, awake her: strike! [_Music._] \u2019Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach; Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come; I\u2019ll fill your grave up: stir; nay, come away.

I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a daughter of most rare note: the report of her is extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage. POLIXENES. That\u2019s likewise part of my intelligence: but, I fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou shalt accompany us to the place, where we will, not appearing what we are, have some question with the shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not uneasy to get the cause of my son\u2019s resort thither. Prithee, be my present partner in this business, and lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia. CAMILLO. I willingly obey your command. POLIXENES. My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.

Once a day I\u2019ll visit The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there Shall be my recreation. So long as nature Will bear up with this exercise, so long I daily vow to use it.

On mine honour, I\u2019ll point you where you shall have such receiving As shall become your highness; where you may Enjoy your mistress; from the whom, I see, There\u2019s no disjunction to be made, but by, As heavens forfend, your ruin.

This your sheep-shearing Is as a meeting of the petty gods, And you the queen on \u2019t. PERDITA. Sir, my gracious lord, To chide at your extremes it not becomes me; O, pardon that I name them! Your high self, The gracious mark o\u2019 th\u2019 land, you have obscur\u2019d With a swain\u2019s wearing, and me, poor lowly maid, Most goddess-like prank\u2019d up. But that our feasts In every mess have folly, and the feeders Digest it with a custom, I should blush To see you so attir\u2019d; swoon, I think, To show myself a glass. FLORIZEL. I bless the time When my good falcon made her flight across Thy father\u2019s ground. PERDITA. Now Jove afford you cause! To me the difference forges dread. Your greatness Hath not been us\u2019d to fear. Even now I tremble To think your father, by some accident, Should pass this way, as you did. O, the Fates! How would he look to see his work, so noble, Vilely bound up?", " PERDITA. I see the play so lies That I must bear a part. CAMILLO. No remedy. Have you done there? FLORIZEL.

O Perdita, what have we twain forgot? Pray you a word. [_They converse apart._] CAMILLO.

FLORIZEL. Fortune speed us! Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side. CAMILLO. The swifter speed the better. [_Exeunt Florizel, Perdita and Camillo._] AUTOLYCUS. I understand the business, I hear it. To have an open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite also, to smell out work for the other senses. I see this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive. What an exchange had this been without boot! What a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do this year connive at us, and we may do anything extempore. The prince himself is about a piece of iniquity, stealing away from his father with his clog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of honesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not do\u2019t: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it; and therein am I constant to my profession.", " POLIXENES.

And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to\u2019t. I give my daughter to him, and will make Her portion equal his. FLORIZEL. O, that must be I\u2019 th\u2019 virtue of your daughter: one being dead, I shall have more than you can dream of yet; Enough then for your wonder. But come on, Contract us \u2019fore these witnesses. SHEPHERD. Come, your hand; And, daughter, yours. POLIXENES. Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you; Have you a father? FLORIZEL. I have; but what of him? POLIXENES. Knows he of this? FLORIZEL. He neither does nor shall. POLIXENES. Methinks a father Is at the nuptial of his son a guest That best becomes the table. Pray you once more, Is not your father grown incapable Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid With age and alt\u2019ring rheums? can he speak? hear? Know man from man? dispute his own estate? Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing But what he did being childish? FLORIZEL. No, good sir; He has his health, and ampler strength indeed Than most have of his age. POLIXENES. By my white beard, You offer him, if this be so, a wrong Something unfilial: reason my son Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason The father, all whose joy is nothing else But fair posterity, should hold some counsel In such a business.", " LORD.

I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages, how it takes up the shore! But that\u2019s not to the point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls! sometimes to see \u2019em, and not to see \u2019em. Now the ship boring the moon with her mainmast, and anon swallowed with yest and froth, as you\u2019d thrust a cork into a hogshead. And then for the land service, to see how the bear tore out his shoulder-bone, how he cried to me for help, and said his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragon\u2019d it: but first, how the poor souls roared, and the sea mocked them, and how the poor gentleman roared, and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than the sea or weather. SHEPHERD. Name of mercy, when was this, boy? CLOWN. Now, now. I have not winked since I saw these sights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor the bear half dined on the gentleman. He\u2019s at it now. SHEPHERD. Would I had been by to have helped the old man! CLOWN. I would you had been by the ship side, to have helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.

If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on the like occasion whereon my services are now on foot, you shall see, as I have said, great difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia. CAMILLO. I think this coming summer the King of Sicilia means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him. ARCHIDAMUS. Wherein our entertainment shall shame us; we will be justified in our loves. For indeed,\u2014 CAMILLO. Beseech you\u2014 ARCHIDAMUS. Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge. We cannot with such magnificence\u2014in so rare\u2014I know not what to say.

You pay a great deal too dear for what\u2019s given freely. ARCHIDAMUS. Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me and as mine honesty puts it to utterance. CAMILLO. Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia. They were trained together in their childhoods, and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection which cannot choose but branch now. Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their society, their encounters, though not personal, have been royally attorneyed with interchange of gifts, letters, loving embassies, that they have seemed to be together, though absent; shook hands, as over a vast; and embraced as it were from the ends of opposed winds.", " Should all despair That hath revolted wives, the tenth of mankind Would hang themselves.

LEONTES. My true Paulina, We shall not marry till thou bid\u2019st us. PAULINA. That Shall be when your first queen\u2019s again in breath; Never till then.", " FLORIZEL. I think you have As little skill to fear as I have purpose To put you to \u2019t. But, come; our dance, I pray. Your hand, my Perdita. So turtles pair That never mean to part. PERDITA. I\u2019ll swear for \u2019em. POLIXENES. This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever Ran on the green-sward. Nothing she does or seems But smacks of something greater than herself, Too noble for this place. CAMILLO. He tells her something That makes her blood look out. Good sooth, she is The queen of curds and cream. CLOWN. Come on, strike up. DORCAS. Mopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic, to mend her kissing with! MOPSA. Now, in good time! CLOWN. Not a word, a word; we stand upon our manners. Come, strike up. [_Music. Here a dance Of Shepherds and Shepherdesses._] POLIXENES. Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this Which dances with your daughter? SHEPHERD. They call him Doricles; and boasts himself To have a worthy feeding. But I have it Upon his own report, and I believe it. He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter. I think so too; for never gaz\u2019d the moon Upon the water as he\u2019ll stand and read, As \u2019twere, my daughter\u2019s eyes. And, to be plain, I think there is not half a kiss to choose Who loves another best. POLIXENES. She dances featly. SHEPHERD. So she does anything, though I report it That should be silent. If young Doricles Do light upon her, she shall bring him that Which he not dreams of.", " Enter a Servant. SERVANT. One that gives out himself Prince Florizel, Son of Polixenes, with his princess (she The fairest I have yet beheld) desires access To your high presence. LEONTES. What with him? he comes not Like to his father\u2019s greatness: his approach, So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us \u2019Tis not a visitation fram\u2019d, but forc\u2019d By need and accident. What train? SERVANT. But few, And those but mean. LEONTES. His princess, say you, with him? SERVANT. Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think, That e\u2019er the sun shone bright on. PAULINA. O Hermione, As every present time doth boast itself Above a better gone, so must thy grave Give way to what\u2019s seen now! Sir, you yourself Have said and writ so,\u2014but your writing now Is colder than that theme,\u2014\u2018She had not been, Nor was not to be equall\u2019d\u2019; thus your verse Flow\u2019d with her beauty once; \u2019tis shrewdly ebb\u2019d, To say you have seen a better. SERVANT. Pardon, madam: The one I have almost forgot,\u2014your pardon;\u2014 The other, when she has obtain\u2019d your eye, Will have your tongue too. This is a creature, Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal Of all professors else; make proselytes Of who she but bid follow. PAULINA. How! not women? SERVANT. Women will love her that she is a woman More worth than any man; men, that she is The rarest of all women. LEONTES. Go, Cleomenes; Yourself, assisted with your honour\u2019d friends, Bring them to our embracement.", " Here comes Bohemia. Enter Polixenes. POLIXENES. This is strange. Methinks My favour here begins to warp. Not speak? Good day, Camillo. CAMILLO. Hail, most royal sir! POLIXENES. What is the news i\u2019 th\u2019 court? CAMILLO. None rare, my lord. POLIXENES. The king hath on him such a countenance As he had lost some province, and a region Lov\u2019d as he loves himself. Even now I met him With customary compliment, when he, Wafting his eyes to the contrary, and falling A lip of much contempt, speeds from me, and So leaves me to consider what is breeding That changes thus his manners. CAMILLO. I dare not know, my lord. POLIXENES. How, dare not? Do not? Do you know, and dare not? Be intelligent to me? \u2019Tis thereabouts; For, to yourself, what you do know, you must, And cannot say you dare not. Good Camillo, Your chang\u2019d complexions are to me a mirror Which shows me mine chang\u2019d too; for I must be A party in this alteration, finding Myself thus alter\u2019d with\u2019t. CAMILLO. There is a sickness Which puts some of us in distemper, but I cannot name the disease, and it is caught Of you that yet are well. POLIXENES. How caught of me? Make me not sighted like the basilisk. I have look\u2019d on thousands who have sped the better By my regard, but kill\u2019d none so. Camillo,\u2014 As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto Clerk-like, experienc\u2019d, which no less adorns Our gentry than our parents\u2019 noble names, In whose success we are gentle,\u2014I beseech you, If you know aught which does behove my knowledge Thereof to be inform\u2019d, imprison\u2019t not In ignorant concealment."], "In Sicilia, what do people say about Perdita?": [" CAMILLO.

Besides, you know Prosperity\u2019s the very bond of love, Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together Affliction alters. PERDITA. One of these is true: I think affliction may subdue the cheek, But not take in the mind. CAMILLO. Yea, say you so? There shall not at your father\u2019s house, these seven years Be born another such. FLORIZEL. My good Camillo, She is as forward of her breeding as She is i\u2019 th\u2019 rear our birth. CAMILLO.

So much the more our carver\u2019s excellence, Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her As she liv\u2019d now. LEONTES. As now she might have done, So much to my good comfort as it is Now piercing to my soul.
