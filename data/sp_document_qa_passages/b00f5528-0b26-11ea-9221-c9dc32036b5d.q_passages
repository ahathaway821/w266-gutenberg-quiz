PAULINA. What, sovereign sir, I did not well, I meant well. All my services You have paid home: but that you have vouchsaf\u2019d, With your crown\u2019d brother and these your contracted Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit, It is a surplus of your grace which never My life may last to answer. LEONTES. O Paulina, We honour you with trouble. But we came To see the statue of our queen: your gallery Have we pass\u2019d through, not without much content In many singularities; but we saw not That which my daughter came to look upon, The statue of her mother.", " CAMILLO.

I am appointed him to murder you. POLIXENES. By whom, Camillo? CAMILLO. By the king. POLIXENES. For what? CAMILLO. He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears, As he had seen\u2019t or been an instrument To vice you to\u2019t, that you have touch\u2019d his queen Forbiddenly. POLIXENES.

Turn then my freshest reputation to A savour that may strike the dullest nostril Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn\u2019d, Nay, hated too, worse than the great\u2019st infection That e\u2019er was heard or read! CAMILLO. Swear his thought over By each particular star in heaven and By all their influences, you may as well Forbid the sea for to obey the moon As or by oath remove or counsel shake The fabric of his folly, whose foundation Is pil\u2019d upon his faith, and will continue The standing of his body.", " I must Forsake the court: to do\u2019t, or no, is certain To me a break-neck.

What is the news i\u2019 th\u2019 court? CAMILLO. None rare, my lord. POLIXENES. The king hath on him such a countenance As he had lost some province, and a region Lov\u2019d as he loves himself. Even now I met him With customary compliment, when he, Wafting his eyes to the contrary, and falling A lip of much contempt, speeds from me, and So leaves me to consider what is breeding That changes thus his manners. CAMILLO. I dare not know, my lord. POLIXENES. How, dare not? Do not? Do you know, and dare not? Be intelligent to me? \u2019Tis thereabouts; For, to yourself, what you do know, you must, And cannot say you dare not.

All my services You have paid home: but that you have vouchsaf\u2019d, With your crown\u2019d brother and these your contracted Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit, It is a surplus of your grace which never My life may last to answer.

I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr\u2019d you: but I could afflict you further. LEONTES. Do, Paulina; For this affliction has a taste as sweet As any cordial comfort. Still methinks There is an air comes from her. What fine chisel Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me, For I will kiss her! PAULINA. Good my lord, forbear: The ruddiness upon her lip is wet; You\u2019ll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain? LEONTES. No, not these twenty years. PERDITA. So long could I Stand by, a looker on. PAULINA. Either forbear, Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you For more amazement.

Though I have for the most part been aired abroad, I desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling sorrows I might be some allay, or I o\u2019erween to think so,\u2014which is another spur to my departure. POLIXENES. As thou lov\u2019st me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of thy services by leaving me now: the need I have of thee, thine own goodness hath made; better not to have had thee than thus to want thee. Thou, having made me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute them thyself, or take away with thee the very services thou hast done, which if I have not enough considered (as too much I cannot) to be more thankful to thee shall be my study; and my profit therein the heaping friendships."], "Camillo has trouble with ___.": [" What!
