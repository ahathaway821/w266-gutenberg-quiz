But the truth is that in dialogue Shakespeare\u2019s language passes so rapidly from verse to prose and from prose to verse, sometimes even hovering, as it were, over the confines, being rhythmical rather than metrical, that all attempts to give regularity to the metre must be made with diffidence and received with doubt.

But the truth is that in dialogue Shakespeare\u2019s language passes so rapidly from verse to prose and from prose to verse, sometimes even hovering, as it were, over the confines, being rhythmical rather than metrical, that all attempts to give regularity to the metre must be made with diffidence and received with doubt.

But the truth is that in dialogue Shakespeare\u2019s language passes so rapidly from verse to prose and from prose to verse, sometimes even hovering, as it were, over the confines, being rhythmical rather than metrical, that all attempts to give regularity to the metre must be made with diffidence and received with doubt.

Prospero, too, repeats his promise, and marks his contentment by further shortening the time of servitude, \u2018within two days,\u2019 I. 2. 420. Possibly \u2018Invisible\u2019 (301) should have a line to itself. Words thus occupying a broken line acquire a marked emphasis. But the truth is that in dialogue Shakespeare\u2019s language passes so rapidly from verse to prose and from prose to verse, sometimes even hovering, as it were, over the confines, being rhythmical rather than metrical, that all attempts to give regularity to the metre must be made with diffidence and received with doubt.
