What, ho! slave! Caliban! Thou earth, thou! speak. _Cal._ [_within_] There\u2019s wood enough within. _Pros._ Come forth, I say! there\u2019s other business for thee: 315 Come, thou tortoise! when? _Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymph._ Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel, Hark in thine ear. _Ari._ My lord, it shall be done.

[_Exit Ariel._] How fares my gracious sir? There are yet missing of your company Some few odd lads that you remember not. 255 _Re-enter ARIEL, driving in CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, in their stolen apparel._ _Ste._ Every man shift for all the rest, and let no man take care for himself; for all is but fortune. --Coragio, bully-monster, coragio! _Trin._ If these be true spies which I wear in my head, here\u2019s a goodly sight. 260 _Cal._ O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed! How fine my master is! I am afraid He will chastise me. _Seb._ Ha, ha! What things are these, my lord Antonio? Will money buy \u2019em? _Ant._ Very like; one of them 265 Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable. _Pros._ Mark but the badges of these men, my lords, Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave, His mother was a witch; and one so strong That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs, 270 And deal in her command, without her power. These three have robb\u2019d me; and this demi-devil-- For he\u2019s a bastard one--had plotted with them To take my life.

Speak not you for him; he\u2019s a traitor. Come; 460 I\u2019ll manacle thy neck and feet together: Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be The fresh-brook muscles, wither\u2019d roots, and husks Wherein the acorn cradled.

[_Draws, and is charmed from moving._ _Mir._ O dear father, Make not too rash a trial of him, for He\u2019s gentle, and not fearful. _Pros._ What! I say, My foot my tutor?

What! An advocate for an impostor! hush! Thou think\u2019st there is no more such shapes as he, Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench! To the most of men this is a Caliban, 480 And they to him are angels. _Mir._ My affections Are, then, most humble; I have no ambition To see a goodlier man. _Pros._ Come on; obey: Thy nerves are in their infancy again, And have no vigour in them.", " Is not this true? _Ari._ Ay, sir. _Pros._ This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child, And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave, 270 As thou report\u2019st thyself, wast then her servant; And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate To act her earthy and abhorr\u2019d commands, Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee, By help of her more potent ministers, 275 And in her most unmitigable rage, Into a cloven pine; within which rift Imprison\u2019d thou didst painfully remain A dozen years; within which space she died, And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans 280 As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island-- Save for the son that she did litter here, A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour\u2019d with A human shape. _Ari._ Yes, Caliban her son. _Pros._ Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban, 285 Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know\u2019st What torment I did find thee in; thy groans Did make wolves howl, and penetrate the breasts Of ever-angry bears: it was a torment To lay upon the damn\u2019d, which Sycorax 290 Could not again undo: it was mine art, When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape The pine, and let thee out. _Ari._ I thank thee, master. _Pros._ If thou more murmur\u2019st, I will rend an oak, And peg thee in his knotty entrails, till 295 Thou hast howl\u2019d away twelve winters. _Ari._ Pardon, master: I will be correspondent to command, And do my spiriting gently."], "Over how manydays does the action of The Tempest take place?": [" O Ferdinand, Do not smile at me that I boast her off, For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise, 10 And make it halt behind her. _Fer._ I do believe it Against an oracle. _Pros._ Then, as my gift, and thine own acquisition Worthily purchased, take my daughter: but If thou dost break her virgin-knot before 15 All sanctimonious ceremonies may With full and holy rite be minister\u2019d, No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall To make this contract grow; but barren hate, Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew 20 The union of your bed with weeds so loathly That you shall hate it both: therefore take heed, As Hymen\u2019s lamps shall light you. _Fer._ As I hope For quiet days, fair issue and long life, With such love as \u2019tis now, the murkiest den, 25 The most opportune place, the strong\u2019st suggestion Our worser Genius can, shall never melt Mine honour into lust, to take away The edge of that day\u2019s celebration When I shall think, or Ph\u0153bus\u2019 steeds are founder\u2019d, 30 Or Night kept chain\u2019d below. _Pros._ Fairly spoke. Sit, then, and talk with her; she is thine own. What, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel! _Enter ARIEL._ _Ari._ What would my potent master? here I am. _Pros._ Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service 35 Did worthily perform; and I must use you In such another trick. Go bring the rabble, O\u2019er whom I give thee power, here to this place: Incite them to quick motion; for I must Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple 40 Some vanity of mine art: it is my promise, And they expect it from me.", " How\u2019s the day? _Ari._ On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord, You said our work should cease. _Pros._ I did say so, 5 When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit, How fares the king and\u2019s followers? _Ari._ Confined together In the same fashion as you gave in charge, Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir, In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell; 10 They cannot budge till your release. The king, His brother, and yours, abide all three distracted, And the remainder mourning over them, Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly Him that you term\u2019d, sir, \u201cThe good old lord, Gonzalo;\u201d 15 His tears run down his beard, like winter\u2019s drops From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works \u2019em, That if you now beheld them, your affections Would become tender. _Pros._ Dost thou think so, spirit? _Ari._ Mine would, sir, were I human. _Pros._ And mine shall. 20 Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling Of their afflictions, and shall not myself, One of their kind, that relish all as sharply, Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art? Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick, 25 Yet with my nobler reason \u2019gainst my fury Do I take part: the rarer action is In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent, The sole drift of my purpose doth extend Not a frown further.

Do you understand me? _Seb._ Methinks I do. _Ant._ And how does your content 260 Tender your own good fortune? _Seb._ I remember You did supplant your brother Prospero. _Ant._ True: And look how well my garments sit upon me; Much feater than before: my brother\u2019s servants Were then my fellows; now they are my men. 265 _Seb._ But for your conscience. _Ant._ Ay, sir; where lies that? if \u2019twere a kibe, \u2019Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences, That stand \u2019twixt me and Milan, candied be they, 270 And melt, ere they molest! Here lies your brother, No better than the earth he lies upon, If he were that which now he\u2019s like, that\u2019s dead; Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it, Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus, 275 To the perpetual wink for aye might put This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who Should not upbraid our course.", " There stand, 60 For you are spell-stopp\u2019d.

O good Gonzalo, My true preserver, and a loyal sir To him thou follow\u2019st! I will pay thy graces 70 Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter: Thy brother was a furtherer in the act. Thou art pinch\u2019d for\u2019t now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood, You, brother mine, that entertain\u2019d ambition, 75 Expell\u2019d remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,-- Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,-- Would here have kill\u2019d your king; I do forgive thee, Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding Begins to swell; and the approaching tide 80 Will shortly fill the reasonable shore, That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them That yet looks on me, or would know me: Ariel, Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell: I will discase me, and myself present 85 As I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit; Thou shalt ere long be free. _ARIEL sings and helps to attire him._ Where the bee sucks, there suck I: In a cowslip\u2019s bell I lie; There I couch when owls do cry. 90 On the bat\u2019s back I do fly After summer merrily.

Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort. 25 The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch\u2019d The very virtue of compassion in thee, I have with such provision in mine art So safely order\u2019d, that there is no soul, No, not so much perdition as an hair 30 Betid to any creature in the vessel Which thou heard\u2019st cry, which thou saw\u2019st sink. Sit down; For thou must now know farther. _Mir._ You have often Begun to tell me what I am; but stopp\u2019d, And left me to a bootless inquisition, 35 Concluding \u201cStay: not yet.\u201d _Pros._ The hour\u2019s now come; The very minute bids thee ope thine ear; Obey, and be attentive.", " _Ste._ Four legs and two voices,--a most delicate monster! His forward voice, now, is to speak well of his friend; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract. 85 If all the wine in my bottle will recover him, I will help his ague. Come:--Amen! I will pour some in thy other mouth. _Trin._ Stephano! _Ste._ Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy! 90 This is a devil, and no monster: I will leave him; I have no long spoon. _Trin._ Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me, and speak to me; for I am Trinculo,--be not afeard,--thy good friend Trinculo. 95 _Ste._ If thou beest Trinculo, come forth: I\u2019ll pull thee by the lesser legs: if any be Trinculo\u2019s legs, these are they. Thou art very Trinculo indeed! How earnest thou to be the siege of this moon-calf? can he vent Trinculos? _Trin._ I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke. 100 But art thou not drowned, Stephano? I hope, now, thou art not drowned. Is the storm overblown? I hid me under the dead moon-calf\u2019s gaberdine for fear of the storm. And art thou living, Stephano? O Stephano, two Neapolitans scaped! 105 _Ste._ Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not constant. _Cal._ [_aside_] These be fine things, an if they be not sprites. That\u2019s a brave god, and bears celestial liquor: I will kneel to him. 110 _Ste._ How didst thou \u2019scape? How camest thou hither? swear, by this bottle, how thou camest hither.", " What is the news? 220 _Boats._ The best news is, that we have safely found Our king and company; the next, our ship-- Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split-- Is tight and yare and bravely rigg\u2019d, as when We first put out to sea. _Ari._ [_Aside to Pros._] Sir, all this service 225 Have I done since I went. _Pros._ [_Aside to Ari._] My tricksy spirit! _Alon._ These are not natural events; they strengthen From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither? _Boats._ If I did think, sir, I were well awake, I\u2019ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep, 230 And--how we know not--all clapp\u2019d under hatches; Where, but even now, with strange and several noises Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains, And more diversity of sounds, all horrible, We were awaked; straightway, at liberty; 235 Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld Our royal, good, and gallant ship; our master Capering to eye her:--on a trice, so please you, Even in a dream, were we divided from them, And were brought moping hither. _Ari._ [_Aside to Pros._] Was\u2019t well done? 240 _Pros._ [_Aside to Ari._] Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free. _Alon._ This is as strange a maze as e\u2019er men trod; And there is in this business more than nature Was ever conduct of: some oracle Must rectify our knowledge. _Pros._ Sir, my liege, 245 Do not infest your mind with beating on The strangeness of this business; at pick\u2019d leisure Which shall be shortly, single I\u2019ll resolve you, Which to you shall seem probable, of every These happen\u2019d accidents; till when, be cheerful, 250 And think of each thing well.", " _(which shall be shortly single)_ Ff. 253: [Exit Ariel] Capell. 256: SCENE VI.

I mean, in a sort. _Ant._ That sort was well fished for. _Gon._ When I wore it at your daughter\u2019s marriage? _Alon._ You cram these words into mine ears against 100 The stomach of my sense. Would I had never Married my daughter there! for, coming thence, My son is lost, and, in my rate, she too. Who is so far from Italy removed I ne\u2019er again shall see her. O thou mine heir 105 Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish Hath made his meal on thee? _Fran._ Sir, he may live: I saw him beat the surges under him, And ride upon their backs; he trod the water. Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted 110 The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head \u2019Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar\u2019d Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke To the shore, that o\u2019er his wave-worn basis bow\u2019d, As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt 115 He came alive to land. _Alon._ No, no, he\u2019s gone. _Seb._ Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss, That would not bless our Europe with your daughter, But rather lose her to an African; Where she, at least, is banish\u2019d from your eye, 120 Who hath cause to wet the grief on\u2019t.", " 125 [_Aside to Seb. and Ant._] But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded, I here could pluck his Highness\u2019 frown upon you, And justify you traitors: at this time I will tell no tales. _Seb._ [_Aside_] The devil speaks in him. _Pros._ No. For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother 130 Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive Thy rankest fault,--all of them; and require My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know, Thou must restore. _Alon._ If thou be\u2019st Prospero, Give us particulars of thy preservation; 135 How thou hast met us here, who three hours since Were wreck\u2019d upon this shore; where I have lost-- How sharp the point of this remembrance is!-- My dear son Ferdinand. _Pros._ I am woe for\u2019t, sir. _Alon._ Irreparable is the loss; and patience 140 Says it is past her cure. _Pros._ I rather think You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace For the like loss I have her sovereign aid, And rest myself content. _Alon._ You the like loss! _Pros._ As great to me as late; and, supportable 145 To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker Than you may call to comfort you, for I Have lost my daughter. _Alon._ A daughter? O heavens, that they were living both in Naples, The king and queen there! that they were, I wish 150 Myself were mudded in that oozy bed Where my son lies. When did you lose you daughter? _Pros._ In this last tempest. I perceive, these lords At this encounter do so much admire, That they devour their reason, and scarce think 155 Their eyes do offices of truth, their words Are natural breath: but, howsoe\u2019er you have Been justled from your senses, know for certain That I am Prospero, and that very duke Which was thrust forth of Milan; who most strangely 160 Upon this shore, where you were wreck\u2019d, was landed, To be the Lord on\u2019t.", " There stand, 60 For you are spell-stopp\u2019d. Holy Gonzalo, honourable man, Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine, Fall fellowly drops.

O good Gonzalo, My true preserver, and a loyal sir To him thou follow\u2019st! I will pay thy graces 70 Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter: Thy brother was a furtherer in the act. Thou art pinch\u2019d for\u2019t now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood, You, brother mine, that entertain\u2019d ambition, 75 Expell\u2019d remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,-- Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,-- Would here have kill\u2019d your king; I do forgive thee, Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding Begins to swell; and the approaching tide 80 Will shortly fill the reasonable shore, That now lies foul and muddy.

What shall I do? say what; what shall I do? 300 _Pros._ Go make thyself like a nymph o\u2019 the sea: Be subject to no sight but thine and mine; invisible To every eyeball else. Go take this shape, And hither come in\u2019t: go, hence with diligence! [_Exit Ariel._ Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well; 305 Awake! _Mir._ The strangeness of your story put Heaviness in me. _Pros._ Shake it off. Come on; We\u2019ll visit Caliban my slave, who never Yields us kind answer. _Mir._ \u2019Tis a villain, sir, I do not love to look on. _Pros._ But, as \u2019tis, 310 We cannot miss him: he does make our fire, Fetch in our wood, and serves in offices That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban! Thou earth, thou! speak. _Cal._ [_within_] There\u2019s wood enough within. _Pros._ Come forth, I say! there\u2019s other business for thee: 315 Come, thou tortoise! when? _Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymph._ Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel, Hark in thine ear. _Ari._ My lord, it shall be done. [_Exit._ _Pros._ Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself Upon thy wicked dam, come forth! 320 _Enter CALIBAN._ _Cal._ As wicked dew as e\u2019er my mother brush\u2019d With raven\u2019s feather from unwholesome fen Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye And blister you all o\u2019er! _Pros._ For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps, 325 Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins Shall, for that vast of night that they may work, All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch\u2019d As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging Than bees that made \u2019em.", " _Ste._ Monster, I will kill this man: his daughter and I will be king and queen,--save our Graces!--and Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou like the plot, Trinculo? 105 _Trin._ Excellent. _Ste._ Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee; but, while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head. _Cal._ Within this half hour will he be asleep: Wilt thou destroy him then? _Ste._ Ay, on mine honour. 110 _Ari._ This will I tell my master. _Cal._ Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure: Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch You taught me but while-ere? _Ste._ At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any 115 reason. --Come on. Trinculo, let us sing. [_Sings._ Flout \u2019em and scout \u2019em, and scout \u2019em and flout \u2019em; Thought is free. _Cal._ That\u2019s not the tune. [_Ariel plays the tune on a tabor and pipe._ _Ste._ What is this same? 120 _Trin._ This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture of Nobody. _Ste._ If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness: if thou beest a devil, take\u2019t as thou list. _Trin._ O, forgive me my sins! 125 _Ste._ He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy upon us! _Cal._ Art thou afeard? _Ste._ No, monster, not I. _Cal._ Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises, 130 Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not. Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments Will hum about mine ears; and sometime voices, That, if I then had waked after long sleep, Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming, 135 The clouds methought would open, and show riches Ready to drop upon me; that, when I waked, I cried to dream again.", " [_Aside to Ari._] Come hither, spirit: Set Caliban and his companions free; Untie the spell. [_Exit Ariel._] How fares my gracious sir? There are yet missing of your company Some few odd lads that you remember not. 255 _Re-enter ARIEL, driving in CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, in their stolen apparel._ _Ste._ Every man shift for all the rest, and let no man take care for himself; for all is but fortune. --Coragio, bully-monster, coragio! _Trin._ If these be true spies which I wear in my head, here\u2019s a goodly sight. 260 _Cal._ O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed! How fine my master is! I am afraid He will chastise me. _Seb._ Ha, ha! What things are these, my lord Antonio? Will money buy \u2019em? _Ant._ Very like; one of them 265 Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable. _Pros._ Mark but the badges of these men, my lords, Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave, His mother was a witch; and one so strong That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs, 270 And deal in her command, without her power. These three have robb\u2019d me; and this demi-devil-- For he\u2019s a bastard one--had plotted with them To take my life. Two of these fellows you Must know and own; this thing of darkness I 275 Acknowledge mine. _Cal._ I shall be pinch\u2019d to death. _Alon._ Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler? _Seb._ He is drunk now: where had he wine? _Alon._ And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they Find this grand liquor that hath gilded \u2019em?-- 280 How camest thou in this pickle?", " _Fer._ No, as I am a man. _Mir._ There\u2019s nothing ill can dwell in such a temple: If the ill spirit have so fair a house, Good things will strive to dwell with\u2019t. _Pros._ Follow me. Speak not you for him; he\u2019s a traitor. Come; 460 I\u2019ll manacle thy neck and feet together: Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be The fresh-brook muscles, wither\u2019d roots, and husks Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow. _Fer._ No; I will resist such entertainment till 465 Mine enemy has more power. [_Draws, and is charmed from moving._ _Mir._ O dear father, Make not too rash a trial of him, for He\u2019s gentle, and not fearful. _Pros._ What! I say, My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor; Who makest a show, but darest not strike, thy conscience 470 Is so possess\u2019d with guilt: come from thy ward; For I can here disarm thee with this stick And make thy weapon drop. _Mir._ Beseech you, father. _Pros._ Hence! hang not on my garments. _Mir._ Sir, have pity; I\u2019ll be his surety. _Pros._ Silence! one word more 475 Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What! An advocate for an impostor! hush! Thou think\u2019st there is no more such shapes as he, Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench! To the most of men this is a Caliban, 480 And they to him are angels. _Mir._ My affections Are, then, most humble; I have no ambition To see a goodlier man. _Pros._ Come on; obey: Thy nerves are in their infancy again, And have no vigour in them."], "Who helped Prosperoand Miranda to flee Italy?": [" _Mir._ You look wearily. _Fer._ No, noble mistress; \u2019tis fresh morning with me When you are by at night. I do beseech you,-- Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers,-- 35 What is your name? _Mir._ Miranda. --O my father, I have broke your hest to say so! _Fer._ Admired Miranda! Indeed the top of admiration! worth What\u2019s dearest to the world! Full many a lady I have eyed with best regard, and many a time 40 The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues Have I liked several women; never any With so full soul, but some defect in her Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed, 45 And put it to the foil: but you, O you, So perfect and so peerless, are created Of every creature\u2019s best! _Mir._ I do not know One of my sex; no woman\u2019s face remember, Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen 50 More that I may call men than you, good friend, And my dear father: how features are abroad, I am skilless of; but, by my modesty, The jewel in my dower, I would not wish Any companion in the world but you; 55 Nor can imagination form a shape, Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle Something too wildly, and my father\u2019s precepts I therein do forget. _Fer._ I am, in my condition, A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king; 60 I would, not so!--and would no more endure This wooden slavery than to suffer The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak: The very instant that I saw you, did My heart fly to your service; there resides, 65 To make me slave to it; and for your sake Am I this patient log-man.", " 85 _Ant._ And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring forth more islands. _Gon._ Ay. _Ant._ Why, in good time. _Gon._ Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now 90 as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage of your daughter, who is now queen. _Ant._ And the rarest that e\u2019er came there. _Seb._ Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido. _Ant._ O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido. 95 _Gon._ Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I wore it?

I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not 40 Out three years old. _Mir._ Certainly, sir, I can. _Pros._ By what? by any other house or person? Of any thing the image tell me that Hath kept with thy remembrance. _Mir._ \u2019Tis far off, And rather like a dream than an assurance 45 That my remembrance warrants. Had I not Four or five women once that tended me? _Pros._ Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else In the dark backward and abysm of time? 50 If thou remember\u2019st ought ere thou camest here, How thou camest here thou mayst. _Mir._ But that I do not. _Pros._ Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since, Thy father was the Duke of Milan, and A prince of power. _Mir._ Sir, are not you my father? 55 _Pros._ Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father Was Duke of Milan; and his only heir And princess, no worse issued. _Mir._ O the heavens! What foul play had we, that we came from thence? 60 Or blessed was\u2019t we did? _Pros._ Both, both, my girl: By foul play, as thou say\u2019st, were we heaved thence; But blessedly holp hither. _Mir._ O, my heart bleeds To think o\u2019 the teen that I have turn\u2019d you to. Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther. 65 _Pros._ My brother, and thy uncle, call\u2019d Antonio,-- I pray thee, mark me,--that a brother should Be so perfidious!--he whom, next thyself, Of all the world I loved, and to him put The manage of my state; as, at that time, 70 Through all the signories it was the first, And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed In dignity, and for the liberal arts Without a parallel; those being all my study, The government I cast upon my brother, 75 And to my state grew stranger, being transported And rapt in secret studies.", " No more yet of this; For \u2019tis a chronicle of day by day, Not a relation for a breakfast, nor Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir; 165 This cell\u2019s my court: here have I few attendants, And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.

[_Kneels._ _Alon._ Now all the blessings Of a glad father compass thee about! 180 Arise, and say how thou camest here. _Mir._ O, wonder! How many goodly creatures are there here! How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world, That has such people in\u2019t! _Pros._ \u2019Tis new to thee. _Alon._ What is this maid with whom thou wast at play? 185 Your eld\u2019st acquaintance cannot be three hours: Is she the goddess that hath sever\u2019d us, And brought us thus together? _Fer._ Sir, she is mortal; But by immortal Providence she\u2019s mine: I chose her when I could not ask my father 190 For his advice, nor thought I had one."], "Where does Arielput the mariners and Boatswain after the tempest?": [" Librarian Of Trinity College, Cambridge. _VOLUME I._ Cambridge and London: MACMILLAN AND CO. 1863.

Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil Would not infect his reason? _Ari._ Not a soul But felt a fever of the mad, and play\u2019d Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners 210 Plunged in the foaming brine, and quit the vessel, Then all afire with me: the king\u2019s son, Ferdinand, With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,-- Was the first man that leap\u2019d; cried, \u201cHell is empty, And all the devils are here.\u201d _Pros._ Why, that\u2019s my spirit! 215 But was not this nigh shore? _Ari._ Close by, my master. _Pros._ But are they, Ariel, safe? _Ari._ Not a hair perish\u2019d; On their sustaining garments not a blemish, But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me, In troops I have dispersed them \u2019bout the isle. 220 The king\u2019s son have I landed by himself; Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs In an odd angle of the isle, and sitting, His arms in this sad knot. _Pros._ Of the king\u2019s ship The mariners, say how thou hast disposed, 225 And all the rest o\u2019 the fleet. _Ari._ Safely in harbour Is the king\u2019s ship; in the deep nook, where once Thou call\u2019dst me up at midnight to fetch dew From the still-vex\u2019d Bermoothes, there she\u2019s hid: The mariners all under hatches stow\u2019d; 230 Who, with a charm join\u2019d to their suffer\u2019d labour, I have left asleep: and for the rest o\u2019 the fleet, Which I dispersed, they all have met again, And are upon the Mediterranean flote, Bound sadly home for Naples; 235 Supposing that they saw the king\u2019s ship wreck\u2019d, And his great person perish.", " _Pros._ Why, that\u2019s my dainty Ariel!

[_Exit._ _Gon._ All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement Inhabits here: some heavenly power guide us 105 Out of this fearful country! _Pros._ Behold, sir king, The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero: For more assurance that a living prince Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body; And to thee and thy company I bid 110 A hearty welcome. _Alon._ Whether thou be\u2019st he or no, Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me, As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse Beats, as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee, The affliction of my mind amends, with which, 115 I fear, a madness held me: this must crave-- An if this be at all--a most strange story. Thy dukedom I resign, and do entreat Thou pardon me my wrongs. --But how should Prospero Be living and be here? _Pros._ First, noble friend, 120 Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot Be measured or confined. _Gon._ Whether this be Or be not, I\u2019ll not swear. _Pros._ You do yet taste Some subtilties o\u2019 the isle, that will not let you Believe things certain.

Sit, then, and talk with her; she is thine own. What, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel! _Enter ARIEL._ _Ari._ What would my potent master? here I am. _Pros._ Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service 35 Did worthily perform; and I must use you In such another trick. Go bring the rabble, O\u2019er whom I give thee power, here to this place: Incite them to quick motion; for I must Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple 40 Some vanity of mine art: it is my promise, And they expect it from me.", " _Pros._ Do so; and after two days I will discharge thee. _Ari._ That\u2019s my noble master! What shall I do? say what; what shall I do? 300 _Pros._ Go make thyself like a nymph o\u2019 the sea: Be subject to no sight but thine and mine; invisible To every eyeball else. Go take this shape, And hither come in\u2019t: go, hence with diligence! [_Exit Ariel._ Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well; 305 Awake! _Mir._ The strangeness of your story put Heaviness in me. _Pros._ Shake it off. Come on; We\u2019ll visit Caliban my slave, who never Yields us kind answer. _Mir._ \u2019Tis a villain, sir, I do not love to look on. _Pros._ But, as \u2019tis, 310 We cannot miss him: he does make our fire, Fetch in our wood, and serves in offices That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban! Thou earth, thou! speak. _Cal._ [_within_] There\u2019s wood enough within. _Pros._ Come forth, I say! there\u2019s other business for thee: 315 Come, thou tortoise! when? _Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymph._ Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel, Hark in thine ear. _Ari._ My lord, it shall be done.

[_Exit Ariel._] How fares my gracious sir? There are yet missing of your company Some few odd lads that you remember not. 255 _Re-enter ARIEL, driving in CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, in their stolen apparel._ _Ste._ Every man shift for all the rest, and let no man take care for himself; for all is but fortune. --Coragio, bully-monster, coragio! _Trin._ If these be true spies which I wear in my head, here\u2019s a goodly sight. 260 _Cal._ O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed! How fine my master is! I am afraid He will chastise me. _Seb._ Ha, ha! What things are these, my lord Antonio? Will money buy \u2019em? _Ant._ Very like; one of them 265 Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable. _Pros._ Mark but the badges of these men, my lords, Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave, His mother was a witch; and one so strong That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs, 270 And deal in her command, without her power. These three have robb\u2019d me; and this demi-devil-- For he\u2019s a bastard one--had plotted with them To take my life. Two of these fellows you Must know and own; this thing of darkness I 275 Acknowledge mine. _Cal._ I shall be pinch\u2019d to death. _Alon._ Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler? _Seb._ He is drunk now: where had he wine? _Alon._ And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they Find this grand liquor that hath gilded \u2019em?-- 280 How camest thou in this pickle?", " Capell made the change. 128: _windring_] _winding_ Rowe. _wand\u2019ring_ Steevens. 129: _sedged_] _sedge_ Collier MS. 136: _holiday_] _holly day_ F1 F2 F3. _holy-day_ F4. 139: SCENE IV.

And now, I pray you, sir, 175 For still \u2019tis beating in my mind, your reason For raising this sea-storm? _Pros._ Know thus far forth. By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune, Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies Brought to this shore; and by my prescience 180 I find my zenith doth depend upon A most auspicious star, whose influence If now I court not, but omit, my fortunes Will ever after droop.

I come To answer thy best pleasure; be\u2019t to fly, 190 To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride On the curl\u2019d clouds, to thy strong bidding task Ariel and all his quality. _Pros._ Hast thou, spirit, Perform\u2019d to point the tempest that I bade thee? _Ari._ To every article. 195 I boarded the king\u2019s ship; now on the beak, Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin, I flamed amazement: sometime I\u2019ld divide, And burn in many places; on the topmast, The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly, 200 Then meet and join. Jove\u2019s lightnings, the precursors O\u2019 the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary And sight-outrunning were not: the fire and cracks Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune Seem to besiege, and make his bold waves tremble, 205 Yea, his dread trident shake.", " _He vanishes in thunder; then, to soft music, enter the Shapes again, and dance, with mocks and mows, and carrying out the table._ _Pros._ Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou Perform\u2019d, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring: Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated 85 In what thou hadst to say: so, with good life And observation strange, my meaner ministers Their several kinds have done.

[_Exit above._ _Gon._ I\u2019 the name of something holy, sir, why stand you In this strange stare? _Alon._ O, it is monstrous, monstrous! 95 Methought the billows spoke, and told me of it; The winds did sing it to me; and the thunder, That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass. Therefore my son i\u2019 th\u2019 ooze is bedded; and 100 I\u2019ll seek him deeper than e\u2019er plummet sounded, And with him there lie mudded.

What is the time o\u2019 the day? _Ari._ Past the mid season. _Pros._ At least two glasses. The time \u2019twixt six and now 240 Must by us both be spent most preciously. _Ari._ Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains, Let me remember thee what thou hast promised, Which is not yet perform\u2019d me. _Pros._ How now? moody? What is\u2019t thou canst demand? _Ari._ My liberty. 245 _Pros._ Before the time be out? no more! _Ari._ I prithee, Remember I have done thee worthy service; Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise To bate me a full year. _Pros._ Dost thou forget 250 From what a torment I did free thee? _Ari._ No. _Pros._ Thou dost; and think\u2019st it much to tread the ooze Of the salt deep, To run upon the sharp wind of the north, To do me business in the veins o\u2019 the earth 255 When it is baked with frost. _Ari._ I do not, sir. _Pros._ Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her? _Ari._ No, sir. _Pros._ Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me. 260 _Ari._ Sir, in Argier. _Pros._ O, was she so? I must Once in a month recount what thou hast been, Which thou forget\u2019st. This damn\u2019d witch Sycorax, For mischiefs manifold, and sorceries terrible To enter human hearing, from Argier, 265 Thou know\u2019st, was banish\u2019d: for one thing she did They would not take her life.", " Librarian Of Trinity College, Cambridge. _VOLUME I._ Cambridge and London: MACMILLAN AND CO. 1863.

Thee of thy son, Alonso, 75 They have bereft; and do pronounce by me: Lingering perdition--worse than any death Can be at once--shall step by step attend You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from,-- Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls 80 Upon your heads,--is nothing but heart-sorrow And a clear life ensuing.", " Librarian Of Trinity College, Cambridge. _VOLUME I._ Cambridge and London: MACMILLAN AND CO. 1863.

Similar cases occur frequently, especially when the verb precedes its nominative. For example, _Tempest_, IV. 1. 262, \u2018Lies at my mercy all mine enemies,\u2019 and _Measure for Measure_, II. 1. 22, \u2018What knows the laws, &c.\u2019 We correct it in those passages where the occurrence of a vulgarism would be likely to annoy the reader. In the mouth of a Boatswain it can offend no one. We therefore leave it. NOTE II. I. 1. 57-59. _Mercy on us!--we split, &c._ It may be doubtful whether the printer of the first folio intended these broken speeches to express \u2018a confused noise within.\u2019 Without question such was the author\u2019s meaning. Rowe, however, and subsequent editors, printed them as part of Gonzalo\u2019s speech. Capell was the first editor who gave the true arrangement. NOTE III.

Look down, you gods, And on this couple drop a blessed crown! For it is you that have chalk\u2019d forth the way Which brought us hither. _Alon._ I say, Amen, Gonzalo! _Gon._ Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue 205 Should become kings of Naples?

[_Alonso sleeps. Exit Ariel._ _Seb._ What a strange drowsiness possesses them! 190 _Ant._ It is the quality o\u2019 the climate. _Seb._ Why Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not Myself disposed to sleep. _Ant._ Nor I; my spirits are nimble. They fell together all, as by consent; They dropp\u2019d, as by a thunder-stroke. What might, 195 Worthy Sebastian?--O, what might?--No more:-- And yet methinks I see it in thy face, What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee; and My strong imagination sees a crown Dropping upon thy head. _Seb._ What, art thou waking? 200 _Ant._ Do you not hear me speak? _Seb._ I do; and surely It is a sleepy language, and thou speak\u2019st Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say? This is a strange repose, to be asleep With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving, 205 And yet so fast asleep. _Ant._ Noble Sebastian, Thou let\u2019st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink\u2019st Whiles thou art waking. _Seb._ Thou dost snore distinctly; There\u2019s meaning in thy snores.", " 125 [_Aside to Seb. and Ant._] But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded, I here could pluck his Highness\u2019 frown upon you, And justify you traitors: at this time I will tell no tales. _Seb._ [_Aside_] The devil speaks in him. _Pros._ No. For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother 130 Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive Thy rankest fault,--all of them; and require My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know, Thou must restore. _Alon._ If thou be\u2019st Prospero, Give us particulars of thy preservation; 135 How thou hast met us here, who three hours since Were wreck\u2019d upon this shore; where I have lost-- How sharp the point of this remembrance is!-- My dear son Ferdinand. _Pros._ I am woe for\u2019t, sir. _Alon._ Irreparable is the loss; and patience 140 Says it is past her cure. _Pros._ I rather think You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace For the like loss I have her sovereign aid, And rest myself content. _Alon._ You the like loss! _Pros._ As great to me as late; and, supportable 145 To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker Than you may call to comfort you, for I Have lost my daughter. _Alon._ A daughter? O heavens, that they were living both in Naples, The king and queen there! that they were, I wish 150 Myself were mudded in that oozy bed Where my son lies. When did you lose you daughter? _Pros._ In this last tempest. I perceive, these lords At this encounter do so much admire, That they devour their reason, and scarce think 155 Their eyes do offices of truth, their words Are natural breath: but, howsoe\u2019er you have Been justled from your senses, know for certain That I am Prospero, and that very duke Which was thrust forth of Milan; who most strangely 160 Upon this shore, where you were wreck\u2019d, was landed, To be the Lord on\u2019t.", " _Seb._ What stuff is this! How say you? 245 \u2019Tis true, my brother\u2019s daughter\u2019s queen of Tunis; So is she heir of Naples; \u2019twixt which regions There is some space. _Ant._ A space whose every cubit Seems to cry out, \u201cHow shall that Claribel Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis, 250 And let Sebastian wake.\u201d Say, this were death That now hath seized them; why, they were no worse Than now they are.

O, that you bore The mind that I do! what a sleep were this For your advancement! Do you understand me? _Seb._ Methinks I do. _Ant._ And how does your content 260 Tender your own good fortune? _Seb._ I remember You did supplant your brother Prospero. _Ant._ True: And look how well my garments sit upon me; Much feater than before: my brother\u2019s servants Were then my fellows; now they are my men. 265 _Seb._ But for your conscience. _Ant._ Ay, sir; where lies that? if \u2019twere a kibe, \u2019Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences, That stand \u2019twixt me and Milan, candied be they, 270 And melt, ere they molest! Here lies your brother, No better than the earth he lies upon, If he were that which now he\u2019s like, that\u2019s dead; Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it, Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus, 275 To the perpetual wink for aye might put This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who Should not upbraid our course.", " If I should 200 take a displeasure against you, look you,-- _Trin._ Thou wert but a lost monster. _Cal._ Good my lord, give me thy favour still.

I do begin to have bloody thoughts. 220 _Trin._ O King Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano! look what a wardrobe here is for thee! _Cal._ Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash. _Trin._ O, ho, monster! we know what belongs to a frippery. O King Stephano! 225 _Ste._ Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I\u2019ll have that gown. _Trin._ Thy Grace shall have it. _Cal._ The dropsy drown this fool! what do you mean To dote thus on such luggage?

How fine my master is! I am afraid He will chastise me. _Seb._ Ha, ha! What things are these, my lord Antonio? Will money buy \u2019em? _Ant._ Very like; one of them 265 Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable. _Pros._ Mark but the badges of these men, my lords, Then say if they be true.

I have not scaped drowning, to be afeard now of your four legs; for it hath been said, As proper a man as ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground; and it shall be said so again, while Stephano breathes at\u2019s nostrils. 60 _Cal._ The spirit torments me:--O! _Ste._ This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil should he learn our language? I will give him some relief, if it be but for that. If I can recover him, and keep him tame, and 65 get to Naples with him, he\u2019s a present for any emperor that ever trod on neat\u2019s-leather. _Cal._ Do not torment me, prithee; I\u2019ll bring my wood home faster. _Ste._ He\u2019s in his fit now, and does not talk after the 70 wisest. He shall taste of my bottle: if he have never drunk wine afore, it will go near to remove his fit. If I can recover him, and keep him tame, I will not take too much for him; he shall pay for him that hath him, and that soundly. _Cal._ Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon, I 75 know it by thy trembling: now Prosper works upon thee. _Ste._ Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is that which will give language to you, cat: open your mouth; this will shake your shaking, I can tell you, and that soundly: you cannot tell who\u2019s your friend: open your chaps again. 80 _Trin._ I should know that voice: it should be--but he is drowned; and these are devils:--O defend me!", " _Alon._ Prithee, peace. _Seb._ You were kneel\u2019d to, and importuned otherwise, By all of us; and the fair soul herself Weigh\u2019d between loathness and obedience, at Which end o\u2019 the beam should bow. We have lost your son, 125 I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have More widows in them of this business\u2019 making Than we bring men to comfort them: The fault\u2019s your own. _Alon._ So is the dear\u2019st o\u2019 the loss. _Gon._ My lord Sebastian, 130 The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness, And time to speak it in: you rub the sore, When you should bring the plaster. _Seb._ Very well. _Ant._ And most chirurgeonly. _Gon._ It is foul weather in us all, good sir, 135 When you are cloudy. _Seb._ Foul weather? _Ant._ Very foul. _Gon._ Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,-- _Ant._ He\u2019ld sow\u2019t with nettle-seed. _Seb._ Or docks, or mallows. _Gon._ And were the king on\u2019t, what would I do? _Seb._ \u2019Scape being drunk for want of wine. 140 _Gon._ I\u2019 the commonwealth I would by contraries Execute all things; for no kind of traffic Would I admit; no name of magistrate; Letters should not be known; riches, poverty, And use of service, none; contract, succession, 145 Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none; No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil; No occupation; all men idle, all; And women too, but innocent and pure; No sovereignty;-- 150 _Seb._ Yet he would be king on\u2019t. _Ant._ The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning.", " the folly of this island! They say there\u2019s but five upon this isle: we are three of them; if 5 th\u2019 other two be brained like us, the state totters. _Ste._ Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee: thy eyes are almost set in thy head. _Trin._ Where should they be set else? he were a brave monster indeed, if they were set in his tail. 10 _Ste._ My man-monster hath drowned his tongue in sack: for my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere I could recover the shore, five-and-thirty leagues off and on. By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant, monster, or my standard. 15 _Trin._ Your lieutenant, if you list; he\u2019s no standard. _Ste._ We\u2019ll not run, Monsieur Monster. _Trin._ Nor go neither; but you\u2019ll lie, like dogs, and yet say nothing neither. _Ste._ Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a 20 good moon-calf. _Cal._ How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe. I\u2019ll not serve him, he is not valiant. _Trin._ Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case to justle a constable. Why, thou debauched fish, thou, was 25 there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much sack as I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being but half a fish and half a monster? _Cal._ Lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord? _Trin._ \u2018Lord,\u2019 quoth he! That a monster should be 30 such a natural! _Cal._ Lo, lo, again! bite him to death, I prithee. _Ste._ Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head: if you prove a mutineer,--the next tree!"], "What are Ferdinand and Miranda doing when Prospero reveals them to the lords?": [" 125 [_Aside to Seb. and Ant._] But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded, I here could pluck his Highness\u2019 frown upon you, And justify you traitors: at this time I will tell no tales. _Seb._ [_Aside_] The devil speaks in him. _Pros._ No. For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother 130 Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive Thy rankest fault,--all of them; and require My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know, Thou must restore. _Alon._ If thou be\u2019st Prospero, Give us particulars of thy preservation; 135 How thou hast met us here, who three hours since Were wreck\u2019d upon this shore; where I have lost-- How sharp the point of this remembrance is!-- My dear son Ferdinand. _Pros._ I am woe for\u2019t, sir. _Alon._ Irreparable is the loss; and patience 140 Says it is past her cure. _Pros._ I rather think You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace For the like loss I have her sovereign aid, And rest myself content. _Alon._ You the like loss! _Pros._ As great to me as late; and, supportable 145 To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker Than you may call to comfort you, for I Have lost my daughter. _Alon._ A daughter? O heavens, that they were living both in Naples, The king and queen there! that they were, I wish 150 Myself were mudded in that oozy bed Where my son lies. When did you lose you daughter? _Pros._ In this last tempest. I perceive, these lords At this encounter do so much admire, That they devour their reason, and scarce think 155 Their eyes do offices of truth, their words Are natural breath: but, howsoe\u2019er you have Been justled from your senses, know for certain That I am Prospero, and that very duke Which was thrust forth of Milan; who most strangely 160 Upon this shore, where you were wreck\u2019d, was landed, To be the Lord on\u2019t.", " Librarian Of Trinity College, Cambridge. _VOLUME I._ Cambridge and London: MACMILLAN AND CO. 1863.

I do beseech you,-- Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers,-- 35 What is your name? _Mir._ Miranda. --O my father, I have broke your hest to say so! _Fer._ Admired Miranda! Indeed the top of admiration! worth What\u2019s dearest to the world! Full many a lady I have eyed with best regard, and many a time 40 The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues Have I liked several women; never any With so full soul, but some defect in her Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed, 45 And put it to the foil: but you, O you, So perfect and so peerless, are created Of every creature\u2019s best! _Mir._ I do not know One of my sex; no woman\u2019s face remember, Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen 50 More that I may call men than you, good friend, And my dear father: how features are abroad, I am skilless of; but, by my modesty, The jewel in my dower, I would not wish Any companion in the world but you; 55 Nor can imagination form a shape, Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle Something too wildly, and my father\u2019s precepts I therein do forget. _Fer._ I am, in my condition, A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king; 60 I would, not so!--and would no more endure This wooden slavery than to suffer The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak: The very instant that I saw you, did My heart fly to your service; there resides, 65 To make me slave to it; and for your sake Am I this patient log-man.", " No more yet of this; For \u2019tis a chronicle of day by day, Not a relation for a breakfast, nor Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir; 165 This cell\u2019s my court: here have I few attendants, And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in. My dukedom since you have given me again, I will requite you with as good a thing; At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye 170 As much as me my dukedom. _Here Prospero discovers FERDINAND and MIRANDA playing at chess._ _Mir._ Sweet lord, you play me false. _Fer._ No, my dear\u2019st love, I would not for the world. _Mir._ Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle, And I would call it fair play. _Alon._ If this prove 175 A vision of the island, one dear son Shall I twice lose. _Seb._ A most high miracle! _Fer._ Though the seas threaten, they are merciful; I have cursed them without cause. [_Kneels._ _Alon._ Now all the blessings Of a glad father compass thee about! 180 Arise, and say how thou camest here. _Mir._ O, wonder! How many goodly creatures are there here! How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world, That has such people in\u2019t! _Pros._ \u2019Tis new to thee. _Alon._ What is this maid with whom thou wast at play? 185 Your eld\u2019st acquaintance cannot be three hours: Is she the goddess that hath sever\u2019d us, And brought us thus together? _Fer._ Sir, she is mortal; But by immortal Providence she\u2019s mine: I chose her when I could not ask my father 190 For his advice, nor thought I had one."], "Who is the King of Naples?": [" If you be maid or no? _Mir._ No wonder, sir; But certainly a maid. _Fer._ My language! heavens! I am the best of them that speak this speech, Were I but where \u2019tis spoken. _Pros._ How? the best? 430 What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee? _Fer._ A single thing, as I am now, that wonders To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me; And that he does I weep: myself am Naples, Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld 435 The king my father wreck\u2019d. _Mir._ Alack, for mercy! _Fer._ Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of Milan And his brave son being twain. _Pros._ [_Aside_] The Duke of Milan And his more braver daughter could control thee, If now \u2019twere fit to do\u2019t. At the first sight 440 They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel, I\u2019ll set thee free for this. [_To Fer._] A word, good sir; I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word. _Mir._ Why speaks my father so ungently? This Is the third man that e\u2019er I saw; the first 445 That e\u2019er I sigh\u2019d for: pity move my father To be inclined my way! _Fer._ O, if a virgin, And your affection not gone forth, I\u2019ll make you The queen of Naples. _Pros._ Soft, sir! one word more. [_Aside_] They are both in either\u2019s powers: but this swift business 450 I must uneasy make, lest too light winning Make the prize light. [_To Fer._] One word more; I charge thee That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself Upon this island as a spy, to win it 455 From me, the lord on\u2019t.", " _Pros._ My brave spirit! Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil Would not infect his reason? _Ari._ Not a soul But felt a fever of the mad, and play\u2019d Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners 210 Plunged in the foaming brine, and quit the vessel, Then all afire with me: the king\u2019s son, Ferdinand, With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,-- Was the first man that leap\u2019d; cried, \u201cHell is empty, And all the devils are here.\u201d _Pros._ Why, that\u2019s my spirit! 215 But was not this nigh shore? _Ari._ Close by, my master. _Pros._ But are they, Ariel, safe? _Ari._ Not a hair perish\u2019d; On their sustaining garments not a blemish, But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me, In troops I have dispersed them \u2019bout the isle. 220 The king\u2019s son have I landed by himself; Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs In an odd angle of the isle, and sitting, His arms in this sad knot. _Pros._ Of the king\u2019s ship The mariners, say how thou hast disposed, 225 And all the rest o\u2019 the fleet. _Ari._ Safely in harbour Is the king\u2019s ship; in the deep nook, where once Thou call\u2019dst me up at midnight to fetch dew From the still-vex\u2019d Bermoothes, there she\u2019s hid: The mariners all under hatches stow\u2019d; 230 Who, with a charm join\u2019d to their suffer\u2019d labour, I have left asleep: and for the rest o\u2019 the fleet, Which I dispersed, they all have met again, And are upon the Mediterranean flote, Bound sadly home for Naples; 235 Supposing that they saw the king\u2019s ship wreck\u2019d, And his great person perish.", " Me, poor man, my library Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties 110 He thinks me now incapable; confederates, So dry he was for sway, wi\u2019 the King of Naples To give him annual tribute, do him homage, Subject his coronet to his crown, and bend The dukedom, yet unbow\u2019d,--alas, poor Milan!-- 115 To most ignoble stooping. _Mir._ O the heavens! _Pros._ Mark his condition, and th\u2019 event; then tell me If this might be a brother. _Mir._ I should sin To think but nobly of my grandmother: Good wombs have borne bad sons. _Pros._ Now the condition. 120 This King of Naples, being an enemy To me inveterate, hearkens my brother\u2019s suit; Which was, that he, in lieu o\u2019 the premises, Of homage and I know not how much tribute, Should presently extirpate me and mine 125 Out of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan, With all the honours, on my brother: whereon, A treacherous army levied, one midnight Fated to the purpose, did Antonio open The gates of Milan; and, i\u2019 the dead of darkness, 130 The ministers for the purpose hurried thence Me and thy crying self. _Mir._ Alack, for pity! I, not remembering how I cried out then, Will cry it o\u2019er again: it is a hint That wrings mine eyes to\u2019t. _Pros._ Hear a little further, 135 And then I\u2019ll bring thee to the present business Which now\u2019s upon \u2019s; without the which, this story Were most impertinent. _Mir._ Wherefore did they not That hour destroy us? _Pros._ Well demanded, wench: My tale provokes that question.", " _Seb._ What stuff is this! How say you? 245 \u2019Tis true, my brother\u2019s daughter\u2019s queen of Tunis; So is she heir of Naples; \u2019twixt which regions There is some space. _Ant._ A space whose every cubit Seems to cry out, \u201cHow shall that Claribel Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis, 250 And let Sebastian wake.\u201d Say, this were death That now hath seized them; why, they were no worse Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate As amply and unnecessarily 255 As this Gonzalo; I myself could make A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore The mind that I do! what a sleep were this For your advancement! Do you understand me? _Seb._ Methinks I do. _Ant._ And how does your content 260 Tender your own good fortune? _Seb._ I remember You did supplant your brother Prospero. _Ant._ True: And look how well my garments sit upon me; Much feater than before: my brother\u2019s servants Were then my fellows; now they are my men. 265 _Seb._ But for your conscience. _Ant._ Ay, sir; where lies that? if \u2019twere a kibe, \u2019Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences, That stand \u2019twixt me and Milan, candied be they, 270 And melt, ere they molest! Here lies your brother, No better than the earth he lies upon, If he were that which now he\u2019s like, that\u2019s dead; Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it, Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus, 275 To the perpetual wink for aye might put This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who Should not upbraid our course."], "What has Prospero been doing on the island for twelve years?": [" Canst thou remember A time before we came unto this cell? I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not 40 Out three years old. _Mir._ Certainly, sir, I can. _Pros._ By what? by any other house or person? Of any thing the image tell me that Hath kept with thy remembrance. _Mir._ \u2019Tis far off, And rather like a dream than an assurance 45 That my remembrance warrants. Had I not Four or five women once that tended me? _Pros._ Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else In the dark backward and abysm of time? 50 If thou remember\u2019st ought ere thou camest here, How thou camest here thou mayst. _Mir._ But that I do not. _Pros._ Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since, Thy father was the Duke of Milan, and A prince of power. _Mir._ Sir, are not you my father? 55 _Pros._ Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father Was Duke of Milan; and his only heir And princess, no worse issued. _Mir._ O the heavens! What foul play had we, that we came from thence? 60 Or blessed was\u2019t we did? _Pros._ Both, both, my girl: By foul play, as thou say\u2019st, were we heaved thence; But blessedly holp hither. _Mir._ O, my heart bleeds To think o\u2019 the teen that I have turn\u2019d you to. Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther. 65 _Pros._ My brother, and thy uncle, call\u2019d Antonio,-- I pray thee, mark me,--that a brother should Be so perfidious!--he whom, next thyself, Of all the world I loved, and to him put The manage of my state; as, at that time, 70 Through all the signories it was the first, And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed In dignity, and for the liberal arts Without a parallel; those being all my study, The government I cast upon my brother, 75 And to my state grew stranger, being transported And rapt in secret studies.", " Is not this true? _Ari._ Ay, sir. _Pros._ This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child, And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave, 270 As thou report\u2019st thyself, wast then her servant; And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate To act her earthy and abhorr\u2019d commands, Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee, By help of her more potent ministers, 275 And in her most unmitigable rage, Into a cloven pine; within which rift Imprison\u2019d thou didst painfully remain A dozen years; within which space she died, And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans 280 As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island-- Save for the son that she did litter here, A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour\u2019d with A human shape. _Ari._ Yes, Caliban her son. _Pros._ Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban, 285 Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know\u2019st What torment I did find thee in; thy groans Did make wolves howl, and penetrate the breasts Of ever-angry bears: it was a torment To lay upon the damn\u2019d, which Sycorax 290 Could not again undo: it was mine art, When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape The pine, and let thee out. _Ari._ I thank thee, master. _Pros._ If thou more murmur\u2019st, I will rend an oak, And peg thee in his knotty entrails, till 295 Thou hast howl\u2019d away twelve winters. _Ari._ Pardon, master: I will be correspondent to command, And do my spiriting gently.", " 31: _betid_] F1. _betide_ F2 F3 F4. 35: _a_] F1. _the_ F2 F3 F4. 38: _thou_] om.

I. 2. 298. The metre of this line, as well as of lines 301, 302, is defective, but as no mode of correction can be regarded as completely satisfactory we have in accordance with our custom left the lines as they are printed in the Folio. The defect, indeed, in the metre of line 298 has not been noticed except by Hanmer, who makes a line thus: \u2018Do so, and after two days I\u2019ll discharge thee.\u2019 Possibly it ought to be printed thus: \u2018Do so; and After two days I will discharge thee.\u2019 There is a broken line, also of four syllables, 253 of the same scene, another of seven, 235. There is no reason to doubt that the _words_ are as Shakespeare wrote them, for, although the action of the play terminates in less than four hours (I. 2. 240 and V. 1. 186), yet Ariel\u2019s ministry is not to end till the voyage to Naples shall be over. Prospero, too, repeats his promise, and marks his contentment by further shortening the time of servitude, \u2018within two days,\u2019 I. 2. 420.

What seest thou else In the dark backward and abysm of time? 50 If thou remember\u2019st ought ere thou camest here, How thou camest here thou mayst. _Mir._ But that I do not. _Pros._ Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since, Thy father was the Duke of Milan, and A prince of power. _Mir._ Sir, are not you my father? 55 _Pros._ Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father Was Duke of Milan; and his only heir And princess, no worse issued. _Mir._ O the heavens! What foul play had we, that we came from thence? 60 Or blessed was\u2019t we did? _Pros._ Both, both, my girl: By foul play, as thou say\u2019st, were we heaved thence; But blessedly holp hither. _Mir._ O, my heart bleeds To think o\u2019 the teen that I have turn\u2019d you to. Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther. 65 _Pros._ My brother, and thy uncle, call\u2019d Antonio,-- I pray thee, mark me,--that a brother should Be so perfidious!--he whom, next thyself, Of all the world I loved, and to him put The manage of my state; as, at that time, 70 Through all the signories it was the first, And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed In dignity, and for the liberal arts Without a parallel; those being all my study, The government I cast upon my brother, 75 And to my state grew stranger, being transported And rapt in secret studies."], "What does Miranda do in Act III, Scene i that is surprising?": [" _Mir._ You look wearily. _Fer._ No, noble mistress; \u2019tis fresh morning with me When you are by at night. I do beseech you,-- Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers,-- 35 What is your name? _Mir._ Miranda. --O my father, I have broke your hest to say so! _Fer._ Admired Miranda! Indeed the top of admiration! worth What\u2019s dearest to the world! Full many a lady I have eyed with best regard, and many a time 40 The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues Have I liked several women; never any With so full soul, but some defect in her Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed, 45 And put it to the foil: but you, O you, So perfect and so peerless, are created Of every creature\u2019s best! _Mir._ I do not know One of my sex; no woman\u2019s face remember, Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen 50 More that I may call men than you, good friend, And my dear father: how features are abroad, I am skilless of; but, by my modesty, The jewel in my dower, I would not wish Any companion in the world but you; 55 Nor can imagination form a shape, Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle Something too wildly, and my father\u2019s precepts I therein do forget. _Fer._ I am, in my condition, A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king; 60 I would, not so!--and would no more endure This wooden slavery than to suffer The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak: The very instant that I saw you, did My heart fly to your service; there resides, 65 To make me slave to it; and for your sake Am I this patient log-man.", " Librarian Of Trinity College, Cambridge. _VOLUME I._ Cambridge and London: MACMILLAN AND CO. 1863.

Thou earth, thou! speak. _Cal._ [_within_] There\u2019s wood enough within. _Pros._ Come forth, I say! there\u2019s other business for thee: 315 Come, thou tortoise! when? _Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymph._ Fine apparition!

[_Draws, and is charmed from moving._ _Mir._ O dear father, Make not too rash a trial of him, for He\u2019s gentle, and not fearful. _Pros._ What! I say, My foot my tutor?

Thou, my slave, 270 As thou report\u2019st thyself, wast then her servant; And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate To act her earthy and abhorr\u2019d commands, Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee, By help of her more potent ministers, 275 And in her most unmitigable rage, Into a cloven pine; within which rift Imprison\u2019d thou didst painfully remain A dozen years; within which space she died, And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans 280 As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island-- Save for the son that she did litter here, A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour\u2019d with A human shape. _Ari._ Yes, Caliban her son. _Pros._ Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban, 285 Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know\u2019st What torment I did find thee in; thy groans Did make wolves howl, and penetrate the breasts Of ever-angry bears: it was a torment To lay upon the damn\u2019d, which Sycorax 290 Could not again undo: it was mine art, When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape The pine, and let thee out. _Ari._ I thank thee, master. _Pros._ If thou more murmur\u2019st, I will rend an oak, And peg thee in his knotty entrails, till 295 Thou hast howl\u2019d away twelve winters. _Ari._ Pardon, master: I will be correspondent to command, And do my spiriting gently."], "What does Caliban do that contrasts with his savage demeanor and grotesque appearance?": [" Librarian Of Trinity College, Cambridge. _VOLUME I._ Cambridge and London: MACMILLAN AND CO. 1863.

[_Exit._ _Enter _Mariners_._ _Boats._ Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts! 5 yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the master\u2019s whistle.

What shall I do? say what; what shall I do? 300 _Pros._ Go make thyself like a nymph o\u2019 the sea: Be subject to no sight but thine and mine; invisible To every eyeball else. Go take this shape, And hither come in\u2019t: go, hence with diligence! [_Exit Ariel._ Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well; 305 Awake! _Mir._ The strangeness of your story put Heaviness in me. _Pros._ Shake it off. Come on; We\u2019ll visit Caliban my slave, who never Yields us kind answer. _Mir._ \u2019Tis a villain, sir, I do not love to look on. _Pros._ But, as \u2019tis, 310 We cannot miss him: he does make our fire, Fetch in our wood, and serves in offices That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban! Thou earth, thou! speak. _Cal._ [_within_] There\u2019s wood enough within. _Pros._ Come forth, I say! there\u2019s other business for thee: 315 Come, thou tortoise! when? _Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymph._ Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel, Hark in thine ear. _Ari._ My lord, it shall be done. [_Exit._ _Pros._ Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself Upon thy wicked dam, come forth! 320 _Enter CALIBAN._ _Cal._ As wicked dew as e\u2019er my mother brush\u2019d With raven\u2019s feather from unwholesome fen Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye And blister you all o\u2019er! _Pros._ For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps, 325 Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins Shall, for that vast of night that they may work, All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch\u2019d As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging Than bees that made \u2019em.", " Juno sings her blessings on you. _Cer._ Earth\u2019s increase, foison plenty, 110 Barns and garners never empty; Vines with clustering bunches growing; Plants with goodly burthen bowing; Spring come to you at the farthest In the very end of harvest! 115 Scarcity and want shall shun you; Ceres\u2019 blessing so is on you. _Fer._ This is a most majestic vision, and Harmonious charmingly. May I be bold To think these spirits? _Pros._ Spirits, which by mine art 120 I have from their confines call\u2019d to enact My present fancies. _Fer._ Let me live here ever; So rare a wonder\u2019d father and a wife Makes this place Paradise. [_Juno and Ceres whisper, and send Iris on employment._ _Pros._ Sweet, now, silence! Juno and Ceres whisper seriously; 125 There\u2019s something else to do: hush, and be mute, Or else our spell is marr\u2019d. _Iris._ You nymphs, call\u2019d Naiads, of the windring brooks, With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks, Leave your crisp channels, and on this green land 130 Answer your summons; Juno does command: Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate A contract of true love; be not too late. _Enter certain Nymphs._ You sunburnt sicklemen, of August weary, Come hither from the furrow, and be merry: 135 Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on, And these fresh nymphs encounter every one In country footing. _Enter certain Reapers, properly habited: they join with the Nymphs in a graceful dance; towards the end whereof PROSPERO starts suddenly, and speaks; after which, to a strange, hollow, and confused noise, they heavily vanish._ _Pros._ [_Aside_] I had forgot that foul conspiracy Of the beast Caliban and his confederates 140 Against my life: the minute of their plot Is almost come."], "In the play, is Caliban a monster or a man?": [" the folly of this island! They say there\u2019s but five upon this isle: we are three of them; if 5 th\u2019 other two be brained like us, the state totters. _Ste._ Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee: thy eyes are almost set in thy head. _Trin._ Where should they be set else? he were a brave monster indeed, if they were set in his tail. 10 _Ste._ My man-monster hath drowned his tongue in sack: for my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere I could recover the shore, five-and-thirty leagues off and on. By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant, monster, or my standard. 15 _Trin._ Your lieutenant, if you list; he\u2019s no standard. _Ste._ We\u2019ll not run, Monsieur Monster. _Trin._ Nor go neither; but you\u2019ll lie, like dogs, and yet say nothing neither. _Ste._ Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a 20 good moon-calf. _Cal._ How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe. I\u2019ll not serve him, he is not valiant. _Trin._ Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case to justle a constable. Why, thou debauched fish, thou, was 25 there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much sack as I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being but half a fish and half a monster? _Cal._ Lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord? _Trin._ \u2018Lord,\u2019 quoth he! That a monster should be 30 such a natural! _Cal._ Lo, lo, again! bite him to death, I prithee. _Ste._ Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head: if you prove a mutineer,--the next tree!", " _Ste._ Come on, then; down, and swear. _Trin._ I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed monster. A most scurvy monster! I could find in 145 my heart to beat him,-- _Ste._ Come, kiss. _Trin._ But that the poor monster\u2019s in drink: an abominable monster! _Cal._ I\u2019ll show thee the best springs; I\u2019ll pluck thee berries; 150 I\u2019ll fish for thee, and get thee wood enough. A plague upon the tyrant that I serve! I\u2019ll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee, Thou wondrous man. _Trin._ A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder 155 of a poor drunkard! _Cal._ I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow; And I with my long nails will dig thee pig-nuts; Show thee a jay\u2019s nest, and instruct thee how To snare the nimble marmoset; I\u2019ll bring thee 160 To clustering filberts, and sometimes I\u2019ll get thee Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me? _Ste._ I prithee now, lead the way, without any more talking. Trinculo, the king and all our company else being drowned, we will inherit here: here; bear my bottle: fellow 165 Trinculo, we\u2019ll fill him by and by again. _Cal. sings drunkenly._] Farewell, master; farewell, farewell! _Trin._ A howling monster; a drunken monster! _Cal._ No more dams I\u2019ll make for fish; Nor fetch in firing 170 At requiring; Nor scrape trencher, nor wash dish: \u2019Ban, \u2019Ban, Cacaliban Has a new master:--get a new man. Freedom, hey-day! hey-day, freedom! freedom, hey-day, 175 freedom!", " I escaped upon a butt of sack, which the sailors heaved o\u2019erboard, by this bottle! which I made of the bark of a tree with mine own hands, since I was cast ashore. 115 _Cal._ I\u2019ll swear, upon that bottle, to be thy true subject; for the liquor is not earthly. _Ste._ Here; swear, then, how thou escapedst. _Trin._ Swum ashore, man, like a duck: I can swim like a duck, I\u2019ll be sworn. 120 _Ste._ Here, kiss the book. Though thou canst swim like a duck, thou art made like a goose. _Trin._ O Stephano, hast any more of this? _Ste._ The whole butt, man: my cellar is in a rock by the sea-side, where my wine is hid. How now, moon-calf! 125 how does thine ague? _Cal._ Hast thou not dropp\u2019d from heaven? _Ste._ Out o\u2019 the moon, I do assure thee: I was the man i\u2019 the moon when time was. _Cal._ I have seen thee in her, and I do adore thee: 130 My mistress show\u2019d me thee, and thy dog, and thy bush. _Ste._ Come, swear to that; kiss the book: I will furnish it anon with new contents: swear. _Trin._ By this good light, this is a very shallow monster! I afeard of him! A very weak monster! The 135 man i\u2019 the moon! A most poor credulous monster! Well drawn, monster, in good sooth! _Cal._ I\u2019ll show thee every fertile inch o\u2019 th\u2019 island; And I will kiss thy foot: I prithee, be my god. _Trin._ By this light, a most perfidious and drunken 140 monster! when\u2019s god\u2019s asleep, he\u2019ll rob his bottle. _Cal._ I\u2019ll kiss thy foot; I\u2019ll swear myself thy subject.", " Were I in England now, as once I was, and had but this fish painted, not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver: there would this monster make a man; any strange beast there makes a man: when they will not give a doit to 30 relieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian. Legged like a man! and his fins like arms! Warm o\u2019 my troth! I do now let loose my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no fish, but an islander, that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt. [_Thunder._] Alas, the storm is come 35 again! my best way is to creep under his gaberdine; there is no other shelter hereabout: misery acquaints a man with strange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past. _Enter STEPHANO, singing: a bottle in his hand._ _Ste._ I shall no more to sea, to sea, 40 Here shall I die a-shore,-- This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man\u2019s funeral: well, here\u2019s my comfort. [_Drinks._ [_Sings._ The master, the swabber, the boatswain, and I, The gunner, and his mate, 45 Loved Mall, Meg, and Marian, and Margery, But none of us cared for Kate; For she had a tongue with a tang, Would cry to a sailor, Go hang! She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch; 50 Yet a tailor might scratch her where\u2019er she did itch. Then, to sea, boys, and let her go hang! This is a scurvy tune too: but here\u2019s my comfort. [_Drinks._ _Cal._ Do not torment me:--O! _Ste._ What\u2019s the matter?"], "What kind of relationship does nearly every scene in the play depict?": [" No more yet of this; For \u2019tis a chronicle of day by day, Not a relation for a breakfast, nor Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir; 165 This cell\u2019s my court: here have I few attendants, And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in. My dukedom since you have given me again, I will requite you with as good a thing; At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye 170 As much as me my dukedom. _Here Prospero discovers FERDINAND and MIRANDA playing at chess._ _Mir._ Sweet lord, you play me false. _Fer._ No, my dear\u2019st love, I would not for the world. _Mir._ Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle, And I would call it fair play. _Alon._ If this prove 175 A vision of the island, one dear son Shall I twice lose. _Seb._ A most high miracle! _Fer._ Though the seas threaten, they are merciful; I have cursed them without cause. [_Kneels._ _Alon._ Now all the blessings Of a glad father compass thee about! 180 Arise, and say how thou camest here. _Mir._ O, wonder! How many goodly creatures are there here! How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world, That has such people in\u2019t! _Pros._ \u2019Tis new to thee. _Alon._ What is this maid with whom thou wast at play? 185 Your eld\u2019st acquaintance cannot be three hours: Is she the goddess that hath sever\u2019d us, And brought us thus together? _Fer._ Sir, she is mortal; But by immortal Providence she\u2019s mine: I chose her when I could not ask my father 190 For his advice, nor thought I had one.", " SCENE II. _Another part of the island._ _Enter CALIBAN with a burden of wood. A noise of thunder heard._ _Cal._ All the infections that the sun sucks up From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall, and make him By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me, And yet I needs must curse. But they\u2019ll nor pinch, Fright me with urchin-shows, pitch me i\u2019 the mire, 5 Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark Out of my way, unless he bid \u2019em: but For every trifle are they set upon me; Sometime like apes, that mow and chatter at me, And after bite me; then like hedgehogs, which 10 Lie tumbling in my barefoot way, and mount Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I All wound with adders, who with cloven tongues Do hiss me into madness. _Enter TRINCULO._ Lo, now, lo! Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me 15 For bringing wood in slowly. I\u2019ll fall flat; Perchance he will not mind me. _Trin._ Here\u2019s neither bush nor shrub, to bear off any weather at all, and another storm brewing; I hear it sing i\u2019 the wind: yond same black cloud, yond huge one, looks 20 like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor. If it should thunder as it did before, I know not where to hide my head: yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish: he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-like smell; a kind 25 of not of the newest Poor-John. A strange fish!", " 20 _Seb._ A living drollery. Now I will believe That there are unicorns; that in Arabia There is one tree, the ph\u0153nix\u2019 throne; one ph\u0153nix At this hour reigning there. _Ant._ I\u2019ll believe both; And what does else want credit, come to me, 25 And I\u2019ll be sworn \u2019tis true: travellers ne\u2019er did lie, Though fools at home condemn \u2019em. _Gon._ If in Naples I should report this now, would they believe me? If I should say, I saw such islanders,-- For, certes, these are people of the island,-- 30 Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note, Their manners are more gentle-kind than of Our human generation you shall find Many, nay, almost any. _Pros._ [_Aside_] Honest lord, Thou hast said well; for some of you there present 35 Are worse than devils. _Alon._ I cannot too much muse Such shapes, such gesture, and such sound, expressing-- Although they want the use of tongue--a kind Of excellent dumb discourse. _Pros._ [_Aside_] Praise in departing. _Fran._ They vanish\u2019d strangely. _Seb._ No matter, since 40 They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.-- Will\u2019t please you taste of what is here? _Alon._ Not I. _Gon._ Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys, Who would believe that there were mountaineers Dew-lapp\u2019d like bulls, whose throats had hanging at \u2019em 45 Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find Each putter-out of five for one will bring us Good warrant of.", " Thy false uncle-- Dost thou attend me? _Mir._ Sir, most heedfully. _Pros._ Being once perfected how to grant suits, How to deny them, whom to advance, and whom 80 To trash for over-topping, new created The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed \u2019em, Or else new form\u2019d \u2019em; having both the key Of officer and office, set all hearts i\u2019 the state To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was 85 The ivy which had hid my princely trunk, And suck\u2019d my verdure out on\u2019t. Thou attend\u2019st not. _Mir._ O, good sir, I do. _Pros._ I pray thee, mark me. I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated To closeness and the bettering of my mind 90 With that which, but by being so retired, O\u2019er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother Awaked an evil nature; and my trust, Like a good parent, did beget of him A falsehood in its contrary, as great 95 As my trust was; which had indeed no limit, A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded, Not only with what my revenue yielded, But what my power might else exact, like one Who having into truth, by telling of it, 100 Made such a sinner of his memory, To credit his own lie, he did believe He was indeed the duke; out o\u2019 the substitution, And executing the outward face of royalty, With all prerogative:--hence his ambition growing,-- 105 Dost thou hear? _Mir._ Your tale, sir, would cure deafness. _Pros._ To have no screen between this part he play\u2019d And him he play\u2019d it for, he needs will be Absolute Milan."], "What does the parallel between Alonso\u2019s desire to drown himself and Prospero\u2019s promise to drown his book symbolize?": [" _Ari._ I\u2019ll fetch them, sir.

And \u2019twixt the green sea and the azured vault Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder Have I given fire, and rifted Jove\u2019s stout oak 45 With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory Have I made shake, and by the spurs pluck\u2019d up The pine and cedar: graves at my command Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let \u2019em forth By my so potent art. But this rough magic 50 I here abjure; and, when I have required Some heavenly music,--which even now I do,-- To work mine end upon their senses, that This airy charm is for, I\u2019ll break my staff, Bury it certain fathoms in the earth, 55 And deeper than did ever plummet sound I\u2019ll drown my book. [_Solemn music._ _Re-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO; SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner, attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO: they all enter the circle which PROSPERO had made, and there stand charmed; which PROSPERO observing, speaks:_ A solemn air, and the best comforter To an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains, Now useless, boil\u2019d within thy skull!", " _Mir._ Do you love me? _Fer._ O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound, And crown what I profess with kind event, If I speak true! if hollowly, invert 70 What best is boded me to mischief! I, Beyond all limit of what else i\u2019 the world, Do love, prize, honour you. _Mir._ I am a fool To weep at what I am glad of. _Pros._ Fair encounter Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace 75 On that which breeds between \u2019em! _Fer._ Wherefore weep you? _Mir._ At mine unworthiness, that dare not offer What I desire to give; and much less take What I shall die to want. But this is trifling; And all the more it seeks to hide itself, 80 The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning! And prompt me, plain and holy innocence! I am your wife, if you will marry me; If not, I\u2019ll die your maid: to be your fellow You may deny me; but I\u2019ll be your servant, 85 Whether you will or no. _Fer._ My mistress, dearest; And I thus humble ever. _Mir._ My husband, then? _Fer._ Ay, with a heart as willing As bondage e\u2019er of freedom: here\u2019s my hand. _Mir._ And mine, with my heart in\u2019t: and now farewell 90 Till half an hour hence. _Fer._ A thousand thousand! [_Exeunt Fer. and Mir. severally._ _Pros._ So glad of this as they I cannot be, Who are surprised withal; but my rejoicing At nothing can be more.

If you could hurt, Your swords are now too massy for your strengths, And will not be uplifted. But remember,-- For that\u2019s my business to you,--that you three From Milan did supplant good Prospero; 70 Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it, Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures, Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso, 75 They have bereft; and do pronounce by me: Lingering perdition--worse than any death Can be at once--shall step by step attend You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from,-- Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls 80 Upon your heads,--is nothing but heart-sorrow And a clear life ensuing.", " 137: _that_] om.

He being thus lorded, Not only with what my revenue yielded, But what my power might else exact, like one Who having into truth, by telling of it, 100 Made such a sinner of his memory, To credit his own lie, he did believe He was indeed the duke; out o\u2019 the substitution, And executing the outward face of royalty, With all prerogative:--hence his ambition growing,-- 105 Dost thou hear? _Mir._ Your tale, sir, would cure deafness. _Pros._ To have no screen between this part he play\u2019d And him he play\u2019d it for, he needs will be Absolute Milan.", " There stand, 60 For you are spell-stopp\u2019d.

O good Gonzalo, My true preserver, and a loyal sir To him thou follow\u2019st! I will pay thy graces 70 Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter: Thy brother was a furtherer in the act. Thou art pinch\u2019d for\u2019t now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood, You, brother mine, that entertain\u2019d ambition, 75 Expell\u2019d remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,-- Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,-- Would here have kill\u2019d your king; I do forgive thee, Unnatural though thou art.

Legged like a man! and his fins like arms! Warm o\u2019 my troth! I do now let loose my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no fish, but an islander, that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt. [_Thunder._] Alas, the storm is come 35 again! my best way is to creep under his gaberdine; there is no other shelter hereabout: misery acquaints a man with strange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past. _Enter STEPHANO, singing: a bottle in his hand._ _Ste._ I shall no more to sea, to sea, 40 Here shall I die a-shore,-- This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man\u2019s funeral: well, here\u2019s my comfort. [_Drinks._ [_Sings._ The master, the swabber, the boatswain, and I, The gunner, and his mate, 45 Loved Mall, Meg, and Marian, and Margery, But none of us cared for Kate; For she had a tongue with a tang, Would cry to a sailor, Go hang! She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch; 50 Yet a tailor might scratch her where\u2019er she did itch. Then, to sea, boys, and let her go hang! This is a scurvy tune too: but here\u2019s my comfort. [_Drinks._ _Cal._ Do not torment me:--O! _Ste._ What\u2019s the matter?", " _Ste._ Four legs and two voices,--a most delicate monster! His forward voice, now, is to speak well of his friend; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract. 85 If all the wine in my bottle will recover him, I will help his ague. Come:--Amen! I will pour some in thy other mouth. _Trin._ Stephano! _Ste._ Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy! 90 This is a devil, and no monster: I will leave him; I have no long spoon. _Trin._ Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me, and speak to me; for I am Trinculo,--be not afeard,--thy good friend Trinculo. 95 _Ste._ If thou beest Trinculo, come forth: I\u2019ll pull thee by the lesser legs: if any be Trinculo\u2019s legs, these are they. Thou art very Trinculo indeed! How earnest thou to be the siege of this moon-calf? can he vent Trinculos? _Trin._ I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke. 100 But art thou not drowned, Stephano? I hope, now, thou art not drowned. Is the storm overblown? I hid me under the dead moon-calf\u2019s gaberdine for fear of the storm. And art thou living, Stephano? O Stephano, two Neapolitans scaped! 105 _Ste._ Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not constant. _Cal._ [_aside_] These be fine things, an if they be not sprites.

His spirits hear me, And yet I needs must curse. But they\u2019ll nor pinch, Fright me with urchin-shows, pitch me i\u2019 the mire, 5 Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark Out of my way, unless he bid \u2019em: but For every trifle are they set upon me; Sometime like apes, that mow and chatter at me, And after bite me; then like hedgehogs, which 10 Lie tumbling in my barefoot way, and mount Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I All wound with adders, who with cloven tongues Do hiss me into madness. _Enter TRINCULO._ Lo, now, lo! Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me 15 For bringing wood in slowly. I\u2019ll fall flat; Perchance he will not mind me. _Trin._ Here\u2019s neither bush nor shrub, to bear off any weather at all, and another storm brewing; I hear it sing i\u2019 the wind: yond same black cloud, yond huge one, looks 20 like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor. If it should thunder as it did before, I know not where to hide my head: yond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we here? a man or a fish? dead or alive?

There are yet missing of your company Some few odd lads that you remember not. 255 _Re-enter ARIEL, driving in CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, in their stolen apparel._ _Ste._ Every man shift for all the rest, and let no man take care for himself; for all is but fortune. --Coragio, bully-monster, coragio! _Trin._ If these be true spies which I wear in my head, here\u2019s a goodly sight. 260 _Cal._ O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed! How fine my master is! I am afraid He will chastise me. _Seb._ Ha, ha! What things are these, my lord Antonio? Will money buy \u2019em? _Ant._ Very like; one of them 265 Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable. _Pros._ Mark but the badges of these men, my lords, Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave, His mother was a witch; and one so strong That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs, 270 And deal in her command, without her power. These three have robb\u2019d me; and this demi-devil-- For he\u2019s a bastard one--had plotted with them To take my life. Two of these fellows you Must know and own; this thing of darkness I 275 Acknowledge mine. _Cal._ I shall be pinch\u2019d to death. _Alon._ Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler? _Seb._ He is drunk now: where had he wine? _Alon._ And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they Find this grand liquor that hath gilded \u2019em?-- 280 How camest thou in this pickle?", " the folly of this island! They say there\u2019s but five upon this isle: we are three of them; if 5 th\u2019 other two be brained like us, the state totters. _Ste._ Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee: thy eyes are almost set in thy head. _Trin._ Where should they be set else? he were a brave monster indeed, if they were set in his tail. 10 _Ste._ My man-monster hath drowned his tongue in sack: for my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere I could recover the shore, five-and-thirty leagues off and on. By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant, monster, or my standard. 15 _Trin._ Your lieutenant, if you list; he\u2019s no standard. _Ste._ We\u2019ll not run, Monsieur Monster. _Trin._ Nor go neither; but you\u2019ll lie, like dogs, and yet say nothing neither. _Ste._ Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a 20 good moon-calf. _Cal._ How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe. I\u2019ll not serve him, he is not valiant. _Trin._ Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case to justle a constable. Why, thou debauched fish, thou, was 25 there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much sack as I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being but half a fish and half a monster? _Cal._ Lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord? _Trin._ \u2018Lord,\u2019 quoth he! That a monster should be 30 such a natural! _Cal._ Lo, lo, again! bite him to death, I prithee. _Ste._ Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head: if you prove a mutineer,--the next tree!", " This my mean task Would be as heavy to me as odious, but 5 The mistress which I serve quickens what\u2019s dead, And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is Ten times more gentle than her father\u2019s crabbed. And he\u2019s composed of harshness. I must remove Some thousands of these logs, and pile them up, 10 Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness Had never like executor. I forget: But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours, Most busy lest, when I do it. _Enter MIRANDA; and PROSPERO at a distance, unseen._ _Mir._ Alas, now, pray you, 15 Work not so hard: I would the lightning had Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin\u2019d to pile! Pray, set it down, and rest you: when this burns, \u2019Twill weep for having wearied you. My father Is hard at study; pray, now, rest yourself; 20 He\u2019s safe for these three hours. _Fer._ O most dear mistress, The sun will set before I shall discharge What I must strive to do. _Mir._ If you\u2019ll sit down, I\u2019ll bear your logs the while: pray, give me that; I\u2019ll carry it to the pile. _Fer._ No, precious creature; 25 I had rather crack my sinews, break my back, Than you should such dishonour undergo, While I sit lazy by. _Mir._ It would become me As well as it does you: and I should do it With much more ease; for my good will is to it, 30 And yours it is against. _Pros._ Poor worm, thou art infected! This visitation shows it."], "Who or what is Sycorax?": [" _Trin._ Why, what did I? I did nothing. I\u2019ll go farther off. _Ste._ Didst thou not say he lied? 70 _Ari._ Thou liest. _Ste._ Do I so? take thou that. [_Beats him._] As you like this, give me the lie another time. _Trin._ I did not give the lie. Out o\u2019 your wits, and hearing too? A pox o\u2019 your bottle! this can sack and 75 drinking do. A murrain on your monster, and the devil take your fingers! _Cal._ Ha, ha, ha! _Ste._ Now, forward with your tale. --Prithee, stand farther off. 80 _Cal._ Beat him enough: after a little time, I\u2019ll beat him too. _Ste._ Stand farther. Come, proceed. _Cal._ Why, as I told thee, \u2019tis a custom with him I\u2019 th\u2019 afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him, Having first seized his books; or with a log 85 Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake, Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember First to possess his books; for without them He\u2019s but a sot, as I am, nor hath not One spirit to command: they all do hate him 90 As rootedly as I. Burn but his books. He has brave utensils,--for so he calls them,-- Which, when he has a house, he\u2019ll deck withal. And that most deeply to consider is The beauty of his daughter; he himself 95 Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman, But only Sycorax my dam and she; But she as far surpasseth Sycorax As great\u2019st does least. _Ste._ Is it so brave a lass? _Cal._ Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant, 100 And bring thee forth brave brood.", " _Cal._ I must eat my dinner. 330 This island\u2019s mine, by Sycorax my mother, Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first, Thou strokedst me, and madest much of me; wouldst give me Water with berries in\u2019t; and teach me how To name the bigger light, and how the less, 335 That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee, And show\u2019d thee all the qualities o\u2019 th\u2019 isle, The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile: Curs\u2019d be I that did so! All the charms Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you! 340 For I am all the subjects that you have, Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me The rest o\u2019 th\u2019 island. _Pros._ Thou most lying slave, Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee, 345 Filth as thou art, with human care; and lodged thee In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate The honour of my child. _Cal._ O ho, O ho! would \u2019t had been done! Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else 350 This isle with Calibans. _Pros._ Abhorred slave, Which any print of goodness wilt not take, Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee, Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage, 355 Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like A thing most brutish, I endow\u2019d thy purposes With words that made them known. But thy vile race, Though thou didst learn, had that in\u2019t which good natures Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou 360 Deservedly confined into this rock, Who hadst deserved more than a prison.", " _Pros._ Ariel, thy charge Exactly is perform\u2019d: but there\u2019s more work. What is the time o\u2019 the day? _Ari._ Past the mid season. _Pros._ At least two glasses. The time \u2019twixt six and now 240 Must by us both be spent most preciously. _Ari._ Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains, Let me remember thee what thou hast promised, Which is not yet perform\u2019d me. _Pros._ How now? moody? What is\u2019t thou canst demand? _Ari._ My liberty. 245 _Pros._ Before the time be out? no more! _Ari._ I prithee, Remember I have done thee worthy service; Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise To bate me a full year. _Pros._ Dost thou forget 250 From what a torment I did free thee? _Ari._ No. _Pros._ Thou dost; and think\u2019st it much to tread the ooze Of the salt deep, To run upon the sharp wind of the north, To do me business in the veins o\u2019 the earth 255 When it is baked with frost. _Ari._ I do not, sir. _Pros._ Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her? _Ari._ No, sir. _Pros._ Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me. 260 _Ari._ Sir, in Argier. _Pros._ O, was she so? I must Once in a month recount what thou hast been, Which thou forget\u2019st. This damn\u2019d witch Sycorax, For mischiefs manifold, and sorceries terrible To enter human hearing, from Argier, 265 Thou know\u2019st, was banish\u2019d: for one thing she did They would not take her life.", " Is not this true? _Ari._ Ay, sir. _Pros._ This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child, And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave, 270 As thou report\u2019st thyself, wast then her servant; And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate To act her earthy and abhorr\u2019d commands, Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee, By help of her more potent ministers, 275 And in her most unmitigable rage, Into a cloven pine; within which rift Imprison\u2019d thou didst painfully remain A dozen years; within which space she died, And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans 280 As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island-- Save for the son that she did litter here, A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour\u2019d with A human shape. _Ari._ Yes, Caliban her son. _Pros._ Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban, 285 Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know\u2019st What torment I did find thee in; thy groans Did make wolves howl, and penetrate the breasts Of ever-angry bears: it was a torment To lay upon the damn\u2019d, which Sycorax 290 Could not again undo: it was mine art, When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape The pine, and let thee out. _Ari._ I thank thee, master. _Pros._ If thou more murmur\u2019st, I will rend an oak, And peg thee in his knotty entrails, till 295 Thou hast howl\u2019d away twelve winters. _Ari._ Pardon, master: I will be correspondent to command, And do my spiriting gently."], "What does Caliban do after Prospero first summons him?": [" Juno sings her blessings on you. _Cer._ Earth\u2019s increase, foison plenty, 110 Barns and garners never empty; Vines with clustering bunches growing; Plants with goodly burthen bowing; Spring come to you at the farthest In the very end of harvest! 115 Scarcity and want shall shun you; Ceres\u2019 blessing so is on you. _Fer._ This is a most majestic vision, and Harmonious charmingly. May I be bold To think these spirits? _Pros._ Spirits, which by mine art 120 I have from their confines call\u2019d to enact My present fancies. _Fer._ Let me live here ever; So rare a wonder\u2019d father and a wife Makes this place Paradise. [_Juno and Ceres whisper, and send Iris on employment._ _Pros._ Sweet, now, silence! Juno and Ceres whisper seriously; 125 There\u2019s something else to do: hush, and be mute, Or else our spell is marr\u2019d. _Iris._ You nymphs, call\u2019d Naiads, of the windring brooks, With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks, Leave your crisp channels, and on this green land 130 Answer your summons; Juno does command: Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate A contract of true love; be not too late. _Enter certain Nymphs._ You sunburnt sicklemen, of August weary, Come hither from the furrow, and be merry: 135 Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on, And these fresh nymphs encounter every one In country footing. _Enter certain Reapers, properly habited: they join with the Nymphs in a graceful dance; towards the end whereof PROSPERO starts suddenly, and speaks; after which, to a strange, hollow, and confused noise, they heavily vanish._ _Pros._ [_Aside_] I had forgot that foul conspiracy Of the beast Caliban and his confederates 140 Against my life: the minute of their plot Is almost come.", " _Pros._ Do so; and after two days I will discharge thee. _Ari._ That\u2019s my noble master!

What, ho! slave! Caliban! Thou earth, thou! speak. _Cal._ [_within_] There\u2019s wood enough within. _Pros._ Come forth, I say! there\u2019s other business for thee: 315 Come, thou tortoise! when? _Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymph._ Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel, Hark in thine ear. _Ari._ My lord, it shall be done.

Indeed the top of admiration! worth What\u2019s dearest to the world! Full many a lady I have eyed with best regard, and many a time 40 The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues Have I liked several women; never any With so full soul, but some defect in her Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed, 45 And put it to the foil: but you, O you, So perfect and so peerless, are created Of every creature\u2019s best! _Mir._ I do not know One of my sex; no woman\u2019s face remember, Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen 50 More that I may call men than you, good friend, And my dear father: how features are abroad, I am skilless of; but, by my modesty, The jewel in my dower, I would not wish Any companion in the world but you; 55 Nor can imagination form a shape, Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle Something too wildly, and my father\u2019s precepts I therein do forget. _Fer._ I am, in my condition, A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king; 60 I would, not so!--and would no more endure This wooden slavery than to suffer The flesh-fly blow my mouth.

How beauteous mankind is!

Of any thing the image tell me that Hath kept with thy remembrance. _Mir._ \u2019Tis far off, And rather like a dream than an assurance 45 That my remembrance warrants. Had I not Four or five women once that tended me? _Pros._ Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else In the dark backward and abysm of time? 50 If thou remember\u2019st ought ere thou camest here, How thou camest here thou mayst. _Mir._ But that I do not. _Pros._ Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since, Thy father was the Duke of Milan, and A prince of power. _Mir._ Sir, are not you my father? 55 _Pros._ Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father Was Duke of Milan; and his only heir And princess, no worse issued. _Mir._ O the heavens! What foul play had we, that we came from thence? 60 Or blessed was\u2019t we did? _Pros._ Both, both, my girl: By foul play, as thou say\u2019st, were we heaved thence; But blessedly holp hither. _Mir._ O, my heart bleeds To think o\u2019 the teen that I have turn\u2019d you to. Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther. 65 _Pros._ My brother, and thy uncle, call\u2019d Antonio,-- I pray thee, mark me,--that a brother should Be so perfidious!--he whom, next thyself, Of all the world I loved, and to him put The manage of my state; as, at that time, 70 Through all the signories it was the first, And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed In dignity, and for the liberal arts Without a parallel; those being all my study, The government I cast upon my brother, 75 And to my state grew stranger, being transported And rapt in secret studies.", " She Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan, Of whom so often I have heard renown, But never saw before; of whom I have Received a second life; and second father 195 This lady makes him to me. _Alon._ I am hers: But, O, how oddly will it sound that I Must ask my child forgiveness! _Pros._ There, sir, stop: Let us not burthen our remembrances with A heaviness that\u2019s gone. _Gon._ I have inly wept, 200 Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you gods, And on this couple drop a blessed crown! For it is you that have chalk\u2019d forth the way Which brought us hither. _Alon._ I say, Amen, Gonzalo! _Gon._ Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue 205 Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice Beyond a common joy! and set it down With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis, And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife 210 Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom In a poor isle, and all of us ourselves When no man was his own. _Alon._ [_to Fer. and Mir._] Give me your hands: Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart That doth not wish you joy! _Gon._ Be it so! Amen! 215 _Re-enter ARIEL, with the _Master_ and _Boatswain_ amazedly following._ O, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us: I prophesied, if a gallows were on land, This fellow could not drown.

I must remove Some thousands of these logs, and pile them up, 10 Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness Had never like executor.

This visitation shows it.", " Words thus occupying a broken line acquire a marked emphasis. But the truth is that in dialogue Shakespeare\u2019s language passes so rapidly from verse to prose and from prose to verse, sometimes even hovering, as it were, over the confines, being rhythmical rather than metrical, that all attempts to give regularity to the metre must be made with diffidence and received with doubt. NOTE V. I. 2. 377, 378: _Courtsied when you have and kiss\u2019d_ _The wild waves whist._ This punctuation seems to be supported by what Ferdinand says (391, 392): \u2018The music crept by me upon the waters, Allaying both their fury and my passion, &c.\u2019 At the end of the stanza we have printed _Hark, hark! ... The watch-dogs bark_ as that part of the burthen which \u2018sweet sprites bear.\u2019 The other part is borne by distant watch-dogs. NOTE VI.

Similar cases occur frequently, especially when the verb precedes its nominative. For example, _Tempest_, IV. 1. 262, \u2018Lies at my mercy all mine enemies,\u2019 and _Measure for Measure_, II. 1. 22, \u2018What knows the laws, &c.\u2019 We correct it in those passages where the occurrence of a vulgarism would be likely to annoy the reader. In the mouth of a Boatswain it can offend no one. We therefore leave it. NOTE II. I. 1. 57-59. _Mercy on us!--we split, &c._ It may be doubtful whether the printer of the first folio intended these broken speeches to express \u2018a confused noise within.\u2019 Without question such was the author\u2019s meaning.

I do beseech you,-- Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers,-- 35 What is your name? _Mir._ Miranda. --O my father, I have broke your hest to say so! _Fer._ Admired Miranda! Indeed the top of admiration! worth What\u2019s dearest to the world! Full many a lady I have eyed with best regard, and many a time 40 The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues Have I liked several women; never any With so full soul, but some defect in her Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed, 45 And put it to the foil: but you, O you, So perfect and so peerless, are created Of every creature\u2019s best! _Mir._ I do not know One of my sex; no woman\u2019s face remember, Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen 50 More that I may call men than you, good friend, And my dear father: how features are abroad, I am skilless of; but, by my modesty, The jewel in my dower, I would not wish Any companion in the world but you; 55 Nor can imagination form a shape, Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle Something too wildly, and my father\u2019s precepts I therein do forget. _Fer._ I am, in my condition, A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king; 60 I would, not so!--and would no more endure This wooden slavery than to suffer The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak: The very instant that I saw you, did My heart fly to your service; there resides, 65 To make me slave to it; and for your sake Am I this patient log-man.", " No more yet of this; For \u2019tis a chronicle of day by day, Not a relation for a breakfast, nor Befitting this first meeting.

[_Kneels._ _Alon._ Now all the blessings Of a glad father compass thee about! 180 Arise, and say how thou camest here. _Mir._ O, wonder! How many goodly creatures are there here! How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world, That has such people in\u2019t! _Pros._ \u2019Tis new to thee. _Alon._ What is this maid with whom thou wast at play? 185 Your eld\u2019st acquaintance cannot be three hours: Is she the goddess that hath sever\u2019d us, And brought us thus together? _Fer._ Sir, she is mortal; But by immortal Providence she\u2019s mine: I chose her when I could not ask my father 190 For his advice, nor thought I had one."], "Why does Prospero suddenly end the masque?": [" Juno sings her blessings on you. _Cer._ Earth\u2019s increase, foison plenty, 110 Barns and garners never empty; Vines with clustering bunches growing; Plants with goodly burthen bowing; Spring come to you at the farthest In the very end of harvest! 115 Scarcity and want shall shun you; Ceres\u2019 blessing so is on you. _Fer._ This is a most majestic vision, and Harmonious charmingly. May I be bold To think these spirits? _Pros._ Spirits, which by mine art 120 I have from their confines call\u2019d to enact My present fancies. _Fer._ Let me live here ever; So rare a wonder\u2019d father and a wife Makes this place Paradise. [_Juno and Ceres whisper, and send Iris on employment._ _Pros._ Sweet, now, silence!

[_Exit._ _Pros._ Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and groves; And ye that on the sands with printless foot Do chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him 35 When he comes back; you demi-puppets that By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make, Whereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid-- 40 Weak masters though ye be--I have bedimm\u2019d The noontide sun, call\u2019d forth the mutinous winds. And \u2019twixt the green sea and the azured vault Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder Have I given fire, and rifted Jove\u2019s stout oak 45 With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory Have I made shake, and by the spurs pluck\u2019d up The pine and cedar: graves at my command Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let \u2019em forth By my so potent art. But this rough magic 50 I here abjure; and, when I have required Some heavenly music,--which even now I do,-- To work mine end upon their senses, that This airy charm is for, I\u2019ll break my staff, Bury it certain fathoms in the earth, 55 And deeper than did ever plummet sound I\u2019ll drown my book. [_Solemn music._ _Re-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO; SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner, attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO: they all enter the circle which PROSPERO had made, and there stand charmed; which PROSPERO observing, speaks:_ A solemn air, and the best comforter To an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains, Now useless, boil\u2019d within thy skull!"], "Where does Ariel led Trinculo, Stephano and Caliban to delay their attack?": [" _Ste._ Four legs and two voices,--a most delicate monster!

If thou beest Stephano, touch me, and speak to me; for I am Trinculo,--be not afeard,--thy good friend Trinculo. 95 _Ste._ If thou beest Trinculo, come forth: I\u2019ll pull thee by the lesser legs: if any be Trinculo\u2019s legs, these are they. Thou art very Trinculo indeed! How earnest thou to be the siege of this moon-calf? can he vent Trinculos? _Trin._ I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke. 100 But art thou not drowned, Stephano? I hope, now, thou art not drowned. Is the storm overblown? I hid me under the dead moon-calf\u2019s gaberdine for fear of the storm. And art thou living, Stephano? O Stephano, two Neapolitans scaped! 105 _Ste._ Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not constant. _Cal._ [_aside_] These be fine things, an if they be not sprites.

Go, sirrah, to my cell; Take with you your companions; as you look To have my pardon, trim it handsomely. _Cal._ Ay, that I will; and I\u2019ll be wise hereafter, And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass 295 Was I, to take this drunkard for a god, And worship this dull fool! _Pros._ Go to; away! _Alon._ Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it. _Seb._ Or stole it, rather. [_Exeunt Cal., Ste., and Trin._ _Pros._ Sir, I invite your Highness and your train 300 To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest For this one night; which, part of it, I\u2019ll waste With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it Go quick away: the story of my life, And the particular accidents gone by 305 Since I came to this isle: and in the morn I\u2019ll bring you to your ship, and so to Naples, Where I have hope to see the nuptial Of these our dear-beloved solemnized; And thence retire me to my Milan, where 310 Every third thought shall be my grave.", " If I should 200 take a displeasure against you, look you,-- _Trin._ Thou wert but a lost monster. _Cal._ Good my lord, give me thy favour still. Be patient, for the prize I\u2019ll bring thee to Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly. 205 All\u2019s hush\u2019d as midnight yet. _Trin._ Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool,-- _Ste._ There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that, monster, but an infinite loss. _Trin._ That\u2019s more to me than my wetting: yet this is 210 your harmless fairy, monster. _Ste._ I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o\u2019er ears for my labour. _Cal._ Prithee, my king, be quiet. See\u2019st thou here, This is the mouth o\u2019 the cell: no noise, and enter. 215 Do that good mischief which may make this island Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban, For aye thy foot-licker. _Ste._ Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts. 220 _Trin._ O King Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano! look what a wardrobe here is for thee! _Cal._ Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash. _Trin._ O, ho, monster! we know what belongs to a frippery. O King Stephano! 225 _Ste._ Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I\u2019ll have that gown. _Trin._ Thy Grace shall have it. _Cal._ The dropsy drown this fool! what do you mean To dote thus on such luggage? Let\u2019s alone, 230 And do the murder first: if he awake, From toe to crown he\u2019ll fill our skins with pinches, Make us strange stuff."], "After Prospero tells Ariel to release the men, he gives a soliloquy in which he gives up what?": [" How\u2019s the day? _Ari._ On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord, You said our work should cease. _Pros._ I did say so, 5 When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit, How fares the king and\u2019s followers? _Ari._ Confined together In the same fashion as you gave in charge, Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir, In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell; 10 They cannot budge till your release. The king, His brother, and yours, abide all three distracted, And the remainder mourning over them, Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly Him that you term\u2019d, sir, \u201cThe good old lord, Gonzalo;\u201d 15 His tears run down his beard, like winter\u2019s drops From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works \u2019em, That if you now beheld them, your affections Would become tender. _Pros._ Dost thou think so, spirit? _Ari._ Mine would, sir, were I human. _Pros._ And mine shall. 20 Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling Of their afflictions, and shall not myself, One of their kind, that relish all as sharply, Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art? Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick, 25 Yet with my nobler reason \u2019gainst my fury Do I take part: the rarer action is In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent, The sole drift of my purpose doth extend Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel: 30 My charms I\u2019ll break, their senses I\u2019ll restore, And they shall be themselves.", " _Alon._ I will stand to, and feed, Although my last: no matter, since I feel 50 The best is past. Brother, my lord the duke, Stand to, and do as we. _Thunder and lightning. Enter ARIEL, like a harpy; claps his wings upon the table; and, with a quaint device, the banquet vanishes._ _Ari._ You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,-- That hath to instrument this lower world And what is in\u2019t,--the never-surfeited sea 55 Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island, Where man doth not inhabit,--you \u2019mongst men Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad; And even with such-like valour men hang and drown Their proper selves. [_Alon., Seb. &c. draw their swords._ You fools! I and my fellows 60 Are ministers of Fate: the elements, Of whom your swords are temper\u2019d, may as well Wound the loud winds, or with bemock\u2019d-at stabs Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish One dowle that\u2019s in my plume: my fellow-ministers 65 Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt, Your swords are now too massy for your strengths, And will not be uplifted. But remember,-- For that\u2019s my business to you,--that you three From Milan did supplant good Prospero; 70 Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it, Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures, Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso, 75 They have bereft; and do pronounce by me: Lingering perdition--worse than any death Can be at once--shall step by step attend You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from,-- Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls 80 Upon your heads,--is nothing but heart-sorrow And a clear life ensuing.", " _Alon._ I long To hear the story of your life, which must Take the ear strangely. _Pros._ I\u2019ll deliver all; And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales, And sail so expeditious, that shall catch Your royal fleet far off.

Sit, then, and talk with her; she is thine own. What, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel! _Enter ARIEL._ _Ari._ What would my potent master? here I am. _Pros._ Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service 35 Did worthily perform; and I must use you In such another trick. Go bring the rabble, O\u2019er whom I give thee power, here to this place: Incite them to quick motion; for I must Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple 40 Some vanity of mine art: it is my promise, And they expect it from me.", " 125 [_Aside to Seb. and Ant._] But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded, I here could pluck his Highness\u2019 frown upon you, And justify you traitors: at this time I will tell no tales. _Seb._ [_Aside_] The devil speaks in him. _Pros._ No. For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother 130 Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive Thy rankest fault,--all of them; and require My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know, Thou must restore. _Alon._ If thou be\u2019st Prospero, Give us particulars of thy preservation; 135 How thou hast met us here, who three hours since Were wreck\u2019d upon this shore; where I have lost-- How sharp the point of this remembrance is!-- My dear son Ferdinand. _Pros._ I am woe for\u2019t, sir. _Alon._ Irreparable is the loss; and patience 140 Says it is past her cure. _Pros._ I rather think You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace For the like loss I have her sovereign aid, And rest myself content. _Alon._ You the like loss! _Pros._ As great to me as late; and, supportable 145 To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker Than you may call to comfort you, for I Have lost my daughter. _Alon._ A daughter? O heavens, that they were living both in Naples, The king and queen there! that they were, I wish 150 Myself were mudded in that oozy bed Where my son lies. When did you lose you daughter? _Pros._ In this last tempest. I perceive, these lords At this encounter do so much admire, That they devour their reason, and scarce think 155 Their eyes do offices of truth, their words Are natural breath: but, howsoe\u2019er you have Been justled from your senses, know for certain That I am Prospero, and that very duke Which was thrust forth of Milan; who most strangely 160 Upon this shore, where you were wreck\u2019d, was landed, To be the Lord on\u2019t.", " The form \u2018princesses,\u2019 the use of which in Shakespeare\u2019s time was doubted by one of our correspondents, is found in the _History of King Leir_. Rowe\u2019s reading \u2018princes\u2019 might be defended on the ground that the sentiment is general, and applicable to royal children of both sexes; or that Sir Philip Sidney, in the first book of the _Arcadia_, calls Pamela and Philoclea \u2018princes.\u2019 NOTE IV. I. 2. 298. The metre of this line, as well as of lines 301, 302, is defective, but as no mode of correction can be regarded as completely satisfactory we have in accordance with our custom left the lines as they are printed in the Folio. The defect, indeed, in the metre of line 298 has not been noticed except by Hanmer, who makes a line thus: \u2018Do so, and after two days I\u2019ll discharge thee.\u2019 Possibly it ought to be printed thus: \u2018Do so; and After two days I will discharge thee.\u2019 There is a broken line, also of four syllables, 253 of the same scene, another of seven, 235. There is no reason to doubt that the _words_ are as Shakespeare wrote them, for, although the action of the play terminates in less than four hours (I. 2. 240 and V. 1. 186), yet Ariel\u2019s ministry is not to end till the voyage to Naples shall be over. Prospero, too, repeats his promise, and marks his contentment by further shortening the time of servitude, \u2018within two days,\u2019 I. 2. 420. Possibly \u2018Invisible\u2019 (301) should have a line to itself.", " _Pros._ Ariel, thy charge Exactly is perform\u2019d: but there\u2019s more work. What is the time o\u2019 the day? _Ari._ Past the mid season. _Pros._ At least two glasses. The time \u2019twixt six and now 240 Must by us both be spent most preciously. _Ari._ Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains, Let me remember thee what thou hast promised, Which is not yet perform\u2019d me. _Pros._ How now? moody? What is\u2019t thou canst demand? _Ari._ My liberty. 245 _Pros._ Before the time be out? no more! _Ari._ I prithee, Remember I have done thee worthy service; Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise To bate me a full year. _Pros._ Dost thou forget 250 From what a torment I did free thee? _Ari._ No. _Pros._ Thou dost; and think\u2019st it much to tread the ooze Of the salt deep, To run upon the sharp wind of the north, To do me business in the veins o\u2019 the earth 255 When it is baked with frost. _Ari._ I do not, sir. _Pros._ Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her? _Ari._ No, sir. _Pros._ Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me. 260 _Ari._ Sir, in Argier. _Pros._ O, was she so? I must Once in a month recount what thou hast been, Which thou forget\u2019st. This damn\u2019d witch Sycorax, For mischiefs manifold, and sorceries terrible To enter human hearing, from Argier, 265 Thou know\u2019st, was banish\u2019d: for one thing she did They would not take her life."], "In this final scene, what does Prospero do to his enemies?": [" Librarian Of Trinity College, Cambridge. _VOLUME I._ Cambridge and London: MACMILLAN AND CO. 1863.

What seest thou else In the dark backward and abysm of time? 50 If thou remember\u2019st ought ere thou camest here, How thou camest here thou mayst. _Mir._ But that I do not. _Pros._ Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since, Thy father was the Duke of Milan, and A prince of power. _Mir._ Sir, are not you my father? 55 _Pros._ Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father Was Duke of Milan; and his only heir And princess, no worse issued. _Mir._ O the heavens! What foul play had we, that we came from thence? 60 Or blessed was\u2019t we did? _Pros._ Both, both, my girl: By foul play, as thou say\u2019st, were we heaved thence; But blessedly holp hither. _Mir._ O, my heart bleeds To think o\u2019 the teen that I have turn\u2019d you to. Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther. 65 _Pros._ My brother, and thy uncle, call\u2019d Antonio,-- I pray thee, mark me,--that a brother should Be so perfidious!--he whom, next thyself, Of all the world I loved, and to him put The manage of my state; as, at that time, 70 Through all the signories it was the first, And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed In dignity, and for the liberal arts Without a parallel; those being all my study, The government I cast upon my brother, 75 And to my state grew stranger, being transported And rapt in secret studies.", " 137: _that_] om.

SCENE III. _Another part of the island._ _Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others._ _Gon._ By\u2019r lakin, I can go no further, sir; My old bones ache: here\u2019s a maze trod, indeed, Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience, I needs must rest me. _Alon._ Old lord, I cannot blame thee, Who am myself attach\u2019d with weariness, 5 To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest. Even here I will put off my hope, and keep it No longer for my flatterer: he is drown\u2019d Whom thus we stray to find; and the sea mocks Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go. 10 _Ant._ [_Aside to Seb._] I am right glad that he\u2019s so out of hope. Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose That you resolved to effect. _Seb._ [_Aside to Ant._] The next advantage Will we take throughly. _Ant._ [_Aside to Seb._] Let it be to-night; For, now they are oppress\u2019d with travel, they 15 Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance As when they are fresh. _Seb._ [_Aside to Ant._] I say, to-night: no more. [_Solemn and strange music._ _Alon._ What harmony is this?--My good friends, hark! _Gon._ Marvellous sweet music! _Enter PROSPERO above, invisible. Enter several strange Shapes, bringing in a banquet: they dance about it with gentle actions of salutation; and, inviting the King, &c. to eat, they depart._ _Alon._ Give us kind keepers, heavens!--What were these?", " [_Aside to Ari._] Come hither, spirit: Set Caliban and his companions free; Untie the spell. [_Exit Ariel._] How fares my gracious sir? There are yet missing of your company Some few odd lads that you remember not. 255 _Re-enter ARIEL, driving in CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, in their stolen apparel._ _Ste._ Every man shift for all the rest, and let no man take care for himself; for all is but fortune. --Coragio, bully-monster, coragio! _Trin._ If these be true spies which I wear in my head, here\u2019s a goodly sight. 260 _Cal._ O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed! How fine my master is! I am afraid He will chastise me. _Seb._ Ha, ha! What things are these, my lord Antonio? Will money buy \u2019em? _Ant._ Very like; one of them 265 Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable. _Pros._ Mark but the badges of these men, my lords, Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave, His mother was a witch; and one so strong That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs, 270 And deal in her command, without her power. These three have robb\u2019d me; and this demi-devil-- For he\u2019s a bastard one--had plotted with them To take my life. Two of these fellows you Must know and own; this thing of darkness I 275 Acknowledge mine. _Cal._ I shall be pinch\u2019d to death. _Alon._ Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler? _Seb._ He is drunk now: where had he wine? _Alon._ And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they Find this grand liquor that hath gilded \u2019em?-- 280 How camest thou in this pickle?"], "Why does Prospero ask the audience to applaud him at the end of the play?": [" No more yet of this; For \u2019tis a chronicle of day by day, Not a relation for a breakfast, nor Befitting this first meeting.

[_Kneels._ _Alon._ Now all the blessings Of a glad father compass thee about! 180 Arise, and say how thou camest here. _Mir._ O, wonder! How many goodly creatures are there here! How beauteous mankind is!
